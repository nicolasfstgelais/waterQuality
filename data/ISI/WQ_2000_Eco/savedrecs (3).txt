J	Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F				Cioffi, F; Gallerano, F			Response of Lake Piediluco to the change of hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient load reductions	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In order to verify and quantify the efficacy of management strategies utilised to improve the water quality of Lake Piediluco in the long and short term, a model was developed to represent the unsteady and three-dimensional form of eutrophication processes and water anoxia phenomena. Such a model, taking into account the hydrodynamic mean and turbulent characteristic of the lake, allows the simulation of the spatial and temporal evolution of the concentration fields of the following species: (a) in water, dissolved oxygen, algal organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, orthophosphate, hydrogen sulphide; and (b) in sediments, dissolved oxygen, particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic carbon, orthophosphate, adsorbed phosphorus, hydrogen sulphide. This paper presents the simulation results using the following configurations characterised by: different hydraulic regimes of the lake; different external phosphorus loads introduced into the lake from discharges; different initial adsorbed phosphorus concentrations in sediments (obtainable by sediment reclaim) in certain critical areas of the lake. The simulations have detailed: (1) the characterisation of the lake's eutrophication behaviour in its present state and the vulnerability of the different areas of the lake to summer water anoxia; (2) the role of external and internal phosphorus loads on the eutrophication processes; and (3) the management options to improve the environmental conditions of the lake.

J	Williams, MW; Tonnessen, KA				Williams, MW; Tonnessen, KA			Critical loads for inorganic nitrogen deposition in the Colorado Front Range, USA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We suggest an empirical approach for determining critical loads for inorganic nitrogen (N) deposition in wetfall to the central Rocky Mountains (USA). We define "critical loads" as a deposition amount above which natural resources can be negatively affected. The arithmetic average from 1992 to 1996 of annual inorganic N deposition in wetfall at the eight National Acid-Deposition Program (NADP) sites located at elevations >2500 m in the central Rocky Mountains ranged from 2.5 to 3.5 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1). In contrast, inorganic N deposition was <2.5 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1) at all 23 NADP sites below 2500 m in elevation. At the Niwot Ridge NADP site in the Colorado Front Range, a simple linear regression of inorganic N in wetfall with time shows a significant increase in deposition of inorganic N in wetfall at the rate of 0.32 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1) (r(2) = 0.62; P < 0.001, n = 13). In turn, the increasing amount of inorganic N in wetfall is causing episodic acidification in headwater catchments of the Green Lakes Valley in the Colorado Front Range, with acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) values below 0 mu mol(c)/L in surface waters during snowmelt runoff at 9-ha and 42-ha sampling sites. At present rates of ANC decrease, we can expect the 9-ha and 42-ha sites to become chronically acidified within the next decade and the 220-ha basin of Green Lake 4 to become episodically acidified. A synoptic survey in 1995 of 91 high-elevation lakes in the central Rocky Mountains suggests that water quality is being affected by inorganic N in wetfall throughout the region. Federal land managers are required to "err on the side of protection" when assessing the amount of deposition that will alter ecosystem processes. However, given the political and economic ramifications of policy decisions, land managers are aware of the need to provide a scientific basis for these decisions and to balance conflicting needs. To achieve this balance and to allow for natural-resource protection, we make a conservative recommendation that critical loads of inorganic N in wetfall to Class 1 areas in the central Rocky Mountains be set at 4 kg.ha(-1).yr(-1). Target loads may be set at lower levels of inorganic N deposition in wetfall to allow a margin of safety to protect extremely sensitive natural resources.																	1051-0761					DEC	2000	10	6					1648	1665		10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[1648:CLFIND]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000165680300007						
J	O'Connell, TJ; Jackson, LE; Brooks, RP				O'Connell, TJ; Jackson, LE; Brooks, RP			Bird guilds as indicators of ecological condition in the central Appalachians	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We developed an index of biotic integrity based on bird communities in the central Appalachians. As one component of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program's (EPA-EMAP) Mid-Atlantic Highlands Assessment (MAHA), the index is intended to indicate landscape-scale stressors to upland environments in the central Appalachians. The Bird Community Index (BCI) ranks bird communities according to the proportional representation of 16 behavioral and physiological response guilds. We developed the index from 34 sites in central Pennsylvania that represented a gradient of human disturbance from near pristine to degraded. Upon satisfactory demonstration that the BCI could discriminate between categories of biotic integrity identified from the human disturbance gradient, we applied it to an independent, probability-based sample of 126 sites across the MAHA area. Our assessment indicates that 16% of the area is in "excellent" condition, 27% is in "good" condition, 36% is in "fair" condition, and 21% is in "poor" condition. Sites in poor condition were dominated by either urban or agricultural bird communities, but these communities could not be numerically distinguished from each other by BCI score. Forested sites in good and excellent condition supported different bird communities and ground-level vegetation attributes but could not be separated by land cover composition alone. In general, the shift from medium to poor ecological condition defined by bird communities coincided with a shift in land cover composition from forested to nonforested.

J	Gilbertson, M				Gilbertson, M			Eco-toxicology: Traditional and post-normal interpretations of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Eco-toxicology is a potentially useful fusing of the two distinct disciplines of ecology and environmental toxicology. However, in applying an ambiguous "ecosystem approach," since the late 1970s, to the implementation of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, there have been difficulties in delimiting the Great Lakes issues to be addressed under the Agreement and in ensuring that general biological resource management and conservation issues are dealt with separately under other existing mandates. There is a priority need for managers involved in the implementation of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement to decide whether the purpose remains one of maintaining and restoring Great Lakes water quality or whether it has already been transformed into a broad program to maintain and restore ecosystem integrity throughout the entire Great Lakes basin. Parts of this ambiguity may have arisen as a result of this fusing of ecology and environmental toxicology.																	0963-9292					DEC	2000	9	6					365	375		10.1023/A:1008967417110								WOS:000166356600001	11214441

Zebra mussels removed seston and excreted ammonia and soluble phosphorus in laboratory systems. When normalized with respect to ash-free dry mass (i.e., mug g(-1) AFD mass d(-1)), smaller zebra mussels filtered seston and excreted soluble nutrients at a higher rate than larger zebra mussels. Although overall zebra mussel density is currently very low in Lake Pepin (similar to 150 ind. m(-2)), lakewide chlorophyll filtration rates of similar to7 mg m(-2) d(-1) were equivalent to chlorophyll loading into Lake Pepin via external sources and represented a turnover of 11 days for chlorophyll standing crop in the lake. Lakewide estimates of excretion of soluble phosphorus of similar to3 mg m(-2) d(-1) by zebra mussels in Lake Pepin were comparable to internal phosphorus loading from anoxic sediments in other eutrophic freshwater aquatic systems. Our results suggest that zebra mussels are currently having a modest impact on phytoplankton dynamics and P and N recycling in this system.																	0270-5060					DEC	2000	15	4					429	437		10.1080/02705060.2000.9663764								WOS:000165431900001						
J	Steinman, AD; Rosen, BH				Steinman, AD; Rosen, BH			Lotic-lentic linkages associated with Lake Okeechobee, Florida	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The hydroscape of south Florida has been severely altered over the past 50 y by the construction of canals, drainage ditches, levees, water control structures, and pump stations. This alteration has included, in part, channelization of the Kissimmee River, construction of a dike around Lake Okeechobee, increased ditching of pastures for drainage throughout the lake's watershed, and unnatural connections from Lake Okeechobee to estuaries on the east and west coasts of Florida. Collectively these processes have reduced the retention of flow in the lake's watershed, restricted the opportunity for nutrients to be assimilated on the landscape and, in turn, increased the rate of eutrophication in Lake Okeechobee. This paper reviews the history of these changes and current plans for system restoration. The fate and transport of P is used to illustrate how hydrologic changes have influenced the system's ecology. Improved drainage has been a key factor allowing for the expansion of dairy and beef cattle operations. This, in turn, has increased agricultural runoff to Lake Okeechobee. best management practices have helped reduce total P (TP) loads to the lake. However, TP concentrations in the pelagic region of the lake have not declined, presumably because of internal loading. Watershed and water-quality models are being used to examine the effect of changing land use in the watershed on the lake's condition. A number of large, multiagency projects are being developed in south Florida, with the goal to develop a hydrologic system that meets the multiple needs of agriculture, urban development, and the environment. Aquatic linkages, including lotic-lentic, lotic-lentic-estuarine and lotic-wetland, are critical aspects of these projects.

J	Smith, LK; Sartoris, JJ; Thullen, JS; Andersen, DC				Smith, LK; Sartoris, JJ; Thullen, JS; Andersen, DC			Investigation of denitrification rates in an ammonia-dominated constructed wastewater-treatment wetland	WETLANDS												Denitrification measurements were made under simulated field conditions using sediment cores and water collected from the Hemet/San Jacinto Multipurpose Demonstration Wetland (Riverside County, California, USA). The 9.9 ha constructed wetland is used to both polish ammonia-dominated secondary municipal effluent and provide migratory bird habitat. The wetland was originally constructed as a marsh-pond-marsh system in 1994. Over the period from January through March 1998, measured denitrification rates averaged 20.9 +/- 20.9 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) within the emergent marsh portions of the wetland and 646 +/- 353 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) in open water areas. The mean areal denitrification removal rate for this period was 0.70 kg N ha(-1) d(-1), which accounted for about 8% of the total N removed by the wetland. Internal retention was the main N-removal mechanism. Synoptic water quality surveys indicated that denitrification was limited by a lack of nitrification within the wetland. Between April 1998 and January 1999, the wetland was reconfigured as a hemi-marsh system, having equal areas of interspersed emergent marsh and deep open water. In May 1999, measured denitrification rates averaged 1414 +/- 298 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) within the emergent marsh zones and 682 +/- 218 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) in the open water areas. The mean areal denitrification removal rate was 3.58 kg N ha(-1) d(-1), which accounted for 40% of the total N removed by the wetland. A synoptic water quality survey indicated that nitrification within the wetland had been enhanced by the reduction of emergent macrophyte biomass and the increase in the area of interspersed deep open water. The modifications to the wetland shifted the nitrogen balance from a large internal storage component and a small denitrification component in 1998 to a more denitrifying system in 1999.

J	Spieles, DJ; Mitsch, WJ				Spieles, DJ; Mitsch, WJ			Macroinvertebrate community structure in high- and low-nutrient constructed wetlands	WETLANDS												We related macroinvertebrate community structure to physical, chemical, and biological gradients in flow-through constructed wetlands receiving secondarily treated domestic wastewater and lower-nutrient river water in Ohio, USA. Macroinvertebrates collected with benthic colonization plates and emergence traps were analyzed with diversity, biotic, and combination indices and related to seventeen parameters of water quality, substrate characteristics, and primary productivity in both wetland systems. A total of 36 and 39 macroinvertebrate taxa were collected in the wastewater wetland and river wetland, respectively. Invertebrate communities nearest to the wastewater source in the wastewater wetland had significantly lower (mean +/- SE) Simpson diversity (0.5 +/- 0.13) and Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) scores (2.6 +/- 0.8) than those of other sampling locations. Sampling locations near the middle and outflow of the wastewater wetland had diversity scores (0.84 +/- 0.01) and ICI scores (4.8 +/- 0.7) statistically similar to sites in the river-fed wetlands. Average diel dissolved oxygen and specific conductivity were the best environmental predictors of invertebrate community metrics; these variables along with chemical oxygen demand and nitrate-nitrogen described nearly 90% of the ICI variation in a four-predictor regression model. Multiple correspondence analysis showed sampling locations loosely grouped by average diel dissolved oxygen, which described 65.4% of the overall variation in the gradient data, and specific conductivity, which described and additional 16.4%. Macroinvertebrate analyses are presented as a valuable means of assessing the ecological status of wetlands used to improve water quality and as an important supplement for traditional chemical analyses.																	0277-5212					DEC	2000	20	4					716	729		10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020[0716:MCSIHA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000166089700013						
J	Maul, JD; Cooper, CM				Maul, JD; Cooper, CM			Water quality of seasonally flooded agricultural fields in Mississippi, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Planned flooding of agricultural fields is performed to prevent erosion (e.g. sheet, gully, and rill) and provide habitat for waterfowl. As a post-harvest field treatment, flooding is becoming more common in the agriculturally dominated landscape of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley (MAV) in the southeastern United States. Despite this trend, information pertaining to water quality characteristics of water remaining on fields during the winter and subsequent relationships with environmental and biological processes is sparse. Because the water retained on fields is eventually released into adjacent waterways prior to planting, it is critical to monitor water quality parameters of these flooded fields. Water quality parameters of flooded agricultural fields were assessed from January to March and compared to those observed in impounded wetlands. Temporal variation of parameters among sampling dates was also examined. Mean (+/-S.E.) suspended solids concentration was greater (p<0.05) in flooded agricultural fields (283.3+/-98.7 mg 1(-1)) than impounded wetlands (79.5+/-25.3 mg 1(-1)) and an interaction of habitat and sampling date was detected on dissolved solids concentration (p<0.05). Water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrate, total phosphorus, enterococci bacteria, and fecal coliform bacterial concentrations exhibited temporal variation among sampling dates (p<0.05). For both flooded fields and wetlands, fecal coliform and enterococci concentrations peaked at 2887.5 and 675.0 colony forming units (CFU) 100 ml(-1), respectively, during the first sampling date (January) and declined to 133.2 and 33.3 CFU 100 ml(-1), respectively, in March. Results of this study indicated that: (1) flooded agricultural fields had greater variability of water quality parameters than wetlands; (2) 53% of measured water quality parameters exhibited temporal variation and (3) impounding water may facilitate decreases in bacterial concentrations. Holding water on agricultural fields and knowledge of temporal water quality trends may provide a means to decrease contaminant concentrations, thus improving quality of potential runoff that may enter adjacent bodies of water.

J	Davies, NM; Norris, RH; Thoms, MC				Davies, NM; Norris, RH; Thoms, MC			Prediction and assessment of local stream habitat features using large-scale catchment characteristics	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Knowledge of what a habitat should be like, in the absence of the effects of human activities, is fundamental to local stream habitat assessment. It has been suggested that stream habitats are influenced by large-scale catchment features. This study aimed to identify these relationships so that local-scale habitat features could be predicted from larger-scale characteristics. 2. Fifty-one reference sites from the Upper Murrumbidgee River catchment, south-eastern Australia, were classified on the basis of the local features of their stream habitat. Large-scale variables, namely catchment area, stream length, relief ratio, alkalinity, percentage of volcanic rocks, percentage of metasediments, dominant geology and dominant soil type, provided sufficient information for classifying 69% of reference sites into appropriate reference site groups. 3. A model created using these large-scale catchment variables was able to predict the local habitat features that were expected (E) to occur at a site in the absence of the effects of human activities. These were compared with observed (O) local habitat features to provide an observed-to-expected (O/E) ratio, an assessment score of the habitat at a site. The departure of this ratio from 1 enables identification of those sites that may be impacted. A list of habitat features that are expected at a site can provide targets for habitat restoration or enhancement. 4. For impacted sites, when habitat assessment from the habitat predictive model was compared with biological assessment from the Australian River Assessment System (AUSRIVAS) predictive model, it was possible to identify whether habitat degradation or water quality degradation was the cause of biological impairment. Such assessment may make it possible to identify rehabilitation goals relevant to the biota.

The parameters monitored were temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, current speed, light attenuation, chlorophyll a and concentrations of ammonium, ortho-phosphate, nitrate and nitrite. The best water quality (low nutrients and chlorophyll a; no hypoxia) was found in the Big Sandy Creek, Turkey Creek and Village Creek systems. Water quality in the Neches River was also generally good except for instances of moderate algal blooms. The: pint Island Bayou system, however, typically showed poor water quality. Very low current velocities and high concentrations of nutrients: promoted massive spring plankton blooms (chlorophyll a in excess of 100 mug L-1) and subsequent hypoxia/anoxia (dissolved oxygen less than 5 mg L-1). In this system, hypoxia occurred as early as April and as late as December.																	0040-4403					NOV	2000	52	4		S			79	92										WOS:000167094100007

Economic and social indicators are already in regular use to support decision making at global, national and sub-national levels and in some cases for air and water quality, but few such indicators are available to assess, monitor and evaluate changes in the quality of land resources. Land refers not just to soil but to the combined resources of terrain, water, soil and biotic resources that provide the basis for land use. Land quality refers to the condition of land relative to the requirements of land use, including agricultural production, forestry, conservation, and environmental management. The LQI program addresses the dual objectives of environmental monitoring as well as sector performance monitoring for managed ecosystems (agriculture, forestry, conservation and environmental management). The primary research issue in the LQI program is the development of indicators that identify and characterize the impact(s) of human interventions on the landscape for the major agroecological zones of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate environments. Core LQIs identified for immediate development are: nutrient balance, yield gap, land use intensity and diversity, and land cover; LQIs requiring longer term research include: soil quality, land degradation, and agro-biodiversity; LQIs being developed by other authoritative groups include: water quality, forestland quality, rangeland quality, and land contamination/pollution.

J	Kaden, S; Schramm, M				Kaden, S; Schramm, M			Control model Spree/Schwarze Elster - a tool to optimise rehabilitation of water resources in the Lusatian mining district	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING					International Symposium on the Ecology of Post-Mining Landscapes	MAR, 1999	BRANDENBURG UNIV TCHNOL, COTTBUS, GERMANY		BRANDENBURG UNIV TCHNOL			The river basins of the Spree and Schwarze Elster have been disrupted by the long-lasting intensive lignite mining process in the Lusatian district, resulting in a large cone-shaped groundwater depression of 4000 km(2). Its volume is about 10 billion m(3), or about 15 times the annual groundwater recharge of that region. Special problems relate to the flooding and future use of remaining pits. With regard to water quality (acidification) it is necessary to accelerate the natural filling process by supplying surface water. This depends on its availability, as well as on the regional water balance. For the Lusatian river basins, longterm water resource planning models exist. These models combine on a monthly basis a stochastic simulation model of runoff with a deterministic analysis of water demand and availability of water resources. Based on these models, the overall and longterm water management strategies are developed. To control the daily water balance and to supply water for flooding the remaining pits, a short-term control model is now under development. It is based on the long-term strategy, but takes into account the actual runoff of the region, discharge in the rivers and water consumption. In this paper both the models and their applications are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Buchan, LAJ; Padilla, DK				Buchan, LAJ; Padilla, DK			Predicting the likelihood of Eurasian watermilfoil presence in lakes, a macrophyte monitoring tool	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												In regions with abundant and diverse freshwater resources, it is difficult and costly to survey all lakes at the level required to detect invasive plants. Effective allocation of monitoring resources requires tools that identify waterbodies where exotic species are most likely to invade. We developed and tested models that predict conditions in which Eurasian watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum, is most likely to survive and successfully colonize. We used logistic regression to model the likelihood of M. spicatum presence or absence using a suite of biological, chemical, and physical lake characteristics which are easily obtainable from public databases. We evaluated model fit by the Aikake criterion and model performance by the percentage of misclassification errors as well as the costs associated with acquiring data for variables modeled. Several models fit our data well, misclassifying only 1.3-11.0% of the lakes where M. spicatum was observed, and used relatively inexpensive landscape variables (percent forest cover in a drainage basin, presence and type of public boat launch, and bedrock type) that typically exist as information layers in geographic information systems (GISs) or recreational atlases. We found that the most important factors affecting the presence or absence of M. spicatum were those that influence water quality factors known to impact M. spicatum growth, rather than factors associated with human activity and dispersal potential. In particular, the amount of forest cover in the lake watershed was consistently important and could control the level of dissolved inorganic carbon in lakes, one of the factors known to affect M. spicatum growth rates. Factors such as the number of game fish species and number and types of boat ramps or proximity to roads were generally less important lake characteristics. Our models can be useful tools for developing management strategies to prevent or slow the spread of M. spicatum and aquatic invaders, such as the zebra mussel, that can attach to it and thus be dispersed. Our models also exemplify a general approach for slowing or stopping the spread of other invading species.																	1051-0761					OCT	2000	10	5					1442	1455		10.2307/2641297								WOS:000089744800019

We examined how O/E ratios derived from stream invertebrate data varied among 234 unimpaired reference sites and 254 test sites potentially impaired by past logging. Data were collected from streams in three montane ecoregions in California. Two sets of River invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS) predictive models were built: one set of models was based on near-species taxonomic resolution; the other was based on family identifications. Two models were built For each level of taxonomic resolution: one calculated O and E based on all taxa with probabilities of capture (P-c) > 0; the other calculated O and E based on only those taxa with P-c greater than or equal to 0.5. Evaluations of the performance of each model were based on three criteria: (1) how well models predicted the taxa found at unimpaired sites, (2) the degree to which O/E values differed among unimpaired reference sites and potentially impaired test sites, and (3) the degree to which test site O/E values were correlated with independent measures of watershed alteration. Predictions of species models were more accurate than those of family models, and predictions of the P-c greater than or equal to 0.5 species model were more robust than predictions of the P-c greater than or equal to 0 model. O/E values derived from both species models were related to land use variables, but only assessments based on the P-c greater than or equal to 0.5 model were insensitive to naturally occurring differences among streams, ecoregions, and years.

J	Mitsch, WJ; Gosselink, JG				Mitsch, WJ; Gosselink, JG			The value of wetlands: importance of scale and landscape setting	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Wetlands have value because their functions have proved to be useful to humans. The unit value for some wetlands also increases with human development (agriculture and urban) because of increased use and/or increased scarcity. Yet, paradoxically, its functions can easily be overwhelmed in areas of heavy human development, thus lessening those values. Thus wetlands appear to work best in the landscape as spatially distributed systems. Also, the value is partially dependent on where they are found in the landscape, e.g., the degree to which a wetland is open to hydrologic and biological fluxes with other systems, including urban and agricultural landscapes. A paradox of assigning values to wetlands and other ecosystems is that it can argue for the replacement of one system with another if a landscape view is not taken. Estimates of percent of landscape for various functions, e.g. water quality or flood control, are presented. It is suggested that a range of 3-7% of temperate-zone watersheds should be in wetlands to provide adequate flood control and water quality values for the landscape. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Codd, GA				Codd, GA			Cyanobacterial toxins, the perception of water quality, and the prioritisation of eutrophication control	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					International-Hydrological-Programme Symposium on Ecohydrology	MAY, 1998	UNIV LODZ, LODZ, POLAND	UNESCO IHP V, UNESCO Venice Off	UNIV LODZ			Mass growths of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), leading to the production of blooms, scums, and mats can occur in nutrient-enriched waterbodies throughout the world. Cyanobacterial mass accumulations attract the attention of water authorities and utilities, environmental and health agencies, and water-user groups, since they present water-treatment, supply, conservation, and health problems. The ability of cyanobacterial populations to produce potent toxins and annual examples of associated human and animal health problems have raised the position of cyanobacteria in the priorities for the management and protection of water quality in countries where health problems associated with the toxins have been perceived. This paper reviews the occurrence of cyanobacterial toxins in waterbodies with examples from national and local surveys. Properties of the known cyanobacterial toxins, associated health problems, and the likelihood of further toxins being discovered are discussed. The need for countermeasures to reduce or prevent the undesirable effects of cyanobacterial toxins exists at several levels. Driving forces influencing the perception of this need and the formulation of management measures include increases in eutrophication increasing demands on diminishing resources for drinking, irrigation, and leisure; and the attention of environmental and health agencies. Health hazards presented by cyanobacterial toxins and derived risk assessments are likely to increasingly influence the ranking of eutrophication problems among water quality issues in drinking and recreational waters.

To retain the nutrients from the lake, the Kis (small)-Balaton Water Protection System (KBWPS) was designed on the lower part of the main inflow, the River Zala. The first part of the KBWPS started to function in July 1985. After a few years the system became hypertrophic. According to our results, approximately 80 000 t of suspended solids, 300 t of total phosphorus (TP), 250 t of phosphate-P, 850 t of total nitrogen (TN), and 2450 t of nitrate-N were retained between 1986 and 1997 by the first part of the system. At present, the KBWPS retains about half of the suspended solids, more than one-third of TP, more than two-thirds of phosphate-P, only one-tenth of TN, but more than half of nitrate. A 16 km(2) area of the second part has been operating experimentally since 1992. This part retains approximately 75% of suspended solids (mostly of phytoplankton origin) coming from the first phase, but the phosphorus retention is low due to release of phosphorus from sediments. Until 1991 there were no significant differences in monthly means of the chlorophyll-a content from the western part of Lake Balaton. Since that time the chlorophyll-a content has been decreasing in the lake. This decrease could have been the result of the combined effects of weather conditions (temperature, rainfall) and nutrient availability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The main components of this methodology are applied to the Dnieper River mouth zone as an example. The relationship between production-destruction (respiration) balance and releases through the Kakhovka hydropower dam has been determined for the channel network, floodplain lakes, the floodplain proper, and the Dnieper River mouth zone combined. Production-destruction processes are predicted as the change in organic matter content, as measured by BODtot. We have developed calculation methods for ecosystem functioning and water quality management in the Dnieper River mouth zone channel network as a result of releases through the Kakhovka dam. The concept of ecosystem, ecological and extremal (target) releases and sanitary addition to ecosystem release for liquidation of anthropogenic pollution was formulated and the volumes of all these releases for the Dnieper River mouth zone were estimated. This methodology and calculation methods can be used for ecosystem state and water quality management in regulated rivers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In Dutch, this environmental stress is known as 'verdroging'. The English term most frequently used is desiccation, but here the term is used with a broader interpretation, to include changes in (soil)water quality due to groundwater depletion. Since the late 1980s desiccation has been recognised by the Dutch government as a major environmental problem. As part of the development of abatement strategies various models have been built. These models are used to analyse the consequences of different water management scenarios for separate landuse functions, such as agriculture, shipping and public water supply. In order to account for the natural environment in these analyses the national ecohydrological model DEMNAT (Dose Effect Model NAture Terrestrial) was developed. A brief description is given of the latest model version. Moreover, results are discussed based on recent applications at national, regional, as well as local scales. Some perspectives for future model developments are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The technique was recently transferred to the UK from America, and is now being tentatively used by the Environment Agency to support water resources decision making in England and Wales. Applications to date have concentrated mainly on fish habitats, investigating the potential relative impacts of changing reservoir or borehole releases, abstractions, and water transfers. Although the application is both expensive and time consuming, it is nonetheless proving to be a valuable tool, and is the subject of ongoing research to further develop its applicability and transferability. Although taking no account of water quality, sediment transport, or other constraints on habitat suitability and population, the technique appears to have significant potential when used in combination with other habitat protection aids.

The study has been carried out on the River Strouma using two approaches: - in time: by determination of the relationship between the biotic indices and the water discharge as a result of the processes that have been realised at the moment of their registration - in space (along the river): by discrete study of specific river stretches dominated by one or more specific anthropogenic impacts on the natural flow regime and/or on the water quality. In a 3-year period, parallel field measurements and hydrobiological samplings have been carried out, supplementing the heretofore existing scarce information. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Hydrobiological modelling techniques were applied to data collected from Lake Sevan since the 1970s and this has provided insight into the functioning of the ecosystem of the lake. Overexploitation and pollution initiated widespread changes throughout the entire lake basin. Uncontrolled abstraction of the lake's water caused severe water level reduction, resulting in eutrophication and water quality degradation. These events have major implications for Armenia. Any future hydrological engineering development should be preceded by an appropriate ecological impact assessment to prevent catastrophes similar to those experienced at Lake Sevan. There is a need to investigate the socio-economic consequences of the changes to Lake Seven and develop measures to limit potentially damaging economic activities. Additionally, this study has identified the need to develop tools to predict the effects of changes that threaten sustainable lake development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

On the basis of observation data, calculation, and mathematical modeling, the peculiarities of current regimes and the regularities of turbulent mixing processes on the shallow areas of the reservoirs were found. The transformation of release waves from hydroelectric power stations were also calculated and the inner water exchange caused by currents and water level fluctuation under these power releases and its influence on organic matter balance (by BODtot) in the shallows were estimated. The influence of the large decrease of water levels in the reservoirs upon macrophyte function and water quality formation was also analysed. The role of wind waves for phytoplankton functioning is illustrated. The possibilities of hydrodynamics management in the Dnieper reservoirs are also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

These lenses are formed due to a combination of unique conditions that include short duration, high intensity rainfall; geomorphology; and lithology that enables rapid infiltration to the underlying ground-water. Large depressions and playas, paleodrainage patterns, and catchment areas, which are necessary for the accumulation of large amounts of water during flash foods, were mapped from aerial photographs, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, and digital elevation model (DEM) datasets. From historical pumping and water quality variation data acquired between 1963 and 1977, the sustainable extraction rate for Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish is estimated ttl be 5.5 and 3.5 Ml day(-1), respectively. These rates are fundamental to the delicate management required to extract freshwater from the lenses and yet avoid upconing of the deeper saline water. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

J	Buzzelli, CP; Childers, DL; Dong, Q; Jones, RD				Buzzelli, CP; Childers, DL; Dong, Q; Jones, RD			Simulation of periphyton phosphorus dynamics in Everglades National Park	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Mathematical modelling is a useful tool to investigate potential ecological responses to variations in hydrodynamic and nutrient inputs in managed aquatic landscapes. The objective of this study was to develop a periphyton growth model and use it to identify critical factors in ecosystem phosphorus dynamics in pristine freshwater wetlands of Everglades National Park (ENP). We simulated changes in periphyton biomass under increased total phosphorus (TP) input for comparison to an ongoing manipulative field experiment. The field experiment analyzes the responses of periphyton, macrophytes, soils, and fauna to increased TP concentrations in replicated flow-through flume channels built within ENP. Both field and model experiments introduce TP enrichments of 5, 15, and 30 mu g l(-1) above ambient concentrations (typically 5-10 mu g l(-1)). The model domain was an individual flume channel (3 m wide x 85 m long) with incident light, water temperature, and volume flux at the head as forcing functions. Base case model periphyton biomass increased with incoming TP during the wet season (June-November) and reached a maximum of 70 g C m(-2) in late August. There was strong evidence of P-limited primary production as water column TP accounted for 95.5% of the variability in average daily carbon biomass. In addition to positive responses in biomass, water column TP and net production also increased under increased TP input. TP enrichment led to lower recycling within and increased export from the model flume channel. Although our simplified model was not structured to simulate shifts in periphyton composition frequently observed as a consequence of P enrichment, the processes and ramifications of community structure are complicated and are not well understood. We suggest a two or more component formulation that can account for a continuum of oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions in order to model periphyton biogeochemical relationships in the Everglades. Refined versions of this model will be used to better simulate observed changes during the course of the field experiment in order to generate new hypotheses for further investigations.

Merida, Yucatan has a population greater than 600 000 inhabitants. The city obtains its freshwater from a thin (<50 m thick) sole-source aquifer. This aquifer also supplies water to satisfy the industrial and agricultural needs of the region. Ln order to help in maintaining an adequate water supply for the city, a detailed study has been conducted to determine the best area to establish a hydrogeological reserve zone (HRZ). A polygon of 900 km(2) was chosen southwest of the city. This area is upgradient from Merida, no industrial activity is present, and there are two natural boundaries that bound the proposed HRZ. These are no-flow boundaries that have developed as a result of the second boundary: a high permeability zone locally known as the ring of cenotes (ring of sinkholes). The major current obstacle to designate this area as a hydrogeological reserve is an industrial landfill that is present in within the proposed area. As part of the establishment of the HRZ, the landfill should be relocated, and a comprehensive ground water quality study should be conducted to determine the actual water quality of the aquifer.

J	Muhammetoglu, AB; Soyupak, S				Muhammetoglu, AB; Soyupak, S			A three-dimensional water quality-macrophyte interaction model for shallow lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A dynamic three-dimensional water quality model for macrophyte-dominated shallow lakes was proposed and tested. The proposed model is capable of simulating macrophytes and its interactions with water quality constituents such as dissolved oxygen (DO), organic nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate, organic phosphorus, orthophosphate, biochemical oxygen demand, phytoplankton and the sediment layer in shallow lakes. An existing two-dimensional hydrodynamic model has been utilized in conjunction with the water quality model to simulate water levels, velocities and flow rates. The modelled macrophyte processes are photosynthesis, respiration, mortality and excretion. Hourly simulation of photosynthesis process has been realized. The hourly simulations need special attention to predict diurnal variations of DO in macrophyte dominated lakes. The proposed water quality simulation model was subjected to calibration, verification and prediction processes using the data collected from Mogan Lake, Turkey. Mogan Lake exhibits wide variations of macrophyte biomass seasonally. The lake also exhibits highly variable DO levels both seasonally and diurnally. Statistical error quantification methods have been utilized to test the goodness of fit between the water quality model predictions and field measurements. Good agreement has been achieved between model predictions and measurements. Moreover, uncertainty analysis has been carried out for macrophyte and DO constituents. The analysis showed that the magnitude of the saturated growth rate of macrophyte is the most sensitive model parameter both for macrophyte and DO. The proposed water quality simulation model gave some promising initial results as a management tool to predict the expected reductions for the undesired consequences of eutrophication problem.

J	Mankin, KR				Mankin, KR			An integrated approach for modelling and managing golf course water quality and ecosystem diversity	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Models can help planners assess the potential impacts of planned land development. However, pollutant yield results from common watershed water quality models are inadequate and must be coupled with other important ecosystem component models to assess the overall impact of land development and management. For example, golf course development typically replaces agricultural or native lands with intensively managed grassland with potential impacts on water quality, as well as avian and aquatic species habitat. An integrated modelling concept was demonstrated using readily available models and data for a hypothetical golf course within the Little Kitten Creek Watershed near Manhattan, KS, USA. A watershed water quality model (EUTROMOD) combined with local fish habitation data and habitat suitability index modelling was used to simulate the overall ecosystem impact of projected golf course design and management actions. Models were calibrated using data for grass and native prairie conditions, and future scenarios were simulated to guide design and management actions. Compared with the native conditions, good golf course management was simulated to increase annual nitrogen (N) yield by 148% and phospohorus (P) yield by 24% with little impact on runoff or erosion, while a poor management scenario increased the N yield by 380%. This change in aquatic nutrient levels along with concurrent projected changes in stream habitat led to a potential impact on three of four fish species analyzed. Avain habitat was also impacted depending upon design and management of non-playing area. An overall design and management plan was developed with the goal of maintaining predevelopment levels of water quality and habitat. Sustainable water quality management must include proper soil and water conservation, irrigation scheduling, and fertilizer and pesticide management. Appropriate features must be designed into numerous contiguous area (1.2 ha minimum for grassland and 0.8 ha minimum for woodland) of non-playing area trough, riparian area, etc.) to meet avian habitat needs. And a diversity of stream habitat conditions must be maintained, including clear pool and gravel-substrate riffle zones, and permanent and intermittent streams. This integrated modelling approach demonstrated the utility of a simplistic framework for analyzing and assessing ecosystem impacts of land development. Further work should integrate and test more complex models and interrelationships between models for lands undergoing a variety of ecosystem changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Accordingly, development of vegetation in the riparian zone can be expected to influence ecosystem functions, and organic matter storage patterns are believed to be indicators of functional recovery in disturbed riparian zones. Our objective was to compare the distribution and allocation of organic matter among microsites within the floodplain and with temporal changes (successional status) associated with community development. Three third order streams in the upper coastal plain of South Carolina were selected. Measurement transects were established across three floodplains of varying successional status, Meyer's branch; a mature riparian hardwood forest; Fourmile branch; a mid-successional riparian forest; and Pen Branch, an early successional riparian forest. Overall, measurements of aboveground biomass, soil carbon, and stand structure indicate that the early and mid successional stands are becoming more similar to the mature stand and that microsite differences within the braided, riparian stream systems are small.

The prediction of water quality is increasingly required in river catchment management, but methods are still developmental. We therefore derived empirical models to predict the concentrations of base cations, H(+) and alkalinity at any point in a complex Scottish river system, and under diverse discharge conditions. Input data were readily available from geological and topographic maps, whole rock composition data and catchment land use inventories in geographical information systems (GIS). 2. A key and novel feature of the model was prediction using geological data for the riparian zone within 50 m of the river. The discharge contributions that passed through soil derived from each parent rock were estimated and used as weightings in predicting final run-off quality. 3. Typical equations fbr upland catchments for mean, maximum or minimum river water Ca concentration, [Ca], were of the form [Ca] = a + b root{Ca(rz)}, where {Ca(rz)} denotes flow routing-weighted rock CaO concentration of the riparian zone rock types present. These equations were significant at P < 0.0001. Similar approaches were applicable to alkalinity and to other base cations. 4. Predictions of [Ca] in catchments with mixed land use were improved by including model terms for catchment riparian zone cover of agriculturally improved (intensified) grassland and arable land. These results indicated anthropogenic effects on base cation flux that would not be represented by geological data alone. 5. Similarly, concentrations of Na, Mg and K were correlated with Cl concentration in the river water, primarily as a consequence of marine-derived Cl. Including distance from the east coast as a predictive variable in place of [Cl] obviated the need for direct [Cl] measurement in model operation. 6. We advocate further work to assess whether similar models can be developed and applied in other geographical locations, where features such as land use, geology and sea salt inputs will all vary.

The temporal and spatial deposition of fecal material relative to storm events and water-bodies determines much of the risk a grazing scheme presents to water quality. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a comparative technique to estimate cattle fecal loading across a watershed through time. Once the method was developed, dry and wet season trials were conducted on a 138 ha experimental rangeland watershed at the San Joaquin Experimental Range in 1996-97. Fifty-four permanent 40 m(2) belt transects were established across the watershed. Observers ocularly assigned a rank of 1 (smallest diameter) to 5 (largest diameter) to each fecal deposit within a transect. A regression relationship was developed to predict fecal deposit dry weight by rank. Load per transect was calculated as the total weight of all fecal deposits in a transect. All fecal deposits in transects were collected and actual fecal load determined. The comparative yield methodology was successfully adapted to estimate rangeland fecal loading. Regression relationships predicting fecal deposit dry weight by ranks were highly significant for all observers (p < 0.001). The R-2 values ranged from 0.97 to 0.99 in the dry season and 0.89 to 0.94 in the wet season, There was no significant difference between the weighed fecal load estimate and the estimates of observers using the Comparative method (p < 0.05). This method provides a rapid, simple method for estimating spatial and temporal livestock fecal loading on rangeland watersheds.																	0022-409X					SEP	2000	53	5					506	510		10.2307/4003651								WOS:000166156300007

Principal components analysis indicated that environmental differences across catchments and ecoregions were associated more with variation in baseflow water chemistry leg., total alkalinity, conductivity) than with geomorphic or geographic variables. Using simple community presence/absence measures, richness of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT richness) followed the pattern Blue Ridge > SW Appalachians = Piedmont = SE Plains. When grouped by catchment total and EPT richness tended to be lower in lowland than in upland regions. However, Bray-Curtis presence/absence similarities coupled with flexible UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages) analyses revealed that invertebrate assemblages were distinctive among ecoregions both at the genus/morphospecies and family levels. Differences in overall similarity among ecoregions were highly significant, with upland Blue Ridge and lowland SE Plains streams displaying the lowest interecoregional similarity, and Piedmont and SW Appalachians streams displaying the highest similarity. Faunal similarity within a given ecoregion approximated that observed within individual catchments. Family-level groupings were almost as robust at discriminating catchments and ecoregions as were classifications derived from genus/morphospecies. The ecoregion concept appears to be as useful a classification scheme as that derived from smaller river catchments in the delineation of stream invertebrate distributions in the southeastern USA.																	0887-3593					SEP	2000	19	3					442	461		10.2307/1468106								WOS:000089896100007						
J	Sandin, L; Johnson, RK				Sandin, L; Johnson, RK			Ecoregions and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages of Swedish streams	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												A total of 694 streams was sampled for benthic macroinvertebrates in the autumn of 1995 as part of the Swedish national stream survey. After removal of sites considered to be impacted, 428 streams were available to test a geographical classification of benthic macroinvertebrates using ecoregions. Cluster analysis, semi-strong hybrid multidimensional scaling, and a permutation test procedure were used to investigate if the 6 main ecoregions of Sweden could be a useful tool to partition the species variance of benthic assemblages. Taxon richness, abundance, and diversity differed between ecoregions, with the main difference occurring in the northern part of the country where the arctic-alpine region had lower taxon richness, number of individuals, and Shannon-Wiener diversity than the southern parts of the country. The permutation test of assemblage composition and the comparison of the flexible beta unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) cluster groups with the ecoregion classification also showed significant differences between the arctic-alpine and the boreal, boreonemoral, and nemoral regions. Despite this result, the benefit of an ecoregion classification for biomonitoring of streams using macroinvertebrates is not convincing because there is a gradual change in macroinvertebrate assemblage composition from north to south. Benthic macroinvertebrate stream assemblages are structured both by large-scale factors (i.e., on a geographical scale), and by small-scale factors (i.e., on a local scale). Ecoregion classifications alone, therefore, may not sufficiently partition variance in assemblage composition and a nested approach, including other factors such as altitude stream size, and catchment characteristics, is probably needed to improve ecoregion classifications and biological assessments that use stream benthic macroinvertebrates.

J	Gerritsen, J; Barbour, MT; King, K				Gerritsen, J; Barbour, MT; King, K			Apples, oranges, and ecoregions: on determining pattern in aquatic assemblages	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Classification of waterbodies is a necessary step for aquatic biological assessment. Geographic classes, such as physiographic provinces, marine biogeographic provinces, and ecoregions are frequently used as a classification framework for conducting bioassessments. An alternative to such a priori classification of waterbodies is to let the biological data tell us, using various statistical exploratory techniques to identify classes that do not necessarily conform to geographic stratification. In assessment of new sites, it is often necessary to identify or predict which of several classes the new site may belong to. We classified benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages from streams of Wyoming, using 3 alternative methods: a priori establishment of ecoregions, adaptive modification of the ecoregions, and a posteriori clustering. Classification strengths were compared using similarity dendrograms. Clustering separated the sites better than ecoregions, but the clusters showed strong ecoregional affinities. The modified ecoregions were equal to the clusters in classification strength. We conclude that an iterative process that includes generation of hypotheses, exploratory data analysis, and evaluation and modification of hypotheses is most likely to produce robust classifications, regardless of specific analytical approaches used.																	0887-3593					SEP	2000	19	3					487	496		10.2307/1468109								WOS:000089896100010

Stresses resulting from human disturbance, however, may constrain species membership in algal assemblages and reduce regional diversity. We expected that ecoregional differences in diatom assemblages, if they were present, would be more evident in relatively undisturbed sites than in randomly selected sites. Benthic diatom and water chemistry samples were collected from streams in 7 ecoregions of the Mid-Atlantic Highlands to evaluate correspondence between ecoregional classification and diatom assemblages. Ecoregional differences were assessed using 196 randomly selected stream sites (probability sites) and 60 sites with less disturbance by humans (reference sites). Multivariate analyses showed that significant ecoregional differences in diatom assemblages were observed only in probability sites and not in reference sites. Water chemistry was significantly different among ecoregions, both for probability sites and for reference sites. Significant differences in diatom assemblages and water chemistry were, however, evident only among ecoregions grouped by topography (i.e., montane, high plateau, and low plateau/valley). Ecoregional differences between montane regions or low plateau/valley regions were subtle. Stream sites grouped by catchments were also significantly different in water chemistry but not in diatom assemblages, both for probability sites and for reference sites. Our data suggest that diatom assemblages respond to land use, especially agricultural activities, and thus may correspond to the ecoregional classification when land use differs significantly among these ecoregions (e.g, montane vs valley ecoregions). Diatom assemblages that lack a region-specific feature may be ideal as unbiased indicators of stream water quality.

J	Naiman, RJ; Turner, MG				Naiman, RJ; Turner, MG			A future perspective on North America's freshwater ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Fresh waters are central to society and to the environment. Nevertheless, ongoing and projected changes in the distribution, abundance, and quality of water resources and freshwater ecosystems represent a serious threat to the integrity of the environment as well as the vitality of human cultures. Nearly every country in the world experiences regular water shortages, agriculture uses most of the world's available fresh water, and most illnesses in developing countries result from waterborne parasites and pathogens. Unfortunately, often hidden in these and other depressing statistics are the needs of the environment for adequate water to maintain vibrant ecosystems. Understanding the abilities and limits of freshwater ecosystems to respond to human-generated pressures is becoming a central issue for cultures and a challenge for science. This article explores trends in alterations to freshwater ecosystems, discusses the ecological consequences of biophysical alterations expected to occur in the next 20-30 years, and identifies some of the major scientific challenges and opportunities to effectively address the changes. Topics discussed include altered hydrological regimes, biogeochemical cycles, altered land use, riparian management, life history strategies, and relations between climate change and water resource management.

J	Pringle, CM				Pringle, CM			Threats to US public lands from cumulative hydrologic alterations outside of their boundaries	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												U.S. public lands are increasingly threatened by human alteration of hydrologic connections outside their boundaries. Cumulative effects of dams, impoundments, regulated flows, wetlands drainage, and groundwater extraction outside of public land boundaries can play a key role in controlling the hydrology and biology within these managed areas. Expanding human populations require more water, and they often look to public lands to meet their demands. Immediate challenges facing water resource managers are increased pressure to dam rivers and pump aquifers near public lands, as a result of water shortages exacerbated by droughts coupled with increased demands from municipal and agricultural growth. As pollutants become more concentrated in less water, water quality often becomes a major related issue. While these problems are particularly acute in rapidly growing regions of the arid West where water is severely limited, they are also emerging in the East. Data on cumulative effects of hydrologic alterations on the biological integrity of public lands have not been systematically assessed at a national level. However, emerging trends can be used to gauge the magnitude of outside pressures and to place water resource challenges into context. The U.S. National Park Service is participating in water rights adjudications in over 50 different park service units. The U.S. Forest Service currently has over 500 legal claims concerning water rights for national forests located in 55 basins of 11 Western states. Similar conflicts exist for national wildlife refuges which are particularly vulnerable to water quality and quantity problems because of their small size; in 1994, 150 out of 224 Western wildlife refuges reported conflicts with other water users, and only 98 reported that their existing water rights assured delivery of adequate water in an average year. As human demands for water continue to expand, financially strapped federal land management agencies have a greater need for strengthened institutional, legal, and scientific tools to manage hydrologic connections. Two case studies from different biogeographic extremes (Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge in the arid Nevada desert and the Caribbean National Forest in the wet tropics of Puerto Rico) illustrate the synergism that can occur between field managers and scientists in implementing localized solutions. Moreover, they highlight the critical need to address cumulative long-term effects of hydrologic alterations outside of public land boundaries. Recommendations include: establishment of more stream gaging stations and monitoring programs within and adjacent to public lands; development of new and innovative partnerships between federal land management agencies and both federal and academic scientists; and interdisciplinary research and development of science-based tools to predict cumulative and interactive effects of hydrologic alterations.

J	Glasgow, HB; Burkholder, JM				Glasgow, HB; Burkholder, JM			Water quality trends and management implications from a five-year study of a eutrophic estuary	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The Neuse River and Estuary, a major tributary of the second largest estuary on the United States mainland, historically has sustained excessive blooms of algae and toxic dinoflagellates, hypoxia, and fish kills. Previous attempts have been made to use shortterm databases of 2-3 years, or data sets from infrequent (monthly) sampling, to assess whether nutrient inputs to the Neuse are increasing and supporting higher algal production. These previous efforts also have relied on single-point-determined flow velocity data, at upstream sites remote from the estuary, to estimate the volume of how in quantifying nutrient loading to the estuary. We completed a five-year study of the Neuse, including a comparative inventory of nutrients to the watershed from point sources and from concentrated animal operations (CAOs) as recent nonpoint sources, as well as an intensive assessment of water quality over time in the mesohaline estuary. Estimates of nutrient loads were based on volume of flow data from shore-to-shore transect cross sections, taken with a boat-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler at the westernmost edge of the estuary. A total of 441 point dischargers contributed at least 3.34 x 10(8) L effluent/d to the Neuse system, much of which came from municipal wastewater treatment giants (2.03 x 10(8) L effluent/d, excluding periods of plant malfunctions; total annual loadings of at least 9 x 10(5) kg P and 2.1 x 10(6) kg N, with a 17% increase in human population over the past decade). The Neuse basin also included 554 CAOs, with 76% in swine production (1.7 x 10(6) animals, from a 285% increase in the past decade) and 23% in poultry (5.5 x 10(5) animals). An estimated 5.9 x 10(9) kg manure produced by swine and poultry during 1998 contributed similar to 4.1 x 10(7) kg N and 1.4 x 10(7) kg P to the Neuse watershed. About 20% of the area in the watershed now has enough manure from CAOs to exceed the P requirements of all nonlegume crops and forages. About two-thirds of the N- and P-rich feeds for these animals are imported (with 4.0 x 10(7) kg N and 1.6 x 10(7) kg P in 1998); thus, the watershed increasingly has become a nutrient sink. Over the five-year study in the Neuse Estuary study area, P loading significantly declined (by an estimated 14%), whereas TN (total nitrogen) loading significantly increased (by an average of 16%) and TNi (total inorganic nitrogen) increased by similar to 38%. The increased inorganic N (N-i), partly related to severe storms with high precipitation in years 4-5, coincided with a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a) that likely reflected displacement/washout of algal populations and cysts. Thus, while both N and P supplies have increased in the watershed, there is evidence for a significant increase in N-i loading but, as yet, no apparent signal for increased P in the lower estuary. Weather patterns ultimately control when/whether the elevated Ni supply will support increased algal production, so that estuarine algal blooms, hypoxia, and fish kills will remain difficult, at best, to predict in modeling efforts. We recommend that decadal data sets, with sufficient sampling frequency to capture nutrient loadings from major storm events, be used to assess fluctuations in algal production of lower rivers and estuaries, and relationships with changing nutrient inputs. Given increased N and P supplies in the Neuse watershed from ongoing growth of both human and swine populations, a current management goal of 30% N reduction should be altered to include increased focus on Ni and strengthened comanagement of P As for estuaries in other regions, nutrient reduction goals should be interpreted as "moving targets" that likely will have to be substantially adjusted upward, over time, to accomplish noticeable reductions in algal blooms, hypoxia, and fish kills in the lower Neuse River and Estuary.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				AUG	2000	10	4					1024	1046										WOS:000088496000008						
J	Mallin, MA; Williams, KE; Esham, EC; Lowe, RP				Mallin, MA; Williams, KE; Esham, EC; Lowe, RP			Effect of human development on bacteriological water quality in coastal watersheds	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Human development along the land-seawater interface is considered to have significant environmental consequences. Development can also pose an increased human health risk. In a rapidly developing coastal region we investigated this phenomenon throughout a series of five estuarine watersheds, each of which differed in both the amount and type of anthropogenic development. Over a four-year period we analyzed the abundance and distribution of the enteric pathogen indicator microbes, fecal coliform bacteria and Escherichia coli. We also examined how these indicator microbes were related to physical and chemical water quality parameters and to demographic and land use factors throughout this system of coastal creeks. Within all creeks, there was a spatial pattern of decreasing enteric bacteria away from upstream areas, and both fecal coliform and E. coli abundance were inversely correlated with salinity. Turbidity was positively correlated with enteric bacterial abundance. Enteric bacterial abundance was strongly correlated with nitrate and weakly correlated with orthophosphate concentrations. Neither fecal coliforms nor E. coli displayed consistent temporal abundance patterns. Regardless of salinity, average estuarine fecal coliform abundance differed greatly among the five systems. An analysis of demographic and land use factors demonstrated that fecal coliform abundance was significantly correlated with watershed population, and even more strongly correlated with the percentage of developed land within the watershed. However, the most important anthropogenic factor associated with fecal coliform abundance was percentage watershed-impervious surface coverage, which consists of roofs, roads, driveways, sidewalks, and parking lots. These surfaces serve to concentrate and convey storm-water-borne pollutants to downstream receiving waters. Linear regression analysis indicated that percentage watershed-impervious surface area alone could explain 95% of the variability in average estuarine fecal coliform abundance. Thus, in urbanizing coastal areas waterborne health risks can likely be reduced by environmentally sound land use planning and development that minimizes the use of impervious surface area, while maximizing the passive water treatment function of natural and constructed wetlands, grassy swales, and other "green" areas. The watershed approach used in our study demonstrates that the land-water interface is not restricted to obvious shoreline areas, but is influenced by and connected with landscape factors throughout the watershed.																	1051-0761					AUG	2000	10	4					1047	1056		10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[1047:EOHDOB]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000088496000009

A number of diversity indices have been proposed and used in numerous works in spite of a lack of statistical characteristics and tests of comparison. These Relative Abundance Distributions (RAD) can also be described using graphic representations exhibiting both the number of taxa and the quantitative distribution of the individuals which constitute these taxa. Fitting these RADs to deterministic or stochastic models remains problematic for different reasons like scale dependence or complexity of the numerical procedures. In our study, we introduce a new model to describe RAD and ecological succession. This model is a Fractal Model based on the assumption that during an ecological succession/accumulation process, at each step of the succession, K new species appear which are k times more abundant with K = k(d) (where d is a fractal dimension). We use a Monte-Carlo procedure with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance to fit this model and to estimate parameters. Through the study of entomological data from a Mediterranean Man And Biosphere reserve, we demonstrate the qualities of the new Fractal Model. Thus, the Fractal Model was rejected for none of the 13 RADs tested. In addition, the parameters (K, k and d) are independent of the Hill family diversity indices and of three evenness indices and are able to provide additional information concerning both the diversity of the sampled ecosystem and development of this biodiversily during the species accumulation process in this ecosystem.																	0030-1299	1600-0706				AUG	2000	90	2					333	342		10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.900214.x								WOS:000089031600014						
J	Leibowitz, SG; Loehle, C; Li, BL; Preston, EM				Leibowitz, SG; Loehle, C; Li, BL; Preston, EM			Modeling landscape functions and effects: a network approach	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Landscape functions, including sediment and nutrient trapping, pollutant degradation, and flood control, are often adversely affected by human activities. Tools are needed for assessing the effects of human activities at the landscape scale. An approach is presented that addresses this goal. Spatially-explicit ecosystem units and their connections are used to define a transport network. A linear transport model is a tractable approach to landscape analysis for assessment purposes. The ability of each unit to provide ecosystem goods and services is considered explicitly in terms of its place in the network. Based on this simple model, landscape-level effects of impacts to the functioning of a. given ecosystem unit can be calculated. Effects of changes in network structure (due to changes in the flow regime) can also be assessed. The model allows several useful concepts to be defined, including change in buffer capacity, free capacity, an ordinal ranking of the relative importance of ecosystem units to overall landscape functioning, and differentiation of cumulative versus synergistic effects. Utility functions for valuation of landscape function are also defined. The framework developed here should provide a foundation for the development of analytic tools that can be applied to assessment and permitting activities. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Watersheds, or river drainage basins, can be understood through an ecological choregraphy. The upper San Pedro River basin of southern Arizona (USA) and northern Sonora (Mexico) is used as an example. This watershed is currently facing significant growth pressures. Rapid urbanization, cattle ranching, and irrigated agricultural pumping in the drainage basin are having negative environmental consequences, including water quality and supply problems, increased soil erosion, threats to wildlife habitats, and degradation of scenic resources. Copper mining, just outside the watershed, potentially impacts groundwater and the San Pedro riparian system. The protection of environmentally sensitive areas would help to maintain the biological integrity of the region. This paper focuses on the design of a framework for the identification of environmentally sensitive areas in the watershed and an analysis of existing government plans to protect such areas. The proposed framework can coordinate local, state, and federal efforts to achieve their protection objectives. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

A field experiment was conducted in 1996 and 1997 at St. Emmanuel, Que., Canada, to investigate the combined effects of water table management (WTM) and N fertilization on soil NO3- level and denitrification rates in the top soil layer (0-0.15 m). The field was planted to cent (Zea mays L.) in both years. Treatments consisted of a factorial combination of two water table treatments, free drainage (FD) at about 1.0 m and subrigation (SI) at 0.6 m below the soil surface, and two N fertilizer rates, 200 kg ha(-1) (N-200) and 120 kg ha(-1) (N-120) SI reduced NO3- concentration in the top soil layer by 42 and 16% in 1996 and 1997, respectively. Nitrate levels in soil were 50% lower in N-120 plots in 1996, and 20% in 1997 compared to the N-200 plots. Denitrification was higher in SI compared to FD, but not influenced by N rate. As a consequence, WTM practices have implication!; for both water quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Climatic conditions played a large role in regulating N dynamics in the soil. Due to drier and cooler conditions in 1997, denitrification rates were lower than in 1996, leaving higher residual NO3- in the soil profile following corn harvest. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Its most probable fish hosts are the Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides). It was once widely distributed (although uncommon) throughout the Ohio and Mississippi drainages and tributaries to the lower Great Lakes, but has declined significantly in recent years. It is listed as endangered in Illinois, threatened in Michigan and New York, and of special concern or interest in Indiana, Ohio and North Carolina. Its range in Canada included western Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and the Grand, Thames, Sydenham, Detroit, Ausable and Maitland rivers. Its numbers in Great Lakes waters have been reduced by the Zebra Mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, and populations in the Thames, Sydenham and Ausable rivers are disappearing or have been lost primarily as a result of agricultural impacts. The healthiest remaining populations in Ontario are found in a 60 km reach of the upper Grand River, but their future is uncertain because of fishing pressures on their host fish, increasing disturbance from recreational activities such as canoeing, and an anticipated decline in water quality accompanying the rapid rate of human population growth that is projected for the watershed.																	0008-3550					JUL-SEP	2000	114	3					457	470										WOS:000166309600012						
J	Ehrenfeld, JG				Ehrenfeld, JG			Evaluating wetlands within an urban context	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					Symposium on Goal Setting and Success Criteria for Coastal Habitat Restoration	JAN 13-15, 1998	CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA					Coastal regions are among the most rapidly urbanizing places on earth. The numerous effects of urbanization on hydrology, geomorphology, and ecology make wetlands in urban regions function differently from wetlands in non-urban lands. Furthermore, wetlands ill urban regions may take on human-related values that they lack in non-urban areas, as they provide some contact with nature, and some opportunities for recreations that an otherwise rare in the urban landscape. Evaluations of the success of restorations in urban regions require criteria first to determine the kinds, and intensities of urban influence on the site, and secondly to assess functional performance. The development of success criteria, at both the levels of assessment, depends on the proper definition of a reference domain (the set of wetlands to which success criteria will apply), and the documentation of a set of reference sites within the domain; both must be based within the urban context appropriate for the region of interest. An example is presented from a study of urban wetlands in New Jersey of a procedure for establishing the reference domain, the reference set of wetlands, and criteria for the assessment of urban influence.

A simulation model, developed and validated for a series of created experimental marshes in Northeastern Illinois, was aggregated and simplified to estimate the nutrient retention capacity of hypothetical large-scale coastal wetland restoration in Michigan and Ohio. Restoration of 31.2 km(2) of wetlands on agricultural land along Saginaw Bay, Michigan, would retain 25 metric tons-P year(-1) (53% of the phosphorus flow from the upstream watershed). Hydrologic restoration of 17.3 km(2) of mostly diked wetlands in Sandusky Bay, Ohio, would retain 38 metric tons year(-1) (12% of the phosphorus flow from the upstream watershed). A wetland distribution model developed for the Saginaw Bay site illustrated a technique for identifying sites that have high potential for being transition zones between open water and upland and thus logical locations for wetland restoration.

J	West, TL; Clough, LM; Ambrose, WC				West, TL; Clough, LM; Ambrose, WC			Assessment of function in an oligohaline environment: Lessons learned by comparing created and natural habitats	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					Symposium on Goal Setting and Success Criteria for Coastal Habitat Restoration	JAN 13-15, 1998	CHARLESTON, SC					Assessments of nursery area function were carried out over a 10-year period in a 3-ha oligohaline marsh and creek system ('Project Area 2') and four natural 'control' creeks (Drinkwater, Jacks, Jacobs, and Tooley) located in the Pamlico River estuary, North Carolina. Habitat function was assessed by comparing (1) growth and survival of fish: (2) long-term monitoring of water quality, sediment organic carbon, and the benthic infaunal community; and (3) measurement of benthic food availability. Growth (weight gain) and survival of the fish Leiostonus xanthurus held within enclosures were similar in both created and natural habitats. Species composition, total fauna density, and species richness of the infaunal community of the Project Area and the natural creeks were comparable within 3 years after construction of the Project Area. However, the sediments of the Project Area lacked the woody detrital cover, high peat content, and predominance of silt and clay characteristic of the natural creek sediments. There was no evidence of significant accretion of total organic carbon in the Project Area during the course of the study. This study has heuristically inspired four recommendations concerning assessment criteria of mitigation success. (1) Direct experimentation is needed to assess habitat function for motile species such as fish. (2) Studies of community structure need to be carried out long enough to permit testing of community stability, especially when working in areas exposed to stochastic abiotic and biotic stressors.

(4) Site design or restoration techniques should be included ill the experimental design of each mitigation effort. Specifically, the lack of replication in these aspects of the mitigation process limits the inferential potential of the study, constrains the ability to make accurate predictions about the probability of success of future mitigation endeavors, and impedes our understanding of the critical mechanisms governing successful habitat creation, restoration, and enhancement.

J	Coen, LD; Luckenbach, MW				Coen, LD; Luckenbach, MW			Developing success criteria and goals for evaluating oyster reef restoration: Ecological function or resource exploitation?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					Symposium on Goal Setting and Success Criteria for Coastal Habitat Restoration	JAN 13-15, 1998	CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA					Habitat restoration encompasses a broad range of activities, emphasizing very different issues, goals, and approaches depending on the operational definition of 'restoration'. This is particularly true for many shellfish (molluscan) dominated systems (e.g. oyster reefs, mussel beds, vermetid gastropod reefs). In contrast to other well-studied biogenic habitats, such as seagrasses, mangroves, or salt marshes, bivalves are directly consumed as a resource. Hence resource extraction has direct consequences for habitat health. Restoration objectives have typically included reduction of public health risks through improved water quality to increase harvest. Restoration or enhancement of populations of commercially exploited shellfish depressed by overharvesting and/or reduced environmental quality remains the principal motivation behind most shellfish 'restoration' efforts. Direct and indirect ecosystem services (e.g. filtering capacity, benthic-pelagic coupling, nutrient dynamics, sediment stabilization, provision of habitat, etc.) derived fi om oyster habitat have been largely ignored or underestimated. Only recently, the restoration of lost ecological function associated with shellfish communities has been included in our discussions and related research examining habitat development and function through a scientific approach. The former area has been reviewed extensively and will not be out focus here. In this review, we examine some of the restoration efforts made in the name of fisheries enhancement, address their effectiveness, and discuss some of the issues associated with realizing the broader goal of ecological restoration. We note the importance of linking success criteria to specific goals and make the case for. a gl cater need in clarifying the ecological functions of shellfish and shellfish habitats. We recognize the limitations of existing datasets and summarize ongoing attempts to address oyster habitat restoration throughout the broad geographic distribution of the American oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). In many ways this topic parallels the ongoing debate over 'attraction versus production' associated with artificial reef management. We consider how local conditions (e.g. tidal range, bottom topography, turbidity, salinity) and resulting habitat traits affect restoration strategies. We also discuss the underappreciated value of shellfish populations from those areas designated as closed to harvesting due to their intrinsic worth as habitat/larval reserves. The necessity of ecosystem (adaptive) management strategies emerges from this discussion. Finally, this overview supports our contention that shellfish habitat should be included in discussions of 'essential fish habitats' (or EFH). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Loehle, C				Loehle, C			Optimal control of spatially distributed process models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Increasingly, forest management practices are being evaluated from a watershed or landscape perspective. Currently, few tools are available for incorporating the impact of spatial patterns of management on spatially distributed dynamic processes, ii new algorithm is presented for scheduling that can maximize timber harvest while meeting spatial constraints. Beginning with a candidate list of stands available for harvest, the algorithm swaps stands that cause the most environmental impact with stands where less impact will occur. It then tries to add more stands for harvest if the swap has reduced landscape level impacts below the environmental restriction. This process repeats as long as swapping is successful. A test case demonstrated that the algorithm could minimize impact of timber harvest on an edge-sensitive bird species. In a second example using water quality (sediment production) restrictions, SWAP generated flexible buffers where width was determined by both clear cut size and landscape position variables. A third example tested the ability of SWAP to control storm runoff from a watershed. A simple watershed was simulated with peak flow the landscape attribute to be controlled. SWAP found a solution that controlled peak flow while maintaining high timber harvest levels. Stand selection based on rankings of stand impact on peak flow did not produce as good a result as SWAP. While the examples explored here are simplistic in their treatment of watershed and landscape factors, the algorithm is easily linked to more sophisticated simulation models.

J	Paradise, CJ				Paradise, CJ			Effects of pH and resources on a processing chain interaction in simulated treeholes	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Both resources and abiotic factors may affect biotic interactions. One interaction that occurs in treehole habitats involves leaf shredders that facilitate growth of detritivores, and it may be affected by both leaf litter quantity and changes in water quality. 2. Water chemistry in central Pennsylvania treeholes has been impacted by acid deposition, and the most common insects therein have differential survival under low pH conditions. Experimental microcosms that mimic treehole habitats were used to test the hypothesis that this abiotic factor, pH, also affects facilitative interactions. Leaf litter resources and pH were varied independently of presence of leaf-shredding scirtid beetles (Helodes pulchella and Prionocyphon discoideus), and the mosquito Aedes triseriatus, to examine interactions among pH, resources and insects. 3. pH affected the interaction between the insects, such that effects of scirtids were more evident at pH 4.5 than at 6.5. Female mosquitoes were larger in the presence of scirtids, low resource and low pH conditions than in absence of scirtids, low resource and low pH conditions. 4. There were also effects of A. triseriatus on scirtids. The size of individual scirtids was smaller in the presence of A. triseriatus, but total scirtid biomass was unaffected as survival was also higher in the presence of A. triseriatus. 5. The effects observed on a resource-mediated biotic interaction led to the conclusion that this interaction is pH dependent, and gives support to the concept that abiotic factors play a role in determining the outcome of biotic interactions, and that acidification can have complex effects on communities.																	0021-8790					JUL	2000	69	4					651	658		10.1046/j.1365-2656.2000.00423.x								WOS:000087841400008

The delineation of ecotones and environmental boundaries is therefore an important step in land-use management planning. The delineation of ecotones depends on the phenomenon of interest and the statistical methods used as well as the associated spatial and temporal resolution of the data available. In the context of delineating wetland and riparian ecosystems, various data types (field data, remotely sensed data) can be used to delineate ecotones. Methodological issues related to their detection need to be addressed, however, so that their management and monitoring can yield useful information about their dynamics and functional roles in ecosystems. The aim of this paper is to review boundary detection methods. Because the most appropriate methods to detect and characterize boundaries depend of the spatial resolution and the measurement type of the data, a wide range of approaches are presented: GIS, remote sensing and statistical ones.

J	Kennedy, TB; Merenlender, AM; Vinyard, GL				Kennedy, TB; Merenlender, AM; Vinyard, GL			A comparison of riparian condition and aquatic invertebrate community indices in central Nevada	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												The importance of maintaining healthy riparian communities to sustain natural stream processes and function is well documented. Land management agencies in the West are currently developing methods to assess and monitor riparian community condition to adapt land use practices that would better protect rangeland ecosystems. To determine whether these methods also provide an indication of abiotic and biotic stream condition, we compared the classification system of riparian communities developed by the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to physical parameters of stream condition and to aquatic invertebrate community assemblages. Thirty-three sites in 19 different streams of the Toiyabe Range in central Nevada were measured for water quality substrate characteristics, and fish abundance and diversity, We sampled aquatic invertebrates and calculated community indices based on environmental tolerance levels. taxonomic diversity; and abundance of sensitive taxa. USFS personnel classified these sites by dominant riparian plant community type (meadow, willow, or aspen) and ecological status (low, moderate, or high) using plant abundance data, rooting depth, and soil infiltration to determine similarities to potential natural communities. Riparian condition indices as well as community diversity were significantly correlated to proportions of fine and small-diameter substrate in streambeds. Accumulation of silt was significantly related to plant community type, with meadow sites expressing highest proportions. Further examinations indicated that 2 of 6 invertebrate community indices were significantly related to ecological status, with highest diversity levels occurring mainly in willow- and aspen-dominated sites in moderate ecological condition. Nevertheless, we show that several other environmental variables, including substrate characteristics, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and species richness of fish communities, were more strongly and consistently related to invertebrate assemblage patterns. Our results demonstrate that information on aquatic invertebrates and stream condition could augment the existing riparian classification system and provide useful monitoring tools to more thoroughly examine ecosystem health in rangelands.																	1527-0904	1944-8341				JUL	2000	60	3					255	272										WOS:000089030000003						
J	Wannamaker, CM; Rice, JA				Wannamaker, CM; Rice, JA			Effects of hypoxia on movements and behavior of selected estuarine organisms from the southeastern United States	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Hypoxia, or low dissolved oxygen, remains a common occurrence in estuarine waters as human activity in coastal areas expands. Fish kills, probably the most recognized indicator of these and other water quality problems, have significantly increased in recent years in many Southeastern United States estuaries. While entire aquatic communities are impacted by changes in available oxygen, estuarine organisms serve as appropriate indicators of these changes as they exhibit complex physiological and behavioral responses to hypoxia. The consequences of hypoxia for these species depend on their ability to detect and avoid areas of low dissolved oxygen. We conducted a series of two-way, replicated choice experiments with juvenile spot (Leiostomus xanthurus), pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides), croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), white mullet (Mugil curema), mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), and brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) to determine their ability to detect and avoid specific levels of hypoxia. Additional data on organisms' movement patterns, aquatic surface respiration, and ventilation rates were collected. All species tested could detect and avoid 1 mg l(-1) dissolved oxygen. The hypoxia avoidance response differed among species, as some species exhibited an avoidance threshold while others exhibited a graded avoidance response. These data supply baseline information necessary to assess how some mobile estuarine organisms respond behaviorally to oxygen concentrations, and to understand how hypoxia more broadly impacts fish populations and estuarine community health.

J	Knight, RL; Payne, VWE; Borer, RE; Clarke, RA; Pries, JH				Knight, RL; Payne, VWE; Borer, RE; Clarke, RA; Pries, JH			Constructed wetlands for livestock wastewater management	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In 1995, the Gulf of Mexico Program (GMP) sponsored efforts by the Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee and the National Council of the Pulp and Paper Industry for Air and Stream Improvement (NCASI) to conduct a review of the literature concerning the use of constructed wetlands for treating concentrated livestock wastewaters. The scope of the literature review and summary of design/operation data included all of North America. Both published and unpublished data have been provided by researchers to be included in the database. The database format used for the GMP project is only slightly modified from the format developed for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) North America Treatment Wetland Database, which includes information from municipal, industrial and stormwater treatment wetlands. The GMP Livestock Wastewater Treatment Wetland Database includes information from 68 sites with a total of 135 pilot and full-scale wetland systems (systems include parallel units at individual research facilities), Types of livestock wastewater being treated by constructed wetlands include dairy manure and milkhouse wash water, runoff from concentrated cattle-feeding operations, poultry manure, swine manure and catfish pond water. Over 1300 operational data records are summarized in the database. These data indicate that removal rates for 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and fecal coliforms are potentially very high in constructed wetlands receiving animal wastewaters. Average concentration reduction efficiencies were: BOD5 65%, TSS 53%, NH4-N 48%, TN 42%, and TP 42%. Removals are a function of inlet concentrations and hydraulic loading rates. Successful wetland design must include adequate pretreatment to protect the health of the wetland biota and must include adequate wetland area to meet the quality goals.

A potential exit pathway in constructed wetlands for detained water and possibly NO(3)(-)-N is via seepage through and under an earthen berm. The objective of this study was to determine if seepage was an important pathway for NO(3)(-)-N transport from two constructed wetlands receiving tile drainage from adjacent agricultural land (wetland A, surface area of 0.6 ha; wetland D, 0.78 ha). A mean apparent hydraulic conductivity (K) was calculated (10.8 cm h(-1), range 8.2-14.3 cm h(-1)) using empirical water budgets. Using Darcy's law, which included the apparent hydraulic conductivity, effective seepage area and daily hydraulic gradient measurements, daily seepage volumes for both wetlands were calculated for the 1997 water year. Total seepage volumes for wetlands A and D were 26 and 22 million liters, respectively, for the 1997 water year, which represented 47 and 27% of the total inlet flow. The amount of NO(3)(-)-N exiting wetlands A and D in seepage water was estimated to be 61 and 25 kg N, respectively, and represented 10 and 4% of the total inlet NO(3)(-)-N load. Seepage connected the wetland with the riparian buffer strip and transported NO(3)(-)-N to populations of denitrifiers deeper in the sediment profile and outside the wetland perimeter, thereby enhancing overall NO(3)(-)-N removal efficiencies.

Design parameters, required for designing a full-scale constructed wetland, were measured in vertical upflow columns with hydraulic residence times varying from 15 to 180 h. Secondary wastewater was pumped vertically upward through eleven soil columns, 1.5 m in length and 15 cm in diameter and influent and effluent concentrations of soluble phosphorus were monitored for up to 411 days. Greater than 80% removal (up to 96%) was observed in nine out of 11 columns and effluent concentrations of soluble phosphorus ranged from 0.14 to 0.50 mg/l (averaging 0.28 mg/l) when the residence time was > 40 h. Columns with a decreased residence time averaged 39% removal. A direct relationship between residence time and soluble phosphorus removal was established. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Silvert, W				Silvert, W			Fuzzy indices of environmental conditions	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING					INDEX Workshop on Environmental Indicatiors and Indices	JUL 10-14, 1998	ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA	INDEX				Fuzzy logic provides a powerful and convenient formalism for classifying environmental conditions and for describing both natural and anthropogenic changes. Whereas traditional indices are based either on crisp sets with discontinuous boundaries between them (e.g. pristine vs, polluted), or on continuous variables whose values are only meaningful to experts (such as so many ppm of a toxin), fuzzy sets make it possible to combine these approaches. Conceptually the use of fuzzy logic is simple (for example, one can describe a site as 20% pristine and 80% polluted), but the real power of the methodology comes from the ability to integrate different kinds of observations in a way that permits a good balance between favourable and unfavourable observations, and between incommensurable effects such as social, economic, and biological impacts. In addition, fuzzy logic can be used to classify and quantify environmental effects of a subjective nature, such as bad odours, and it even provides a formalism for dealing with missing data. The fuzzy memberships can be used as environmental indices, but it is also possibly to 'defuzzify' them and obtain a more traditional type of index. The fuzzy methodology is illustrated by examples based on research to evaluate of the effects of finfish mariculture on coastal zone water quality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In the future there will still be a need to develop guidelines for monitoring the trophic status of smaller lakes. Four small lakes were investigated by the author in the years 1996 and 1997. In order to define the nutrient charge of those lakes more precisely, special emphasis has been put upon the two criteria diatoms and macrophytes. Eventually an evaluation of the lakes' catchment areas will also be an important component of these studies. Benthic diatoms are the main part of periphyton. As unicellular fast reproducing organisms they are excellent indicators for trophic situations in lakes. The diatom index denotes the trophic status of the littoral zone during the last few weeks before sampling. The macrophytes, however, reflect the nutrient charge over a longer period, i.e. several years. The macrophyte index is based on the fact that some species are most prevalent at certain nutrient loads. The effort to combine these two indication systems carries a high resolution of spatial nutrient changes as well as in temporally changes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Boulton, AJ				Boulton, AJ			River ecosystem health down under: Assessing ecological condition in riverine groundwater zones in Australia	ECOSYSTEM HEALTH												Below many rivers and extending laterally beneath their banks lies a zone of saturated sediments-the hyporheic zone. This region is the site of dynamic exchanges of water and materials between the groundwater below, lateral alluvial aquifers, and the river flowing above. In this centrally located ecosystem component, the actions of the microbial biofilms coating the sediments are considered to act like a biological filter, enhancing water quality during the exchange process. However, the hyporheic zones in many rivers are threatened by siltation, toxicants and increasing acidity, physical extraction for gravel, or altered groundwater inputs through pumping. Current protocols to assess river health do not explicitly consider that of the hyporheic zone, despite its central role in many rivers. This oversight is due largely to the relative infancy of the discipline of hyporheic research, limited communication to river managers by ecologists, and technical difficulties in sampling the hyporheic zone. Ecosystem health assessments in rivers with potentially important hyporheic zones could include measurements of the extent of hydrological exchange between the river and the hyporheic zone at a range of scales, the rates of some key interstitial chemical processes, and perhaps the biodiversity of hyporheic invertebrates. In Australia, the potential of some of these measurements is being investigated, especially in relation to assessing the health of "groundwater-dependent ecosystems."																	1076-2825					JUN	2000	6	2					108	118		10.1046/j.1526-0992.2000.00011.x								WOS:000087945900005

Population growth and urban development have resulted in the use of the river for the discharge of mining, sewage, and industrial effluents. Despite considerable efforts to reverse the ecological impacts of these abuses, the river still suffers from continuing pollution from these sources. As a consequence, fish and macroinvertebrate fauna of the river remain restricted due to water quality problems. The macroinvertebrate fauna comprised only 12 taxonomic families and generally consisted of pollution-tolerant species with low species diversity. The fishery consisted of stocked brown trout and grayling, and there appeared to be little or no recruitment of these fishes through reproduction. Other native fishes occurred in low numbers.

J	Verb, RG; Vis, ML				Verb, RG; Vis, ML			Comparison of benthic diatom assemblages from streams draining abandoned and reclaimed coal mines and nonimpacted sites	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												We examined whether there was a particular group of diatoms specific to acid mine drainage (AMD) sites and/or reclaimed sites in streams in a coal-mining region of southeastern Ohio. Streams were initially placed into 5 categories: 1) stream receiving AMD from an unreclaimed site, 2) stream receiving drainage from a site reclaimed prior to a 1972 regulation, 3) stream receiving drainage from a site reclaimed between 1972 and 1982 under Ohio Revised Code (ORC) 1513, 4) stream receiving drainage from site reclaimed after 1982 under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) and 5) stream not impacted by AMD. The diatom flora from riffles in each system and environmental parameters (pH, conductance, metal concentrations [Al, Fe, Mn], current velocity, width, and depth) were examined to assess the recovery of reclamation sites from mining. Canonical correspondence analyses separated heavily impacted AMD streams from other sites. Total alkalinity and pH were highly correlated to the 1st axis, and SO4, average depth, and temperature were influential in additional axes. Discriminant analyses of the diatom and environmental data sets were successful in assigning samples into 1 of the a priori stream categories (85% and 81.8% accuracy, respectively). AMD streams were characterized by a dominant flora of Eunotia exigua and Frustulia rhomboides. Streams that fluctuated between acidic and circumneutral pH (termed oscillating) had greater abundances of Brachysira vitrea than other study streams. Streams of intermediate water quality (i.e., reclaimed sites) were dominated by Achnanthidium,,minutissimum. There was a predictable relationship between post-reclamation stream water quality and diatom assemblages, which may prove useful in assessment and management of reclamation efforts.																	0887-3593					JUN	2000	19	2					274	288		10.2307/1468070								WOS:000088106300006						
J	Da Costa, KS; Gourene, G; De Morais, LT; Van den Audenaerde, DFET				Da Costa, KS; Gourene, G; De Morais, LT; Van den Audenaerde, DFET			Fish populations in two West-African coastal rivers facing different agricultural and hydroelectric schemes	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												The relationship between fish species richness and water quality related variables are studied in the Agnebi and Bia rivers. Both are coastal rivers in eastern Cote d'Ivoire submitted to the impacts of small (Agnebi) and large (Bia) reservoirs. Up-stream fish species composition is similar in both rivers whereas it differs in the median and lower course, mainly due to the presence of the large dams of Ayame I and II. The presence of the dams on the river Bia explains the longitudinal gradient of species richness observed. Such gradient is much less effective in the Agnebi river where the small reservoirs are located to the upper-most part of the affluents of the river. Water quality is similar in both rivers. Yet the ordination of the water related variables by principal component analysis indicates a difference between the upper zone in the Agnebi and the median zone in the Bia river. Main discriminant factors are conductivity, total dissolved solids and hardness of water to a less extent. There was a reduced seasonal rhythmic variability in some water quality related variables, mainly nitrogen compounds and water temperature. A co-inertia analysis was performed to relate fish abundance and water quality variables. Fishes are distributed into five groups according to their affinities to specific water conditions.

Approximately 230 surveys were made with over 15,000 measurements of physico-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, salinity, conductivity, redox potential and tributaries water flow). Approximately 400 chemical analyses of the main nutrients as well as more than 1,000 observations on flora, fauna and sediment were made. The La Palme lagoon was found to be one of the rare oligotrophic Mediterranean lagoons with very good water quality. The measured parameters were found to follow a well-defined seasonal rhythm in spite of large absolute variations and inter-annual differences. In spite of heavy transformations in the last century, the catchment area as well as the entrance channel to the open sea remain relatively natural. Special observations on the karstic springs show that they have great influence on the water balance. Via the catchment area meteorological conditions directly and indirectly influence strongly the conditions inside the lagoon. The exchange with the open sea buffers the extreme amplitude of abiotic parameters inside the lagoon but the lagoon "character" seems to be determined by sediment and nutrient input from the catchment area. The Etang de La Palme could serve as an excellent example of spatio-temporal dynamics inside undisturbed oligotrophic coastal lagoons.																	0240-8759					JUN	2000	50	2					101	115										WOS:000089048400005						
J	Craft, CB; Casey, WP				Craft, CB; Casey, WP			Sediment and nutrient accumulation in floodplain and depressional freshwater wetlands of Georgia, USA	WETLANDS												Soil accretion, sediment deposition, and nutrient (N, P, organic C) accumulation were compared in floodplain and depressional freshwater wetlands of southwestern Georgia, USA to evaluate the role of riverine (2600 km(2) catchment) versus depressional (<10 km(2) catchment) wetlands as sinks for sediment and nutrients. Soil cores were collected from three floodplain (cypress-gum) and nine depressional (three each from cypress-gum forest, cypress-savannah, and herbaceous marsh) wetlands and analyzed for radionuclides ((CS)-C-137, Pb-210), bulk density, N, P, and organic C to quantify recent (30-year) and long-term (100-year) rates of sediment and nutrient accumulation. There was no significant difference in organic C, N, or sediment accumulation between depressional and floodplain wetlands. However, P accumulation was 1.5 to three times higher in the floodplain (0.12-0.75 g/m(2)/yr) than in the depressional wetlands (0.08-0.25 g/m(2)/yr). Sediment and nutrient accumulations were highly variable among depressional wetland types, more so than between depressional and floodplain wetlands. This variability likely is the result of differences in historical land use, hydrology, vegetation type, NPP, and perhaps fire frequency. Mean (n = 12) one-hundred-year rates of sediment deposition (1036 g/m(2)/yr), organic C (79 g/m(2)/yr), N (6.0 g/m(2)/yr), and P accumulation (0.38 g/m(2)/yr) were much higher than 30-year rates (sediment = 118 g/m(2)/yr, C = 20 g/m(2)/yr, N = 1.5 g/m(2)/yr, P = 0.09 g/m(2)/yr). Higher 100-year (Pb-210) Sediment and nutrient accumulations Likely reflect the greater numbers of farms, greater grazing by livestock, and the absence of environmentally sound agricultural practices in southwestern Georgia at the turn of the century. Our findings suggest that the degree of anthropogenic disturbance within the surrounding watershed regulates wetland sediment, organic C, and N accumulation. Phosphorus accumulation also is greater in floodplain wetlands that have large catchments containing fine textured (clay) sediments that are co-deposited with P.																	0277-5212					JUN	2000	20	2					323	332		10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020[0323:SANAIF]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000087748100009						
J	Jorgensen, BS; Syme, GJ				Jorgensen, BS; Syme, GJ			Protest responses and willingness to pay: attitude toward paying for stormwater pollution abatement	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												In contingent valuation (CV) surveys, there is often a proportion of individuals who are not willing to pay to obtain (avoid) an increase (decrease) in some attribute of a particular environmental public good. Some of these respondents might protest an aspect of the CV survey (e.g. payment vehicle) or the behavioral intention (i.e. willingness to pay, WTP) constituting the measure of economic value. Respondents' attitudes toward the behavior of paying for a particular public good may contribute to the decision to pay independent of other explanatory variables, such as the price of the intervention, household income, and methodological characteristics of the CV survey. Moreover, attitude toward paying for the good may manifest in protest responses as a reaction to higher prices and methodological factors (e.g. the payment vehicle). To the extent that protest beliefs are dependent on such matters of survey design, they may be alleviated through changes in CV methodology. However, to the extent that protest beliefs are a reaction to the act of paying, methodological remedies may not be effective. CV surveys of stormwater pollution abatement were conducted in four Australian state capital cities. The surveys differed with respect to the type of pollution abatement intervention, the payment regime, the vector of prices used in the dichotomous choice question, and the institution responsible for implementing the stormwater pollution intervention. Protest beliefs were measured for all respondents irrespective of their responses to the WTP question. Results indicated that attitude toward paying underpinned protest beliefs regarding the role of government in stormwater management and individual rights to unpolluted waterways. This attitude was present in each city sample despite methodological differences between the CV surveys. Attitude toward paying explained variability in WTP, and was a larger predictor than was price. Household income was significantly associated with attitude toward paying, and this relationship was also invariant over city samples. Protest beliefs were not independent of either the WTP question or demographic factors, such as household income. Rather, these beliefs were related to WTP through attitudes toward the act of paying for stormwater pollution abatement. Censoring protest responses in the present study would bias CV samples toward those individuals who an favorably disposed toward paying for environmental public goods and those from higher income households.

The illness, cryptosporidiosis, can be fatal to persons with compromised immune systems. At question is the potential for C. parvum in cattle fecal deposits on rangeland watersheds to contaminate surface water. First, C. parvum oocysts must be released from fecal deposits during rainfall, becoming available for transport. In 1996, we examined the transport of C. parvum oocysts in overland flow from fecal deposits under natural rainfall and rangeland conditions at the San Joaquin Experimental Range in Madera County, Calif. Our null hypothesis was that C. parvum oocysts are not released from fecal pats and transported 1 m downslope as overland flow with rainfall. Paired plots were located on 10, 20, and 30% slope sites. Each plot was loaded with four, 200 g fecal pats dosed with 10(5) oocysts g(-1). Fats were placed 1.0 m above the base of each plot. Composite runoff samples from each plot were analyzed for oocyst concentration following each of 4 storm events. Oocysts were transported during each storm. Slope was a significant factor in oocyst transport, with oocyst transport increasing with slope. Although not significant, there was an apparent flushing effect of oocysts across storms, with the majority transported in the first 2 storms. A pilot rainfall simulation experiment also revealed a flushing phenomenon from pats during individual rainfall events. C. parvum oocysts in fecal pats on rangeland can be transported from fecal deposits during rainfall events, becoming available for transport to water-bodies. Future studies need to examine surface and subsurface transport of oocysts on rangeland hillslopes for distances greater than 1 m.																	0022-409X					MAY	2000	53	3					295	299		10.2307/4003435								WOS:000088341100009						
J	Hakanson, L; Parparov, A; Hambright, KD				Hakanson, L; Parparov, A; Hambright, KD			Modelling the impact of water level fluctuations on water quality (suspended particulate matter) in Lake Kinneret, Israel	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A dynamic (time dependent) mathematical model of the monthly cycling of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in lakes with variable water levels has been developed. The model has been applied for the large subtropical Lake Kinneret (Israel), which has variable water levels related to domestic freshwater needs and climatological conditions. The main conclusions from this work are: 1. Uncertainty analyses (Monte Carlo simulations) have shown that the two most important model uncertainties concern sedimentation and erosion related to a lowering of the wave base ( = the water depth separating areas where discontinuous and continuous sedimentation of fine matter occurs). The best way to improve the reliability of the mean monthly SPM-predictions would be to improve the modelling parts related to sedimentation and a lowering of the wave base. All other processes are of less importance for the SPM-predictions (e.g. inflow, outflow, primary production, resuspension, mineralization and mixing). 2. A successive, gradual lowering of the wave base seems to correspond to the 'worst case' scenario likely to alter SPM-values the most. 3. In the 'worst case' scenario, very high levels of SPM may be maintained for a long time (>10 years), which would likely cause serious changes to the Lake Kinneret ecosystem. These results indicate the existence of a narrow threshold range of artificial changes of lake morphometry (water level lowering of about 4-5 m from the maximum water level), which may cause significant deterioration of water quality in Lake Kinneret.

Approaches are adapted to specific geographic, political, and cultural needs of each member nation. In Malaysia, the Department of Fisheries Malaysia, FAO, and the Bay of Bengal Program have been working together in the design and implementation of a Special Area Management (SAM) approach to address the issues facing the Pulau Payar Marine Park along the west coast of Malaysia. Early results of the scientific work have assisted in achieving the SAM project objectives. For example, science applied in the project helped participants to view the issues objectively, to gauge the effectiveness of past management actions, and to guide decisions on future actions. Important success stories of the SAM project discussed in the paper include: (1) Pulau Payar Marine Park appears to be succeeding at what it set out to do (i.e., sustain or enhance fisheries productivity); (2) "unmanaged tourism" seems to have greater adverse impact than previous fisheries practices; (3) it is possible to identify and promote tourist activities that reduce or eliminate harm to coral reefs; (4) the ground has been laid to tackle the infrastructure and development-related issues identified through the multi-sectoral SAM process as having major impacts on both water quality and coral reefs; and (5) multisectoral and scientific input can be successfully sought and incorporated to identify issues for management attention and decision making.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				APR	2000	10	2					386	396		10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0386:SCAMIA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000086008300006						
J	Clements, WH; Carlisle, DM; Lazorchak, JM; Johnson, PC				Clements, WH; Carlisle, DM; Lazorchak, JM; Johnson, PC			Heavy metals structure benthic communities in Colorado mountain streams	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The development of held sampling designs that employ multiple reference and polluted sites has been proposed as an alternative to the traditional upstream vs, downstream approach used in most biomonitoring studies. Spatially extensive monitoring programs can characterize ecological conditions within an ecoregion and provide the necessary background information to evaluate future changes in water quality. We measured physicochemical characteristics, heavy-metal concentrations, and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure at 95 sites in the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion in Colorado, USA. Most sites (82%) were selected using a systematic, randomized sampling design. Each site was placed into one of four metal categories (background, low, medium, and high metals), based on the cumulative criterion unit (CCU), which we defined as the ratio of the instream metal concentration to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criterion concentration, summed for all metals measured. A CCU of 1.0 represents a conservative estimate of: the total metal concentration that, when exceeded, is likely td cause harm to aquatic organisms. Although the CCU was less than 2.0 at most (66.3%) of the sites, values exceeded 10.0 at 13 highly polluted stations. Differences among metal categories were highly significant for most measures of macroinvertebrate abundance and all measures of species richness. We observed the greatest effects on several species of heptageniid mayflies (Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae), which were highly sensitive to heavy metals and were reduced by >75% at moderately polluted stations. The influence of taxonomic aggregation on responses to metals was also greatest for mayflies. In general, total abundance of mayflies and abundance of heptageniids were better indicators of metal pollution than abundance of dominant mayfly taxa. We used stepwise multiple-regression analyses to investigate the relationship between benthic community measures and physicochemical characteristics at the 78 randomly selected sites. Heavy-metal concentration was the most important predictor of benthic community structure at these sites. Because of the ubiquitous distribution of heavy-metal pollution in the Southern Rocky Mountain ecoregion, we conclude that potential effects of heavy metals should be considered when investigating large-scale spatial patterns of benthic macroinvertebrate communities in Colorado's mountain streams.

Based on up to 30 years of experimental and monitoring data, the outflow, N, and P exported from this Pennsylvania watershed is examined in terms of critical source areas. Most of the surface runoff and P export occurs from areas near the stream. About 90% of the algal-available P exported in outflow was generated during the largest 7 storms/year. In contrast, nearly all the nitrate (NO3) exported originated as subsurface flow entering the soil or ground water some distance from the stream, acid mostly occurred during nonstorm flow periods. The NO3 export observed over the long term corresponds to the N excess computed by N balance obtained by farmer survey for agricultural land. By combining land use, hydrologic processes; watershed position, soil P status, and N balance information for agricultural land, the major source areas for P and N are predictable and identifiable. We apply these ideas and techniques to our research watershed and present the results as an example of this approach. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Norton, MM; Fisher, TR				Norton, MM; Fisher, TR			The effects of forest on stream water quality in two coastal plain watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					Joint Conference of the 7th Stockholm Water Symposium / 3rd International Conference on the Environmental Management of Enclosed Coastal Seas (EMECS)	AUG 10-15, 1997	STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN					Forest had varying effects on stream nutrients in two coastal plain basins of the Delmarva Peninsula, USA. In the Choptank basin, forest was strongly associated with low stream total nitrogen (TN) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations (r(2) similar to 0.70), and forest placement along first order streams was important in maintaining low stream nitrogen (N) concentrations (r(2) similar to 0.35). In addition, a multiple regression model explained similar to 40% of the stream total phosphorus (TP) variance and indicated that forest directly adjacent to streams (0-100 m) acted as a TP source and forest further away (100-300 m) from streams acted as a TP sink. In contrast, stream nutrients in the nearby Chester basin demonstrated a strong relationship with soil hydrologic properties. Forest had no significant effect on stream N and P because the finer-textured soils, higher stream slopes, and higher runoff potential of the Chester basin appeared to result in less baseflow compared to that in the Choptank basin. This reduced the opportunity for forest to intercept N via plant uptake and denitrification in the high runoff potential soils of the Chester basin. The high percentage of stormflow (40%) coupled with high stream slopes resulted in high soil erosion potential, which may explain the higher TP stream concentrations measured in the Chester compared to that in the Choptank. Differences in the hydrologic pathway appear to explain the different effects of forest on water quality in these two basins. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The appearance of strongly elevated concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in major European rivers was found to be primarily a post-war phenomenon. However. the relatively rapid water quality response to increased point source emissions and intensified agriculture does not imply that the reaction to decreased emissions will be equally rapid. Long-term fertilisation experiments have shown that important processes in the large-scale turnover of nitrogen operate on a time scale of decades up to at least a century, and in several major Eastern European rivers there is a remarkable lack of response to the dramatic decrease in the use of commercial fertilisers that started in the late 1980s. In Western Europe, studies of decreased phosphorus emissions have shown that riverine loads of this element can be rapidly reduced from high to moderate levels, whereas a further reduction, if achieved at all, may take decades. Together, the reviewed studies showed that the inertia of the systems that control the loss of nutrients from land to sea was underestimated when the present goal of a 50% reduction of the input of nutrients to the Baltic Sea and the North Sea was adopted.

Nonpoint pollution control activities in rural areas of Poland are insufficient to meet the demands of the recovering agricultural production. There is still a need for agricultural runoff monitoring programs for identification, quantification and control of nonpoint sources. Special efforts are required to familiarise farmers with environmental friendly agricultural production technologies and 'good agricultural practices'. This paper describes typical nonpoint sources from Polish agriculture. It presents all these activities and achievement in nonpoint pollution control after 1989, when systemic changes began and environmental problems became more visible. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Mander, U; Kull, A; Kuusemets, V				Mander, U; Kull, A; Kuusemets, V			Nutrient flows and land use change in a rural catchment: a modelling approach	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Due largely to unprecedented land-use changes in the Porijogi River catchment (southern Estonia) losses of nutrients and organic matter have decreased significantly. During the period 1987-1997 abandoned lands increased from 1.7 to 10.5% and arable lands decreased from 41.8 to 23.9%. At the same time, the runoff of total-N, total-P, SO4 and organic matter (after BOD5) decreased from 25.9 to 5.1, 0.32 to 0.13, 78 to 48, and 7.4 to 3.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. The most significant decreases occurred in agricultural subcatchments while the changes were insignificant in the forested upper course catchment. A simple empirical model which incorporates land-use pattern, fertilization intensity, soil parameters and water discharge accurately described the variations of total-N and total-P runoff in both the whole catchment and its agricultural subcatchments (R-2 varies from 0.95-0.99 for N to 0.49-0.93 for P). In small agricultural subcatchments the rate of fertilization is found the most important factor for nitrogen runoff, whereas in larger mosaic watersheds land use pattern plays the main role. Seven alternative scenarios compiled on the base of the empirical model allow to forecast potential nitrogen and phosphorus losses from the catchment. This information can be used in further landscape and regional planning of the whole region.

The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978 is a binational instrument designed by the governments of the United States and Canada to respond to this injury through the development and implementation of common water quality objectives, cooperative regulatory programs, and other measures. The implementation of the Great Lakes Wa ter Quality Agreement has entered a critical phase because the ambiguously drafted purpose is interpreted differently by toxicologists and ecologists with consequent misunderstandings in preparing Remedial Action Plans and Lakewide Management Plans, selecting indicators of restoration, and selecting critical pollutants. With shrinking budgets, agencies cannot afford such misunderstandings when injury to health and property continues unabated.																	1076-2825					MAR	2000	6	1					24	38		10.1046/j.1526-0992.2000.00003.x								WOS:000086283200006						
J	Brown, LR				Brown, LR			Fish communities and their associations with environmental variables, lower San Joaquin River drainage, California	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Twenty sites in the lower San Joaquin River drainage, California, were sampled from 1993 to 1995 to characterize fish communities and their associations with measures of water quality and habitat quality. The feasibility of developing an Index of Biotic Integrity was assessed by evaluating four fish community metrics, including percentages of native fish, omnivorous fish, fish intolerant of environmental degradation, and fish with external anomalies. Of the thirty-one taxa of fish captured during the study, only 10 taxa were native to the drainage. Multivariate analyses of percentage data identified four site groups characterized by different groups of species. The distributions of fish species were related to specific conductance, gradient, and mean depth; however, specific conductance acted as a surrogate variable for a large group of correlated variables. Two of the fish community metrics - percentage of introduced fish and percentage of intolerant fish - appeared to be responsive to environmental quality but the responses of the other two metrics - percentage of omnivorous fish and percentage of fish with anomalies - were less direct. The conclusion of the study is that fish communities are responsive to environmental conditions, including conditions associated with human-caused disturbances, particularly agriculture and water development. The results suggest that changes in water management and water quality could result in changes in species distributions. Balancing the costs and benefits of such changes poses a considerable challenge to resource managers.																	0378-1909					MAR	2000	57	3					251	269		10.1023/A:1007660914155								WOS:000085462400002

Palaeolimnological analyses of fossil diatoms and pigments were conducted in four lakes of the Qu'Appelle Valley, Saskatchewan, Canada, to quantify the effect of upstream depositional basins on lake response to urban and agricultural human activities. Pasqua, Echo, Mission and Katepwa lakes exhibit similar modern limnological characteristics, lie sequentially downstream from urban point sources of growth-limiting nitrogen (N), yet drain similarly large areas of farmland (38-40 x 10(3) km(2)). 2. Analyses indicated that all lakes were naturally productive, contained eutrophic diatoms (i.e. Stephanodiscus niagarae, S. hantzchii, S. parvus and Aulacoseira granulata), and supported blooms of colonial (as myxoxanthophyll) and potentially toxic N-fixing cyanobacteria (aphanizophyll), even prior to the onset of European settlement (ca. 1890) and urban development ten (ca. 1930). 3. The onset of agricultural practices ca. 1890 had only modest effects on algal communities in the Qu'Appelle lakes, with subtle increases in eutrophic diatom species (Pasqua, Mission and Katepwa lakes) and 25-50% increases in pigment-inferred algal abundance (Echo, Mission and Katepwa lakes). 4. Despite naturally high production, total algal abundance (beta-carotene) in upstream Pasqua Lake increased by more than 350% after intense urbanization beginning ca. 1930, while eutrophic diatoms became more common and cyanobacteria populations increased ten-fold. Principal components analysis (PCA) explained 64% of diatom variance, and identified three eras corresponding to baseline, pre-agricultural communities (1776-1890), an era of high production (ca. 1925-1960) and recent variable community composition following tertiary treatment of urban sewage (ca. 1977-1990). 5. Analyses of three downstream lakes demonstrated that urban impacts following 1930 remained evident in fossil profiles of beta-carotene and myxoxanthophyll, but that large blooms of N-fixing cyanobacteria were restricted to the past 25 years at downstream Mission and Katepwa lakes. Similarly, PCA showed that fossil diatom assemblages exhibited little directional variation until the 1970s. 6. Together, these analyses support the hypothesis that upstream lakes were effective at reducing the impacts of point-source urban nutrients on downstream lakes. In contrast, diffuse agricultural activities had only limited impacts on water quality and these were less well ameliorated by upstream basins.

We compared aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages among stream segments within continuously grazed pastures, intensive rotationally grazed pastures, undisturbed grassy vegetative buffer strips, and undisturbed woody vegetative buffer strips. We collected macroinvertebrate and stream sedimentation data from four streams in each land use category in two consecutive years. In an attempt to account for inherent watershed variability among streams, we represented watershed condition with a sample collected upstream of each treatment reach. Watershed condition tended to have greater influence on macroinvertebrate measures than local riparian land use. However, local riparian land use influences were apparent if watershed condition was statistically accounted for with analysis of covariance. Stream reaches with intensive rotational grazing tended to have macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics intermediate of the buffer and continuously grazed reaches. Although we detected some differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages that apparently reflected very local land use, our results suggest the macroinvertebrates were mostly responding to large-scale watershed influences.																	0270-5060					MAR	2000	15	1					93	106		10.1080/02705060.2000.9663725								WOS:000085508000010

Relationships with TN and TP were sufficiently strong to develop weighted-averaging (WA) regression-calibration models for inferring stream water concentrations of these nutrients. The models were accurate within +/-2.4 mu g/L for TP (apparent r(2) = 0.52) and +/-2 mg/L for TN (apparent r(2) = 0.53). An evaluation of the goodness of fit of these models with and without bootstrapping indicated that they performed better (bootstrapped r(2) = 0.44 for TP and bootstrapped r(2) = 0.42 for TN) than published TN and TP inference models for which similar assessments were made. Based on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development eutrophication ratings, the TP model predicted 76% of the mesotrophic and 57% of the eutrophic samples correctly. The model correctly predicted only 20% and 33%, respectively of oligotrophic and hypereutrophic samples. WA inference models were improved when seasonal variation was removed by using mean summer water quality and diatom data (apparent r(2) = 0.76 and bootstrapped r(2) = 0.61 for TP; apparent r(2) = 0.82 and bootstrapped r(2) = 0.70 for TN). Overall, rye conclude that epilithic diatoms can be related to TN and TF using these methods, and that WA inference models have utility for indicating eutrophication in southern Ontario lowland streams.																	0887-3593					MAR	2000	19	1					32	49		10.2307/1468280								WOS:000087205700003

The 10 metrics and the PIBI were correlated with 27 chemical, 12 physical habitat, and 3 landscape variables. Overalls PIBI was inversely correlated with stream depth, stream water color, and Fe. Component metrics were significantly correlated with several chemical (Al, acid neutralizing capacity, Cl, Fe,Mn, N, Na, P, pH, Si, SO4 total suspended solids), physical habitat (channel embeddedness, riparian disturbances, stream depth stream width, substrate composition), and landscape (% of the watershed in forest, agriculture and urban land uses) variables. Canonical correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between the 10 PIBI metrics and 4 significant environmental gradients related to general human disturbances (stream acidity, stream substrate composition, and stream and riparian habitat). Analysis of variance revealed significant differences in PIBI scores for lowland vs highland streams, and among stream orders. Annual differences were explained by differences in the proportions of sampling sites in lowland streams in each year. The univariate distribution of PIBI scores was used to set threshold PIBI values for the assessment of ecological condition in Mid-Appalachian streams.

The study had 3 objectives: 1) to evaluate the validity of aggregating reference site data into a single bioregion, 2) to select biological metrics that best discriminated reference sites from sites impaired by habitat disturbance and organic pollution and 3) to combine these metrics into an index of biological quality. Macroinvertebrate, physical habitat, and water-quality data were collected in 106 streams during autumn 1995. Fifty-five sites were reference, 34 sites had habitat stresses, and 17 sites had water-quality stresses. Classification of reference sites divided the coastal plain into 3 bioregions, separated north and south by Chesapeake Bay and separated east and west by ecoregion. Five metrics were effective at discriminating impairment: number of taxa, number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa, % Ephemeroptera, Hilsenhoff Biotic Index and % clinger mode of existence. An aggregated index, the Coastal Plain Macroinvertebrate Index (CPMI), was developed using these metrics. The CPMI accurately identified 86% of impaired sites. The precision of CPMI scores was estimated to be +/-10% (3 scoring units out of 30) at the 90% confidence interval. The CPMI accurately assigned both habitat disturbance and waterquality impairment indicating a similar degree of ecological impact from these 2 stressors. Guidance is provided for applying the CPMI to other macroinvertebrate data sees in the region.																	0887-3593					MAR	2000	19	1					128	144		10.2307/1468286								WOS:000087205700009						
J	Blahnik, T; Day, J				Blahnik, T; Day, J			The effects of varied hydraulic and nutrient loading rates on water quality and hydrologic distributions in a natural forested treatment wetland	WETLANDS												Hydrology and water quality distributions in a Louisiana forested waste-water treatment wetland were studied under four different hydraulic loading rates (HLR). Pond discharge, surface-water elevations, and fluorescent dye travel times were recorded to assess surface-water hydrology, and water samples were collected for nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and suspended solids analyses. Wetted surface area increased with pond discharge rate, and 58 to 66 percent of surface-water flow was concentrated in shallow channels covering only 10 to 12 percent of the total study area. Water residence times were much longer (0.9 to 1.1 days) than minimum dye travel times (2 to 3 hours) through the 4-hectare study area. Relative to study area influent concentrations, study area outflow concentrations of nitrate and total and organic suspended solids were lower, ammonium was higher, and phosphate was generally unchanged. However, there was an increase in concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate within 50 m of the study area inflow location. Ammonium and phosphate did decrease from these peak concentrations. Net nitrate production was observed within 50 m of the pond outfall and was probably due to nitrification. Net nitrate removal was observed beyond this distance and ranged up to 0.10 . g . m(-2) . d(-1) probably due primarily to denitrification. In general, nitrate removal rates increased linearly with changes in nitrate loading rates. Results show that nutrient distributions are linked to hydrology. Higher pond discharge rates created more treatment surface area, and higher constituent loading rates produced higher removal rates. Therefore, discharge rates could be manipulated, and physical control structures could be installed to increase wetted surface area and increase removal efficiency within the wetland. Higher loading rates could then be processed without requiring significant increases in treatment area.																	0277-5212					MAR	2000	20	1					48	61		10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020[0048:TEOVHA]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000086162200005						
J	Sun, G; Riekerk, H; Kornhak, LV				Sun, G; Riekerk, H; Kornhak, LV			Ground-water-table rise after forest harvesting on cypress-pine flatwoods in Florida	WETLANDS												Forest removal represents one of the large-scale ecosystem disturbances that concern water quality degradation, species composition change, and wildlife habitat alteration along the Florida coast. We conducted a five-year study with the objective to address effects of two forest management scenarios on the water regimes of cypress-pine flatwoods ecosystems in the lower coastal plain. Three experimental blocks (16-21 ha) were used in this study, with one representing control (C), one wetlands-harvest-only (W), and one wetlands + uplands harvest (ALL). Within the center of each block, a representative cypress wetland and its surrounding pine upland were extensively instrumented to quantify the changes of each hydrologic variable induced by tree removal. Water levels in cypress wetlands in both treatment areas were significantly elevated about 32-41 cm on average, and outflow doubled in the five-month dry period immediately following the tree harvesting. The ground-water table in the upland was also raised by about 29 cm on average due to ALL, but it was not affected significantly during the entire post-treatment period by W. During wet periods, the: treatment effects for both wetlands and uplands were not significant. Causes for spatial and temporal variability of hydrologic responses to forest harvesting are speculated to be 1) total evapotranspiration does not change significantly in flatwoods after tree removal during wet seasons; 2) specific yield of the flatwoods soils is variable in time and space; and 3) lateral water movement from uplands to wetlands. From this study, we conclude that harvesting both uplands and wetlands causes greater response than harvesting wetlands only. The impacts lasted for more than two years but were most pronounced only in the dry periods. Temporal and spatial variations of each hydrologic component should be considered in evaluating the hydrologic impact of forest management on the flatwoods landscape.																	0277-5212					MAR	2000	20	1					101	112		10.1672/0277-5212(2000)020[0101:GWTRAF]2.0.CO;2								WOS:000086162200010

Learning to manage such systems to minimize water quality impacts is essential for the environmental and economic sustainability of these types of animal production systems. Management intensive grazing is a grazing system in which animals at a high stocking density are rotated through several paddocks at short time intervals (12-24 h) so that animal performance is maximized. Although MIG has the potential to increase dairy farm profitability in the northeast US, recent work in this region has shown that a substantial amount of N applied as fertilizer is leached below the root zone of orchardgrass (Dactyls glomerata L., (cv.) 'Pennlate') managed as an intensive pasture. How much N is leached from other forage species managed as intensive pasture under the climatic conditions of the northeast US is not known. A field study was conducted using large drainage lysimeters to measure NO3-N leaching loss from six pasture swards: orchardgrass + N, orchardgrass + alfalfa (Medicago sativa L., (cv.) Alfagraze), orchardgrass + Ladino type white clover (Trifolium repens L.), Ryegrass (Lolium perrene L, (cv.) Citadel) + N, ryegrass + alfalfa, and ryegrass + white clover. The study site was located in central Pennsylvania on a Hagerstown silt loam soil (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf). Nitrate-N leaching losses were most consistent under N fertilized swards where the amount of N could be adjusted for yearly weather conditions. In a drought year, NO3-N leaching increased dramatically in swards containing alfalfa or white clover. Sward type and stocking density need to be taken into consideration when developing an animal production system that will be both environmentally and economically sustainable.

J	Uri, ND				Uri, ND			Perceptions on the use of no-till farming in production agriculture in the United States: an analysis of survey results	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												A number of economic and environmental benefits are associated with the use of no-till in production agriculture in the United States. There are lower labor, energy, and machinery costs associated with no-till farming relative to conventional tillage systems and other types of conservation tillage. Reduced erosion and runoff associated with no-till also lead to a number of environmental benefits, including a reduction in water quality impairment. The objective of this study is to assess farmers perception of their actual use of no-till. An analysis of the Agricultural Resource Management Study survey data for 1996 shows that for soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), spring wheat, and durum wheat, farmers' perceptions are consistent with reality. In the case of corn (Zea mays L.), however, nearly 18% of corn farmers believe they are using no-till, while in actuality, only slightly more than 12% are using this tillage system. In order to properly associate the benefits of no-till with its use, it is important that farmers' perception of what constitutes no-till and their actual use of no-till be consistent.

A simulated normal distribution was developed for nitrate concentrations, based on the information derived from two data sets. The first one is characteristic of oligotrophic conditions, and the second of eutrophic conditions. The distribution parameters were calculated from the raw data without distorting their information by applying transformations or any other drastic data manipulation. A standard normal distribution was derived and was evaluated in a case study. The proposed distribution can be used to define eutrophication scales, assign critical values, and test any nitrate concentration data for the evaluation of the trophic conditions of the area in which they were collected.																	1051-0761					FEB	2000	10	1					303	309										WOS:000085108400024						
J	Werner, TM; Kadlec, RH				Werner, TM; Kadlec, RH			Stochastic simulation of partially-mixed, event-driven treatment wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Simulated rain events and runoff produce a more realistic influent to a stormwater treatment wetland than do an averaged inlet flow and concentration. Network flow models provide a more realistic prediction of a treatment wetland's internal flows than does a plug flow or complete mixing estimation. Therefore, a combination of simulated rain events and a partial mixing model was chosen to produce realistic and descriptive predictions of treatment wetland function. The internal flow and mixing of the wetland was modeled using the network model ZDM. First-order pollutant removal was added to the hydraulic model, and the combination was calibrated to experimental nitrate data from Des Plaines River Wetland Demonstration Project wetland EWC1. Rainfall probability distributions were used in Monte Carlo simulations, and coupled with simple pollutant deposition and runoff from a watershed, to provide varying concentrations and flows into a wetland. The model was then combined with the variable rain and inlet flows produced by the Monte Carlo simulation, to provide predictions of the expected performance of a treatment wetland for nitrate reduction. The results of the simulation contain more detail than a time averaged model, which predicts only flowrate and concentration. The simulations produced such averages, but they also produced cumulative frequency distributions of anticipated exit concentrations. Using the ZDM model, an equation was developed to estimate the average conversion provided by a treatment wetland. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Models of ecological half-life may be valuable and cost-effective predictive tools for authorities setting restrictions on human consumption of freshwater fish after environmental releases of radioactivity. This work aimed to validate such a model for radioactive caesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137) in brown trout Salmo trutta populations. Data were drawn from lakes with a wide variability in abiotic and biotic factors and initial caesium load. 2. In Norway, the highest fallout (more than 150 kBq m(-2) of Cs-137) from the Chernobyl accident occurred in Oppland county, in south central Norway. Radioactivity was measured in more than 1800 samples of brown trout in nearly 100 localities in this region during 1986-95. 3. The back-calculated maximum initial radioactivity on 1 January 1987 showed a strong regional variability (range 443-13 370; average 3855 Bq kg(-1)). Large variation in initial radioactivity was also recorded on a local scale (within 50 km). 4. The ecological half-life model for caesium in brown trout populations for 1987-94/95 gave a close fit to real data from all localities with sufficient time series. Predicted half-lives ranged from 1.2 to 4.2 years (average 2.5) but 95% confidence limits were narrow (2.7 and 2.3 years). 5. The overall variability in radioactivity levels over time was almost entirely related to the initial load and, with few exceptions, 88% of the changes in radioactivity was explained by the simple regression model. Modest variability in ecological half-life was not correlated with initial activity, and no clear effects of water quality or season could be detected. For most lakes, levels of radioactivity in brown trout appeared to be predictable, with high accuracy after a fallout event, without extensive information on population ecology and water quality. However, more detailed work may be required to assess patterns within individual lakes.

J	Goossen, M; Langers, F				Goossen, M; Langers, F			Assessing quality of rural areas in the Netherlands: finding the most important indicators for recreation	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Quality is a major topic in most Western societies, not only for products, but also for land. This is especially true in the Netherlands, a country with 15.6 million people living on 33 900 km(2) of land, with a huge demand for land for agriculture, urban development, nature, infrastructure, recreation, etc. The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Fishery has asked the Winand Staring Centre to find out if it is possible to measure the quality of rural areas for recreational purposes. In a survey about quality, it is important to interview the recreationists themselves. So, in-home interviews were made with cyclists, walkers, swimmers, sailors and fishermen. The survey tried to assess the relative importance of some quality indicators of rural areas for recreational purposes. Dutch researchers usually divide quality into utilisation quality and perception quality. Utilisation quality is defined as fitness for use, while perception quality is that quality of the environment which people notice or experience (such as the beauty of the landscape or tranquillity) when they engage in recreational activities. Tranquillity, accessibility, water quality and nuisance value were the most important quality indicators. On the basis of the importance of some quality indicators, maps were prepared showing the attractiveness of various areas in the Netherlands for swimming and cycling, as an example what can be done with the results. It was found that 75% of the swimming locations were quite attractive or even extremely attractive. About 12% of the rural areas were good for cycling, and 56% were reasonable.

B	Merrill, JZ; Cornwell, JC		Weinstein, MP; Kreeger, DA		Merrill, JZ; Cornwell, JC			The role of oligohaline marshes in estuarine nutrient cycling	CONCEPTS AND CONTROVERSIES IN TIDAL MARSH ECOLOGY					Meeting on Concepts and Controversies in Tidal Marsh Ecology	APR, 1998	VINELAND, NJ					Oligohaline marshes, poised at the land-sea margin, often occur where the estuary is most enriched in inorganic particles and nutrients. Although light can limit the production of planktonic communities, high nutrient concentrations and regular tidal inundation results in highly productive macrophyte and algal communities. Despite potentially important water quality values, relatively few detailed studies of N and P cycling in oligohaline marshes are evident in the literature. Because of the temporal variability in marsh flux studies, the net annual retention of N and P is best assessed by measurement ofN and P burial in the sediment. In the Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries and subestuaries, high rates of tidal marsh N and P burial indicate an important water quality function. A recent study shows the marshes of a Chesapeake Bay tributary retain a large portion of nitrogen and phosphorus entering the river from above the fall line. The marshes trap 35% of the nitrogen and 81% of the phosphorus which would otherwise be recycled, exported, or buried in the subtidal sediments of the estuary. Although there are few studies, high nitrate supply rates, potentially high nitrification rates, and high rates of sediment metabolism can result in high rates of denitrification. More complete studies of tidal marsh nutrient cycling, particularly nitrogen cycling, are needed for a better understanding of the importance of these tidal freshwater marshes to estuarine nutrient balances. Alternative methodologies for denitrification measurement are needed for more accurate measurements, and more attention needs to be paid to scaling individual measurements to whole marsh ecosystems. A new method for the measurement of net N-2(g) exchange was applied to a Chesapeake Bay tributary to develop an annual estimate of net denitrification in the marsh sediments. Denitrification rates were similar to 60 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) with high seasonal variability. Annual calculations were made based on a loose correlation to annual ambient nitrate concentrations. This preliminary calculation suggests that an additional 10% of the fall line nitrogen may be removed by such marsh systems. More measurements of net N-2(g) exchange and computer simulation models are required to determine the net removal of fall line nitrogen by the upper estuarine marshes.

J	Sartoris, JJ; Thullen, JS; Barber, LB; Salas, DE				Sartoris, JJ; Thullen, JS; Barber, LB; Salas, DE			Investigation of nitrogen transformations in a southern California constructed wastewater treatment wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A 9.9-ha combined habitat and wastewater treatment demonstration wetland was constructed and planted in the summer of 1994, at Eastern Municipal Water District's (EMWD) Hemet/San Jacinto Regional Water Reclamation Facility (RWRF) in southern California. From January 1996 through September 1997, the marsh-pond-marsh wetland system was operated to polish an average of 3785 m(3) d(-1) (1 x 10(6) gal day(-1)) of secondary-treated effluent from the RWRF. Nitrogen removal was a major objective of this wetland treatment. Weekly inflow/outflow water quality monitoring of the wetland was supplemented with biannual, 45-station synoptic surveys within the system to determine internal distribution patterns of the nitrogen species (total ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and organic nitrogen), total organic carbon (TOC), and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254). Synoptic surveys were carried out during May 22 and September 17, 1996, and May 6 and September 25, 1997 and the results were mapped using the ARC/INFO processing package and inverse distance weighted mathematical techniques. Distribution patterns of the various nitrogen species, TOC, and UV254 within the wetland indicate that the nitrogen dynamics of the system are influenced both by variations in treatment plant loading, and, increasingly, by the degree of coverage and maturity of the emergent vegetation.

J	Nairn, RW; Mitsch, WJ				Nairn, RW; Mitsch, WJ			Phosphorus removal in created wetland ponds receiving river overflow	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality changes and biogeochemical development were evaluated over 2 years in two newly created freshwater riparian wetland ponds (1 ha each) in an agricultural and urban watershed. Both wetlands received pumped river water and had similar hydrologic regimes. One wetland was planted with 13 species of vegetation typical of Midwestern US marshes; the other received no planted vegetation. Water quality sampling was conducted weekly and detailed hydrologic budgets were developed from data collected twice daily. Hydrologic budgets were dominated by pumped surface flows (mean inflow = 1480 m(3) day(-1)). Two floods accounted for 32% of inflow in 1 year. Both wetlands significantly decreased turbidity (62 to 27 NTU) and increased dissolved oxygen (9-11 mg l(-1)). Inflow dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (17 +/- 3 and 169 +/- 11 mu g P l(-1)) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than outflow concentrations (DRP: 5 +/- 1 and 6 +/- 1 mu g P l(-1); TP: 69 +/- 8 and 74 +/- 9 mu g P l(-1)) for planted and unplanted wetlands, respectively. Phosphorus removal was related to decreases in turbidity and the level of biological activity. Extensive and highly productive algal coverage in both wetlands and the subsequent deposition and decomposition of the algal mat influenced P retention through biological uptake and chemical sorption and coprecipitation. Mean removal rates were 1.0 g P m(-2) year(-1) for DRP and 5.4 g P m(-2) year(-1) for TP and did not differ significantly between wetlands (P < 0.05). Approximately 35% of TP mass removal occurred during two floods. A conservative tracer (Cl) indicated limited and negligible effects of dilution on decreases in P concentration. Water flow rate and P concentration did not affect P removal which was loading-limited and seasonal. Initial development of macrophytic vegetation demonstrated no influence on water quality changes. Both wetlands acted as effective P sinks in the initial 2 years of operation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ann, Y; Reddy, KR; Delfino, JJ				Ann, Y; Reddy, KR; Delfino, JJ			Influence of chemical amendments on phosphorus immobilization in soils from a constructed wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Soils previously used for agriculture are currently being converted to wetlands with the goal that they will function as sinks for nutrients. However, residual fertilizer nutrients, especially phosphorus (P) are rapidly released upon flooding. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of selected chemical amendments in immobilizing the soluble soil P. Soil used in the study was an organic soil, obtained from a 3-month old constructed wetland created on an agricultural land in Lake Apopka Basin, central Florida. Chemical amendments used were: CaCO3, (calcite), Ca(OH)(2), CaMg(CO3)(2) (dolomite), Al-2(SO4) (alum), FeCl3 and mixtures of selected amendments. The effective amounts required for each chemical amendment to minimize P release from soil to overlying floodwater were 7-15 g kg(-1) for CaCO3 and Ca(OH)(2), 12 g kg(-1) for alum, and 1-2 g kg(-1) for FeCl3. Based on P flux, the order of effectiveness in immobilizing soluble P was as follows: FeCl3 > alum > Ca(OH)(2) > calcite > dolomite. High rates of chemical amendments are needed to reduce P levels, because of complexation of P binding cations (Ca, Fe and Al) with organic matter. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Ann, Y; Reddy, KR; Delfino, JJ				Ann, Y; Reddy, KR; Delfino, JJ			Influence of redox potential on phosphorus solubility in chemically amended wetland organic soils	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Conversion of agricultural lands to wetlands results in solubilization of residual fertilizer P, thus increasing soluble P concentration of floodwater. Previous studies have shown that application of chemical amendments such as alum, FeCl3 and CaCO3 were found to be effective in decreasing soluble P of the soil porewater. Water-table fluctuations and variable hydraulic loading rates in wetlands can alter soil redox conditions, and the solubility of P compounds. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of oxidized and reduced soil conditions on P solubility of a wetland organic soil amended with chemicals. Soil treatments evaluated include: (i) control, (ii) CaCO3 at 15.3 g kg(-1), (iii) alum at 14.5 g kg(-1), and (iv) FeCl3 at 1.8 g kg(-1). Dissolved reactive P of soils in the control and FeCl3 amended soils responded to changes in Eh, while a less pronounced effect was noted in alum and CaCO3 amended soils. Overall, dissolved P concentrations were higher under reduced conditions and decreased with increase in Eh. The KCl-P (labile inorganic P) decreased with increase in Eh, while NaOH-RP (Fe- and Al-bound P) increased with Eh, especially in control, FeCl3 and alum amended soils. Soil amended with CaCO3 showed minimal changes in either KCl-RP or NaOH-RP. In CaCO3 amended soil, the solubility of P was regulated by the solid phases of Ca-P compounds, while in other treatments solubility was controlled by variscite, strengite, and vivianite. Amendments (such as CaCO3 and alum) that are less sensitive to changes in redox conditions may be suitable for binding P under wetland environments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Schaafsma, JA; Baldwin, AH; Streb, CA				Schaafsma, JA; Baldwin, AH; Streb, CA			An evaluation of a constructed wetland to treat wastewater from a dairy farm in Maryland, USA	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, wastewater from animal operations laden with nutrients, sediment, and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) contributes to the degradation of surface water quality. A constructed wetland system was built to treat wastewater from a dairy farm in Frederick County, Maryland to evaluate the use of wetland technology as a best management practice for dairy waste. To assess treatment effects, we sampled water once a month at several sites through the system, which consists of two settling basins, two cells, and a vegetated filter strip. Samples were analyzed for total nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate/nitrite, total phosphorus, ortho-phosphate, total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity, and pH. Flow through the wetland system resulted in significant reductions in concentrations of all analytes except nitrate/nitrite. Relative to initial concentrations, total nitrogen was reduced 98%, ammonia 56%, total phosphorus 96%, ortho-phosphate 84%, suspended solids 96%, and biochemical oxygen demand 97%. Nitrate/nitrite increase by 82%, although mean concentrations were much lower than concentrations of ammonia or total nitrogen. The increase in nitrate/nitrite is probably due to the oxidation of ammonia via nitrification in the vegetated filter strip. Our results suggest that while reductions are large, further removal is necessary to meet design requirements. This may be possible through the addition of another anaerobic wetland cell downstream of the system or recirculation of wastewater through the wetland cells to promote denitrification and uptake of nutrients by plants.

J	Yang, MD; Sykes, RM; Merry, CJ				Yang, MD; Sykes, RM; Merry, CJ			Estimation of algal biological parameters using water quality modeling and SPOT satellite data	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Discovering biological parameters is the essential step to understand and even control an ecosystem. Traditional in situ sampling is time-consuming, expensive, and can only be taken for small areas with limited samples. It also needs a long-term observation program to acquire biological growth records. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to estimate algal biological parameters, which are important factors of eutrophication control, by using water quality modeling and remote sensing techniques. Algal growth rate and respiration rate were estimated using a one-dimensional water quality model (QUAL2E) and two-dimension spatially distributed water quality data derived from SPOT satellite imagery for the Te-Chi Reservoir in Taiwan.

J	Bobba, AG; Singh, VP; Bengtsson, L				Bobba, AG; Singh, VP; Bengtsson, L			Application of environmental models to different hydrological systems	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												In recent years global problems such as climatic change, acid rain, and water pollution in surface and subsurface environments dominate discussions of world environmental problems. In this paper, the roles of hydrologic processes and hydrogeochemical processes are investigated through development, modification, and application of mathematical models for addressing point and non-point source water quality modelling of receiving waters: surface water, subsurface water and lake water. The paper describes the use of models to simulate the movements of pollutants and water: subsurface water, surface water and lake sediments. A hydrological model was applied to Northeast Pond River watershed to understand climate change effects in the watershed. Four watershed acidification models were applied to compute hydrogen ion, alkalinity and sulphate concentrations from Turkey Lakes watershed, Canada. The computed hydrogen ion was used to estimate acidic events, magnitude of hydrogen ion, and duration using a stochastic model. There exist uncertainties in environmental models due to imperfect knowledge of processes controlling water quality parameters as well as errors in data. Monte Carlo, first order, and inverse method analyses were used to assess uncertainty in models. SUTRA (saturated-unsaturated transport) and SUTRA(-1) models were applied to Lambton county, Ontario, Canada to locate groundwater discharge areas for St. Clair River, calculate discharge rates, and hydrogeologic parameters. A sediment contamination model was developed and applied to Great Lakes sediment data to estimate transport parameters by Pb-210 data. It was then coupled with fatty acid data and results were compared with observed data. A contaminant transport model was developed and applied to two North American streams to compute stream water concentration. The computed data was compared with observed data using a simple statistical method. A hydrological model was coupled with water quality models and RAISON (regional analysis by intelligent systems on) expert system and applied to Canadian watersheds. Digital satellite data was used to locate groundwater discharge and recharge areas in the watershed. This data is useful as observed data for hydrological modelling and GIS (Geographical Information System) system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Savard, M				Savard, M			Modelling risk, trade, agricultural and environmental policies to assess trade-offs between water quality and welfare in the hog industry	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												To assess the trade-offs between water quality and welfare in North Carolina and in Quebec under different trade, agricultural and environmental policies in the pork sector, an economic model is linked to an environmental model. The economic model isa spatial mathematical programming model of US and Canadian swine industries. It is a partial equilibrium model, which is dynamic, regional and incorporates a risk variable. The objective function maximizes market welfare defined as the Marshallian measures of producer and consumer surpluses plus government payments. The objective function does not maximize social welfare, which includes the economic benefits derived from water quality, because economic values for improved water quality do not exist for the areas of interest. The objective is to maximize the area under each region's pork demand Function, adding government payments and subtracting all production, slaughter, processing, storage and distribution costs. The Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator (EPIC) is the environmental model used in concert with the economic modal. Nitrates and phosphates are the environmental indicators. Phosphates being less soluble than nitrates, are lost mainly in runoff and erosion, and hence affect surface water, while nitrates are lost in runoff and leachate contaminating ground and surface waters. The accumulation of phosphates accelerates the eutrophication process while high levels of nitrates in drinking water have been associated with maethemoglobinea, a potentially lethal blood disorder affecting infants under 6 months of age. Since welfare measures are calculated at the regional level, and water quality occurs at the local level, the trends rather than the magnitudes of water quality and welfare changes, are compared to determine if economic and environmental objectives conflict. There are four scenarios: two trade scenarios encompassing important liberalization endeavors and two environmental scenarios simulating potential nutrient management plans. In three cases out of eight, there are trade-offs between welfare and water quality. In the Southeast; including North Carolina, regional welfare decreases due to increased manure disposal costs imposed under both. nutrient plans. Welfare decreases are partly compensated by decreases of nitrates and phosphates in runoff. In Quebec, the elimination of the ban on US live hog imports in Canada allows imports of hogs from the Midwest into Quebec, which accompanies a decrease of hog inventories in Quebec. The welfare change is negative and the change in water quality with respect to nitrogen is positive. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	McDermot, D; Rose, KA				McDermot, D; Rose, KA			An individual-based model of lake fish communities: application to piscivore stocking in Lake Mendota	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A general individual-based fish community simulator is presented. The model tracks the daily feeding, growth, movement, reproduction, and mortality of individuals of up to six species for multiple generations in up to three spatial boxes. The version presented in this paper has been configured and calibrated for Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. Six species are followed: yellow perch, bluegill, white bass, cisco, walleye, and northern pike. The environment consists of daily temperature, dissolved oxygen, and prey densities in each of the epilimnion, hypolimnion, and littoral zone spatial boxes. Feeding parameters and larval mortality rates were calibrated until all species persisted at reasonable biomasses, with realistic mean lengths at age and diets by life stage. Two alternate baseline calibrations are presented which differ in their degree of interannual variability. Correlation analysis of survival and growth rates showed that larvae were influenced by competition, yearlings by predation, and young of the year (YOY) juveniles by both. Adult growth was density-dependent for planktivores and positively related to forage biomass for piscivores. Cisco dynamics were effectively independent of the other species. The calibrated model was used to compare the effects of a biomanipulation experiment (piscivore enhancement) versus a coincident fish die-off event, and to evaluate alternative stocking regimes for their ability to sustain improved water duality. Predicted total zooplankton consumption was used to indicate effects on algae and water quality. Cisco die-off produced similar short-term but much larger long-term reductions in zooplankton consumption than piscivore enhancement. Delayed changes in YOY juvenile and larval survival illustrated complex indirect food web responses to piscivore enhancement. None of the three alternative stocking regimes analyzed yielded ideal management results. Stocking either had little effect on zooplankton consumption, or resulted in significant changes in piscivore mean lengths or in the composition of the fish community. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

About half of this toxicity has been found to be due to the organophosphate (OP) pesticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos used in urban areas for structural termite and ant control, and lawn and garden pest control. The other half is due to unknown causes likely associated with the use of pesticides in commercial nurseries and agriculture. The non-stormwater flow into Upper Newport Bay is non-toxic. Stormwater runoff events cause short-term pulses of toxic waters to enter this marine bay. Studies on the fate of the toxic pulses of San Diego Creek water in Upper Newport Bay show that for many stormwater runoff events, the Creek freshwater forms a lens above the marine waters that is diluted by tidal mixing with the bay's marine waters. The regulatory issue that should be assessed is the water quality and ecological significance of the pulses of aquatic life toxicity that exist in the waters at the bottom of the freshwater lens where the Creek waters mix with the marine waters. For some stormwater runoff events, potentially toxic waters are present in a limited areal and volumetric extent in the bay for several days. It is unclear whether these toxic pulses of OP pesticides are significantly adverse to the beneficial uses of Upper Newport Bay because of their limited duration and the limited number/type of marine aquatic organisms that are exposed to toxic conditions associated with stormwater runoff events. Further studies need to be conducted to define the magnitude of the potential beneficial use impairment of bay waters due to this toxicity.																	1040-1695		0-8031-2861-4				2000	1381						35	51		10.1520/STP14413S								WOS:000086563700003

Forty-nine pesticide compounds were detected in one or more water samples collected for analysis. The ten most frequently occurring compounds were simazine, diazinon, metolachlor, chlorpyrifos, DCPA, EPTC, trifluralin, atrazine, diuron, and cyanazine. Detailed studies at four sites revealed significant seasonal variability in the number of pesticides detected in individual site samples and in the summed concentrations of all pesticides detected in a site sample. Concentrations of diazinon were related with application patterns to different crop types and to timing of rainfall. Significant correlations were found between water quality, habitat, and fish assemblage data. The correlations, however, were dependent on the number and locations of the sites included in the analysis. There was no clear link between pesticide concentrations and fish assemblages. Our results highlighted differences in the temporal and spatial scales of sampling between the water quality and ecological studies. The water quality and pesticide studies emphasized sampling over short periods of time at few sites, but the ecological studies emphasized single samples over a large geographic area because of lack of information on the range of possible ecological conditions in the study area.																			1-56670-453-7				2000							25	62										WOS:000084508200003

The tank car rupture resulted in the discharge of up to 27,000 kg of the pesticide into the Upper Sacramento River. The contaminant was subsequently transported from the spill site downstream to Shasta Lake, a distance of approximately 77.5 km. During transit, metam decomposed by hydrolysis and photolysis into methyl isothiocyanate (MITC) that was diminished in aqueous concentration by volatilization to the atmosphere along the river. The spill event was simulated mathematically using the two-dimensional hydrodynamic model RMA-2, modified to represent the run-riffle-pool character of the steep gradient stream in the mountainous terrain, coupled with the companion finite element water quality model RMA-4Q, modified to represent the unique physic al and chemical processes governing the fate and transport of metam and MITC. The models were calibrated against field observations of the passage of MITC at downstream locations during several days following the accident. Sensitivity testing of alternative scenarios considering various combinations of hydrolysis, photolysis, and volatilization rates revealed the relative importance of these processes in determining the fates of metam and MITC in the stream and in the overlying atmosphere.																			1-56670-453-7				2000							71	92										WOS:000084508200005

The assessment is the principal means by which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Congress, and the public evaluate water quality, the progress made in maintaining and restoring water quality, and the extent of remaining problems. The procedures for developing the assessment database and the methods for evaluating and reporting assessment results are being improved to facilitate better reporting of water quality conditions. Here we present the results of our work with the WQA in California (CWQA) for Sierra Nevada rivers and streams. By attaching assessment database records to the EPA River Reach File, we have developed a more usable form of the statewide assessment. The CWQA spatial database is a Geographic Information System (GIS) which will enhance resource managers' ability to visually depict water quality conditions associated with specific rivers and to analyze these conditions to evaluate possible sources of impairment. An analysis of the resultant CWQA for the Sierra Nevada demonstrates the strength and weaknesses of the spatial dataset in its current format. In addition, a preliminary regional comparison of water quality problems and restoration project locations and issues illustrates how the CWQA spatial database can be incorporated into regional analyses that support watershed management decisions.																			1-56670-453-7				2000							333	348										WOS:000084508200019

Voluntary water purchase programs are an example of such a policy. This paper examines the structure and performance of two water right purchase programs operating in Nevada: the Truckee River Water Quality Agreement and the Lahontan Valley purchase program administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the State of Nevada and The Nature Conservancy. Statistical analysis of the latter program indicates that it is performing efficiently Notably, personal factors prompt water right sales, and the least productive rights (e.g., those appurtenant to poor soils) are sold to the government. Concluding comments offer suggestions about ways to improve program performance, including, allowing the sale of fractional water rights.

The Riparian Ecosystem Management model (REMM) has been developed for researchers and natural resource agencies as a modeling tool that can help quantify the water quality benefits of riparian buffers under varying site conditions. Processes simulated in REMM include surface and subsurface hydrology; sediment transport and deposition; carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus transport removal and cycling; and vegetation growth. Management options, such as vegetation type size of the buffer zone, and biomass harvesting also can be simulated. REMM can be used in conjunction with upland models, empirical data, or estimated loadings to examine scenarios of buffer zone design for a hillslope. Evaluation of REMM simulations with field observations shows generally good agreement between simulated and observed data for groundwater nitrate concentrations and water table depths in a mature riparian forest buffer. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes that influenced the water balance ol soil moisture storage affected the streamflow output. Parameter changes that influence either hydrology or rates of nutrient cycling affected total N transport and plant N uptake.				inamdar, shreeram/B-7433-2009													0022-4561						2000	55	1					27	34										WOS:000085250700005						
J	Shepard, R				Shepard, R			Nitrogen and phosphorous management on Wisconsin farms: Lessons learned for agricultural water quality programs	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Farming systems that combine animals forage, and cash grain production have the opportunity to augment commercial fertilizers with nutrients generated on a farm. To do this, the farmer must weigh the economic benefits associated with a low-risk option of relying on commercial nutrients against technological and managerial uncertainties associated with using on-farm nutrient sources. This decision by the farmer must be made in the context of maintaining a financially-viable farm while reducing the probability of environmental degradation caused by over-application of crop nutrients. Supposedly best management practices (BMPs) promoted by water quality programs help the farmer achieve this objective. A survey was conducted among Wisconsin livestock farmers to assess the application of all sources of nitrogen (N), and phorphorus (P2O5) in the production of corn. Nitrogen and phosphorus inputs were selected because they have been shown to negatively effect the surface and ground water resources when used in excess or in sensitive ecological areas. This research differed from more common attitudinal surveys of farmers by focusing on the actual agronomic behaviors associated with the management of crop nutrients in mixed farming systems. Data from 1,928 farms in Wisconsin was used in this analysis to determine the overall nutrient application rates and rise of BMPs. Results indicate that two out of three farmers apply excess nitrogen (N), while four out out of five apply excess phosphorus (P2O5) for corn production. Few rise the recommended BMPs in an appropriate fashion. These results indicate that farmers' actual behavior patterns must be brought into the design of both best management practices and implementation strategies for water quality programs.																	0022-4561						2000	55	1					63	68										WOS:000085250700010

This research investigates the relationship between changes in water quality and changes in farming practices in two Lake Ei ip tributaries. Using the Erosion Productivity impact Calculator (EPIC), simulations of pollutant emissions from farms in the Maumee :and Sandusky River basins were conducted with 1985 ann 1995 land use and cropping patterns. information was compared with unit area leads derived from detailed water quality data collected nt integrator stations near the mouths of the two rivers. The comparison showed large differences between the two data sets that cannot be explained by errors of`load estimation, errors in application of the EPIC model or differences between the modeled and monitored parameters . Rather, discrepancies in results are likely due to the fact that EPIC does not model in-stream delivery losses, and the observed loads are affected by these losses. However, EPIC simulations are generally accurate in predicting the direction of change of unit area lends of water quality parameters.																	0022-4561						2000	55	1					85	90										WOS:000085250700013

The FSA, constructed from easily-obtained materials, is adaptable to various applications, portable, easily calibrated and delivers reproducible flow, rates. Variability among replications was quite small with Coefficient of Variability (CV) of less than 1.5%. Water flowed as a sheet onto the test surface at application rates of 4 L min(-1) (1.1 gal) or greater. In initial field tests, the device runs used to apply a 0.1 mg kg(-1) (0.1 PPM) atrazine solution to 1 x 5-m (3.3 x 16.4-ft) sections of buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides Nutt. Engelm.) sod at a rate equivalent to runoff occurring from a 30-m (98.4-ft) wide field directly upslope with a 5.1 cm (2 in) rain. The outflow atrazine concentration from the sad was reduced in the first 15 min, and then increased, stabilizing at 85% of the input concentration. With minor modifications, the FSA can provide inflow for concentrated flow experiments.																	0022-4561						2000	55	1					102	104										WOS:000085250700016

We conducted a two year field study to provide information to farm planners on manure application timing for intensive grass production in the Pacific Northwest. We applied dairy manure slurry [340 kg total N ha(-1) yr(-1); (300 lb N ac(-1) yr(-1))] to orchardgrass on well drained and poorly drained soils in western Washington, comparing early (February and May) mid-season (May through summer), and late (summer through full) timing sequences for manure application. We also compared manure N rates ranging from 170 to 670 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) (150 to 600 lb ac(-1) yr(-1))for the mid-season application only. Forage yield, N uptake, apparent N recovery, and late-season soil nitrate-N were measured Cumulative apparent N recovery for manure N averaged 31% and ranged from 24 to 38% over all treatments. The early and late manure sequences on the well drained soil had greater spring-harvest and cumulative yields than for the mid-season sequence. Timing effects were smaller and not statistically significant On the poorly drained soil. The effect of a manure application on grass production was greatest in the first harvest following application, and declined in subsequent harvests. Residual soil nitrate was less than 5 mg N kg(-1) soil for all manure timing sequences applied at the 340 kg total N ha(-1) yr(-1) (300 lb N ac(-1) yr(-1)) rate.																	0022-4561						2000	55	2					147	152										WOS:000088545000007

Grass hedges may reduce runoff losses of nutrients and sediment The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of narrow switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) hedges (similar to 0.75 m wide) on the transport of P and N from afield receiving beef cattle feedlot manure under tilled and no-till renditions. This study was conducted on a steep (12 % average slope) Monona silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludolls) soil near Treynor, Iowa. The experiment was a split-plot with no-till and disked systems as main plots and subplots of manure, fertilizer and check with or without a grass hedge. A rainfall simulator was used and runoff was collected from both the initial and the following wet simulations. Only 38% of the no-till plots and 63% of disked plots had any runoff during the initial 6.4 cm hr(-1) water application. A single narrow grass hedge reduced runoff concentrations of dissolved P (DP) by 47%, bioavailable P (BAP) by 48%, particulate P (PP) by 38%, total P (TP) by 40%, and NH4-N by 60% during the wet simulation on the no-till plots receiving manure, compared with similar plots with no hedges. The corresponding reductions in concentrations as a result of a grass hedge for DP, BAP, PP, TP, and NH4-N on the disked plots were 21, 29, 43, 38, and 52%, respectively. Runoff NH4-N concentration from fertilizer applied to the disked plots was reduced by 61%, NO3-N by 21%, and total N (TN) by 27% during the wet simulation when grass hedges were used. Grass hedges also reduced total quantities of DP, BAP, TP, and NH4-N during the wet simulation. The TP loss was 3.3% of applied P fertilizer and was 0.3% of applied manure P. Narrow grass hedges were effective in reducing P and N losses in runoff from both manure and fertilizer application.																	0022-4561						2000	55	2					172	176										WOS:000088545000010

Public record were wed to document the manure management practices of 10 CAFOs housing 59,700 finishing hogs in a 1,554 ha area of Hamilton County, Iowa. Together, the CAFOs generated an estimated 811,500 kg of nitrogen (N) each year, more than 70% of which volatilized into the atmosphere. CAFOs minimized the area required for applying manure by underestimating manure N content, projecting above average crop yields, and applying manure to soybeans. Some fields were claimed by more than one CAFO, and some field sizes were overestimated Manure application based on crop demand for phosphorus would require 9,350 ha of cropland, compared to the 990 ha used by CAFOs. Several policy changes could alleviate the nutrient management problems inherent in CAFOs.																	0022-4561						2000	55	2					205	212										WOS:000088545000015						
J	Lowrance, R; Hubbard, RK; Williams, RG				Lowrance, R; Hubbard, RK; Williams, RG			Effects of a managed three zone riparian buffer system on shallow groundwater quality in the southeastern Coastal Plain	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Riparian forest buffers can help improve agricultural water quality. USDA guidelines are for riparian forest buffers of three zones. Zone 1 is permanent woody vegetation near the stream. Trees can be harvested in Zone 2, which is upslope from Zone 1. Zone 3 is a grass filter upslope from Zone 2 at field edge. In order to test USDA guidelines, a site runs established in the southeastern Coastal Plain near Tifton, Georgia, with an 8 m wide grass buffer (Zone 3) situated between a field and a mature Riparian forest. In the Zone 2 forest, mostly 50 year-old pine trees, one block was harvested by clearcut, one block was thinned and one block was left as a mature forest control. Care was taken to minimize soil disturbance during the timber harvest operation. The Zone 1 forest [15 m wide (49 ft)] was left undisturbed. Shallow groundwater wells were used to monitor the effect of the managed Riparian forest buffer on N, P, and Cl concentrations. Groundwater nitrate concentrations decreased from 11 to 22 mg L-1 adjacent to the field to less that 2 mg L-1 at 5 m (16 ft) into the forest. Nitrate concentration decreased under the grass filter strip as well as in the forest. Nitrate concentrations increased in one corner of the Riparian forest near the stream. This increase may be due to flow patterns of groundwater that bypasses the Riparian forest buffer. Chloride concentrations increased under the buffer indicating that the nitrate removal was due to biological processes such as plant uptake and denitrification rather than dilution. Concentrations of other potential pollutants such as ortho-p, ammonium, and organic N moved in very small quantities and did not show consistent spatial patterns. There was no effective to harvesting of the Zone 2 forest on either nutrient concentrations or water table elevations. These results indicate that Zone 2 trees, along small streams in the southeastern coastal plain, can be harvested with little effect on groundwater nutrient movement to streams.																	0022-4561						2000	55	2					212	220										WOS:000088545000016

However, increased stocking rate can increase NO3- leaching from pastures. Increasing stocking rate increases NO3- loss through leaching because the bulk of the N consumed by the animal is excreted in concentrated areas of the pasture mainly in urine. We used experimental data from the northeast U.S. and the literature to assess the relationships between stocking rate and NO3- leaching losses beneath an intensively grazed pasture. A relatively low cumulative seasonal stocking rate of about 200 mature Holstein ha(-1) could result in a 10 mg l(-1) NO3-N concentration in the leachate beneath a fertilized, intensively grazed pasture. This means that while management intensive grazing can improve farm profitability and help control erosion, it can have a significant negative effect on water quality beneath pastures. The extent to which this effect occurs within specific watersheds needs to be evaluated in context of the other cropping systems and land uses within the watershed.																	0022-4561						2000	55	2					238	243										WOS:000088545000020

The term hydrologically sensitive area (HSA) was used to refer to areas in a watershed especially prone to generating runoff that are, therefore, potentially susceptible to transporting contaminants to perennial surface water bodies. As an example, a cost benefit method for quantifying HSAs was developed and applied such that water quality protection was balanced with agriculture needs for NYC watersheds. In accordance with the variable source area concept, the spatial extent of HSAs vary throughout the year. On an annual average, approximately 10% of the watershed is designated HSA and about 20% of the total annual runoff originates on these HSAs. This study is meant to illustrate an approach to dealing with water quality risk assessment.																	0022-4561						2000	55	3					277	284										WOS:000165792200007						
J	Manale, A				Manale, A			Flood and water quality management through targeted, temporary restoration of landscape functions: Paying upland farmers to control runoff	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Floods have caused billions of dollars in damage to populated areas associated with river systems in recent years. Runoff associated with floods has resulted in deterioration of downstream water quality. The threat of flooding may be known weeks if not months in advance. Such nonstructural means as temporary storage of runoff on agricultural lands in the upland areas of the watersheds during periods when flood risks are high, may provide ecological benefits through reduced sediment runoff, soil carbon loss, and loading of nutrients to surface waters, at the same time diminishing the threat of downstream flooding. Local or regional resource managers or insurance industry consortia could establish contracts with farmers to store runoff by the temporary plugging of ditches, drainage systems, and similar practices until the flood threat has passed. In return, farmers would be paid an amount covering the loss of potential net revenue and the opportunity cost from use of the land for the period of runoff storage. Highly detailed topographic maps would be used to estimate storage capacity on a farmer's fields and hydrographic data would be used to estimate the volume of water from a precipitation event that must be stored in order to avert downstream flooding. When meteorological data suggest that a flood is imminent or that an extreme precipitation event is likely, the contractural agreements would be initiated. Case studies in select watersheds in Iowa show how the policy might lessen the social and environmental cost of floods.																	0022-4561						2000	55	3					285	295										WOS:000165792200008

This paper investigates the environmental and economic consequences of altering nitrogen fertilizer practices for a central Illinois watershed. A model of the watershed is employed to assess the impacts of the alternative management practices. The model incorporates heterogeneity of soil types and characterizes lake water quality as a weather-driven random process affected by production practices. Results indicate that improvements in surface water quality can be obtained while increasing fram profits by reducing nitrogen fertilizer application levels. Varying the timing of fertilizer application does improve water quality, but also increases the variability of farm profits.																	0022-4561						2000	55	3					296	303										WOS:000165792200009						
J	Woltemade, CJ				Woltemade, CJ			Ability of restored wetlands to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in agricultural drainage water	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Runoff from artificially drained agricultural lands is a common source of excessive nitrogen and phosphorus to downstream waters. Restored wetlands receiving crop field drainage water are shown to lower concentrations of both nitrogen and phosphorous. Case studies in Maryland, Illinois, and Iowa indicate that wetlands can remove up to 68% of nitrate-nitrogen and 43% of phosphorous from drainage water, although performance varies considerably. Performance comparison across sites indicates that large wetlands relative to the contributing drainage area most effectively improve water quality. Time series data representing periods of both relatively high and low inflow indicate that performance is highly sensitive to retention time, with greatest nutrient removal during flow conditions that facilitate retention times of at least one to two weeks. Where wetlands are incorporated into forested riparian buffer strips, additional water quality benefits are shown.																	0022-4561						2000	55	3					303	309										WOS:000165792200010						
J	Forster, DL				Forster, DL			Public policies and private decisions: Their impacts on Lake Erie water quality and farm economy	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Since the early 1970s, pollution abatement efforts have recognized nonpoint sources and, particularly, agriculture, as major causes of pollution in the Lake Erie region. The first objective of this research is to summarize federal and state agricultural pollution abatement programs that encouraged farmers to adopt conservation practices. Next, the economic impacts of changes in farming practices are reviewed. Statistical analyses of farm-level accounting data and a farm simulation model are used to investigate the economic effects of conservation practices in the region. Finally, simulated farm pollutant emissions in 1985 and 1995 are compared to actual pollutant loadings. This comparison offers evidence that improvements in water quality are attributable to changes in farming practices, (e.g., conservation tillage adoption).																	0022-4561						2000	55	3					309	322										WOS:000165792200011						
J	Kraft, S; Penberthy, J				Kraft, S; Penberthy, J			Conservation policy for the future: What lessons have we learned from watershed planning and research	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												In the last ten years, watershed planning has become a focal point of soil and water conservation policy in the United States (Naiman 1992; Euphrat and Warkentin 1994; Adler 1995). To proponents, the watershed and the movement of water across and through its landscape and into its streams and groundwater captures processes that results in soil loss, sedimentation of waterways, and deterioration of water quality. Consequently, conservationists argue that by changing management structures and practices across the landscape of a watershed, it is possible to advance a range of environmental goals. As a consequence of this position, there are watershed planning efforts across the country that are typically based on a partnership that is led by local citizens who rely on federal and state agency personnel for technical support. While much is currently written about such watershed based planning efforts, the development of a set of strategies for facilitating the planning process rests on lessons derived from ongoing planning efforts (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1997).																	0022-4561						2000	55	3					327	333										WOS:000165792200013

One tool for exploring the risk associated with management practices is probabilistic risk assessment (PRA). A PRA for the discharge of nitrogren (N) from agricultural nonpoint sources (NPSs) to a stream was performed for a small watershed in Virginia. Using fault tree analysis, a type of PRA, probability of occurrence for excessive N discharge to the stream during a runoff event was evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative analysis showed that proper management of cover, nutrients, and livestock is key to controlling the probability of agricultural NPS pollution occurrence. While this conclusion is not new, presentation of pollution causing events in a graphical format is new. Land use, management practice, stream flow, and water quality data, along with expert opinion, were used to assign probabilities to individual events within the fault tree and to calculate overall probability of N discharge to the the stream. Quantitative assessment showed the impact of best management practices (BMPs) on reducing the likelihood of N discharge. Probability of N discharge during a runoff event for the watershed decreased by 0.08 from 1987 to 1993 due to the implementation of BMPs during that time. For the same time period, a subwatershed isolating two dairies showed a 0.09 decrease in the probability of N discharge. The fault tree method was useful in representing changes within the watershed. Data requirements needed to complete the PRA were similar to those of other integrative approaches to assessing NPS pollution.																	0022-4561						2000	55	3					340	346										WOS:000165792200015						
J	Tate, KW; Nader, GA; Lewis, DJ; Atwill, ER; Connor, JM				Tate, KW; Nader, GA; Lewis, DJ; Atwill, ER; Connor, JM			Evaluation of buffers to improve the quality of runoff from irrigated pastures	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Non grazed, vegetated buffer strips are often recommended as best management practices to protect waterbodies from sediments and nutrients in runoff from grazed pastures. The objectives of this study were to characterize levels of nitrate/nitrogen (NO3-N) total phosphorus (Total P), and total suspended solid (TSS) in runoff and evaluate the potential water quality improvements from 10 m buffer strips on irrigated Sierra Nevada foothill pastures. We found that 15% and (69% of irrigation water applied to sprinkler and flood irrigated pastures became run off respectively. There were distinct temporal patterns of constituent concentration in runoff during irrigation events having ramifications for effective water quality monitoring and study design. The to m buffer did not significantly reduce concentrations and load of NO3-N in runoff from sprinkler and flood irrigated pastures. The buffer also failed to reduce Total P concentration under either irrigation schemes, or Total P and TSS load under sprinkler irrigation. The buffer did reduce TSS concentration under both irrigation schemes, TSS load under flood irrigation, and Total P load under flood irrigation. These results reflect the effectiveness of buffers during the first year following buffer establishment Improved irrigation efficiently to reduce runoff generation is perhaps the most readily acceptable and practical first step for reducing the potential for negative water quality imparts from these systems.																	0022-4561						2000	55	4					473	478										WOS:000166458600009

Because of environment worsening the surface water became undrinkable, So, about 98 % of Tomsk region population use ground mater sources. Nevertheless Tomsk region water-hearing levels don't comply with requirements of drinking water state standards. In small villages of Tomsk region where is no centralized water supply the water is drawed from water wells. Ground water is used without any water treatment. Whereas in most of water wells the content of iron, manganese and hardness of water exceeds the admissible level several times. The main goal of this research work was the estimation of ground water chemical content and suitability for drinking water supply. We have researched drinking water sources of Tomsk region villages: Loskutovo, Timiryazevo and others. The analytical methods applied are: colorimetry, flame photometry and complexation titration. Experimental results show the iron excess concentration in every ater sample. In conclusion it should be noted that ground water of Tomsk region is suitable for drinking water supply. But we should recommend to use water purifiers in household or built deironing stations to decrease the iron concentration in ground water.																			0-7803-6486-4				2000							292	296										WOS:000166671600062						
J	Attrill, MJ; Power, M				Attrill, MJ; Power, M			Effects on invertebrate populations of drought-induced changes in estuarine water quality	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Between the years 1989 and 1992, severe drought conditions occurred in the Thames estuary catchment, significantly reducing freshwater flows into the estuary and affecting estuarine water quality. Long-term data assembled for water quality between 1977 and 1992 were combined with invertebrate abundance data obtained from the intake screens of West Thurrock power station over the same period. This allowed an examination of the influence of drought-induced changes in water-quality parameters on the populations of the most abundant mobile estuarine invertebrates. For 8 invertebrate species, seasonal and monthly means for pre-drought (1977 to 1988) and drought (1989 to 1992) abundances were calculated and tested for significant differences. Time-series data were used to estimate regression models explaining observed variations in populations of Carcinus maenas, Crangon crangon and Gammarus spp. during both periods. Stability tests were used to establish significant differences in pre-drought and drought models. Significant mean seasonal and monthly differences were found for C. maenas and Gammarus spp. in both winter and summer, with significant summer differences being apparent for C. crangon and Palaemon longirostris. Regression analyses confirmed these results for the modelled species and highlighted the significance of drought-related changes in temperature for all 3 crustaceans, with dissolved oxygen being an additional significant variable for C. crangon. The reported significant changes in abundance of the studied species during drought conditions have important implications for the structure and dynamics of estuarine food webs, as C. maenas, Gammarus spp., and particularly C. crangon, are either important predators on invertebrates and juvenile fish or major food items for estuarine fish species.																	0171-8630						2000	203						133	143		10.3354/meps203133								WOS:000089661100010						
J	Pinckney, JL; Paerl, HW; Haugen, E; Tester, PA				Pinckney, JL; Paerl, HW; Haugen, E; Tester, PA			Responses of phytoplankton and Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate zoospores to nutrient enrichment in the Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina, USA	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The recently described toxic dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida and morphologically similar Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have become a major water quality issue with possible fish mortality and reported human health implications. The linkages between accelerated nutrient loading, eutrophication, and the proliferation of this group of dinoflagellates, however, are not well established for natural systems. Phytoplankton primary production may provide a key link between nutrient inputs and potential outbreaks of Pfiesteria-like biflagellated zoospores in the Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina. The impacts of nutrient (NO3--nitrogen and PO43--phosphorus) supply rates, sediment-water column exchange, water column mixing, and phytoplankton prey on the abundance of Pfiesteria-like non-toxic biflagellated zoospores were examined seasonally over 18 mo in a region of the Neuse River Estuary where fish-kills attributed to P, piscicida have been reported. Phytoplankton community responses to the manipulated variables indicated that biomass and productivity were consistently N Limited. Dominant phytoplankton taxa, including chlorophytes, diatoms, and cyanobacteria, exhibited significant biomass increases in response to N (as NO3-) additions. Phosphate (as PO43-) enrichments did not additionally influence the relative growth and abundance of individual algal groups. Pfiesteria-like zoospores did not exhibit significant increases in abundance in response to mixing, sediment, or nutrient-addition treatments. Seasonally, the number of Pfiesteria-like zoospores was positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass and productivity. The abundance of Pfiesteria-like zoospores followed general trends in phytoplankton biomass and production in the estuary, suggesting that the source of organic nutrition supporting growth is likely phytoplankton based. Lowering of phytoplankton growth and bloom potentials through proposed nutrient-input reduction strategies should translate into broad-based water quality improvement, including declines in the frequency and magnitudes of nuisance algal blooms, O-2 depletion, and associated fish and shellfish mortality in the Neuse River Estuary.																	0171-8630						2000	192						65	78		10.3354/meps192065								WOS:000085578000005

Samples were collected in November of 1997 (seven sites) and again in November of 1998 (nine sites). Fecal bacterial concentrations (total and fecal coliforms, Clostridium perfringens, and enterococci) were measured as relative indicators of fecal contamination. F+-specific coliphage genotyping was performed to determine the source of fecal contamination at the study sites. Bacterial levels were considerably higher at most sites in the 1997 sampling compared to the 1998 sampling, probably because of the greater rainfall that year. In November of 1997, 2 of the 7 sites were in violation of all indicator standards and guidance levels. In November of 1998, 1 of 9 sites was in violation of all indicator standard and guidance levels. The highest concentrations of all fecal indicators were found at a station downstream of the animal holding pens in HSSWP. The lowest levels of indicators were found at the Homosassa Main Spring vent. Levels of fecal indicators downstream of HSSWP (near the point of confluence with the river) were equivalent to those found in the Southeastern Fork and areas upstream of the park influences. F+ specific RNA coliphage analysis indicated that fecal contamination at all sites that tested positive was from animal sources (mammals and birds). These results suggest that animal (indigenous and those in HSSWP) and not human sources influenced microbial water quality in the area of Homosassa River covered by this study.																	0095-3628					JAN	2000	39	1					56	64		10.1007/s002489900193								WOS:000086676900007

But while much has been written on the degradation of natural areas, and growing concerns for human health, little has been done to address their connections. While inherently we know that there is a connection between how we use our water resources and the resources available to us, the challenge has been to define this connection in terms that are considered valid, and to apply this knowledge in a strategy for action. This paper outlines the similarities and interactions between ecological and human needs. By exploring the connections between land use, water quality, and human health, we can gain a better understanding of how human effects on ecological processes do, in fact, affect our quality of life.																							2000	2	14					89	94										WOS:000167600600015

After 2 years, the aquatic vegetation population that had been dominated by submerged species was composed primarily of emerged species. Aquatic vegetation coverage was reduced to <15% for the remainder of the study. Releative abundance of largemouth bass (Micropteras salmoides) and number of angler efforts were directly proportional with the reduction in aquatic vegetation coverage. Angler success was slightly increased. Water quality parameters and nutrient levels were not appreciably changed.																							2000							18	27										WOS:000175525900003

Construction parameters such as height and orientation regulate the total amount of solar radiation received within the area shadowed by over-water structures. The effects of dock height and piling presence on Halodule wrightii and Syringodium filiforme were examined for 12 m transects at three sites at Indian River Lagoon, Florida. Seagrass cover, shoot density, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were measured in situ over a 12-month period for treatments of pilings without decking, 0.91 m docks (above Mean High Water) and 1.52 m docks. Treatment and control transects showed post-construction decreases in cover and shoot density, partially because of an algal bloom produced by an unusually wet winter. Average percent decreases between 14 weeks pre-construction and 33 weeks post-construction showed predicted trends: cover at controls declined 12.3%; cover at pilings declined 21.3%; cover at 1.51 m docks declined 23.8%; and cover at 0.91 m docks declined 28.4%. Shoot counts nearest structures decreased 56% whereas shoot counts farthest from the structures decreased 40%. Analysis of seagrass change along treatment transects reveals a trend toward decreases nearest the docks and pilings, showing the greatest average treatment impacts closest to the structures. Monthly light data collected at the seagrass bed edge at the three sites predicted minimum seagrass light requirements of 33.3, 28.6, and 26.7% I-0. Daylong PAR surveys showed irradiance values for 0.91 and 1.51 m docks as significantly lower than control and pilings values in peak growing season (July). Current trends and PAR measurements were used to predict the decline and perhaps demise of the seagrasses directly influenced by dock shading.																			0-8493-2045-3				2000							49	63										WOS:000085514200004

Examination of the environmental, independent variables indicates a strong seasonal cycle for temperature and a trend toward increasing chlorophyll levels during the year. Dependent response variables recorded for tape grass also indicated a seasonal pattern that mimicked the temperature cycle. There was a time lag in maximal life history attributes. Number of shoots per sample, number of blades per sample, and number of blades per shoot had highest values during the warmer months, i.e., May-August. Blade length, blade width, and biomass were higher during the later part of the summer and early fall. Reproductive attributes of the plants, i.e., number of male and female flowers, were highest during the fall. The salinity gradient that was part of the study design was weak and accounted for only a small part of the variation observed between locations along the river. Typically, the end of the year parameter levels were higher than the beginning of the parameter levels for all response variables among plants. It is suspected that this is due to the inordinately heavy rains during early 1998 that led to lower salinities at all locations. These normally freshwater plants were apparently less stressed because of the lower salinity conditions in the estuary. This situation may have provided a "boost" to their growth that helped expand the extent, size, and-fitness of tape grass within the estuarine system. A paradox was revealed in that higher plant growth parameters were recorded among plants from the higher salinity portions of the river. During 1998, salinities were low at the most seaward location, but water clarity was greater, thus providing conditions that may have facilitated growth of this normally freshwater plant in an estuarine ecosystem.																			0-8493-2045-3				2000							65	79										WOS:000085514200005

Plants collected from the Caloosahatchee Estuary (southwest Florida) were exposed to five constant salinity treatments (6, 12, 18, 25, or 35 parts per thousand) for 43 days. Two independent experiments were conducted: one during the winter dry season and the other during the summer wet season. Although there were differences between the two seasonal experiments, these differences were independent of salinity. T. testudinum survived exposure to a salinity of 6 parts per thousand for 6 weeks in both seasons. After 6 weeks exposure, number of blades, number of blades/shoot, and biomass of blades were similar in the range 12-35 parts per thousand, but all three parameters exhibited a relative decrease at 6 parts per thousand. The final length of blades achieved at the end of the experiment increased steadily as salinity increased. In general, production and elongation of new blades were observed at all salinities. Elongation rates of newly formed blades were positively correlated with salinity. The net production of blades was positive at salinities of 12 parts per thousand or greater, but ceased at 6 parts per thousand. The phosphorus and nitrogen content of blades and rhizomes was inversely related to salinity. The biomass of blades in the mesocosm experiments was within the range observed in the Caloosahatchee. Both in the field and in the laboratory, blade biomass increased as salinity increased. Our experimental results suggest that given unlimited light, parameters of growth in T. testudinum are negatively impacted at salinities between 6 and 12 parts per thousand.																			0-8493-2045-3				2000							81	98										WOS:000085514200006						
B	Deis, DR		Bortone, SA		Deis, DR			Monitoring the effects of construction and operation of a marina on the seagrass Halophila decipiens in Fort Lauderdale, Florida	SEAGRASSES: MONITORING, ECOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND MANAGEMENT	MARINE SCIENCE SERIES				Workshop on Subtropical and Tropical Seagrass Management Ecology - Responses to Environmental Stress	OCT 14-16, 1998	FT MYERS, FL					A monitoring program to determine the impact of marina development and operation on seagrasses was designed and performed for the City of Fort Lauderdale at the Birch/Las Olas Fort Lauderdale Municipal Marina. The marina site is located on the east side of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) on the north and south sides of the Las Olas Boulevard bridge in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Basically, the proposed marina development plan includes removing the existing marina and replacing it with piers and slips extending further waterward toward the ICW. At least three previous seagrass surveys had been conducted at the marina site and indicated that Halophila decipiens occurs in varying densities within the site between years (i.e., over time). This species of Halophila has been described as an annual seagrass species regrowing each year from seed. Regrowth each year may be controlled by light (photoperiod); flowering is primarily controlled by temperature. This seasonal regrowth may explain some of the variability between past investigations at the site. The intent of the seagrass investigation is to determine whether a statistically significant change in the distribution and abundance of H. decipiens occured as a direct result of demolition of the existing structures, construction of the new waterfront facility, and subsequent operations of the marina. The basis for this determination will be a statistical comparison to a nearby control area of approximately the same dimensions, depth, and bottom contours as the study site. At the same time, a pre- and post-construction water quality monitoring program was also designed and will be conducted to identify and characterize how selected water quality parameters might be influenced by demolition/construction/operation activities. The seagrass survey and water quality monitoring efforts will be coordinated to optimize the potential to correlate water quality trends with observed changes in seagrass abundance/diversity Three seagrass investigations are proposed - one during the pre-construction period in the summer of 1997 and two over the 3 subsequent years. Water quality sampling began during the initial seagrass monitoring event. Quarterly water quality sampling will continue throughout the seagrass monitoring program.																			0-8493-2045-3				2000							147	155										WOS:000085514200011

Specifically, as much as 80% of the seagrass beds in Tampa Bay have been lost since the late 1800s as a result of dredging, pollution, and reduced water clarity. Historical seagrass losses have also been documented in other coastal areas such as Charlotte Harbor and Sarasota Bay. This study was initiated to assess temporal and spatial changes in seagrass coverage in these estuaries and to monitor the effects of improvements in water quality on seagrass bed expansion. Using 1:24,000 scale aerial color photography, seagrass distributions were photointerpreted and transferred to a geographical information system (GIS) database for analysis. Based on trend analysis of the data, Tamps Bay and Sarasota Bay have experienced consistent, measurable gains in seagrass coverage since 1988. Seagrass coverage in Tampa Bay has increased an average of 2% per year between 1988 and 1996. A remarkable 7% increase in seagrass coverage was observed between 1988 and 1994 in Sarasota Bay followed by an 11% increase between 1994 and 1996. In Charlotte Harbor, a small decline in seagrass coverage occurred between 1982 and 1992; however, a 2% average annual increase has been observed between 1992 and 1996. Observed increases in seagrass coverage in Tampa Bay and Sarasota Bay are believed to be directly linked to improving water quality and light penetration resulting from reductions in point-source pollutant loads. The timing and duration of riverine inflow, nutrient loading, and changes in water color can affect light penetration in Charlotte Harbor. The relationships between these factors and seagrass productivity appear to be more complex than in Tampa Bay and Sarasota Bay. Further data collection will be necessary to associate water quality trends with seagrass community dynamics in this estuary.																			0-8493-2045-3				2000							157	166										WOS:000085514200012

Criteria for targets are that they must be scientifically defensible; ecologically achievable; objective, i.e., based on actual data, such as historical distribution; simple; and bounded by natural variability. Three levels of quantitative seagrass coverage targets are set: (1) potential = to a depth of 1.7 m, based on "healthy" areas of the lagoon; (2) historical = maximum extent of where seagrass has been mapped, largely based on 1943; and (3) critical minimum = maximum extent of where seagrass has been mapped in at least half of non-1943 mappings. These quantitative targets will be used to set water quality and pollutant loading targets. Qualitative targets include seagrass and animal density, diversity, and productivity.																			0-8493-2045-3				2000							211	218										WOS:000085514200016

Abatement of organic and color-staining components had been implemented to improve the water quality of effluent discharged by a pulp mill into the headwaters of Elevenmile Creek, a stream entering this low salinity estuary. This study was designed to assess whether previous in situ habitat conditions (e.g., light exclusion, water, or sediment toxicity) had prevented natural recruitment of aquatic grasses or if other factors, (e.g., propagule transport) existed which might limit or delay V. americana colonization or growth. Different transplanting configurations were employed in our experimental designs to observe success in establishment of beds and assess our ability to measure plant growth among the varying micro-habitats and substrates. The initial transplanting, in 1991, consisted of two plants each, spaced at 40 cm centers in four 6 x 1 m parallel row-plots. Subsequently these plants spread rapidly by runners merging the rows into a continuously expanding grass bed. Second and third trials conducted in 1995 were planted in a cross-shaped configuration, which has emerged as our preferred design. The growth of these transplants indicated V. americana grass beds were recruitment limited, rather than constrained by prevailing conditions of water quality/toxicity, light reduction, or unsuitable substrate during the study period. Our experience may represent a fundamental method for routine utilization of the responses of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) to assess a broad range of questions concerning habitat and water quality of potential sites for habitat restoration.																			0-8493-2045-3				2000							231	238										WOS:000085514200018						
B	Mattson, RA		Bortone, SA		Mattson, RA			Seagrass ecosystem characteristics and research and management needs in the Florida Big Bend	SEAGRASSES: MONITORING, ECOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND MANAGEMENT	MARINE SCIENCE SERIES				Workshop on Subtropical and Tropical Seagrass Management Ecology - Responses to Environmental Stress	OCT 14-16, 1998	FT MYERS, FL					The seagrass ecosystem present in nearshore waters of the Florida Big Bend coast is the second largest in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, covering about 3,000 km(2). This area (from the St. Marks to the Anclote River) generally receives less research and management attention compared to other seagrass areas in Florida (i.e., Florida Bay, Indian River Lagoon). It represents the northern distributional limit of American tropical seagrasses. The major seagrass species are Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme, and Halodule wrightii. Halophila engelmanni, Halophila decipiens, and Ruppia maritima are also present but constitute a lesser component of coverage and standing crop. Benthic green algae in the order Siphonales and drift algae (primarily Rhodophyta) are major floristic components of these beds, in some areas standing crop of algae exceeds that of seagrasses. Four subregions may be recognized in the northern portion of the region: Apalachee Bay, Deadman Bay, Suwannee Sound and adjacent coastal waters, and Waccasassa Bay. Submerged vegetation coverage was estimated by a 1972 NMFS study: Apalachee Bay 128.0 km2; Deadman Bay 7.4 km(2); Suwannee Sound 32.3 km(2); and Waccasassa Bay 98.0 km(2). These data are for inshore, shallow-water areas (primarily < 2 m MLW depth). Other submerged vegetation mapping studies conducted in the region misclassified vegetation coverage in some areas or only mapped in a spatially defined region. Limited amounts of field data are available to describe the seagrass/benthic algal communities in the Big Bend, with few studies reporting standing crop, short-shoot densities, or productivity data. Differences between seagrass community characteristics in the Big Bend vs. Florida Bay have been attributed in part to climatic differences. Studies conducted in Apalachee Bay indicate that reduction in light quantity and quality associated with discharge of bleached kraft mill effluent have resulted in significant reductions in seagrass coverage and standing crop. Because seagrasses are influenced by water clarity which can be affected by a variety of water quality factors, they can serve as biological indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of efforts to protect water quality. A key component leading to this would be determining minimum water quality characteristics needed to maintain suitable water clarity. Given the current high ecological integrity of this portion of the Big Bend coast (perhaps the least disturbed in Florida), it is desirable to collect additional descriptive data (both mapping and field data) at an adequate number of sample sites to document current seagrass community conditions and form the basis for a monitoring program to assess this condition on an ongoing basis. The results from studies conducted in this area and other estuaries could be used to derive protective water quality criteria to maintain existing seagrass coverage and community composition. An important research question is whether the seagrasses in this area are more sensitive to environmental perturbation than those in areas in the southern part of the state, since they reside at the northern limit of their distribution and are subject to natural climatic stresses.																			0-8493-2045-3				2000							259	277										WOS:000085514200020						
B	Johansson, JOR; Greening, HS		Bortone, SA		Johansson, JOR; Greening, HS			Seagrass restoration in Tampa Bay: A resource-based approach to estuarine management	SEAGRASSES: MONITORING, ECOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND MANAGEMENT	MARINE SCIENCE SERIES				Workshop on Subtropical and Tropical Seagrass Management Ecology - Responses to Environmental Stress	OCT 14-16, 1998	FT MYERS, FL					Historical (pre-1930s) seagrass meadows in Tampa Bay are believed to have covered 31,000 ha of the shallow bay bottom. However, impacts to the bay from increasing population and industrial development of the Tampa Bay area resulted in large seagrass reductions. By 1982, approximately 8,800 ha of seagrass remained. Recently, Tampa Bay seagrass monitoring programs have shown that the trend of seagrass loss has been reversed. The bay-wide seagrass cover in 1997, was estimated at 10,930 ha. In Hillsborough Bay, the bay segment that historically has had the poorest water quality, seagrass increased from near 0 ha in 1984 to about 57 ha in 1998. The Tampa Bay seagrass expansion apparently started,in response to water quality improvements that occurred from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s, which included reductions in phytoplankton biomass and water column light attenuation. These improvements followed;a nearly 50% reduction in external nitrogen loading from domestic and industrial point-sources, primarily discharging to Hillsborough Bay, that occurred in the early 1980s. However, most recently, high rainfall amounts during the years 1995, 1996, and the 1997-1998 El Nino event increased nitrogen loading to the bay. Both phytoplankton biomass and light attenuation increased in all major bay segments during this period of high rainfall. These influences on seagrass growth are often detrimental and appear to have reduced the rate of seagrass expansion during the last few years. The reduced rate of expansion is most evident in the Hillsborough Bay section of Tampa Bay for which the most detailed and current seagrass information: is available. Recognizing the link between nitrogen loading, water quality, and seagrass protection, local, state, and federal partners working cooperatively through the Tampa Bay National Estuary Program (TBNEP) have agreed to adopt nitrogen loading targets for Tampa Bay based on the light requirements of Thalassia testudinum. A long-term goal has been adopted to achieve 15,400 ha of seagrass coverage, or 95% of the seagrass estimated for 1950. Reaching the goal will require preservation of the approximately 10,400 ha of seagrass present in the bay in 1992 and restoration of an additional 5,000 ha. Field measurements in Tampa Bay indicate that 20-25% of surface irradiance is required for sustained growth of T. testudinum. Two independent water quality models were used to estimate nitrogen loading rates and associated water column chlorophyll a concentrations required to maintain irradiance levels at the apparent maximum depth of seagrass growth in 1950 for each major bay segment. Based on monitoring data, it appears that light levels can be maintained at these depths in most bay segments with the existing nitrogen loading rates. However, to achieve the longterm seagrass restoration goal, increases in nitrogen loading associated with a projected increase in the watershed's human population must be offset. TBNEP partners have, therefore, identified and committed to specific nitrogen load reduction projects to ensure that nitrogen management targets are met. An interagency bay-wide seagrass monitoring program has been established to document the progress of Tampa Bay seagrass protection and restoration. Citizen-based educational and voluntary programs are underway to help reduce propeller scarring of seagrass meadows and to plant seagrass in areas which currently lack vegetation.																			0-8493-2045-3				2000							279	293										WOS:000085514200021
