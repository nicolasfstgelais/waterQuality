J	Hellwig, J; Stahl, K; Lange, J				Hellwig, Jost; Stahl, Kerstin; Lange, Jens			Patterns in the linkage of water quantity and quality during low-flows	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study investigates 72 catchments across the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, for changes in water quality during low-flow events. Data from the state's water quality monitoring network provided seven water quality parameters (water temperature, electrical conductivity, concentrations of chloride, sodium, sulfate, nitrate, and phosphate), which were statistically related to streamflow variability. Water temperature changes during low-flow showed seasonal dependence. Nitrate concentrations revealed high spatial heterogeneity with about one third of the stations showing decreasing values during low discharge. For most other parameters, concentrations increased during low-flow. Despite consistent trend directions, the magnitudes of changes with streamflow differed markedly across the state. Both multiple linear regression and a multiple analysis of variances were applied to explain these differences with the help of catchment characteristics. Results indicated that for sulfate and conductivity, geology of the catchments was the most important control, whereas for chloride, sodium, and nitrate, sewage treatment plants had the largest influence. For phosphate, no clear control could be identified. Independent from the applied method, land use was a less important control on river water quality during low-flow than geology or inflow from sewage treatment plants. These results show that the effects of diffuse and point sources, as well as those of natural and anthropogenic sources differ for different water quality parameters. Overall, a high diversity of potential water quality deterioration signals needs to be considered when the ecological status of rivers is to be protected during low-flow events.

J	Roberts, M; Hanley, N; Williams, S; Cresswell, W				Roberts, Michaela; Hanley, Nick; Williams, Sam; Cresswell, Will			Terrestrial degradation impacts on coral reef health: Evidence from the Caribbean	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Coral reefs are in decline worldwide. While coral reef managers are limited in their ability to tackle global challenges, such as ocean warming, managing local threats can increase the resilience of coral reefs to these global threats. One such local threat is high sediment inputs to coastal waters due to terrestrial over-grazing. Increases in terrestrial sediment input into coral reefs are associated with increased coral mortality, reduced growth rates, and changes in species composition, as well as alterations to fish communities. We used general linear models to investigate the link between vegetation ground cover and tree biomass index, within a dry-forest ecosystem, to coral cover, fish communities and visibility in the case study site of Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands. We found a positive relationship between ground cover and coral cover below 10 m depth, and a negative relationship between tree biomass index and coral cover below 10 m. Greater ground cover is associated to sediment anchored through root systems, and higher surface complexity, slowing water flow, which would otherwise transport sediment. The negative relationship between tree biomass index and coral cover is unexpected, and may be a result of the deep roots associated with dry-forest trees, due to limited availability of water, which therefore do not anchor surface sediment, or contribute to surface complexity. Our analysis provides evidence that coral reef managers could improve reef health through engaging in terrestrial ecosystem protection, for example by taking steps to reduce grazing pressures, or in restoring degraded forest ecosystems.

Natural drivers are related primarily to the accentuated hydrodynamic processes, high rainfall and fluvial discharge. The anthropogenic driver is related to the lack of planning for beach development. These human pressures result in a reduction in the quality of the beaches through microbiological contamination, the accumulation of garbage on the sand and in the water, sewage outfalls, and overcrowding which, combined with the intense local hydrodynamics and the lack of planning of recreational activities (zoning, warning signs, lifeguard coverage) may increase the risk of accidents for beachgoers, such as drowning, and injuries caused by motorboats, jet skis and stingrays. Despite all the problems identified, no response whatsoever was observed from the local authorities. The results of the DPSIR analysis indicate an urgent need for the implementation of beach management plans to improve the conditions of the beaches and in particular their safety, as well as identifying the obligations of the local authorities responsible for the future development of the Amazon coast.

Species-specific impacts of suspended sediments on gill structure and function in coral reef fishes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Reduced water quality, in particular increases in suspended sediments, has been linked to declines in fish abundance on coral reefs. Changes in gill structure induced by suspended sediments have been hypothesized to impair gill function and may provide a mechanistic basis for the observed declines; yet, evidence for this is lacking. We exposed juveniles of three reef fish species (Amphiprion melanopus, Amphiprion percula and Acanthochromis polyacanthus) to suspended sediments (0-180 mg l(-1)) for 7 days and examined changes in gill structure and metabolic performance (i.e. oxygen consumption). Exposure to suspended sediments led to shorter gill lamellae in A. melanopus and A. polyacanthus and reduced oxygen diffusion distances in all three species. While A. melanopus exhibited impaired oxygen uptake after suspended sediment exposure, i.e. decreased maximum and increased resting oxygen consumption rates resulting in decreased aerobic scope, the oxygen consumption rates of the other two species remained unaffected. These findings imply that species sensitive to changes in gill structure such as A. melanopus may decline in abundance as reefs become more turbid, whereas species that are able to maintain metabolic performance despite suspended sediment exposure, such as A. polyacanthus or A. percula, may be able to persist or gain a competitive advantage.																	0962-8452	1471-2954				NOV 15	2017	284	1866							20171279	10.1098/rspb.2017.1279								WOS:000414773600004	29093217

It does represent a major challenge for the coming decades. Since water is used for many different industrial, agricultural and domestic applications, a wide variety of waste effluents is being produced. Since conventional wastewater treatment plants, mainly based on biological processes, are poorly efficient for the treatment of toxic and/or non-biodegradable and/or highly concentrated effluents, new solutions are being looked for. Many different approaches have been investigated and catalytic processes may play a crucial role. Both oxidation and reduction processes for the treatment of chlorophenols have been reviewed. The principle of each of those processes is being described, the key parameters are identified and subsequently the major challenges to be overcome both in terms of material science and/or catalytic efficiency (activity and selectivity) are highlighted to offer a general but homogenized overview of the state-of-the-art in the different fields. Finally, the most recent developments in each field are shortly discussed.

Assessment of drinking water quality at the tap using fluorescence spectroscopy	WATER RESEARCH												Treated drinking water may become contaminated while travelling in the distribution system on the way to consumers. Elevated dissolved organic matter (DOM) at the tap relative to the water leaving the treatment plant is a potential indicator of contamination, and can be measured sensitively, inexpensively and potentially on-line via fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy. Detecting elevated DOM requires potential contamination events to be distinguished from natural fluctuations in the system, but how much natural variation to expect in a stable distribution system is unknown. In this study, relationships between DOM optical properties, microbial indicator organisms and trace elements were investigated for households connected to a biologically-stable drinking water distribution system. Across the network, humic-like fluorescence intensities showed limited variation (RSD = 3.5-4.4%), with half of measured variation explained by interactions with copper. After accounting for quenching by copper, fluorescence provided a very stable background signal (RSD < 2.2%) against which a similar to 2% infiltration of soil water would be detectable. Smaller infiltrations would be detectable in the case of contamination by sewage with a strong tryptophan-like fluorescence signal. These findings indicate that DOM fluorescence is a sensitive indicator of water quality changes in drinking water networks, as long as potential interferents are taken into account.

Control strategies for nitrous oxide emissions reduction on wastewater treatment plants operation	WATER RESEARCH												The present paper focused on reducing greenhouse gases emissions in wastewater treatment plants operation by application of suitable control strategies. Specifically, the objective is to reduce nitrous oxide emissions during the nitrification process. Incomplete nitrification in the aerobic tanks can lead to an accumulation of nitrite that triggers the nitrous oxide emissions. In order to avoid the peaks of nitrous oxide emissions, this paper proposes a cascade control configuration by manipulating the dissolved oxygen set-points in the aerobic tanks. This control strategy is combined with ammonia cascade control already applied in the literature. This is performed with the objective to take also into account effluent pollutants and operational costs. In addition, other greenhouse gases emissions sources are also evaluated. Results have been obtained by simulation, using a modified version of Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2, which takes into account greenhouse gases emissions. This is called Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2 Gas. The results show that the proposed control strategies are able to reduce by 29.86% of nitrous oxide emissions compared to the default control strategy, while maintaining a satisfactory tradeoff between water quality and costs.

Climate change change risks, extinction debt, and conservation implications for a threatened freshwater fish: Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Climate change is affecting many freshwater species, particularly fishes. Predictions of future climate change suggest large and deleterious effects on species with narrow dispersal abilities due to limited hydrological connectivity. In turn, this creates the potential for population isolation in thermally unsuitable habitats, leading to physiological stress, species declines or possible extirpation. The current extent of many freshwater fish species' spatio-temporal distribution patterns and their sensitivity to thermal impacts from climate change critical information for conservation planning are often unknown. Carmine shiner (Notropis percobromus) is an ecologically important species listed as threatened or imperilled nationally (Canada) and regionally (South Dakota, United States) due to its restricted range and sensitivity to water quality and temperature. This research aimed to determine the current distribution and spatio-temporal variability in projected suitable habitat for Carmine shiner using niche-based modeling approaches (MaxEnt, BIOCLIM, and DOMAIN models). Statistically down scaled, bias-corrected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) data was used to model the distribution of Carmine shiner in central North America for the period of 2041-2060 (2050s). Maximum mean July temperature and temperature variability were the main factors in determining Carmine shiner distribution. Patterns of projected habitat change by the 2050s suggest the spatial extent of the current distribution of Carmine shiner would shift north, with >50% of the current distribution changing with future projections based on two Representative Concentrations Pathways for CO2 emissions. Whereas the southern extent of the distribution would become unsuitable for Carmine shiner, suitable habitats are predicted to become available further north, if accessible. Importantly, the majority of habitat gains for Carmine shiner would be in areas currently inaccessible due to dispersal limitations, suggesting current populations may face an extinction debt within the next half century. These results provide evidence that Carmine shiner may be highly vulnerable to a warming climate and suggest that management actions - such as assisted migration - may be needed to mitigate impacts from climate change and ensure the long-term persistence of the species.

Differences in nitrate and phosphorus export between wooded and grassed riparian zones from farmland to receiving waterways under varying rainfall conditions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Agricultural activities in catchments can cause excessive nutrient loads in waterways. Catchment nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows may be intercepted and assimilated by riparian vegetation. While prior studies suggest that woody vegetation is preferable for reducing P loads, the question remains: is woody vegetation or grass cover more effective at reducing catchment N and P exports to waterways. To address this we investigated the relative importance of vegetation type, hydrologic and soil microbial processes on N and P losses from soil to a stream. The study involved the analysis of data from two soil microcosm experiments, and a field case study. We found P leaching loss from riparian zones depended significantly on vegetation type (woody vs. grass cover), with lower P exported from wooded riparian, zones, irrespective of the scale of rainfall. For N leaching losses, the scale of rainfall had an effect. During high rainfall, vegetation type had a major effect on N leaching loss, with lower N exported from grassed verses wooded riparian zones. However, under low rainfall conditions, soil type and soil C and N stores, potential indicators of soil microbial activity, rather than vegetation cover, affected N leaching. It is hypothesized that soil microbes were reducing N removal under these conditions. We reason that nitrifiers may have played an important role in soil N cycling, as increased soil ammonium had a strong positive effect on nitrate leaching loads, mediated through soil nitrate stores. Whereas, N immobilization, via incorporation into microbial biomass, and denitrification processes appeared to be limited by C availability, with increased C associated with reduced N leaching. Overall, this study identified that N leaching losses from riparian zones appeared to be affected by two different processes, vegetative uptake and soil microbial processes, the relative importance of which was driven by hydrological conditions.

In hydro-geochemically dis-homogeneous areas, the use of a unique regional NBL, higher than TV, could arise problems to distinguish between natural occurrences and anthropogenic contaminant sources. Hence, the goal of this study is to improve the NBL definition employing a geostatistical approach, which reconstructs the contaminant spatial structure accounting geochemical and hydrogeological relationships. This integrated mapping is fundamental to evaluate the contaminant's distribution impact on the NBL, giving indications to improve it. We decided to test this method on the Drainage Basin of Venice Lagoon (DBVL, NE Italy), where the existing NBL is seven times higher than the TV. This area is notoriously affected by naturally occurring arsenic contamination. An available geochemical dataset collected by 50 piezometers was used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of arsenic in the densely populated area of the DBVL A cokriging approach was applied exploiting the geochemical relationships among As, Fe and NH4 +. The obtained spatial predictions of arsenic concentrations were divided into three different zones: i) areas with an As concentration lower than the TV, ii) areas with an As concentration between the TV and the median of the values higher than the TV, and iii) areas with an As concentration higher than the median. Following the BRIDGE suggestions, where enough samples were available, the 90th percentile for each zone was calculated to obtain a local NBL (LNBL). Differently from the original NBL, this local value gives more detailed water quality information accounting the hydrogeological and geochemical setting, and contaminant spatial variation. Hence, the LNBL could give more indications about the distinction between natural occurrence and anthropogenic contamination. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xie, HI; Shen, ZY; Chen, L; Qiu, JL; Dong, JW				Xie Hui; Shen Zhenyao; Chen Lei; Qiu Jiali; Dong Jianwei			Time-varying sensitivity analysis of hydrologic and sediment parameters at multiple timescales: Implications for conservation practices	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Environmental models can be used to better understand the hydrologic and sediment behavior in a watershed system. However, different processes may dominate at different time periods and timescales, which highly complicate the model interpretation. The related parameter uncertainty may be significant and needs to be addressed to avoid bias in the watershed management. In this study, we used the time-varying and multi-timescale (TVMT) method to characterize the temporal dynamics of parameter sensitivity at different timescales in hydrologic and sediment modeling. As a case study, the first order sensitivity indices were estimated with the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) method for the Hydrological Simulation Program - Fortran (HSPF) model in the Zhangjiachong catchment in the Three Gorge Reservoir Region (TGRR) in China. The results were compared to those of the traditional aggregate method to demonstrate the merits of the TVMT method. The time-varying nature of the hydrologic and sediment parameters was revealed and explained mainly by the variation of hydro-climatic conditions. The baseflow recession parameter, evapotranspiration (ET) parameter for the soil storage, and sediment wash off parameter showed high sensitivities almost across the whole period. However, parameters related to canopy interception and channel sediment scour varied notably over time due to changes in the climate forcing. The timescale-dependent characteristics was observed and was most evident for the baseflow recession parameter and ET parameter. At last, the parameters affecting the sediment export and transport were discussed together with the inferred conservation practices. Reasonable controls for sediment must be storm-dependent. Compared to management practices on the land surface, practices affecting channel process would be more effective during storm events. Our results present one of the first investigations for sediment modeling in terms of the importance of parameter sensitivity in both time periods and evaluation timescales for the model calibration, diagnostic evaluation, and prioritizing efforts for conservation practices.

Microbial use of low molecular weight DOM in filtered and unfiltered freshwater: Role of ultra-small microorganisms and implications for water quality monitoring	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays a central role in regulating productivity and nutrient cycling in freshwaters. It is therefore vital that we can representatively sample and preserve DOM in freshwaters for subsequent analysis. Here we investigated the effect of filtration, temperature (5 and 25 degrees C) and acidification (HCI) on the persistence of low molecular weight (MW) dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON) and orthophosphate in oligotro-phic and eutrophic freshwater environments. Our results showed the rapid loss of isotopically-labelled glucose and amino acids from both filtered (0.22 and 0.45 mu m) and unfiltered waters. We ascribe this substrate depletion in filtered samples to the activity of ultra-small (<0.45 mu m) microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) present in the water. As expected, the rate of C, N and P loss was much greater at higher temperatures and was repressed by the addition of HCI. Based on our results and an evaluation of the protocols used in recently published studies, we conclude that current techniques used to sample water for low MW DOM characterisation are frequently inadequate and lack proper validation. In contrast to the high degree of analytical precision and rigorous statistical analysis of most studies, we argue that insufficient consideration is still given to the presence of ultra-small microorganisms and potential changes that can occur in the low MW fraction of DOM prior to analysis.

Since only very intensive and farreaching environmental policies could result in water quality improvements, valuing the restoration of the river presents many unique challenges. We develop a choice modeling approach to valuation of the restoration of this river, with general tightening of environmental policy as the policy, and an increase in prices as the payment vehicle. The estimation is performed in willingness to pay space, adjusting for heterogeneity of tastes. We find that respondents, who are primarily low income, exhibit higher willingness to pay for complete restoration than moderate restoration, higher for moderate restoration in comparison to minimal restoration, and that they prefer restoration sooner, rather than later.

J	Zhai, XY; Xia, J; Zhang, YY				Zhai, Xiaoyan; Xia, Jun; Zhang, Yongyong			Integrated approach of hydrological and water quality dynamic simulation for anthropogenic disturbance assessment in the Huai River Basin, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Detailed depiction of hydrological process and its associated pollution processes plays a critical role in environment improvement and management at basin scale. It also provides a useful tool to assess impact of potential factors on hydrological and water quality conditions. However, it was still difficult to well capture some typical characteristics of these complicated processes including built-in nonlinearity and time-variation, water infrastructure regulations, particularly for highly regulated basins. In this study, an integrated approach of hydrological and water quality dynamic simulation was proposed to solve these difficulties and assess the impacts of several anthropogenic disturbances. The Huai River Basin which was highly disturbed and seriously polluted, was selected as the study area. The main anthropogenic activities considered were point source pollution emissions, diffuse pollutant losses and dam regulations. Results showed that the integrated simulation could well capture the variations in water level, water discharge, concentrations of permanganate index (CODMn) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) in high (2007), normal (2008) and low (2004) flow years at 15 stations in the upper and middle streams of Huai River Basin. The regulation rules of downstream sluices played negative roles on water quality improvement if keeping current pollution sources, while those of middle stream sluices played positive roles on water quality improvement. However, the water quality deterioration was mainly attributed to emission of point source pollution (12%-43%), followed by diffuse pollutant loss (0-23%) and water quantity-oriented dam regulation (-29%-20%). The study was expected to provide technical supports for the implementation of water pollution control and sustainable water resources management in the Huai River Basin, and give a reference of integrated hydrological and hydrodynamic simulation.

Pesticide mixture risks were evaluated using three different scenarios for non-detects (best-case, worst-case and using the Kaplan-Meier method). The risk of each scenario was analyzed using Swedish Water Quality Objectives (WQO) and trophic-level specific environmental thresholds. Using the Kaplan-Meier method the environmental risk of 73% of the samples exceeded acceptable levels, based on an assessment using Concentration-Addition and WQOs for the individual pesticides. Algae were the most sensitive organism group. However, analytical detection limits, especially for insecticides, were insufficient to analyze concentrations at or near their WQO's. Thus, the risk of the analyzed pesticide mixtures to crustaceans and fish is systematically underestimated. Treating non-detects as being present at their individual limit of detection increased the estimated risk by a factor 100 or more, compared to the best-case or the Kaplan-Meier scenario. Pesticide mixture risks are often driven by only 1-3 compounds. However, the risk-drivers (i.e., individual pesticides explaining the largest share of potential effects) differ substantially between sites and samples, and 83 of the 141 monitored pesticides need to be included in the assessment to account for 95% of the risk at all sites and years. Single-substance oriented risk mitigation measures that would ensure that each individual pesticide is present at a maximum of 95% of its individual WQO, would also reduce the mixture risk, but only from a median risk quotient of 2.1 to a median risk quotient of 1.8. Also, acceptable total risk levels would still be exceeded in more than 70% of the samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Storm event-scale nutrient attenuation in constructed wetlands experiencing a Mediterranean climate: A comparison of a surface flow and hybrid surface-subsurface flow system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Among different Water Sensitive Urban Design options, constructed wetlands (CWs) are used to protect and restore downstream water quality by attenuating nutrients generated by stormwater runoff. This research compared the nutrient attenuation ability during a diverse population of storm events of two CWs: (a) a hybrid CW with multiple alternating surface flow (SF) and laterite-based subsurface flow (SSF) compartments, and (b) a single stage SF CW. Within storm variability, nutrient concentrations were assessed at 2 to 3-h intervals at both the main inlet and outlet of each CW. Dissolved oxygen concentrations of the surface waters were also monitored at 10-min intervals using high frequency in situ sensors. Nutrient loads into the CWs were observed to be higher when a high rainfall event occurred, particularly after longer antecedent dry conditions. Longer hydraulic retention times promoted higher attenuation at both sites. However, the relative extent of nutrient attenuation differed between the CW types; the mean total nitrogen (TN) attenuation in-the hybrid and SF CW was 45 and 48%, respectively. The hybrid ON attenuated 67% total phosphorus (TP) loads on average, while the SF ON acted as a net TP source. Periodic storm events transitioned the lentic ON into a lotic CW and caused riparian zone saturation; it was therefore hypothesized that such saturation of organic matter rich-riparian zones led to release of TP in the system. The hybrid CW attenuated the released TP in the downstream laterite-based SSF compartments. Diel oxygen metabolism calculated before and after the storm events was found to be strongly correlated with water temperature, solar exposure and antecedent dry condition during the pre-storm conditions. Furthermore, the SF ON showed a significant relationship between overall nutrient load attenuation and the change in oxygen metabolism during the storm perturbation, suggesting oxygen variation could be a useful proxy indicator of ON function.

Therefore, there is a need to develop efficient wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which can be operated in remote communities under extreme climatic conditions. WWIPs have been identified as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The objective of this work was to quantify the presence of nine different ARG markers (int1, sul1, sul2, tet(O), erm(B), mecA, blar(CIX-M), bla(TEM), and qnr(S)) in two passive systems (waste stabilization ponds [WSPs]) and one mechanical filtration plant operating in two smaller and one large community, respectively, in Nunavut, Canada. Measurement of water quality parameters (carbonaceous oxygen demand, ammonia, total suspended solids, Escherichia coli and total coliforms) showed that the WWTPs provided only primary treatment Low levels of the ARGs (2 log copies/mL) were observed in the effluent, demonstrating that bacteria residing in three northern WWTPs harbour ARGs conferring resistance to multiple clinically -relevant classes of antibiotics. Our results indicate that long-term storage in WSPs benefitted removal of organic material and some ARGs. However, one WSP system showed evidence of the enrichment of sul1, sul2, mecA, tet(O) and qnr(S). Further research is needed to fully understand if these ARG releases pose a risk to human health, especially in the context of traditional hunting and fishing activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The ditch receives runoff of agriculture and domestic wastewater from an adjacent community. During 2013, the occurrence of 38 organic pollutants (pesticides, poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), artificial sweeteners and pharmaceutical residues) was monitored monthly at five selected points in the ditch water. Additionally, sediment and Typha domingensis (cattail) plants were collected in March, June, and September 2013 and investigated concerning their ability to absorb and accumulate pollutants. The concentrations of the selected pollutants in the ditch water ranged from sub ng L-1 (metolachlor, atrazine) tow (metalaxyl, acesulfame). The metabolites endosulfan sulfate and endosulfan lactone exceeded mostly the concentration of the precursor insecticide endosulfan. Sorption on sediments was of minor relevance for accumulation of pollutants in the ditch system. Concentrations in the sediments varied seasonally and ranged from 0.2 to 12,432 mu g kg(-1) dry weight (d.w.). T. domingensis accumulated ten of the studied pollutants mainly in roots (5-1065 lig kg(-1) d.w.). Overall, the monitoring results of the ditch compartments indicated that downstream the concentrations of the target pollutants decreased. Under no -flow conditions in the hot season, the ditch revealed a noticeable potential to mitigate pollutants. Among the high microbial activity in the water and the subtropical climate conditions, the ditch vegetation contributed to natural attenuation of the selected pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ahn, SR; Kim, SJ				Ahn, So Ra; Kim, Seong Joon			Assessment of integrated watershed health based on the natural environment, hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Watershed health, including the natural environment, hydrology, water quality, and aquatic ecology, is assessed for the Han River basin (34 148 km(2)) in South Korea by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The evaluation procedures follow those of the Healthy Watersheds Assessment by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Six components of the watershed landscape are examined to evaluate the watershed health (basin natural capacity): stream geomorphology, hydrology, water quality, aquatic habitat condition, and biological condition. In particular, the SWAT is applied to the study basin for the hydrology and water-quality components, including 237 sub-watersheds (within a standard watershed on the Korea Hydrologic Unit Map) along with three multipurpose dams, one hydroelectric dam, and three multifunction weirs. The SWAT is calibrated (2005-2009) and validated (2010-2014) by using each dam and weir operation, the flux-tower evapotranspiration, the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture, and groundwater-level data for the hydrology assessment, and by using sediment, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen data for the water-quality assessment. The water balance, which considers the surface-groundwater interactions and variations in the stream-water quality, is quantified according to the sub-watershed-scale relationship between the watershed hydrologic cycle and stream-water quality. We assess the integrated watershed health according to the U.S. EPA evaluation process based on the vulnerability levels of the natural environment, water resources, water quality, and ecosystem components. The results indicate that the watershed's health declined during the most recent 10-year period of 2005-2014, as indicated by the worse results for the surface process metric and soil water dynamics compared to those of the 1995-2004 period. The integrated watershed health tended to decrease farther downstream within the watershed.

J	Mahato, M; Adhikari, B				Mahato, Manmatha; Adhikari, Basudam			Monitoring of drinking water quality: a preliminary approach by an electronic tongue based on functionalized polymer membrane electrodes	ANALYTICAL METHODS												Functionalized polymer membrane electrodes based multichannel sensor is used as an electronic tongue to monitor the drinking water (DW) quality simply by measuring the surface electric potential with respect to Ag/AgCl reference electrode in 1 mM aqueous KCl. Changes of minute concentration of dissolved minerals greatly affected the surface potential of the sensor. The three-channel sensor device (electronic tongue) is made by using three different functionalized polymer membrane electrodes, namely, phosphorylated hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride modified polyvinyl alcohol-polyacrylic acid membrane; phosphorylated and crosslinked polyvinyl-co-ethylene membrane; phosphorylated and crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol membrane, as working electrodes and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Developed electronic tongue is utilized for the sensing measurements of five different branded drinking water samples. Sensor characteristics, like, temporal stability, response stability, response patterns and repeatability of responses have been studied. Principal component analysis of the sensing data shows good discrimination among the analytes under study. Distinctive response patterns were observed for different drinking water samples in variation with the concentrations of dissolved minerals. Surprisingly sensor has done great job in order to monitor the dissolved minerals as present in tested samples with the help of standard calibrated sensing data.

Consistent reductions in clay soils compared to sandy loam were found for fresh water (FW) and TWW irrigation, respectively, in root water uptake, as well as in hydraulic conductivity of whole plant (K-s plant), stem (K-s stem) and root (K-s root). Transcript levels of most PIPs down-regulated following TWW irrigation in both soils, but relative gene expression of three PIPs was significantly higher in summer for sandy soil and FW than for clay soil and TWW; their mRNA levels was significantly correlated to Ks root. A pot experiment, which compared short term influences of saline and TWW found that both treatments, compared to FW, reduced root water uptake and PIPs mRNA levels by 2-fold after 20 days, and the decreases continued with time until the end of the experiment. These latter data indicated that salinity had an important influence. Our results suggest that plant hydraulic adjustment to soil texture and water quality occurs rapidly, i.e. within days, and is modulated by PIPs expression.																	2045-2322					NOV 13	2017	7								15429	10.1038/s41598-017-15762-2								WOS:000415022900065	29133958

Design and deployment of a smart system for data gathering in aquaculture tanks using wireless sensor networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS												The design of monitoring systems for marine areas has increased in the last years. One of the many advantages of wireless sensor networks is the quick process in data acquisition. The information from sensors can be processed, stored, and transmitted using protocols efficiently designed to energy saving and establishing the fastest routes. The processing and storing of data can be very useful for taking intelligent decisions for improving the water quality. The monitoring of water exchange in aquaculture tanks is very important to monitor the fish welfare. Thus, this paper presents the design, deployment, and test of a smart data gathering system for monitoring several parameters in aquaculture tanks using a wireless sensor network. The system based on a server is able to request and collect data from several nodes and store them in a database. This information can be postprocessed to take efficient decisions. The paper also presents the design of a conductivity sensor and a level sensor. These sensors are installed in several aquaculture tanks. The system was implemented using Flyport modules. Finally, the data gathering system was tested in terms of consumed bandwidth and the delay Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packets delivering data from the sensors.

Testing the microbial quality of drinking water at source (n = 29) and households (n = 43) of 29 peri-urban villages of Bengaluru city, indicated that 80% and 93% of samples respectively were unfit for human consumption as per WHO standards, i.e. nil E. coli in 100 ml sample. This also indicated that water gets contaminated further at the point-of-use when compared to the source. Forty-one per cent of the source drinking water samples had high E. coli counts which in turn means that the residing population face moderate to high risk of diarrhoea. A longitudinal study of the microbial quality of drinking water at source of supply (n = 45) was undertaken five times over an eight-month period in a subset of eight villages. Only around 18% of the total samples were microbially safe with nil E. coli/100 ml. Microbial contamination was found to be lower in January and March (<30 CFU/100 ml E. coli) when compared to December, May and September (>150 CFU/100 ml). Samples from Chikkakuntanahalli and Kodiyalakeranahalli had. 1000 CFU/100 ml E. coli. Total dissolved solids, calcium, magnesium, alkalinity and hardness in source drinking water of eight selected villages were beyond acceptable levels. The nitrate levels were consistently high and beyond WHO permissible levels. Alarming levels of microbial and chemical contamination of drinking water from the sites press for appropriate remedial measures to reduce health threats, particularly among vulnerable population.																	0011-3891					NOV 10	2017	113	9					1702	1709		10.18520/cs/v113/i09/1702-1709								WOS:000414605700028						
J	Gardade, L; Khandeparker, L				Gardade, Laxman; Khandeparker, Lidita			Spatio-temporal variations in pathogenic bacteria in the surface sediments of the Zuari estuary, Goa, India	CURRENT SCIENCE												Estuaries are hotspots of anthropogenic activities. The deposition of pathogenic bacteria in the sediment and their re-suspension into the water column are influenced by riverine discharge and tides. The abundance of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., total coliforms (TC) and Vibrio spp. (Vibrio cholerae (VC), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP), Vibrio alginolyticus (VA)) was assessed along with the total bacterial count (TBC) and total viable count (TVC) in surface sediments along the banks of the Zuari estuary, Goa, India. The study was carried out fortnightly for a period of 17 months covering three seasons, i.e. pre-monsoon (PreM), monsoon (MON) and postmonsoon (POM). The spatial and temporal changes in the quality of organic matter were also assessed. The organic matter content was high and rich in carbohydrates and proteins towards upstream sites. The quality of organic matter was influenced by the seasons. E. coli O157: H7 was detected only during MON towards the upstream stations. A negative correlation between TC and TBC with salinity was evident indicating the influence of land run-off. The Shigella spp. and VA were high towards the mouth of the estuary during PreM. However, during POM, the TVC, TC and VP were abundant towards the upstream and VC were abundant at the mouth of the estuary. Among the Vibrios, VP and VA were the most frequently occurring bacteria whereas TC and Shigella spp. were dominant among allochthonous pathogens in the sediments irrespective of space and time. In addition to influence of seasons, the sampling time influenced by tidal condition also played an important role in the population dynamics of pathogenic bacteria in the sediments. Future studies should address the interaction of pathogenic bacteria with suspended particles, their transport and survival in the sediments.																	0011-3891					NOV 10	2017	113	9					1729	1738		10.18520/cs/v113/i09/1729-1738								WOS:000414605700031

Increased sediment loads cause non-linear decreases in seagrass suitable habitat extent	PLOS ONE												Land-based activities, including deforestation, agriculture, and urbanisation, cause increased erosion, reduced inland and coastal water quality, and subsequent loss or degradation of downstream coastal marine ecosystems. Quantitative approaches to link sediment loads from catchments to metrics of downstream marine ecosystem state are required to calculate the cost effectiveness of taking conservation actions on land to benefits accrued in the ocean. Here we quantify the relationship between sediment loads derived from landscapes to habitat suitability of seagrass meadows in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. We use the following approach: (1) a catchment hydrological model generates sediment loads; (2) a statistical model links sediment loads to water clarity at monthly time-steps; (3) a species distribution model (SDM) factors in water clarity, bathymetry, wave height, and substrate suitability to predict seagrass habitat suitability at monthly time-steps; and (4) a statistical model quantifies the effect of sediment loads on area of seagrass suitable habitat in a given year. The relationship between sediment loads and seagrass suitable habitat is non-linear: large increases in sediment have a disproportionately large negative impact on availability of seagrass suitable habitat. Varying the temporal scale of analysis (monthly vs. yearly), or varying the threshold value used to delineate predicted seagrass presence vs. absence, both affect the magnitude, but not the overall shape, of the relationship between sediment loads and seagrass suitable habitat area. Quantifying the link between sediment produced from catchments and extent of downstream marine ecosystems allows assessment of the relative costs and benefits of taking conservation actions on land or in the ocean, respectively, to marine ecosystems.

J	Jiang, L; Xia, M				Jiang, Long; Xia, Meng			Wind effects on the spring phytoplankton dynamics in the middle reach of the Chesapeake Bay	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The spring phytoplankton bloom, bridging nutrient loading and summer hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay especially in its middle reach, is highly sensitive to physical forcing. In addition to riverine input, winds could be a noticeable driver of estuarine phytoplankton variability, affecting its water quality and ecosystem health. In this study, wind impacts on the spring bloom were investigated utilizing the 29-year (1985-2013) monitoring data and an existing FVCOM-ICM estuarine water quality model. The retrospective analysis revealed that winds exerted a significant control on the spring algal biomass in the middle bay, which could be as important as the effects of riverine inputs. According to the model simulation, the mid-bay spring algal bloom was mainly fueled by the riverine nutrients, and its biomass was higher on the western than that on the eastern flank. Numerical experiments indicated a negative relationship between stratification and the overall algal biomass. It was found that up-estuary (southerly) winds could induce upwelling, thus enhance primary production along the western shore, and increase phytoplankton transport to deeper waters, making up-estuary winds most effective in the mid-bay transverse phytoplankton enrichment. Given that the regional wind pattern is tightly coupled with the large-scale climatic variability, it is recommended to fully consider climatic effects on the lower food web in ecosystem management in the future.

Allocation of monitoring stations is the first step in the design of a water quality network. For this task, planning objectives are identified and a Multi-Objective Artificial Bee Colony-based optimization algorithm is designed and implemented in a Geographic Information System framework. Specifically, the number of stations is minimized in a range of values at the same time that the detection of lower compliance areas, the affected population and the relative importance of the river stretches are maximized. The estimation of pollutant parameters such as Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Faecal Coliform Bacteria or Total Dissolved Solids is performed by using the WorldQual model. This allows to objectively allocate monitoring stations to rivers where no real measurements are available, and thus it is especially relevant to allocate water quality stations for the first time. This approach has been tested on the Great Fish River basin (South Africa), finding networks improving the values of the objective functions between 22.22% and 47.83% with respect to the ones of the current network. Moreover, the solution analysis provides insightful and valuable information to the decision maker. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In Isiolo County, a semi-arid region lying in the northern part of Kenya, poor sanitation and water shortage remain a major problem facing the rural communities. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of the study was to assess the relationship between sanitation practices and the bacteriological quality of drinking water sources. The study also assessed the risk factors contributing to open defaecation in the rural environments of the study area. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 150 households was conducted to assess the faecal disposal practices in open defaecation free (ODF) and open defaecation not free (ODNF) areas. Sanitary surveys and bacteriological analyses were conducted for selected community water sources to identify faecal pollution sources, contamination pathways, and contributory factors. Analysis of data was performed using SPSS (descriptive and inferential statistics at alpha = .05 level of significance). RESULTS: Open defaecation habit was reported in 51% of the study households in ODNF villages and in 17% households in ODF villages. Higher mean colony counts were recorded for water samples from ODNF areas 2.0, 7.8, 5.3, and 7.0 (x10(3)) colony-forming units (CFUs)/100 mL compared with those of ODF 1.8, 6.4, 3.5, and 6.1 (x10(3)) areas for Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci, Salmonella typhi, and total coliform, respectively. Correlation tests revealed a significant relationship between sanitary surveys and contamination of water sources (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: The water sources exhibited high levels of contamination with microbial pathogens attributed to poor sanitation. Practising safe faecal disposal in particular is recommended as this will considerably reverse the situation and thus lead to improved human health.																	1178-6302					NOV 9	2017	11								UNSP 178630217735539	10.1177/1178630217735539								WOS:000423715400001	29051705

Estimating future temperature maxima in lakes across the United States using a surrogate modeling approach	PLOS ONE												A warming climate increases thermal inputs to lakes with potential implications for water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In a previous study, we used a dynamic water column temperature and mixing simulation model to simulate chronic (7-day average) maximum temperatures under a range of potential future climate projections at selected sites representative of different U.S. regions. Here, to extend results to lakes where dynamic models have not been developed, we apply a novel machine learning approach that uses Gaussian Process regression to describe the model response surface as a function of simplified lake characteristics (depth, surface area, water clarity) and climate forcing (winter and summer air temperatures and potential evapotranspiration). We use this approach to extrapolate predictions from the simulation model to the statistical sample of U.S. lakes in the National Lakes Assessment (NLA) database. Results provide a national-scale scoping assessment of the potential thermal risk to lake water quality and ecosystems across the U.S. We suggest a small fraction of lakes will experience less risk of summer thermal stress events due to changes in stratification and mixing dynamics, but most will experience increases. The percentage of lakes in the NLA with simulated 7-day average maximum water temperatures in excess of 30 degrees C is projected to increase from less than 2% to approximately 22% by the end of the 21st century, which could significantly reduce the number of lakes that can support cold water fisheries.

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between terrestrial net primary production (NPP) and the rate at which carbon is exported from the catchments in a temperate stream network. The analysis included more than 200 catchment areas in southwest Germany, ranging in size from 0.8 to 889 km(2) for which CO2 evasion from stream surfaces and downstream transport with stream discharge were estimated from water quality monitoring data, while NPP in the catchments was obtained from a global data set based on remote sensing. We found that on average 13.9 g Cm(-2)yr(-1) (corresponding to 2.7% of terrestrial NPP) are exported from the catchments by streams and rivers, in which both CO2 evasion and downstream transport contributed about equally to this flux. The average carbon fluxes in the catchments of the study area resembled global and large-scale zonal mean values in many respects, including NPP, stream evasion and the carbon export per catchment area in the fluvial network. A review of existing studies on aquatic-terrestrial coupling in the carbon cycle suggests that the carbon export per catchment area varies in a relatively narrow range, despite a broad range of different spatial scales and hydrological characteristics of the study regions.

J	Kim, SR; Getachew, BA; Kim, JH				Kim, Sang-Ryoung; Getachew, Bezawit A.; Kim, Jae-Hong			In Situ Healing of Compromised Membranes via Polyethylenimine-Functionalized Silica Microparticles	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Microscale damages to membranes used in large-scale filtration processes for water treatment can result in severe degradation of product water quality. One promising technology to address this issue is in situ healing of compromised membranes via healing agents that are added to the feed side of a membrane system and seal the defect site because of increased hydraulic drag through damage site during filtration. We herein introduce an improved in situ membrane healing method using amine-functionalized silica microparticles that is effective under varying operating conditions, overcoming limitations faced by previous healing agents such as chitosan agglomerates. The silica microparticles are functionalized with branched polyethylenimine (PEI) molecules for efficient interparticle cross-linking with glutaraldehyde. The PEI-decorated silica microparticles (SiO2@PEI MPs) were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential analysis. This study investigates the selective deposition of the SiO2@PEI MPs on the damage area using confocal laser scanning microscopy under variable cross-flow rate (0.5-2.0 L/min) and flushing time (10 to 30 min) conditions. The in situ healing technique recovered the particle rejection of compromised membranes to 99.1% of the original membrane's performance without any flux decline. The results of this study show that the use of SiO2@PEI MPs is a promising and practical approach to ensure membrane process integrity.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 7	2017	51	21					12630	12637		10.1021/acs.est.7b03436								WOS:000414887200065	29064689

This synergism in mixtures containing an azole has mostly been studied by effect measurements, while the underlying mechanism has been less well investigated. In this study, six azole fungicides (cyproconazole, epoxiconazole, ketoconazole, prochloraz, propiconazole, and tebuconazole) were selected to investigate their synergistic potential and their CYP inhibition strength in the aquatic invertebrate Gammarus pulex. The strobilurin fungicide azoxystrobin was chosen as co-occurring substrate, and the synergistic potential was measured in terms of internal concentrations of azoxystrobin and associated biotransformation products (BTPs). Azoxystrobin is biotransformed by various reactions, and 18 BTPs were identified. By measuring internal concentrations of azoxystrobin and its BTPs with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry in the presence and absence of azole fungicides followed by toxicokinetic modeling, we showed that the inhibition of CYP-catalyzed biotransformation reactions indeed played a role for the observed synergism. However, synergism was only observed for prochloraz at environmentally realistic concentrations. Increased uptake rate constants, an increase in the total internal concentration of azoxystrobin and its BTPs, in vivo assays for measuring CYP activities, and G. pulex video-tracking suggested that the 2-fold increase in bioaccumulation, and, thereby, the raised toxicity of azoxystrobin in the presence of prochloraz is not only caused by inhibited biotransformation but even more by increased azoxystrobin uptake induced by hyperactivity.

J	Moore, HE; Boldero, J				Moore, Harriet E.; Boldero, Jennifer			Designing Interventions that Last: A Classification of Environmental Behaviors in Relation to the Activities, Costs, and Effort Involved for Adoption and Maintenance	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY												Policy makers draw on behavioral research to design interventions that promote the voluntary adoption of environmental behavior in societies. Many environmental behaviors will only be effective if they are maintained over the long-term. In the context of climate change and concerns about future water security, behaviors that involve reducing energy consumption and improving water quality must be continued indefinitely to mitigate global warming and preserve scarce resources. Previous reviews of environmental behavior have focused exclusively on factors related to adoption. This review investigates the factors that influence both adoption and maintenance, and presents a classification of environmental behaviors in terms of the activities, costs, and effort required for both adoption and maintenance. Three categories of behavior are suggested. One-off behaviors involve performing an activity once, such as purchasing an energy efficient washing machine, or signing a petition. Continuous behaviors involve the performance of the same set of behaviors for adoption and for maintenance, such as curbside recycling. Dynamic behaviors involve the performance of different behaviors for adoption and maintenance, such as revegetation. Behaviors can also be classified into four categories related to cost and effort: those that involve little cost and effort for adoption and maintenance, those that involve moderate cost and effort for adoption and maintenance, those that involve a high cost or effort for adoption and less for maintenance, and those that involve less cost or effort for adoption and a higher amount for maintenance. In order to design interventions that last, policy makers should consider the factors that influence the maintenance as well as the adoption of environmental behaviors.																	1664-1078					NOV 6	2017	8								1874	10.3389/fpsyg.2017.01874								WOS:000414387400001	29163265

This study investigates diet dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics in one of these typical urbanised wetlands, in tropical North Queensland, Australia. High frequency data loggers (DO, temperature, depth) were deployed for several days over the summer months in different tidal pools and channels that fish use as temporal or permanent refuges. DO was extremely variable over a 24 h cycle, and across the small-scale wetland. The high spatial and temporal DO variability measured was affected by time of day and tidal factors, namely water depth, tidal range and tidal direction (flood vs ebb). For the duration of the logging time, DO was mainly above the adopted threshold for hypoxia (50% saturation), however, for around 11% of the time, and on almost every logging day, DO values fell below the threshold, including a severe hypoxic event (<5% saturation) that continued for several hours. Fish still use this wetland intensively, so must be able to cope with low DO periods. Despite the ability of fish to tolerate extreme conditions, continuing urban expansion is likely to lead to further water quality degradation and so potential loss of nursery ground value. There is a substantial discontinuity between the recommended DO values in the Australian and New Zealand Guidelines for Fresh and Marine Water Quality and the values observed in this wetland, highlighting the limited value of these guidelines for management purposes. Local and regional high frequency data monitoring programs, in conjunction with local exposure risk studies are needed to underpin the development of the management that will ensure the sustainability of coastal wetlands.

In this paper our main objective is to share the lessons learned from the innovative methodology used throughout the project. To achieve the proposed objectives, the multi-disciplinary scientific knowledge in the project team was combined and integrated with the knowledge and views of local stakeholders of four selected European coastal lagoons, using a three step participatory approach. With this innovative approach, which included the usage of eco-hydrological and water quality-modelling tools, the team developed and analyzed integrated scenarios of possible economic development and environmental impacts in four European lagoons and their catchments. These scenarios were presented and discussed with stakeholders, giving rise to management recommendations for each case study lagoon. Results show that some management options might be transferrable to other European lagoons having similar climatic, geophysical and socio-economic settings. In management terms, the project output provides a set of policy guidelines derived from the different analyses conducted and proposes initiatives concerning management implementation in a local-regional-national European setting.

Spatial and Seasonal Characterization of Water Quality in The Oueme River Basin (Republic of Benin, West Africa)	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												THE STUDY aims at evaluating the quality of the water in the Oueme River basin. Data were collected from October 2014 through September 2015. Physico-chemical parameters were assessed and the concentrations of dissolved heavy metals were determined. The results show both physical and chemical pollutions of the water according to a nonlinear pollution gradient. The middle basin up to the height of the city of Kaboua appears to be the most polluted segment. The Delta region, near the coast, is the second most polluted segment, and the remaining parts of the basin are the least polluted. Pollutant concentrations are highest during the low flow season. Cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of sampled sites reveals that Atchakpa-Rejet and Kaboua have high concentrations of nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, orthophosphate, conductivity, TDS, pH, calcium, magnesium, and total hardness. Kpassa, Beterou, and Atchakpa-Bethel have high dissolved oxygen and high transparency values. All other sites have high alkalinity. During the low flow season, Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu were detected at concentrations exceeding ecological standards in most of the sites. The Water Quality Index (WQI) ranged from 52.7 to 80.9, meaning that water in that river basin can be classified either as marginal quality, moderately polluted, or good quality for aquatic life. Overall, water in the Oueme River basin is under high and increasing influence of human activities.																	0449-2285	2357-0245				NOV-DEC	2017	60	6					1077	1090		10.21608/ejchem.2017.1463.1095								WOS:000429319300011

Conductivity is an important parameter in salinity evaluation which can reflect the salinity of the water. Therefore, the conductivity of calcareous sand has great significance in water quality evaluating of calcareous sand in marine environment. In this paper, we selected an exposed open calcium sand on a calcareous sand island, and buried triple sensors of soil conductivity, volumetric water content and temperature at the depths of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 m to monitor the calcareous sand conductivity and volumetric water content. The relationship between calcareous sand conductivity and pore water conductivity is analyzed based on conductivity and volumetric water content site observation, conductivity indoor testing and Manta2 water quality sensor verification of calcareous sand with different gradations. The results show that the conductivity of calcareous sands has linear relationship with the volumetric water content and the conductivity of pore water respectively, and then promote a calculation model for the conductivity of calcareous sand.																	1000-7598					NOV	2017	38			2			158	162		10.16285/j.rsm.2017.S2.021								WOS:000427563400021

Water quality was evaluated and compared with standard of water quality criteria. Results and Discussion: The three of most bacterial isolations in Tilapia fish from well-typed fish ponds were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Edwardsiella tarda and coagulase negative Staphylococci. While, K. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus group D non enterococci were isolated from Tilapia fish, which feeding on river floating baskets. Therefore, only K. pneumoniae and C. albicans were isolated from fry in nursery fish pond. Penicillin and ampicillin resistance were occurred in K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis. Water qualities of fish water farms were evaluated and almost of water parameters were to water standard quality, except ammonia and alkaline values were higher and lower than reference values, respectively. Conclusions: We were deduced that growing of pathogens in fishes, especially K. pneumoniae may relate to water environment However, antibiotic resistance of isolated bacteria may concern as zoonotic pathogens.																	1755-6783	0974-6005				NOV-DEC	2017	10	6					1563	1568		10.4103/ATMPH.ATMPH_511_17								WOS:000426375900037

SWAT modeling of hydrology, sediment and nutrients from the Grand River, Ontario	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												The Grand River watershed (GRW) is an important agricultural area in Southern Ontario. Land use has been modified by various human endeavors, altering hydrology and increasing export of sediment and nutrients. The objective of this study was to predict spatial and temporal patterns of hydrology, and export of sediment and nutrients from the GRW to Lake Erie using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. The Sequential Uncertainty FItting (SUFI2) program was used to calibrate and validate stream flow for years 2001-2010. Calibration and validation of the SWAT model for monthly stream flow at York indicated good model performance (R-2, NSE, and PBIAS = 0.64, 0.63 and 7.1 for calibration (2001-2005); =0.82, 0.74 and 0.2, for validation (2006-2010)). The model was applied to predict sediment and nutrient export from the GRW into Lake Erie. Predicted loading at Dunnville (near the mouth) was 2.3 x 10(5) tonnes y(-1) total suspended sediment, 7.9 x 10(3) tonnes y(-1) TN, and 2.3 x 10(2) tonnes y(-1) TP. This SWAT model can now be used to investigate the relative effects of best management practices, and to forecast effects of climate change, on sustainable water management, hydrology, and sediment and nutrient export to Lake Erie.																	1201-3080					NOV	2017	52	4					243	257		10.2166/wqrj.2017.014								WOS:000426183000002

Modeling nutrient removal using watershed-scale implementation of the two-stage ditch	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) is the most intensively farmed region of the Great Lakes. Because of the flat topography and poorly-drained soils many farmers rely on drainage management practices (e.g., subsurface tile drainage, ditch channelization) to maintain productive agriculture. However, these practices also facilitate the delivery of excess nutrients and sediments to Lake Erie, which have been linked to recurring harmful algal blooms (HABs) and associated environmental degradation. Implementation of inset floodplains in formerly channelized waterways via the two-stage ditch can improve water quality but the efficacy has been tested using only implementation in short reaches. Watershed models are critical tools for assessing watershed-scale implementation and as such can guide effective management. We evaluated the effectiveness of the two-stage ditch in improving water quality in the River Raisin Watershed (RRW), a major subbasin in the WLEB, combining empirical measurements for nutrient reductions from two-stage ditches across the Midwest with output from a Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. We modeled two-stage implementation in 25, 50, and 100% of headwater reaches in the RRW, and found that the practice could reduce total annual NO3--N export by 2, 5 and 10%, respectively. The two-stage was even more effective at reducing total phosphorus (TP) export, which was reduced by 12, 20 and 31%, respectively. Compared to other conservation practices, nutrient reduction efficiency for the two-stage ditch was good, both in terms of percent load reduction and cost, but watershed-scale adoption will be required in order to achieve significant nutrient reductions as called for by policymakers.

Subsurface tile drained area detection using GIS and remote sensing in an agricultural watershed	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Subsurface tile drainage has been used around the globe to lower the water table and drain soils that are seasonally or perennially wet making them suitable for agriculture and/or increasing productivity. However, tile drainage systems have a negative impact on water quality of adjacent streams and ditches due to the transport of excess fertilizer nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from fields. To support nutrient management and conservation practices like drain water management (DWM), accurate delineation of the agricultural area drained by tiles is critical for quantifying nutrient yields (nutrient mass per area per time) to downstream water bodies. In this study, we tested Geographic Information System decision tree classification (GIS DTC) and satellite remote sensing based methods (i.e., image differencing) to determine tile drainage area in an agricultural watershed, Shatto Ditch Watershed (SDW) in Indiana, USA. Using these techniques, we estimated that 79% of the cultivated area of SDW is tile drained with 94% accuracy according to the image differencing approach whereas 55% is classified as tile drained with an accuracy of 75% based on estimates from the DTC approach with the most relaxed rule thresholds (where tiles exist on <= 4% slope with poorly and moderately well drained soils). Using satellite imagery to characterize tile drained area at a high resolution over large geographical extent shows promise and will be important for accurately quantifying nutrient yields from tiles which will inform management and conservation efforts to reduce excess nutrient export to downstream water bodies.

Phosphorus concentrations in a Florida Everglades water conservation area before and after El Nino events in the dry season	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The Florida Everglades depends on both seasonal hydroperiods and low nutrient loading. This study investigated phosphorus concentrations in a 237,000-ha wetland complex in the Greater Florida Everglades known as Water Conservation Area 3A (WCA-3A). WCA-3A is south and downstream of Lake Okeechobee and most of the agricultural activity in the Everglades region, but immediately north and upstream of the Everglades National Park. The original goal of the study was to investigate if this water conservation area was serving as a phosphorus sink during a 9-month period (October 2015 to June 2016) that normally would have bracketed the dry winter season of south Florida. The beginning of 2016 brought several unexpected polar fronts with high rainfall, an unusual weather pattern in subtropical Florida later confirmed to have been caused by an El Nino condition in the Pacific Ocean. Samples taken at the beginning of the dry season (October through December 2015 during pre-El Nino conditions) showed low phosphorus concentrations. In April and June 2016 during post-El Nino conditions, monthly average total phosphorus concentrations averaged 7.1-7.2 ppb total phosphorus in inflow region of WCA-3A, significantly higher (P = 0.030 and 0.045) than 3.0 and to 2.6 ppb in the wetland's outflow region. The wetland was found to be a sink of phosphorus with a 47% decrease in total phosphorus from north to south during this post- El Nino time. If future additional wetlands and water quality strategies are not in place to mitigate fluxes of phosphorus during future climate variations such as this El Nino condition, this wetland complex may take on an even greater role of protecting the water quality of the downstream Everglades National Park.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				391	395		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.028								WOS:000423883000005						
J	Mitsch, WJ				Mitsch, William J.			Solving Lake Erie's harmful algal blooms by restoring the Great Black Swamp in Ohio	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Harmful algal blooms are now a common occurrence around the world in these Anthropocene times because of fertilization of phosphorus and nitrogen for crop and animal production. One of the most dramatic cases in North America is the recent accelerated eutrophication of Lake Erie in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Also, we have lost, by some estimates, 50% of the world's wetlands in the 20th century and 90% of the wetlands in Ohio USA over the 19th and 20th centuries. We are proposing a serious analysis of an ecological engineering opportunity to restore parts of the former 400,000 ha (1 million acre) Great Black Swamp that was immediately southwest of Lake Erie in Ohio and is now one of the major sources of agricultural phosphorus to western Lake Erie through the Maumee River. Restoring and creating 20,000-40,000 ha (50,000-100,000 acres) or 5-10% of the original wetlands in the Black Swamp to optimize nutrient reduction could reduce phosphorus loading by 480-960 metric tons/year or 18-37% percent of the annual phosphorus loading by the Maumee River to Lake Erie. A thorough investigation of this idea will first require physical (mull-year mesocosm experiments), mathematical, and business models to explore biogeochemical, hydrologic and economic feasibility and reliability. If this presents reasonable results, it would be followed by the creation of a small 400-1000 ha (1000-2500 acre) demonstration treatment wetland in the Black Swamp region to see if wetland performance will scale up as predicted with the mesocosm and mathematical models. Only after a decade of studies at these smaller scale models and a demonstration levels would the full-scale nutrient retention wetlands be implemented in the former Black Swamp. When completed, these treatment wetlands would cover about 10% of the Great Black Swamp region and could remove, with proper ecological engineering design, 40% or more of the phosphorus load from the Maumee River Basin now going into Lake Erie.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				406	413		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.040								WOS:000423883000007

Design of real-time and long-term hydrologic and water quality wetland monitoring stations in South Florida, USA	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Hydrologic regimes in tropical and subtropical regions (e.g. hurricanes, tropical storms, and droughts) impact biogeochemical processes in created and restored wetlands with variability of wet/dry seasons and extreme weather events. Our South Florida Wetland Monitoring Network (SFWMN) with three real-time hydrologic, water quality, and meteorological field stations was established by the Everglades Wetland Research Park of Florida Gulf Coast University in the subtropical Southwest Florida, USA, beginning in 2012. The stations include a restored freshwater marsh (RFM) and adjacent meteorological field station; a restored brackish water marsh (RBM); and a created freshwater treatment wetland system and adjacent meterological station (CFTW). Continuous observations of water depth, temperature, salinity, and pH for the period of January 2012 to January 2016 indicate significant differences among the restored freshwater marsh, the restored brackish marsh, and the created freshwater treatment wetlands for water temperature and pH for wet and dry seasons. The brackish wetland salinity fluctuated between 26.16 (in the dry season) to 1.03 ppt (in the wet season). The real-time dataset allowed up-to-date information of the frequency and duration of severe weather events illustrating, for example, that 70% of the 2012 annual rainfall (1129 mm) occurring in July and August with a 75.4 mm precipitation during one event tropical storm Isaac on August 26-28, 2012. This storm led to a water stage peak in the brackish wetland due to excessive watershed runoff, not tidal surges, and salinity decreased from 22.3 to 5.5 ppt. The coefficient of variation (CV) for water depth and water quality from all wetland monitoring stations exhibited similar variations during all seasons, except when the salinity for the brackish marsh (RBM) had the highest CV values (1.02) in the wet season. Principal component analysis (PCA) at each station identified the variance in water depth and water quality parameters as due to seasonal changes of precipitation in distinct wet and dry seasons. The data from these monitoring stations are also used for research by scholars and students as well as for teaching a better understanding of wetlands dynamics and function in the classroom. As a whole, these stations are being used to bring awareness about the fragile and unique hydrological conditions of wetlands in subtropical Southwest Florida, especially for long-term conditions related to sea level changes and more frequent tropical storms.

Relative importance of external and internal phosphorus loadings on affecting lake water quality in agricultural landscapes	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Internal phosphorus (P) loading from the sediment poses a high risk of being an additional P source to deteriorate water quality. Previous studies hypothesized that internal P loads can be as high as external P inputs, especially in P enriched landscapes such as agricultural areas. However, internal P loadings in eutrophic conditions are rarely quantified or compared with external P loads. In this study, we aimed to answer these three questions; 1) how much P is internally released from the sediment of hypereutrophic lakes? 2) how much do internal P loads contribute to lake water quality compared to external loads? and 3) what factors regulate the release and retention of P in the sediment? We selected four hypereutrophic lakes located in Eastern Nebraska. In the study lakes and watersheds, internal and external P loads were quantified in 2014. Total P concentrations of inflow water collected from primary water channels feeding the study lakes and daily inflow water discharge rates were used to calculate external P loads. Internal P loads were quantified from flow-through soil core incubation experiments. External TP loads varied temporarily depending on the changes in discharge, and were highest during spring storm events. The majority of internal P loading (i.e. P release from sediment) occurred in the summer when lakes experience strong stratification (i.e. anaerobic conditions). This is likely associated with oxygen availability in the sediments and chemical dissolution of P. By comparing the annual-scale of external and internal P inputs, external P loadings were still the dominant P source to the lakes, contributing up to 98% of the total P input whereas internal P loadings accounted for 4-12% of the total P input. Although internal P loads were relatively minor on an annual time scale, we found that summer internal loadings in some of study lakes exceeded their external loadings. Our results confirmed the dominant influence of external P loadings on water quality in the reservoirs. This suggests that non-point source controls and watershed management strategies to reduce external loadings should be implemented prior to internal P loading controls. Internal P loadings can be a significant P source, even if just temporarily, worsening water quality of agricultural reservoirs and downstream ecosystems in the summer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Riparian forests play a major role in protecting water quality, and there is a need to assess the role of riparian restoration in reducing nutrients and sediment loading. This study uses watershed simulation modeling to evaluate impacts of riparian forest restoration on water quality in a tropical agricultural watershed. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate streamflow, suspended sediment and nutrients of the Sarapui River watershed, located in southeast Brazil. We observe a spatial and temporal variation in water quality impacts of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and rainfall patterns. Watersheds with agricultural and some residential areas had a higher sediment and nutrients loads than forest and with pasture land uses, especially during the wet season. Forested watersheds in general had a better water quality than other LULC types. Riparian restoration in the study watershed can reduce suspended sediment (9.26%), total nitrogen (22.6%), and total phosphorus (7.83%). Protecting riparian zone and site-conservation practices is critical to improve water quality. We observe that the simulation model provides a satisfactory baseline of the watershed system to evaluate impacts of land use changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hsu, TTD; Mitsch, WJ; Martin, JF; Lee, J				Hsu, Tsung-Ta David; Mitsch, William J.; Martin, Jay F.; Lee, Jiyoung			Towards sustainable protection of public health: The role of an urban wetland as a frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetlands are known for providing important ecosystem services, such as reduction of eutrophication. However, less research has focused on public health service of wetlands: their ability to protect microbial quality of water for downstream while they attract wildlife populations. For urban surface water, transmission of antibiotic resistance is also an important concern. Under anticipated climate change scenarios, more extreme precipitation patterns are emerging. Thus, runoff and flooding from increased precipitation will impair surface water quality more significantly. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the dynamics of bacteria of public health concern in urban wetlands, including: Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Arcobacter, and two antibiotic resistance genes (sulfonamide, sul1 and tetracycline, tetQ); and 2) identify the major fecal contamination sources using microbial source tracking (MST). Water samples were collected across the urban wetlands in central Ohio from June 2013 to June 2014 and tested with a culture-based (E. coli) and quantitative PCR (the rest) methods. Since Canada geese were the most observed wildlife at the study sites and they are known to carry an array of infectious disease agents, their fecal samples were also collected. From the water samples, E. coli (fecal indicator) had the highest occurrence in 99.2% of the total samples, followed by sul1 (98.3%), Arcobacter (94.9%), STEC (74.6%), tetQ (58.5%), and Campylobacter (1.7%). Overall reduction in E. coli was 22.3% across the wetlands, but variation was observed depending on the season. Microbial source tracking suggested a high prevalence of avian- (44.9%) and ruminant- (38.1%) originated fecal contaminations (e.g., Canada geese and deer). From the geese fecal samples, STEC (93.2%) and Arcobacter (4.5%) were detected, which could potentially compromise wetlands functions in reductions in bacteria of public health concern and antibiotic resistance. The results suggest that careful wildlife management together with long-term monitoring of microorganisms of concern are needed for making urban wetlands as a sustainable frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread in surface water.

J	Marion, JW; Zhang, F; Cutting, D; Lee, J				Marion, Jason W.; Zhang, Feng; Cutting, David; Lee, Jiyoung			Associations between county-level land cover classes and cyanobacteria blooms in the United States	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Cyanobacteria blooms can cause public health concerns related to drinking water quality and water recreation. The rapidly changing global climate is anticipated to bring about an increased frequency of extreme weather events (e.g. stronger storms, more extensive droughts), which are expected to promote more frequent cyanobacteria blooms that persist for longer durations in freshwater. Land use planning, landscape management, and ecological engineering may present mitigation opportunities for decreasing the occurrence and intensity of current and future cyanobacteria blooms through improved nutrient management strategies thereby reducing eutrophication of watersheds. To examine the potential impacts of various land cover classes (and their relative density) on cyanobacteria bloom coverage, county-level data were obtained or generated from the National Land Cover Database and the national nutrient inputs to the land surface database. These data were paired with county-level estimates of cyanobacteria bloom area obtained by satellite-based MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer). Multivariable zero-inflated beta regression models were constructed for the U.S. and five U.S. regions for assessing the relationships between the proportion of county area experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom, county land cover types, and nutrient loading. The land cover type associated with the greatest decreases in bloom area in the national model was deciduous forest (p < 0.001). Open water extent (p = 0.001) and nitrogen loading from manure (p = 0.002) and fertilizer (p < 0.001) were positively associated with the proportion of water characterized as experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom. A significant interaction (p < 0.001) was observed between cultivated crop coverage and open water extent. Overall, increasing cultivated crop coverage was associated with increasing proportions of cyanobacteria blooms. Low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity development land uses were not associated with bloom coverage in the national model, although development land uses were positively associated in several regional models. Ultimately, there is evidence that county-level land cover and nutrient loading, notably N in the national model, can impact countylevel cyanobacteria bloom coverage. Given regional model differences, additional remote sensing-based studies that examine watershed-based effects on cyanobacteria coverage are needed to establish watershed-specific associations. Studies that transcend county boundaries may provide greater utility than this correlational study for better characterizing land uses and mitigation measures that impact or could impact cyanobacteria bloom coverage in U.S. surface waters.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				556	563		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.032								WOS:000423883000022

The potential for wetland systems to act as sinks for various types of pollutants indicates their potential for mitigating algal blooms. Although nutrient uptake in terrestrial treatment wetland systems has received substantial attention in the literature, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in floating constructed wetland (FCW) function for algal control and whether plant species can optimise performance. Here, the effect of FCWs on water quality including nutrient levels and algal biomass was investigated, along with the effect of planting with different species of macrophyte. All the planted FCWs showed significant potential for algal bloom mitigation in both hypereutrophic and mesotrophic systems; algal biomass control is proposed to be due to the direct uptake of nitrate and phosphate via macrophyte roots, rather than algaecidal effect of phenolic compounds. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release was found to differ between species, with implications for drinking water treatment.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				581	588		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.033								WOS:000423883000025

Phosphorus (P) impairment of fresh surface waters is a major concern in the USA and worldwide. The aim of this study is to use a bench scale P removal system that utilizes electrocoagulation (EC) to address this water quality problem. This study examined the effects of treatment parameters (initial pH, initial conductivity, power input, and initial P concentration) on the ability of the EC process to remove P in solutions with initial P concentrations less than 2 mg/L. It also investigated the ability of EC to reduce concentrations of P in surface water and treated wastewater. P concentrations in phosphate solutions, surface water, and wastewater effluent were reduced by 99% in under 60 min. The removal efficiency was demonstrated to be directly proportional to the conductivity and power supplied.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				589	596		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.031								WOS:000423883000026

This study investigated the feasibility of applying nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) as a complementary treatment after membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment of source-separated urine. Experiments were conducted on a lab scale with a synthetic effluent containing natural organic matter representative of urine after MBR treatment. The performances of NF and RO in terms of productivity and water quality were compared. NF and RO could remove more than 95% of total organic carbon which is composed mainly of humic and fulvic acids. NF could only reduce the conductivity by less than 45% whereas RO removed more than 80% of ions which would make water reuse more feasible. A complete short-term fouling analysis by membrane autopsy was performed in order to understand the different contributions of organic and inorganic components on NF and RO fouling. The obtained results showed that NF was more prone to scaling as water rinsing and chemical cleaning were not fully effective in removing mineral deposits. RO seemed less prone to organic fouling and scaling than NF.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	95						18	33		10.5004/dwt.2017.21441								WOS:000423703500003

Specifically, fuzzy regression analysis can supply useful information about the validity of measured quantities. This article examines the variation of certain quality characteristics of groundwater in boreholes using fuzzy methodology. Traditionally, classical correlation analysis was used to depict the relation between the dependent variable and the independent variables. Classical regression is considered to be probabilistic and has many uses but can be problematic: (a) if the data set is small, (b) if the error distribution is not normal, (c) if there is uncertainty between dependent and independent variables or if linearity acceptance is not proper. For the previous reasons fuzzy regression analysis is preferable. Water was sampled from these boreholes by Institute of Geology and Mineral Exploration from 2005 to 2008 and the concentration spread of Ca, K and Mg ions was examined. Using fuzzy regression, the range of these concentrations was calculated during the period under consideration with inclusion equations and results are presented in graphic form. All the measured values were taken into account in order to obtain an estimation of future measurement accuracy with a confidence level according to historical values and similar regional conditions.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	95						45	50		10.5004/dwt.2017.21525								WOS:000423703500005

This study aimed at assessing the spatial distribution of water quality of 23 Rwandan rivers that drain into the Lake Kivu by using the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) and the River Pollution Index (RPI). The study collected field data and analyzed the parameters of the NSFWQI and RPI including suspended solids, turbidity, biological oxygen demand, nitrate, temperature, total phosphorus, pH, fecal coliform and dissolved oxygen. For gathering details related to entities adjacent to rivers, land use and land cover, topography and rainfall have been analyzed. The results showed that good water quality (negligibly polluted) was located in areas dominated by forestland while bad and very bad (39%, 26%) classes of rivers (severely polluted) were influenced by the dominance of farmland. Moreover, 22% of rivers in medium class were equivalent to 26% moderately polluted due to the disturbance of other land use types and other factors such as slope and tropical rainfall.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	95						118	127		10.5004/dwt.2017.21566								WOS:000423703500013						
J	Boussouga, YA; Lhassani, A				Amine Boussouga, Youssef; Lhassani, Abdelhadi			Modeling of fluoride retention in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes for single and binary salt mixtures	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												High levels of fluoride in groundwater cause a major problem for drinking water quality in many countries around the world. In addition to reverse osmosis (RO), recent publications indicate that nanofiltration (NF) is a promising technology to deal with fluoride removal from aqueous solutions. First of all, a characterization of commercial NF and RO membranes was performed in terms of hydraulic permeability (L-p and L'(p)) and contact angle (theta). Then, performances of the selected membranes on Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42- as well as F-rejection were determined within a laboratory study in simple salt. At 10 mg/L of concentration, pH = 6.7 and 10 bar, the rejections of fluoride with NF270, NF90 and BW30 were 63%, 91% and 97%, respectively. The influence of sulfate, chloride, nitrate and bicarbonate on fluoride rejection was also studied in binary mixtures with different concentration ratios (1/1, 1/2 and 2/1). Unlike the divalent anions, the results have shown that higher concentrations of monovalent anions affect positively fluoride rejection. Experimental data of fluoride rejection were modeled by using Spiegler-Kedem-Katchalsky model, first to confirm the experiment by calculating the non-linear parameter (chi(2)), and second to evaluate transfer mechanisms (convection and diffusion) of fluoride ions by estimating the phenomenological parameters of mass transfer (s and Ps) for the selected NF and RO membranes in simple and binary mixture. For NF membranes, a duality between both transfer mechanisms was recorded which was strongly affected by the feed composition.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	95						162	169		10.5004/dwt.2017.21502								WOS:000423703500017

In this study, we examined the effects of fish stocking density on water quality and biomass yields in a recirculating aquaponic-membrane filtration system used for co-culturing tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and water spinach (Ipomoea aquatica). The system was composed of a fish tank, sludge tank with a filtration membrane, and hydroponic tank. Tilapia (average initial weight, 1.8 g) was examined at three densities: 450 (low), 600 (medium), and 750 (high) individuals per tank. The initial density of water spinach was 8.3 g m(-2). The experimental period with no water exchange lasted for 12 weeks. Our results revealed that the increasing density of tilapia correlated positively with the increasing weight gain of water spinach but negatively with the growth of tilapia. The average weight gains were 10.8, 8.3, and 4.0 g in the low-, medium-, and high-density groups, respectively. The levels of NH4+-N, NO2--N, NO3--N, orthophosphate, biochemical oxygen demand, total bacterial counts, and turbidity in the fish and plant tank effluents were significantly higher in the high-density group than in the low-density group. The total weight gains of plants were 1,204, 1,402, and 1,708 g in the low-, medium-, and high-density groups, respectively. These results indicated that membrane filtration combined with a hydroponic component maintained a suitable water quality in the system for the survival of fish. However, the highest fish biomass gained was observed in the medium-density group, and the highest plant yield was obtained in the high-density group.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						22	32		10.5004/dwt.2017.20959								WOS:000423704600004

The former required qualified effluents for capable using in desired recycling purposes, and needed to demonstrate stability of the proposed system under extreme conditions. A mobile pilot plant composed of submerged microfiltration (sMF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was applied to commit aforementioned issues in recycling BSE on site. Even an emergent shutdown caused by typhoon (shock chemical oxygen demand was more than three times, 210 m.L-1, of normal BSE, 85.7 mg.L-1), excellent water quality still fulfilled requirements for cooling water make-up or process water in petrochemical manufacturing. Stability of the integrated membrane system (IMS) was therefore proved, average flow rates of sMF and RO were, respectively, 10.40 +/- 0.29 and 4.47 +/- 0.41 L min(-1), as well as effective membrane fouling control was implemented. Economic attractive of the proposed IMS was presented by evaluating capital (CAPEX) and operational expenditures (OPEX) of the sMF-one pass RO (0.45 USD.m(-3) for OPEX and 0.28 USD.m(-3) for CAPEX) and further upgrading to sMF-two pass RO (0.52 and 0.32 USD.m(-3), respectively) for full-scale reclamation project.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						45	54		10.5004/dwt.2017.21463								WOS:000423704600006

Optimization of filtration to relaxation mode using woven fiber microfiltration system for water and wastewater treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												In this study, the fouling behavior of flat sheet woven fiber microfiltration (WFMF) system for water and wastewater treatment was investigated. In the first phase, WFMF system was operated for treating wastewater under filtration to relaxation mode (FRM) of 30(min)-10(min), 45(min)-15(min) and 60(min)-20(min) corresponding to 36, 24 and 18 cycles/d, operated at an average flux of 8 L/m(2)/h. Results revealed that 45(min)-15(min) was optimum FRM while variation in removal rate of COD, PO43--P and NH4+-N was 58%-71%, 21%-34% and 16%-30%, respectively. In the second phase, WFMF system was evaluated for water treatment having turbidity of 23-50 NTU, total suspended solids (TSS) 200-400 mg/L and fecal coliform (FC) 120 +/- 20 CFU/100 mL under optimized FRM. The removal rates of turbidity, TSS and FC were 64%-96%, 58%-85% and 2-3 log, respectively. Physical and chemical cleaning were applied separately on the membrane and it was found that pore blockage causing irreversible fouling can only be removed by chemical cleaning.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						69	75		10.5004/dwt.2017.21277								WOS:000423704600009

To minimize damage from the effluent, its effect on the ecosystem should be figured out by predicting and monitoring through modeling as well as on-site investigation. This study used four steps of environmental impact assessment; pollutant source identification, analysis of the acceptor ecosystem, analysis of the links between source and acceptor, and mitigation suggestions. In each step of the assessment, pollution sources were identified and affected ecosystem was analyzed. Their correlation was also analyzed to propose efficient facility operation methods to reduce environmental impacts. On-site water quality survey and Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code modeling were also performed to predict and assess the environmental impacts of the effluent discharge to the Yeongil Bay region. The result showed that T-N and T-P in region near to the effluent outlet increased, resulting in rapid growth of chlorophyll-a, which might lead to a red tide.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						201	210		10.5004/dwt.2017.21036								WOS:000423704600025

The environmental statistical techniques were used to identify the clustering development on the tropical river system using hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis (HACA), discriminant analysis (DA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The HACA results indicated that the main of Pahang tropical river system is classed into three main clusters namely the upstream reach, middle stream reach and downstream reach. The calibration and validation analyses proved the DA with 100% confident level. The PCA indicates three variables demonstrated significant correlations that are domination slope R-2 = 0.796, bankfull width-to-depth ratio R-2 = -0868, and sinuosity R-2 = 0.557, respectively. Model of stream classification system with future geomorphology process and problem expectations is produced where the first class considered in terrace and valley erosion zone, second class in a low terrace of land near the channels and sediment transports zone, and third class in valley deposition and floodplain zone. The results are important to local authorities as a decision support system using the river clustering model for Pahang River Basin.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						237	254		10.5004/dwt.2017.21098								WOS:000423704600030						
J	Chang, YJ; Chang, IC; Yu, TY				Chang, Yu-Jie; Chang, I-Cheng; Yu, Tai-Yi			Spatiotemporal features and delineation of water quality control zones for Taipei Water Resources District with multivariate manners	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												This research adopts two methods of multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA), to analyze the water quality parameters (WQPs) monitoring results for evaluating the dominant factors on the rivers water quality and the areas which should be protected carefully. The combination of PCA and CA provides a better technique to classify the water quality control zones. Although PCA is an effective tool to categorize the monitoring stations, it cannot conduct complex dimensional classification on all of the monitoring stations and parameters; whereas, CA can help to determine the correlations between different monitoring stations via the WQPs monitoring results and then provides a more reasonable classification numbers for further watershed management. In this research, 23 monitoring stations were classified into four water quality control zones by using PCA and CA methods. The results from PCA in various water quality control zones indicate that the amounts of total coliform (TC) can lead to various correlation with various WQPs based on the characteristics of regions and pollutant sources. By applying CA to further classify the WQPs of the monitoring station for midstream of Nanshi River, analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests found only the mean values of monitoring WQPs indices for TC and dissolved oxygen (DO) have significant differences. In terms of the water quality in this area, the wastewater from hot springs usages might cause 17% of the midstream of Nanshi River monitoring stations (Cluster A) to rise their TC values and slightly decrease both DO and pH values. In this region, TC is the WQPs indicator with the highest impact resulted from hot spring wastewater. Additionally, by applying PCA and CA, the correlation of WQPs and the effects that hot spring wastewater have on water quality can be further investigated.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						255	266		10.5004/dwt.2017.20970								WOS:000423704600031						
J	Kwon, DY; Kim, JH				Kwon, Dae Young; Kim, Jun Ho			Study on the control of released manganese in residuals treatment processes of water treatment plant	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Bank filtrate as an alternative for drinking water resource has a problem of high concentration of iron and manganese regardless of various advantages. The high concentration can be removed less than drinking water standard in the process of water treatment, but the removed iron and manganese are moved to residuals treatment processes as precipitation sludge or backwash water, which can make a problem if not a proper management. In order to solve this problem, this study has performed overall investigation on water quality of every process of residuals treatment, from which the relationship between the release and the process management has been figured out. This study also proposed a proper measure to control the released manganese. The investigation revealed that the release hardly occurred in exhaust resin because of high dissolved oxygen (DO) but it could happen in case of long residence more than 72 h. It also showed that the release constantly occurred in the thickener because of long residence of large amount of sludge. The iron release in the thicker was easily oxidized by DO during it raised to the upper. However, the released manganese was hardly oxidized and remained the released one even until it moved to the dewatering and returned to the thickener. As a result, it caused the significant deterioration of the residuals' quality. Aeration and pH adjustment with alkali dose were investigated in order to treat the released manganese. The alkali dose showed an optimum measure to remain the residuals quality below the standard.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				NOV	2017	96						267	275		10.5004/dwt.2017.20924								WOS:000423704600032

Selected metals were determined using AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectrometry), an experimental technique widely recognized as a suitable for the determination of metals in real samples. The average concentrations of iron, zinc and copper were 23.375 mu g/g, 7.033 mu g/g and 5.7 mu g/g, respectively in all six investigated grape varieties (Methods I and III). The Hazard Quotient values for all the elements were below 1 (one), which can be considered safe. Performed statistics with Pearson correlation matrix on grape samples based on metals' content shows that there is a high positive correlation between In-transformed data of iron and copper (0.697), and low positive correlation between In-transformed data of iron and zinc (0.337) and Zn and Cu (0.554). The study represents the fast and efficacious approach to the determination of selected metals (Fe, Zn, and Cu) in grape varieties. It suggests that results of the determination depend on the extraction methods, and the best and the most reliable method was found.																	0003-925X					NOV-DEC	2017	68	6					140	145		10.2376/0003-925X-68-140								WOS:000423500900003

Optimizing Water-Injection Design in a Shallow Offshore Reservoir	SPE PRODUCTION & OPERATIONS												Water injection is commonly used to improve oil recoveries in depleting reservoirs. However, insufficient injectivity can result in water-injection projects being limited in injection rates, which can sometimes make them uneconomic. Implementing water-injection projects requires a multidisciplinary approach to optimize water-injection rates for reservoir-performance, cost, and well-design considerations. The costs for the surface facilities are dependent on the required water quality, water temperature, and other operating parameters that are linked to the injectivity of water. A work flow including quantitative assessment of the injectivity development as a function of the operating parameters as well as the uncertain geomechanical and reservoir parameters can be used to improve the surface-facility design. Such a work flow was applied to a shallow offshore field. The results showed that the base-case design of the facilities should be modified to avoid an increase of the flowing bottomhole pressure (BHP) above the minimum stress of the caprock. The effect of the various parameters on the BHP was investigated, and the sensitivity of the BHP to uncertain input parameters under different operating conditions was tested. The results indicated that the BHP does not exceed the BHP limit, and hence the injectivity is expected to be high enough for a sufficiently long period of time under a wide range of conditions.																	1930-1855	1930-1863				NOV	2017	32	4					551	563										WOS:000423268000014

The Role of Detoxification Enzymes in the Adaptation of the Major Malaria Vector Anopheles gambiae (Giles; Diptera: Culicidae) to Polluted Water	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The main malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa, the Anopheles gambiae (Giles; Diptera: Culicidae), normally breed in clean water sources. However, evidence suggests an on-going adaptation of Anopheline species to polluted breeding habitats in urban settings. This study aimed at understanding the adaptation to breeding in water bodies with different qualities, in five selected mosquito breeding sites in urban Accra, Ghana. The study sites were also evaluated for the WHO water-quality parameters as a measure of pollution, and insecticide residues. Field mosquitoes were evaluated for five genes; CYP6P3, CYP4H19, CYP4H24, GSTD1-4, and ABCC11-associated with insecticide detoxification-using quantitative RT-PCR, as well as Mono-oxygenase, Alpha Esterase, Glutathione S-transferase, and insensitive acetylcholinesterase (AChE) using biochemical enzyme assays. The lab-reared, insecticide susceptible An. gambiae Kisumu strain was bred in the most polluted water source for 10 generations and evaluated for the same genes and enzymes. The results revealed that the fold expression of the genes was higher in the larvae compared with the adults. The results also suggest that detoxification enzymes could be involved in the adaptation of An. gambiae to polluted breeding sites. Correlation analysis revealed a highly positive significant correlation between calcium levels and all five genes (P < 0.05). Stepwise linear regression to understand which of the variables predicted the expression of the genes revealed that sulphate was responsible for ABCC11 and CYP4H24, alkalinity for GSTD1-4, and calcium for CYP4H19 and CYP6P3. The detailed genetic basis of this adaptation need to be further investigated. A further understanding of this adaptation may provide outlooks for controlling malaria and other disease vectors adapted to polluted breeding water sources.

J	Fan, SF				Fan, Shufang			Internal Characteristics of Loose Solid Source of Debris Flow in Zhouqu	SAINS MALAYSIANA												In this paper, with debris flow in Zhouqu as the research object, combined with experiments such as cation exchange capacity (CEC), mineral chemical composition and water quality analysis, relation between water and salt in solid source forming debris flow was studied via soil column leaching test and soluble salt analysis, and internal characteristics of debris flow was accordingly showed. It was found that, the soil was loose, and the content of gravel and sand was high, and the content of fine particle was low. The soluble contents at the slope of the accumulation body were described as, collapsed accumulation body > landslide accumulation body, slope toe > slope top, gentle slope > steep slope, also related to length of the slope. The results indicated that accumulations released a large number of base ion after intense weathering, which migrated with water, concentrated and enriched at the slope toe. Saline soil with high salt content collapsed when encountering water and then formed mudflow, thus becoming the internal power to trigger and initiate debris flow to some extent.																	0126-6039					NOV	2017	46	11					2179	2186		10.17576/jsm-2017-4611-19								WOS:000422854400019

A Multialgorithm Approach to Land Surface Modeling of Suspended Sediment in the Colorado Front Range	JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS												A new paradigm of simulating suspended sediment load (SSL) with a Land Surface Model (LSM) is presented here. Five erosion and SSL algorithms were applied within a common LSM framework to quantify uncertainties and evaluate predictability in two steep, forested catchments (> 1,000 km(2)). The algorithms were chosen from among widely used sediment models, including empirically based: monovariate rating curve (MRC) and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE); stochastically based: the Load Estimator (LOADEST); conceptually based: the Hydrologic Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF); and physically based: the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). The algorithms were driven by the hydrologic fluxes and meteorological inputs generated from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) LSM. A multiobjective calibration was applied to each algorithm and optimized parameter sets were validated over an excluded period, as well as in a transfer experiment to a nearby catchment to explore parameter robustness. Algorithm performance showed consistent decreases when parameter sets were applied to periods with greatly differing SSL variability relative to the calibration period. Of interest was a joint calibration of all sediment algorithm and streamflow parameters simultaneously, from which trade-offs between streamflow performance and partitioning of runoff and base flow to optimize SSL timing were noted, decreasing the flexibility and robustness of the streamflow to adapt to different time periods. Parameter transferability to another catchment was most successful in more processoriented algorithms, the HSPF and the DHSVM. This first-of-its-kind multialgorithm sediment scheme offers a unique capability to portray acute episodic loading while quantifying trade-offs and uncertainties across a range of algorithm structures.

These monitoring programs generate large database that aim to satisfy environmental licensing conditions, as well as the management of water resources. In order to generate information that would facilitate the management of water resources, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of Tibagi river water located in Parana State, Brazil, before the construction of the Maua hydroelectric power plant (HPP). Data from four of the eight stations described in the Limnological Conditions Monitoring Program of the Tibagi river described in the HPP's Basic Environmental Plan were analyzed. The selected data comprises the period between December 2009 and April 2012, before the HPP installation. In general, the retained factors demonstrated the anthropogenic influence on the water resources. Even with a small variation in the composition of the factor 1 in the monitored stations, this factor was especially characterized by the variables: total phosphorus, total solids, and fecal coliforms. The presence of fecal coliforms in the factor's composition is a common indicator of pollution from untreated domestic sewage. The same applies to total phosphorus, which, as well as the total solids, can also be related to the inappropriate land use in the vicinity.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				NOV-DEC	2017	22	6					1075	1083		10.1590/S1413-41522017163661								WOS:000419732000005

Among the main demands for improvement of these programs, there is a need to proof the provided ecosystem services. It is in this context that the present research was developed to evaluate the directives of water quality monitoring in watershed covered by PES and to assess the applicability of these to the watershed of the Couves Stream in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo. For this applied research, besides the bibliographical research on the subject, a historical research in the documents of the Municipal Secretary of Environment and a monthly analysis of the water quality data provided by municipal utility were performed. From the results, it was verified that, at present, the Couves Stream waters do not meet the limits of Class 1 for the parameter Escherichia coli. At its various stages, PES demands differentiated monitoring conditions in relation to the number of sampling points and the frequency of analysis. Finally, even understanding the characterization of all parameters that compose the Water Quality Index (WQI) as essential, this study showed a minimum set of indicators for assessing the increases of water quality in watersheds covered by PES.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				NOV-DEC	2017	22	6					1141	1150		10.1590/S1413-41522017165072								WOS:000419732000011

Phosphorus Dynamics Near Bald Cypress Roots in a Restored Wetland	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Phosphorus (P) dissolution occurs commonly in wetland soils restored from agricultural land. Associated with P release are high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and Fe2+. This field study evaluated the effect of a fluctuating water table on the root dynamics of bald cypress (Taxodium distichum L. Rich.) to determine whether root death created soil reduction microsites, potentially contributing to P dissolution. The study site is a restored Carolina bay wetland with organic soils. Root growth and death were monitored on 16 6-yr-old bald cypress using minirhizotrons. Root dynamics, water table levels, and soil porewater chemistry and redox potential in the root zone were monitored for 2 yr. Soil solution samples were analyzed for Fe2+, pH, DOC, and P. High rates of root growth occurred during dry conditions, whereas root death occurred during sustained periods of saturation, particularly within 20 cm of the surface. Cyclic changes in concentrations of Fe2+, DOC, and dissolved total P (DTP) were related to water table position but not to changes in root numbers. After sustained periods of saturated conditions, redox potential decreased to 0 mV, Fe2+ increased to 1.75 mg Fe2+ L-1, and DOC increased to 350 mg L-1, resulting in peak DTP concentrations of 750 mu g L-1, compared with 100 mu g L-1 during dry periods. This study showed that in these high-C soils (similar to 20% organic C) rooting dynamics had minimal impact on changes in P concentrations and that P dissolution was largely controlled by Fe reduction processes occurring within the C-rich soil matrix.																	0361-5995	1435-0661				NOV-DEC	2017	81	6					1652	1660		10.2136/sssaj2017.07.0228								WOS:000419646100039

To this end, several studies were used, including: Tacna Spatial Project (PET, Spanish acronym) National Water Authority (ANA, Spanish acronym), Local Water Authority (ALA, Spanish acronym), and the National Weather and Water Service (SENAMHI, Spanish acronym), among others. Three geomorphological units were identified: the Western Cordillera, Puna, and the Andes dissected flank with its own characteristics. In addition, the geological formations that affect the water quality of the Caplina Basin were identified based on the geological cartography. The sources with the greatest influence on water quality were determined. These included the Aruma and Paralocos geothermal springs which produce water with high contents of arsenic, lead, and sodium, in concentrations exceeding the Environmental Quality Standard (ECA, Spanish acronym), and high iron concentration in the water channel from the Barroso Chico spring to the Ancoma Creek. The relationships among the geology, climate, and hydrology were identified, which reflect changes in the concentrations of the elements in the water during seasons with low water levels versus those with high levels.

J	Yang, Y; Wu, JF; Wang, JG; Zhou, ZF				Yang, Yun; Wu, Jianfeng; Wang, Jinguo; Zhou, Zhifang			An Elitist Multiobjective Tabu Search for Optimal Design of Groundwater Remediation Systems	GROUNDWATER												This study presents a new multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), the elitist multiobjective tabu search (EMOTS), and incorporates it with MODFLOW/MT3DMS to develop a groundwater simulation-optimization (SO) framework based on modular design for optimal design of groundwater remediation systems using pump-and-treat (PAT) technique. The most notable improvement of EMOTS over the original multiple objective tabu search (MOTS) lies in the elitist strategy, selection strategy, and neighborhood move rule. The elitist strategy is to maintain all nondominated solutions within later search process for better converging to the true Pareto front. The elitism-based selection operator is modified to choose two most remote solutions from current candidate list as seed solutions to increase the diversity of searching space. Moreover, neighborhood solutions are uniformly generated using the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) in the bounded neighborhood space around each seed solution. To demonstrate the performance of the EMOTS, we consider a synthetic groundwater remediation example. Problem formulations consist of two objective functions with continuous decision variables of pumping rates while meeting water quality requirements. Especially, sensitivity analysis is evaluated through the synthetic case for determination of optimal combination of the heuristic parameters. Furthermore, the EMOTS is successfully applied to evaluate remediation options at the field site of the Massachusetts Military Reservation (MMR) in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. With both the hypothetical and the large-scale field remediation sites, the EMOTS-based SO framework is demonstrated to outperform the original MOTS in achieving the performance metrics of optimality and diversity of nondominated frontiers with desirable stability and robustness.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				NOV-DEC	2017	55	6					811	826		10.1111/gwat.12525								WOS:000419219600005	28493319

Borehole techniques have been widely used, but they are quite expensive, intrusive, and time consuming. The electrical resistivity method has proved very successful in groundwater assessment. This advanced technique uses the calculation of Dar-Zarrouk (D-Z) parameters, namely longitudinal unit conductance, transverse unit resistance, and longitudinal resistivity has been employed by using 50 vertical electrical sounding points to assess the groundwater and delineate the fresh-saline water interface over 1045 km(2) area of Khanewal in Southern Punjab of Pakistan. The x-y plots and maps of D-Z parameters were produced to establish a decipherable vision for the occurrence and distribution of different water-bearing formations of fresh-saline water aquifers through a complicated situation of intermixing of different resistivity ranges for fresh-saline water bodies. This technique is useful to reduce the ambiguity produced by the process of equivalence and suppression which cause intermixing in differentiating fresh, brackish, and saline aquifers during interpretation. The fresh-saline water interface is correlated very well with the previous studies of water quality analysis carried out in Khanewal area. The results suggest that the D-Z parameters are useful for demarcating different aquifer zones. The behavior and pattern of D-Z parameters with respect to occurrence and distribution of different water-bearing formations were effectively identified and delineated in the study area.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				NOV-DEC	2017	55	6					841	856		10.1111/gwat.12527								WOS:000419219600007	28498518

With the development of social economy, the pollution problem of Lijiang River in recent decades has become more and more serious, which has aroused widespread concern and attention. However, the study on the reduction of river pollution load is seldom found reported until now. In this paper, the pollutant load of Lijiang River is estimated by equal standard pollution load method and the water pollution model is used to simulate the reduction of river pollution load under different ecological water supply of upstream reservoir. The calculation results showed that the livestock and poultry breeding and rural life are the main sources of pollution, and the main pollutants are TN and TP, the pollution load ratio data of which is 30.30% and 29.39% respectively. The simulation results indicated that three kinds of upstream reservoir replenishment plans have obvious effect on the reduction in pollution load of Lijiang water. After being replenished by upstream reservoir, the concentration of water in downstream of the replenishment point decrease rapidly, the higher the water intensity is, the faster the concentration will decrease. Compared with the target year (S2), the 30m(3)/s water replenishment plan from the upstream reservoir can reduce about 20% of the annual average maximum concentration of CODMn and NH4-N in the river, and 60m(3)/s water replenishment can reduce about 40% in same rate. At the same time, by the comparison of annual average data and dry season average date simulation, we found that the constant replenishment in dry season improve water quality obviously.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				NOV	2017	16	11					2589	2598										WOS:000419141500019

A standardized process for the design of water monitoring networks does not exist with the exception of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) general guidelines about the minimum network density. While one of the major challenges in the design of optimal hydrometric networks has been establishing design objectives, information theory has been successfully adopted to network design problems by providing measures of the information content that can be deliverable from a station or a network. This review firstly summarizes the common entropy terms that have been used in water monitoring network designs. Then, this paper deals with the recent applications of the entropy concept for water monitoring network designs, which are categorized into (1) precipitation; (2) streamflow and water level; (3) water quality; and (4) soil moisture and groundwater networks. The integrated design method for multivariate monitoring networks is also covered. Despite several issues, entropy theory has been well suited to water monitoring network design. However, further work is still required to provide design standards and guidelines for operational use.

Interestingly, correlations between water quality and the extent of tree mortality in Colorado montane ecosystems suggest compensatory effects from adjacent live vegetation that mute responses in less severely impacted forests. To this end, we investigated whether the composition of the soil bacterial community and associated functionality beneath beetle-killed lodgepole pine was influenced by the extent of surrounding tree mortality. The most pronounced changes were observed in the potentially active bacterial community, where alpha diversity increased in concert with surrounding tree mortality until mortality exceeded a tipping point of similar to 30 to 40%, after which diversity stabilized and decreased. Community structure also clustered in association with the extent of surrounding tree mortality with compositional trends best explained by differences in NH4+ concentrations and C/N ratios. C/N ratios, which were lower in soils under beetle-killed trees, further correlated with the relative abundance of putative nitrifiers and exoenzyme activity. Collectively, the response of soil microorganisms that drive heterotrophic respiration and decay supports observations of broader macroscale threshold effects on water quality in heavily infested forests and could be utilized as a predictive mechanism during analogous ecosystem disruptions. IMPORTANCE Forests around the world are succumbing to insect infestation with repercussions for local soil biogeochemistry and downstream water quality and quantity. This study utilized microbial community dynamics to address why we are observing watershed scale biogeochemical impacts from forest mortality in some impacted areas but not others. Through a unique "tree-centric" approach, we were able to delineate plots with various tree mortality levels within the same watershed to see if surviving surrounding vegetation altered microbial and biogeochemical responses. Our results suggest that forests with lower overall tree mortality levels are able to maintain "normal" ecosystem function, as the bacterial community appears resistant to tree death. However, surrounding tree mortality influences this mitigating effect with various linear and threshold responses whereupon the bacterial community and its function are altered. Our study lends insight into how microscale responses propagate upward into larger-scale observations, which may be useful for future predictions during analogous disruptions.

Oxygenation of Irrigation Water during Propagation and Container Production of Bedding Plants	HORTSCIENCE												Oxygen supply to the root zone is essential for healthy plant growth, and one technology that can potentially supply additional oxygen is the injection of purified oxygen (oxygenation) into irrigation water. The objective was to evaluate whether oxygenation of irrigation water affected plant growth and substrate dissolved oxygen (DO) levels during mist propagation of unrooted cuttings and subsequent growth in containers. Dissolved oxygen measured at source tanks for ambient tap water (averaging 7.1 mg.L-1) or oxygenated tap water (31.1 mg.L-1) was pumped through fine (69 mu m) mist nozzles for propagation of Calibrachoa x hybrid 'Aloha Kona Dark Red' and Lobelia erinus 'Bella Aqua'. There were no measured differences in root length or root dry mass for Calibrachoa and Lobelia propagated using oxygenated water compared with ambient water because DO of ambient or oxygenated water reached approximate to 100% oxygen saturation in water (8.7 mg.L-1) after passing through mist nozzles. To evaluate subsequent growth without the effect on DO of fine emitters, rooted cuttings of these two plant species and Pelargonium x hortorum 'Patriot Red' were grown in 10.2-cm diameter pots. The plants were irrigated with either ambient (6.0 mg.L-1) or oxygenated (27.7 mg.L-1) nutrient solutions, delivered by top watering or subirrigation when the substrate dried to 45% of container capacity (CC), measured gravimetrically. Oxygenated water did not enhance root or shoot growth compared with ambient water for the three bedding plants. In addition, Pelargonium growth was not enhanced when irrigated at high moisture level (maintained at 80% CC) with oxygenated water compared with ambient water. In container substrate without plants, it was possible to increase DO of the substrate solution by 68% when a high volume of oxygenated water (200% container volume or 850 mL) was applied by top watering because existing substrate solution was displaced. In contrast, when containers were subirrigated at approximate to 45% CC, the smaller 180-mL volume of oxygenated water was absorbed by the substrate and did not increase DO compared with ambient water. Overall, irrigating with oxygenated water did not enhance root or plant growth of three bedding plants grown in porous, peat-based substrate. To increase oxygen supply to roots in container production, growers should focus on having adequate air porosity in substrate and avoiding overwatering.																	0018-5345	2327-9834				NOV	2017	52	11					1608	1614		10.21273/HORTSCI12181-17								WOS:000418523500022

The reverse osmosis process has been selected to study since it typically uses less energy than thermal distillation. The aim of the robust design is to overcome the limitation of classical controllers in dealing with large parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, sensor noises, and unmodeled process dynamics. The analyzed desalination process is modeled as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system with varying parameters. The control system is decoupled using a feed forward decoupling method to reduce the interactions between control channels. Both nominal and perturbed reverse osmosis systems have been analyzed using structured singular values for their stabilities and performances. Simulation results show that the system responses meet all the control requirements against various uncertainties. Finally the reduced order controller provides excellent robust performance, with achieving decoupling, disturbance attenuation, and noise rejection. It can help to reduce the membrane cleanings, increase the robustness against uncertainties, and lower the energy consumption for process monitoring.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV 1	2017	89	11					1932	1941		10.2175/106143017X15054988926316								WOS:000418398500001	29080563

Development of Multiple Regression Models to Predict Sources of Fecal Pollution	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												This study assessed the usefulness of multivariate statistical tools to characterize watershed dynamics and prioritize streams for remediation. Three multiple regression models were developed using water quality data collected from Sinking Creek in the Watauga River watershed in Northeast Tennessee. Model 1 included all water quality parameters, model 2 included parameters identified by stepwise regression, and model 3 was developed using canonical discriminant analysis. Models were evaluated in seven creeks to determine if they correctly classified land use and level of fecal pollution. At the watershed level, the models were statistically significant (p < 0.001) but with low r(2) values (Model 1 r(2) = 0.02, Model 2 r(2) = 0.01, Model 3 r(2) = 0.35). Model 3 correctly classified land use in five of seven creeks. These results suggest this approach can be used to set priorities and identify pollution sources, but may be limited when applied across entire watersheds.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV 1	2017	89	11					1961	1969		10.2175/106143017X14839994523901								WOS:000418398500004	28327258

Design of Remediation Actions for Nutrient Mitigation in the Hyporheic Zone	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Although hyporheic exchange has been shown to be of great importance for the overall water quality of streams, it is rarely considered quantitatively in stream remediation projects. A main driver of hyporheic exchange is the hydraulic head fluctuation along the streambed, which can be enhanced by modifications of the streambed topography. Here we present an analytical 2-D spectral subsurface flow model to estimate the hyporheic exchange associated with streambed topographies over a wide range of spatial scales; a model that was validated using tracer-test-results and measurements of hydraulic conductivity. Specifically, engineered steps in the stream were shown to induce a larger hyporheic exchange velocity and shorter hyporheic residence times compared to the observed topography in Tullstorps Brook, Sweden. Hyporheic properties were used to parameterize a longitudinal transport model that accounted for reactions in terms of first-order decay and instantaneous adsorption. Theoretical analyses of the mitigation effect for nitrate due to denitrification in the hyporheic zone show that there is a Damkohler number of the hyporheic zone, associated with several different stream geomorphologies, that optimizes nitrate mass removal on stream reach scale. This optimum can be limited by the available hydraulic head gradient given by the slope of the stream and the geological constraints of the streambed. The model illustrates the complex interactions between design strategies for nutrient mitigation, hyporheic flow patterns, and stream biogeochemistry and highlights the importance to diagnose a stream prior remediation, specifically to evaluate if remediation targets are transport or reaction controlled.

The need for high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality models within optimization schemes is driven by improved computational capabilities, increased requirements to meet specific points of compliance with greater resolution, and the need to optimize operations of not just single reservoirs but systems of reservoirs. This study describes an important advancement for computing hourly power generation schemes for a hydropower reservoir using high-fidelity models, surrogate modeling techniques, and optimization methods. The predictive power of the high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality model CE-QUAL-W2 is successfully emulated by an artificial neural network, then integrated into a genetic algorithm optimization approach to maximize hydropower generation subject to constraints on dam operations and water quality. This methodology is applied to a multipurpose reservoir near Nashville, Tennessee, USA. The model successfully reproduced high-fidelity reservoir information while enabling 6.8% and 6.6% increases in hydropower production value relative to actual operations for dissolved oxygen (DO) limits of 5 and 6 mg/L, respectively, while witnessing an expected decrease in power generation at more restrictive DO constraints. Exploration of simultaneous temperature and DO constraints revealed capability to address multiple water quality constraints at specified locations. The reduced computational requirements of the new modeling approach demonstrated an ability to provide decision support for reservoir operations scheduling while maintaining high-fidelity hydrodynamic and water quality information as part of the optimization decision support routines. Plain Language Summary Hydropower operations can influence water quality, including temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations both upstream and downstream of dams. Meanwhile, as energy demands increase it is important to improve the efficiency and capacity of renewable sources. A well-optimized hydropower system thus requires a fully integrated approach where environmental quality and energy production are achieved together. Currently, hydropower optimization subject to environmental constraints is limited by dimensionality, resolution, and computational expense of detailed hydrodynamic and water quality models. The need for integrating these models within optimization schemes is now driven by improved computational capabilities, requirements to meet specific points of compliance, and the need to optimize systems of reservoirs. This study describes an approach for computing hourly power generation schemes for a hydropower reservoir using high-fidelity models, surrogate modeling techniques, and optimization methods. Surrogate models, which emulate the predictions of complex models at much less computational expense, are integrated into an optimization routine that maximizes hydropower generation subject to dam operations and water quality constraints. For the case study, the method found potential increases in hydropower production value relative to actual operations while maintaining DO minimum concentrations, and produced an expected decrease in power generation at more restrictive DO limits.

Drinking water quality and water risk assessment in the university of science and technology of southern Philippines	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES												The study evaluated the quality of drinking water sources in the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines (USTP). The main objective was to determine drinking water quality of different water sources in the university. Six sampling stations were identified which included faucets and water fountains in the different departments of the university, namely engineering, science center, education, and information technology. Physicochemical analyses included pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), alkalinity, lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd). Sampling periods commenced on July to September 2014. Overall the university's drinking water sources were within allowable limits set by the Philippine National Standard for Drinking Water (PNSDW). However, Pb and Cd concentrations were beyond the permissible limits. Risk assessments for both metals showed potential contamination. The results of the study is preliminary by nature and further monitoring be implemented. (c) 2017 The Authors.

Water quality assessment using macroinvertebrates along the mining area of Brgy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED AND APPLIED SCIENCES												In this research, water quality assessment in the Bigaan River, Brgy. Gango, Libona, Bukidnon was conducted to determine the impact of small scale mining on the aquatic ecosystem using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators. Analysis revealed that total suspended solid, total hardness and mercury content is higher in the downstream portion of the river. Species composition of macroinvertebrates differs between sites. Total abundance and species diversity is higher in the upstream portion of the river. The absence of pollution sensitive Ephemeroptera (Mayfly) and Tricoptera (Caddisfly) taxa in the downstream portion of the river indicates that the water quality is deteriorating. Although the level of mercury contamination in the downstream portion is low and within the standard limit, the outcome still indicates that long term exposure to mercury brought by small scale gold mining has detrimental effects on macroinvertebrate communities and on the quality and functionality of the river ecosystem.

We carried out a study of the efficacy of detention of phytoplankton, contained in the initial raw water on a floating filter with expanded polystyrene (EPS) bed. We developed three technological models, which provide the removal of algae by using a floating filter with further coagulation of the remaining suspended substances for processing of the raw water from the low power surface sources. The application of the proposed water pretreatment technologies from the low power sources can significantly reduce the problem of the drinking water supply to the small populated areas in different climatic conditions.

We aimed to reveal potential impacts of the North American crayfish Orconectes limosus on river assessment in the Neman River basin (southeastern Baltic Sea). A laboratory experiment using identical macroinvertebrate assemblages was conducted to compare feeding selectivity and effects between O. limosus and the European Astacus leptodactylus. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate potential impacts of O. limosus on disturbed and undisturbed crayfish-free macroinvertebrate assemblages: one dominated by Oligochaeta vs. one co-dominated by Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera and Mollusca (EPT-codominated). In the laboratory experiment, both crayfish species preferred feeding on Diptera (mostly chironomids), but O. limosus also selected Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera. Family richness did not change, but both species inflated the Shannon Diversity index by reducing Diptera domination. Astacus leptodactylus treatments had higher Shannon Diversity and percentage of EPT abundance compared to O. limosus treatments. Field experiments indicated (1) negative, (2) assemblage-specific, or (3) no effects of O. limosus on macroinvertebrate metrics. A negative effect, especially in the undisturbed assemblage, was observed on simple additive metrics based on taxa presence data, such as total or EPT family richness, or BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) score. Assemblage-specific effects were indicated for some metrics based on relative abundances. In the Oligochaeta-dominated assemblage, Shannon Diversity was inflated and the percentage of Oligochaeta abundance was reduced. In the EPT-codominated assemblage Shannon Diversity was deflated while the relative abundance of Oligochaeta was not affected. No effects were observed when using the ASPT (Average BMWP Score Per Taxon) or percentage of EPT abundance. We conclude that O. limosus may have a more diverse predatory diet than A. leptodactylus, and thus can have a stronger effect on macroinvertebrate taxa sensitive to disturbances. Therefore, the invasion of O. limosus can alter macroinvertebrate assemblages and compromise conventional ecological assessment, even when it displaces resident Astacus species.																	1798-6540	1818-5487				NOV	2017	12	4					523	540		10.3391/ai.2017.12.4.09								WOS:000418011300009

The intermittent creek receives domestic and industrial discharges of Kemalpasa District Center and its neighborhoods and more than 180 factories of the organized industrial zone. A monitoring campaign was conducted on the creek and samples were taken in two different seasons with distinct hydrological characteristics from 20 stations along the creek to quantify the quality status of water and sediment columns. A number of physicochemical parameters, heavy metals, and trace elements were measured by field and laboratory techniques to assess the status of creek's water and sediment quality. The spatial and temporal variations were determined, and statistical tools were used to conduct an environmental forensic overview along the creek. A geo-accumulation index and a modified heavy metal pollution index were calculated to cumulatively assess the quality of sediment and water columns, respectively. The results revealed that the creek was under significant pollution load from the industrial zone where metal processing, food and beverage production, marble and natural stone manufacturing, and paper production are made. In particular, elements such as Co, Cu, Cd, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, and Zr were found to be above the surface water quality standard values. Similarly, B, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Sn were determined to be in extreme levels in the sediment column with values exceeding the probable effect concentrations.

Scan of water treatment processes to achieve desirable chlorine stability in water supply systems	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												Removal of natural organic matter (NOM) is increasingly important in production and distribution of drinking water complying with health and aesthetic guidelines. The impact of treatment is often investigated using the resulting dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and trihalomethane formation potential. Water treatment processes of ferric and alum coagulation with and without pre-oxidation by ozone and permanganate were scanned for their ability to treat synthetic raw water from peat extract. To compare the efficiency of the treatment methods the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and chlorine decay and trihalomethane (THM) formation tests the important parameters needed in practice were used. A high level of DOC removal (>80%) was achieved with all the treatments. A significant difference was observed in chlorine decay rates and THM production. Pre-oxidation with 2 mg/L of O-3 and coagulation with 45 mg/L of ferric sulphate produced the most chlorine stable water followed by water treated with 80 mg/L of ferric sulphate. Chlorine decay test was found to be a more sensitive indicator of a successful treatment than DOC. The optimisation of the ozone dose is likely to identify the best water quality and chemical cost combination which is not likely achievable by the coagulation alone.

Effect of preparation variables of plaster molds for slip casting of sanitary ware	BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ESPANOLA DE CERAMICA Y VIDRIO												A full factorial design was used to evaluate the effect of various preparation conditions for making plaster molds for slip casting of sanitary ware. We investigated the relationships between the processing conditions, microstructure, and final properties of the plaster molds. The results showed that the rheological behavior, and hence, the time during which the plaster suspension is pourable for making the plaster molds (before an important increase in viscosity due to the precipitation of gypsum crystals) were dependent on the preparation conditions. Variations in the chemical composition, pore size distribution, and microstructure explained the statistically significant effect of preparation variables (including the mixing time, water temperature, and water quality). Preparation conditions that promoted high initial viscosity of the plaster suspension (accelerative effect of the setting time) developed less porous structure in the mold that principally increased the compressive strength (16%, deionized water instead of tap water) and the casting rate (9%, water at 25 degrees C instead of 38 degrees C). According to the results are proposed optimum conditions to make the molds while avoiding unnecessary energy use. (c) 2017 SECV. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

Differential environmental responses of tropical phytoplankton community in the southwest coast of India	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Phytoplankton characteristics (biomass, primary productivity, species composition and community structure) were studied in a tropical estuary (Cochin estuary) and adjacent coastal marine region for understanding the factors controlling their productivity patterns and community dynamics. The Cochin estuary (CE) sustained a high level of inorganic nutrients supporting very high phytoplankton biomass, productivity, and abundance. Though the CE exhibited a 2-3 fold increase in the annual mean of chlorophyll a (14.6 +/- 8.5 mg m(-3)) and primary production (1288 +/- 999 mgC m(-3)d(-1)) than the coastal waters, both regions sustained a substantial dominance of small-sized phytoplankton, in particular nanoplankton (2-20 mu m), which apparently contributed > 70% of total chlorophyll a and primary production. Diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton functional group (> 75% of total abundance) prevailed over both sampling locations almost throughout the year. However, the sporadic dominance of certain species of dinoflagellates (during premonsoon) and green and blue-green algae (during monsoon) were also encountered in the estuary. The SIMPER analysis, based on phytoplankton species abundance data, revealed the presence of certain characterizing species exclusive for both estuary and coastal waters, and most of them belonged to smaller diatoms e. g., Skeletonema costatum, Thalassiosira subtilis, Nitzschia longissima, Cylindrotheca closterium etc. The incessant proliferation of these small sized diatoms, especially in the CE, can be considered as a potential source of consistently higher phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity, and which can even survive in the recurring short-term (tides) and long-term (seasonal) hydrographic changes of the Cochin estuary.

Environmental forcing of intertidal benthic macrofauna of Bodo Creek, Nigeria: Preliminary index to evaluate cleanup of Ogoniland	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Pristine and before-disturbance baseline data are essential tools in monitoring and measurement of progress and net success or otherwise of restoration of degraded ecosystems. These are usually lacking in regions such as the Niger Delta where demands for such data is pressing due to impending pollution. We present a rare case of available pre-spill data of how distribution and abundance of macrobenthic infauna were structured by some physical and chemical variables of interstitial water in Bodo Creek, lower eastern Niger Delta, Nigeria, before two major oil spills impacted the creek in 2008. Monthly composite samples of macrobenthos and interstitial water in four soft-bottom unvegetated intertidal flats were analysed for one year. Thirty six taxa, twenty-two families and four classes of macrozoobenthos were recorded. The bivalves Lorepis aberrans, Macoma innominata, Senilia senilis, and polychaetes Nereis diversicolor, N. virens, N. pelagic and Clymenella torquata were eurizonal in distribution and abundant, attaining sub-dominant and dominant status at the sites. The observed pattern of reduction in rainy season macrofauna abundance in some river systems of the Niger Delta due to sediment instability was counterbalanced by increased recruitment of the dominant taxa. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed the explanatory (physicochemical) variables only accounted for 31.8% of variation in the species data. The species-environmental correlations were: 0.64, 0.74 and 0.72 for the first, second and third axes, respectively. Plans for cleanup, remediation and 'restoration' of Bodo Creek, have reached implementation stage as the Federal Government of Nigeria flagged off cleanup of Ogoniland on June 2, 2016. The usefulness of these data as potential template for monitoring and evaluation of water quality response to the proposed cleanup and restoration is highlighted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Colonization and growth of biofouling depend on the complex interactions of biological, physical and chemical factors. Anthropogenic disturbances from coastal modification and water pollution can affect biofouling communities. The coastline of the Arabian Gulf is influenced by marine pollution from a variety of land-based activities. This study investigated spatial and temporal aspects of macrofouling assemblages using experimental panels in a marina and a mariculture centre in Bahrain for a period of one year (2014). Macrofouling assemblages of the two sites differed distinctly in species richness and composition. A total of 38 species was recorded in the mariculture centre compared to eleven species in the marina. Assemblages in the mariculture centre were dominated by hydrozoans, actinozoans, ascidians and sponges, while those in the marina were dominated by tubeworms and barnacles. Different successional patterns were observed in the sampling sites. The sequence of species replacements started by green algae and hydrozoans, followed by actinozoans, ascidians and sponges in the mariculture centre. Brown and green algae, tubeworms and hydrozoans were the earliest successional groups followed by barnacles in the marina. The study provided an initial characterization for the variability of macrofouling assemblages in the naturally and anthropogenically stressed marine environment of the Arabian Gulf.

The quality of surface water resources in Central America is usually low due to the presence of metals and other pollutants. The lack of analytical instrumentation to perform routine monitoring of water has encouraged the development of easy tools to facilitate the determination of heavy metals in waters in remote sites. In this study, we evaluated the use of different sorbents, such as Adsorbsia As600 (titanium dioxide), Iontosorb Oxin, 8-hydroxyquinoline bearing functional groups, and Duolite GT-73, with thiol functionality, for Cd, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Al extraction. It was found that both Adsorbsia As600 and Iontosorb Oxin allowed the adsorption of all metals, and the recovery was achieved using either HCl or ethylenediaminetetraacetic sodium salt (EDTA) solutions. Hence, Adsorbsia As600 was employed for in situ sampling in the metal contamination evaluation of water samples (from 15 wells and nine storage tanks) from the municipality of Torola, Mozaran, El Salvador. The developed procedure allowed all the metals in the samples to be detected, and Ni and Al were found to be above Salvadoran guidelines for drinking water quality.

In designing a monitoring network, a crucial aspect is represented by the sensors' location. In this study, a methodology for the optimal placement of wastewater monitoring sensors in sewer systems is presented. The sensor location is formulated as an optimization problem solved using greedy algorithms (GRs). The Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used to perform hydraulic and water-quality simulations. Six different procedures characterized by different fitness functions are presented and compared. The performances of the procedures are tested on a real sewer system, demonstrating the suitability of GRs for the sensor-placement problem. The results show a robustness of the methodology with respect to the detection concentration parameter, and they suggest that procedures with multiple objectives into a single fitness function give better results. A further comparison is performed using previously developed multi-objective procedures with multiple fitness functions solved using a genetic algorithm (GA), indicating better performances of the GR. The existing monitoring network, realized without the application of any sensor design, is always suboptimal.

Moreover, following the marine spatial planning principles, the effects of port structure changes on water quality must also be considered. To support the sustainable management of harbour waters, we calculated flushing time (FT) through the use of a numerical model within the Civitavecchia port under different scenarios. To assess the effects of the realization of new infrastructure that will significantly alter the port configuration in the coming years, we also developed the flushing efficiency index (FEI). The increase in the harbour basin size due to the embankment extension result in high values of FT, particularly in the inner part of the port, in accordance with the highest values of the enrichment factor of the trace metals found in the sediment. The deterioration of water quality is confirmed by negative FEI values. Otherwise, the index assumes positive values after the realization of a second entrance in the southern part of Civitavecchia port, highlighting a drastic improvement in harbour water renewal. This study provides a low-cost and predictive tool to correctly address environmentally sustainable management of port activities.

A key component of APEX application in Korea is simulating the water quality impacts of rice paddies because rice agriculture claims the largest cropland area in the country. In this study, a computational module called APEX-Paddy (National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Wanju, Korea) is developed to simulate water quality with considering pertinent paddy management practices, such as puddling and flood irrigation management. Data collected at two experimental paddy sites in Korea were used to calibrate and validate the model. Results indicate that APEX-Paddy performs well in predicting runoff discharge rate and nitrogen yield while the original APEX highly overestimates runoff rates and nitrogen yields on large storm events. With APEX-Paddy, simulated and observed flow and mineral nitrogen yield (QN) are found to be highly correlated after calibration (Nash & Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) = 0.87 and Percent Bias (PBIAS) = -14.6% for flow; NSE = 0.68 and PBIAS = 2.1% for QN). Consequently, the APEX-Paddy showed a greater accuracy in flow and QN prediction than the original APEX modeling practice using the SCS-CN (Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number) method.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							869	10.3390/w9110869								WOS:000416798300055						
J	Diaz-Alcaide, S; Martinez-Santos, P; Villarroya, F				Diaz-Alcaide, Silvia; Martinez-Santos, Pedro; Villarroya, Fermin			A Commune-Level Groundwater Potential Map for the Republic of Mali	WATER												Groundwater represents an essential resource in sub-Saharan Africa, where several hundred million people rely on aquifers for domestic supply. This paper presents a method to map groundwater potential in the Republic of Mali based on a spatially-distributed database of 26,040 boreholes. The database includes exhaustive information on key parameters such as borehole location, success rate of borehole production, depth, yield, static groundwater level or water quality. Representative variables were classified and interpreted jointly to develop a groundwater potential index for each of the 703 communes in Mali. This provides a methodological novelty because groundwater potential studies typically rely on indirect indicators such as lineaments, slope, soil moisture and landforms. Also, such large borehole databases have seldom been used to estimate groundwater potential. The highest indexes were obtained for the areas in and around the River Niger's Inner Delta, including southern Tombouctou and the central parts of the Segou and Mopti Regions. The lower Precambrian formations, which include the country's thoroughly populated southern plateau, had moderate scores. The lowest groundwater potential was found in the northern part of the Kayes and Koulikoro Regions, as well as in the entire region of Kidal. By providing results at the commune scale, these outcomes show that groundwater potential across the country's geological and hydrogeological units can be highly variable, and that local and regional-scale information may be useful for groundwater management purposes. These results are policy-relevant in a context of rapid change and population growth, where groundwater resources can be expected to be increasingly relied upon in the coming years.					martinez-santos, pedro/0000-0003-2014-4063												2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							839	10.3390/w9110839								WOS:000416798300025

The effects of environmental factors (rain depth, length of dry period between consecutive rain events, time since the beginning of the rainy season, roof type, wind speed, and wind direction) and air pollution parameters (O-3, SO2, NO2, NO, PM2.5, and PM2.5-10) on roof runoff quality were studied. Three roofs of three common types (concrete, steel sheets, and tiles) were constructed. Roof-generated runoff was collected over two rainy seasons (>50 rain events) and were analysed for presence of metals, chemical and physical constituents, and faecal coliforms (a total of 23 parameters). Rain depth and runoff volume from each roof were recorded for each rain event. Most parameters examined complied with the Israeli potable water regulations. A stepwise multivariate linear regression established a significant effect of roof type on runoff pollutant concentrations, especially for ones generated by the roof material itself (e.g., Ca from the concrete roof and Zn from roof tiles). A significant effect of various air pollutants on the quality of roof-runoff water was found, as explained by rain washing off pollutants that accumulated in the atmosphere during the antecedent dry period. Both O-3 and PM2.5-10 affected 17 quality parameters each. Rain depth affected only four out of the 23 water quality variables. In contrast, the length of the dry period between consecutive rain events was an important factor, affecting 12 roof-runoff quality variables.

The Zeolite-Anammox Treatment Process for Nitrogen Removal from WastewaterA Review	WATER												Water quality in San Francisco Bay has been adversely affected by nitrogen loading from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) discharging around the periphery of the Bay. While there is documented use of zeolites and anammox bacteria in removing ammonia and possibly nitrate during wastewater treatment, there is little information available about the combined process. Though relatively large, zeolite beds have a finite ammonium adsorption potential and require periodic re-generation depending on the wastewater nitrogen loading. Use of anammox bacteria reactors for wastewater treatment have shown that ammonium (and to some degree, nitrate) can be successfully removed from the wastewater, but the reactors require careful attention to loading rates and internal redox conditions. Generally, their application has been limited to treatment of high-ammonia strength wastewater at relatively warm temperatures. Moreover, few studies are available describing commercial or full-scale application of these reactors. We briefly review the literature considering use of zeolites or anammox bacteria in wastewater treatment to set the stage for description of an integrated zeolite-anammox process used to remove both ammonium and nitrate without substrate regeneration from mainstream WWTP effluent or anaerobic digester filtrate at ambient temperatures.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							901	10.3390/w9110901								WOS:000416798300087						
J	Hua, RX; Zhang, YY				Hua, Ruixiang; Zhang, Yongyong			Assessment of Water Quality Improvements Using the Hydrodynamic Simulation Approach in Regulated Cascade Reservoirs: A Case Study of Drinking Water Sources of Shenzhen, China	WATER												Water quality safety is of critical importance in environmental improvement, particularly with respect to drinking water resources worldwide. As the main drinking water sources in Shenzhen, China, the cascade reservoirs comprising the Shiyan, Tiegang, and Xili Reservoirs are highly regulated and have experienced water quality deterioration in recent years. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was established using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) for the cascade reservoirs. The relationships between water quality and improvement measures were quantified and the main pollution sources for individual reservoirs were identified. Results showed that the hydrodynamic and water quality model well captured the spatial and temporal variations of water level, the permanganate concentration index (CODMn), and total nitrogen (TN), with high resolution in the cascade reservoirs. The correlation coefficients between simulations and observations were close to 1.00 for water levels, and over 0.50 for CODMn and TN concentrations. The most effective methods for water quality improvement were the reduction of the runoff load for TN and transferred water load for CODMn in the Shiyan Reservoir, reduction of the transferred water load in the Tiegang Reservoir, and an increase in transfer water volume, especially in the flood season, in the Xili Reservoir. Internal pollution sources also played an important role in water pollution, and thus sedimentation should be cleaned up regularly. This study is expected to provide scientific support for drinking water source protection and promote the application of hydrodynamic model in water quality management.

J	Macnamara, J; Derry, C				Macnamara, James; Derry, Chris			Pollution Removal Performance of Laboratory Simulations of Sydney's Street Stormwater Biofilters	WATER												The City of Sydney is constructing more than 21,000 square metres of street biofilter units (raingardens) in terms of their Decentralised Water Master Plan (DWMP), for improving the quality of stormwater runoff to Port Jackson, the Cooks River, and the historical Botany Bay. Recharge of the Botany Sand Beds aquifer, currently undergoing remediation by extraction of industrial chlorinated hydrocarbon pollutants, is also envisaged. To anticipate the pollution removal efficiency of field biofilter designs, laboratory soil-column simulations were developed by Western Sydney University partnered with the City. Synthetic stormwater containing stoichiometric amounts of high-solubility pollutant salts in deionised water was passed through 104 mm columns that were layered to simulate monophasic and biphasic field designs. Both designs met the City's improvement targets for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), with >65% median removal efficiency. Prolonged release of total suspended solids (SS) on startup emphasised the need for specifications and testing of proprietary fills. Median removal efficiency for selected heavy metal ecotoxicants was >75%. The researchers suggested that Zinc be added to the targets as proxy for metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and oils/greases co-generated during road use. Simulation results suggested that field units will play an important role in meeting regional stormwater improvement targets.

The logarithmic reduction rates for fecal coliforms (FC), Escherichia coli (EC) and intestinal enterococci (IE) were 2.84, 2.90 and 2.93. In the investigated period of time, the tested treatment plant released 4.3% of the total annual load flow volume as combined sewer overflow (CSO), that is, when the influent into the combined sewer exceeds the capacity of the treatment plant and coarsely cleaned wastewater arrives at the recipient. This CSO discharge increased the number of FIB significantly by 1.2 x 10(2) MPN/100 mL for EC, and by 1.8 x 10(1) MPN/100 mL for IE. For the Styrian part of the Mur River (1.6 million inhabitants), a calculation of FIB of all sewage treatment plants estimating the same ratio of CSO (4.3%) and a given mean flow rate (QM) results in a significant increase of the FIB load in the recipient: 3.8 x 10(3) MPN/100 mL for EC and 5.8 x 10(2) MPN/100 mL for IE. On the basis of these values the standards of water quality for recreational purposes cannot be met.

Non-Metropolitan Drinking Water Suppliers' Response to the Diagnostic Tool for Non-Technical Compliance in Limpopo, South Africa	WATER												Without the planning of non-technical issues, water treatment plants may face challenges in sustaining safe drinking water. Parameters such as the planning of financial resources, human resources, a lack of professional process controllers, poor working conditions, staff shortages and a lack of appropriate training of process controllers contribute to the underperformance of drinking water treatment plants. This study aimed at applying the Diagnostic Tool for Non-Technical Compliance to assess the compliance of small drinking water plants with management norms. Six water treatments (Vondo water scheme, Malamulele, Mutshedzi, Mutale regional water treatment plant, Tshedza and Tshedza package plant) were selected from the Vhembe district municipality of the Limpopo province in South Africa. From the abovementioned non-technical parameters, the results showed that during the first assessment period (August 2008 and June 2009) selected water treatment plants scored between 53% and 68% and fell under Class 2, indicating serious challenges requiring attention and improvement. During the second assessment period (November and December 2010), a slight improvement was observed as all plants scored between 72% and 80%, falling under the Class 2 category. Even after corrective actions and remeasurement, none of the plants met the compliance standards, which range from 90% to 100% to obtain the Class 1 compliance standard. The study recommended that tactical and strategic plans that clearly define the operational procedures, process controlling, financial planning, maintenance culture, emergency preparedness and regular monitoring and evaluation should be entrenched for the smooth running of the small water treatment plants. Furthermore, all water services providers and water services authorities should apply the diagnostic tools as developed, which provides guidance on a stepwise procedure on plant operations and management on a daily basis.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							853	10.3390/w9110853								WOS:000416798300039

Effect of Water Quality Sampling Approaches on Nitrate Load Predictions of a Prominent Regression-Based Model	WATER												High frequency in-situ measurements of nitrate can greatly reduce uncertainty in nitrate flux estimates. Water quality databases maintained by various federal and state agencies often consist of pollutant concentration data obtained from periodic grab samples collected from gauged reaches of a stream. Regression models, such as the LOAD ESTimator (LOADEST), are frequently used to model variations in concentrations associated with changes in water discharge to provide integrated solute flux measurements. However, uncertainty in the relationships between nutrient concentration and flow may lead to errors in the corresponding flux estimates. In this study, a high frequency, in-situ measurement of nitrate concentration was implemented to ascertain uncertainty in the concentration/discharge relationship caused by nitrate hysteresis. It was found that observed nitrate hysteresis, as influenced by complex storm/watershed interactions, was not readily predictable. Therefore, it can lead to substantial nitrate flux uncertainty, based on periodic grab sample monitoring approaches. Scientists and engineers should take advantage of the proposed findings in future studies to enhance the quality of the associated decision making processes.

Impact of Hybrid Water Supply on the Centralised Water System	WATER												Traditional (technical) concepts to ensure a reliable water supply, a safe handling of wastewater and flood protection are increasingly criticised as outdated and unsustainable. These so-called centralised urban water systems are further maladapted to upcoming challenges because of their long lifespan in combination with their short-sighted planning and design. A combination of (existing) centralised and decentralised infrastructure is expected to be more reliable and sustainable. However, the impact of increasing implementation of decentralised technologies on the local technical performance in sewer or water supply networks and the interaction with the urban form has rarely been addressed in the literature. In this work, an approach which couples the UrbanBEATS model for the planning of decentralised strategies together with a water supply modelling approach is developed and applied to a demonstration case. With this novel approach, critical but also favourable areas for such implementations can be identified. For example, low density areas, which have high potential for rainwater harvesting, can result in local water quality problems in the supply network when further reducing usually low pipe velocities in these areas. On the contrary, in high demand areas (e.g., high density urban forms) there is less effect of rainwater harvesting due to the limited available space. In these high density areas, water efficiency measures result in the highest savings in water volume, but do not cause significant problems in the technical performance of the potable water supply network. For a more generalised and case-independent conclusion, further analyses are performed for semi-virtual benchmark networks to answer the question of an appropriate representation of the water distribution system in a computational model for such an analysis. Inappropriate hydraulic model assumptions and characteristics were identified for the stated problem, which have more impact on the assessments than the decentralised measures.

Along with ever increasing human activities, agricultural and domestic wastes have been directly discharged into river systems around the Watershed, which consequently poses a grave threat to the sustainable development of Xinjiang. Through statistical and spatial analysis, we have determined the relationships between land use/cover (LULC) and hydro-chemical characteristics during rainy and dry seasons in 2014. Spatial patterns of hydro-chemical characteristics as demonstrated by mineralization, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and SO42-, HCO3-, Cl-, Mg2+, Na+, Ca2+ and K+ concentrations were examined in 113 sites. Since hydro-chemical characteristics were affected by LULC patterns, this study delineated six zones to analyze the distribution characteristics of hydro-chemical parameters and its relationship with LULC patterns. The results showed that, except for the pH, all variables demonstrated significant spatial differences during dry and rainy seasons. In addition, the relationships between water quality and LULC patterns indicated that the farmland, forest-grassland, water body and salinized land all affected hydro-chemical characteristics during both rainy and dry seasons. Especially, decreased rainfall, irrigation, surface runoff, the area of lake, etc. largely led to the increase in ion content, which had great influence on hydro-chemical characteristics parameters in dry season. Furthermore, we established several stepwise linear multiple regressions models. The results showed that pH, mineralization and Ca2+ were defined by forest-grassland, while the Cl- and Mg2+ were defined by salinized land during the rainy season. The pH and Na+ were estimated based on farmland, whereas Cl- and Ca2+ were estimated based on forest-grassland during the dry season. In conclusion, this research on the relationships between the spatial distribution of hydro-chemical characteristics in Ebinur Lake Watershed and LULC patterns will be significant for the sustainable management of the arid regions in northwest China.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							888	10.3390/w9110888								WOS:000416798300074

National assessments are particularly difficult as models must operate with both a very large spatial extent (the contiguous U.S.) while maintaining a level of granularity required to capture important small scale processes. In this research, we developed datasets to describe the hydrologic connectivity at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC-12) level. Connectivity between 86,000 HUC-12s as provided by the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) was evaluated and corrected. We also detailed a method to resolve the highly detailed National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) stream segments within each HUC-12 into vastly simplified representative channel schemes suitable for use in the recently developed Soil and Water Assessment Tool + (SWAT+) model. This representative channel approach strikes a balance between computational complexity and accurate representation of the hydrologic system. These data will be tested in the upcoming CEAP II national assessment. Until then, all the WBD corrections and NHDPlus representative channel data are provided via the web for other researchers to evaluate and utilize.

Previously, temporal analysis-based methods for single sensor stations have shown limited performance as they fail to consider spatial information. Besides, abundant historical data from multiple stations are still underexploited in causal relationship modelling. In this paper, a contamination event detection method is proposed, in which both temporal and spatial information from multi-stations in water distribution systems are used. The causal relationship between upstream and downstream stations is modelled by Bayesian Network, using the historical water quality data and hydraulic data. Then, the spatial abnormal probability for one station is obtained by comparing its current causal relationship with the established model. Meanwhile, temporal abnormal probability is obtained by conventional methods, such as an Autoregressive (AR) or threshold model for the same station. The integrated probability that is calculated employed temporal and spatial probabilities using Logistic Regression to determine the final detection result. The proposed method is tested over two networks and its detection performance is evaluated against results obtained from traditional methods using only temporal analysis. Results indicate that the proposed method shows higher accuracy due to its increased information from both temporal and spatial dimensions.																	2073-4441					NOV	2017	9	11							894	10.3390/w9110894								WOS:000416798300080

Common carp had a greater effect on the abundance of large zooplankton species (Diaphanosoma brachyurum) compared to bream. The abundance of the small Bosmina longirostris increased in mesocosms both with bream and common carp. The macrozoobenthos biomass reduced at higher rates in mesocosms with common carp than in those with bream, with the strongest effect of common carp on mayfly larvae. The differences between the consumption of chironomid and oligochaete larvae were not established in mesocosms with common carp. Bream mainly affected the larvae of mayflies and oligochaetes and, to a lesser degree, the chironomid larvae.																	1995-4255	1995-4263				NOV	2017	10	6					632	639		10.1134/S1995425517060117								WOS:000418097400005

Ruiz			Meta-Analysis Constrained by Data: Recommendations to Improve Relevance of Nutrient Management Research	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Five research teams identified parallel obstacles when concurrently attempting to conduct meta-analyses on the air and water quality impacts of on-farm 4R nutrient management practices. Across projects, system complexity and the lack of relevant data from cultivated and grassland agriculture field trials impeded the application of standard meta-analytical procedures. Because challenges were comparable across projects, the 4R Research Fund technical leadership tasked the researchers with recommending improvements in field research design, data collection, and reporting to enhance future agri-environmental data syntheses and meta-analyses. Here we outline statistical and analytical issues unique to meta-analysis and data synthesis in agriculture, discuss critical data and reporting gaps in the existing literature, and provide specific recommendations for researchers, funders, and journals. Key obstacles developed when field studies did not include complete descriptive or response data (per treatment and experiment year), measurement uncertainty, estimation error in treatment effects, or simultaneously measured nutrient losses and crop yield. Others did not report crop nutrient uptake or their apparent recovery efficiencies. To alleviate such challenges for subsequent research, we make the following recommendations: (i) use common meta-data protocols for consistent units and terminology; (ii) clearly define treatments and controls; (iii) provide complete, tabular, full-factorial response data for each year and location; (iv) collect and report a minimum set of auxiliary data; and (v) establish requirements for data curation and repositories in funding and publication cycles. Implementing these in future nutrient management research will facilitate more robust meta-analyses and other data synthesis efforts.																	0002-1962	1435-0645				NOV-DEC	2017	109	6					2441	2449		10.2134/agronj2017.04.0215								WOS:000417648100001

The freshwater tidal zone on the coast of Argentina is used for several purposes, including recreational and navigational activities and the provision of drinking water. We analyzed the relationship between the abundance of the phytoplanktonic species, changes in water quality (linked to enrichment with nutrients and organic matter) and the land use on the coast of Argentina. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) allowed us to identify two environmental gradients, one related to anthropogenic activities, where the most influential factors were BOD5, DIN, PO43- and DO, and a second gradient related to turbidity and conductivity. The relative abundances of 24 species were significantly correlated with the deterioration of the water quality. This set of tolerant species is mostly composed of taxa considered C-strategists, and the most represented group was the Chlorococcalean algae. The percentage of this group can provide an early warning indicator of the impairment of the water quality; its abundance exceeded 30% at those sites with a bad water quality (reaching 19000 cell mL(-1)), and were less than 15% (300 cell mL(-1)) in sites with a good water quality. The use of a reduced group of species constitutes a potential tool for monitoring, complementing another common indicators such as chlorophyll a or the total density of phytoplankton. Considering that most of these tolerant species are widely distributed it is possible to employ them as a biomonitor in other freshwater zones of temperate estuaries.																	0278-4343	1873-6955				NOV 1	2017	150						10	17		10.1016/j.csr.2016.08.009								WOS:000417657700002

In Europe, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) gives the legal basis for the use of this indicator for water quality assessment and its management. Several quality indices, like the Specific Polluosensitivity Index (SPI), were developed to assess the ecological quality status of rivers based on diatom communities. It is based on morphological identifications and count of diatom species present in natural biofilms using a microscope. This methodology requires high taxonomic skills and several hours of analysis per sample as 400 individuals must be identified to species level. Since several years, a molecular approach based on DNA metabarcoding combined to High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is developed to characterize species assemblages in environmental samples which is potentially faster and cheaper. The ability of this approach to provide reliable diatom inventories has been demonstrated and its application to water quality assessment is currently being improved. Despite optimization of the DNA metabarcoding process with diatoms, few studies had yet extended it at the scale of a freshwater monitoring network and evaluated the reliability of its quality assessment compared to the classical morphological approach. In the present study we applied DNA metabarcoding to the river monitoring network of the tropical Island Mayotte. This island is a French departement since 2011 and the WFD has to be applied. This offered the opportunity to scale up the comparison of molecular and morphological approaches and their ability to produce comparable community inventories and water quality assessments. Benthic diatoms were sampled following WFD standards in 45 river sites in 2014 and 2015 (80 samples). All samples were submitted in parallel to the molecular and the morphological approaches. DNA metabarcoding was carried out using Genelute DNA extraction method, rbcL DNA barcode and PGM sequencing, while microscopic counts were carried out for the classical methodology. Diatom community structures in terms of molecular (OTUs) and of morphological (species) were significantly correlated. However, only 13% of the species was shared by both approaches, with qualitative and quantitative variation due to i) the incompleteness of the reference library (82% of morphological species are not represented in the database), ii) limits in taxonomic knowledge and iii) biases in the estimation of relative abundances linked to diatom cell biovolume. However, ecological quality status assessed with the molecular and morphological SPI values were congruent, and little affected by sequencing depth. DNA metabarcoding of diatom communities allowed a reliable estimation of the quality status for most of the rivers at the scale of the full biomonitoring network of Mayotte Island.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2017	82						1	12		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.024								WOS:000417551700001

One of the increasing activities is recreation, including bathing areas in the south of the Caspian Sea, which have been scarcely studied and assessed. Investigating the interactions between human activities and the resulting environmental status in bathing areas, by using adequate indicators and assessment methods, is necessary to undertake management measures for ecosystem restoration. In this study, for the first time, we use the Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool (NEAT) outside the European waters to assess environmental status in bathing waters, to differentiate areas impacted and non-impacted by bathing activities. We have assessed the status in winter and summer seasons, by combining multiple indicators from different ecosystem components (8 physico-chemical, 4 bacteria, 2 plankton, and 1 benthos indicators). Despite the interactions between season and human affection, NEAT determined that the Caspian Seas is not in good status, differentiating, in summer, between impacted and non-impacted bathing areas, with a significant correlation with the number of beach users. Accordingly, management measures should be taken in the southern Caspian Sea to improve the environmental status in general and that of bathing areas in particular.

J	Pandey, J; Yadav, A				Pandey, Jitendra; Yadav, Amita			Alternative alert system for Ganga river eutrophication using alkaline phosphatase as a level determinant	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Short-term variations in phosphorus (P) concentrations must be considered while assessing the long-term changes in trophic status and estimating the P load and export. Furthermore, given the challenges of conventional monitoring of river systems, a sediment-specific biomonitoring tool may be more successful inferring P related human controls. In this study, conducted along a 37 km river channel representing up-and downstream urban control, and through a trajectory from a major point source (Assi drain), we tested the patterns of concordance between alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity and soluble reactive-P (SRP) and between AP activity and trophic status in the Ganga River. To validate data comparison, we selected a reference site at Dev Prayag, situated 1130 km upstream to the main study stretch. Samples were collected for three consecutive year (March 2013 to February 2016) with respect to atmospheric deposition, surface runoff, point source loading, river water and sediment analysis. For trajectory analysis, samples were collected from 15 locations starting from the drain outlet (zero distance) upto 1.5 km downstreaM with sampling location 100 m away from the preceding one. We found marked spatial and temporal variations in P concentrations which could be traced by quantifying the AP activity. The AP activity, recorded highest at reference site, declined with increases in P; and at drain mouth it was close to zero reflecting strong influence of P level on alkaline phosphatase activity in the river. We used canonical correlation analysis (CCorA) to test the degrees of concordance and similarity in different variables. Most of the environmental variables and indicators of eutrophy appear largely clustered at one side of the coordinate separating AP activity and dissolved oxygen towards opposite side of the axis. The dynamic fit function relating AP activity with different variables showed significant positive correlation with DO (R-2 = 0.67; p < 0.001) and negative correlations with BOD (R-2 = 0.82; p < 0.001), Chl a biomass (R-2 = 0.52; p < 0.001) and trophic status index (R-2 = 0.54 (Chl a), 0.96 (DRP); p < 0.001). Furthermore, the enzyme activity did not show significant negative correlation with heavy metals in sediment. Because anthropogenic activities continue to enhance P loads; AP is inhibited directly by P availability; and eutrophy feedbacks sediment P release, our observations on P-AP activity relationship provide a valuable alternative means for detecting P related. controls on water quality, trophic status and biogeochemical feedbacks in human impacted rivers.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2017	82						327	343		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.061								WOS:000417551700032

This biome covers an area of about 2 million km2, i.e. nearly 24% of the total area of Brazil, and has come under substantial pressure during the last 50 years caused by strong land-use/land-cover change, mostly due to agricultural expansion and urbanization. Because of its fast transformation rate, there is an enormous demand for knowledge, and its application, about the effects of land-use/land-cover on the capacity of providing or maintaining ecosystem services. The MapES approach was developed using a vast existing knowledge base. After analyzing and structuring this knowledge the relationships between land-use/land-cover and the potential to provide or maintain eight ecosystem services (Erosion Control, Runoff Control, Water Supply, Water Quality Maintenance, Soil Quality Maintenance, Biodiversity Maintenance, Food Production and Energy Production) were parametrized. In addition, the approach was developed as spatially explicit by including landscape properties (soil, slope and distance to river network) in the cell based system. A reference map of potential natural vegetation and a land use map for 2013 for a meso-scale experimental catchment (32.7 km(2)) were produced. The catchment was used as an example to apply the approach, i.e. assessing and visualizing changes from before human interference to the current land use situation. Finally, a procedure for assessing the potential impacts of land-use/land-cover on ecosystem services considering the methodological limitations of the respective monitoring. The presented approach is easy to understand, to modify and to adapt to other situations and might be therefore used in other context of decision support. It might also help to fill the gap between land use planning and numeric modeling using very complex tools.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				NOV	2017	82						513	525		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.028								WOS:000417551700050

Diatom teratologies as biomarkers of contamination: Are all deformities ecologically meaningful?	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Contaminant-related stress on aquatic biota is difficult to assess when lethal impacts are not observed. Diatoms, by displaying deformities (teratologies) in their valves, have the potential to reflect sub-lethal responses to environmental stressors such as metals and organic compounds. For this reason, there is great interest in using diatom morphological aberrations in biomonitoring. However, the detection and mostly the quantification of teratologies is still a challenge; not all studies have succeeded in showing a relationship between the proportion of abnormal valves and contamination level along a gradient of exposure. This limitation in part reflects the loss of ecological information from diatom teratologies during analyses when all deformities are considered. The type of deformity, the severity of aberration, species proneness to deformity formation, and propagation of deformities throughout the population are key components and constraints in quantifying teratologies. Before a metric based on diatom deformities can be used as an indicator of contamination, it is important to better understand the "ecological signal" provided by this biomarker. Using the overall abundance of teratologies has proved to be an excellent tool for identifying contaminated and non-contaminated environments (presence/absence), but refining this biomonitoring approach may bring additional insights allowing for a better assessment of contamination level along a gradient. The dilemma: are all teratologies significant, equal and/or meaningful in assessing changing levels of contamination? This viewpoint article examines numerous interrogatives relative to the use of diatom teratologies in water quality monitoring, provides selected examples of differential responses to contamination, and proposes solutions that may refine our understanding and quantification of the stress. This paper highlights the logistical problems associated with accurately evaluating and interpreting teratologies and stimulates more discussion and research on the subject to enhance the sensitivity of this metric in bioassessments.

However, they are vulnerable parts of the landscapes that are often poorly understood and understudied. Land use and management practices, as well as climate change are thought to be a contribution to the global amphibian decline. However, more research is needed to understand the extent of these impacts. Here, we present methodology for characterizing a vernal pond's morphology and detail a monitoring station that can be used to collect water quantity and quality data over the duration of a vernal pond's hydroperiod. We provide methodology for how to conduct field surveys to characterize the morphology and develop stage-storage curves for a vernal pond. Additionally, we provide methodology for monitoring the water level, temperature, pH, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductivity of water in a vernal pond, as well as monitoring rainfall data. This information can be used to better quantify the ecosystem services that vernal ponds provide and the impacts of anthropogenic activities on their ability to provide these services.																	1940-087X					NOV	2017		129							e56466	10.3791/56466								WOS:000417688700070	29155765					
J	Shu, TX; Xia, M; Chen, JH; de Silva, C				Shu, Tongxin; Xia, Min; Chen, Jiahong; de Silva, Clarence			An Energy Efficient Adaptive Sampling Algorithm in a Sensor Network for Automated Water Quality Monitoring	SENSORS												Power management is crucial in the monitoring of a remote environment, especially when long-term monitoring is needed. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind may be harvested to sustain a monitoring system. However, without proper power management, equipment within the monitoring system may become nonfunctional and, as a consequence, the data or events captured during the monitoring process will become inaccurate as well. This paper develops and applies a novel adaptive sampling algorithm for power management in the automated monitoring of the quality of water in an extensive and remote aquatic environment. Based on the data collected on line using sensor nodes, a data-driven adaptive sampling algorithm (DDASA) is developed for improving the power efficiency while ensuring the accuracy of sampled data. The developed algorithm is evaluated using two distinct key parameters, which are dissolved oxygen (DO) and turbidity. It is found that by dynamically changing the sampling frequency, the battery lifetime can be effectively prolonged while maintaining a required level of sampling accuracy. According to the simulation results, compared to a fixed sampling rate, approximately 30.66% of the battery energy can be saved for three months of continuous water quality monitoring. Using the same dataset to compare with a traditional adaptive sampling algorithm (ASA), while achieving around the same Normalized Mean Error (NME), DDASA is superior in saving 5.31% more battery energy.																	1424-8220					NOV	2017	17	11							2551	10.3390/s17112551								WOS:000416790500113

Development and Validation of an On-Line Water Toxicity Sensor with Immobilized Luminescent Bacteria for On-Line Surface Water Monitoring	SENSORS												Surface water used for drinking water production is frequently monitored in The Netherlands using whole organism biomonitors, with for example Daphnia magna or Dreissena mussels, which respond to changes in the water quality. However, not all human-relevant toxic compounds can be detected by these biomonitors. Therefore, a new on-line biosensor has been developed, containing immobilized genetically modified bacteria, which respond to genotoxicity in the water by emitting luminescence. The performance of this sensor was tested under laboratory conditions, as well as under field conditions at a monitoring station along the river Meuse in The Netherlands. The sensor was robust and easy to clean, with inert materials, temperature control and nutrient feed for the reporter organisms. The bacteria were immobilized in sol-gel on either an optical fiber or a glass slide and then continuously exposed to water. Since the glass slide was more sensitive and robust, only this setup was used in the field. The sensor responded to spikes of genotoxic compounds in the water with a minimal detectable concentration of 0.01 mg/L mitomycin C in the laboratory and 0.1 mg/L mitomycin C in the field. With further optimization, which should include a reduction in daily maintenance, the sensor has the potential to become a useful addition to the currently available biomonitors.

Ecological resilience in lakes and the conjunction fallacy	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												There is a pressing need to apply stability and resilience theory to environmental management to restore degraded ecosystems effectively and to mitigate the effects of impending environmental change. Lakes represent excellent model case studies in this respect and have been used widely to demonstrate theories of ecological stability and resilience that are needed to underpin preventative management approaches. However, we argue that this approach is not yet fully developed because the pursuit of empirical evidence to underpin such theoretically grounded management continues in the absence of an objective probability framework. This has blurred the lines between intuitive logic (based on the elementary principles of probability) and extensional logic (based on assumption and belief) in this field.

The trajectory of agricultural technology is now at an inflection point where information technology, including remote sensing, simulation modeling, decision support systems, precision agricultural technologies, and automation, enables site-specific management at small spatial scales with the potential to simultaneously enhance food and bioenergy production, farm profitability, and environmental quality. To achieve these economic and environmental benefits of transforming agricultural landscape design and cropping system management, agricultural producers need increased access to both enabling technologies and engineering expertise. Government policies and programs are also needed to incentivize changes in cropping systems that promote soil health and improve water quality, for example, payments to cover much or all of the cost of transitioning land use to perennials and nutrient trading programs in which agricultural producers contract with industrial and municipal wastewater generators to reduce nutrient loading at a reduced cost. Information technology is providing the tools to target, quantify, and document this re-coupling of economic, environmental, and social sustainability in food-energy-water systems.

Leaf litter additions enhance stream metabolism, denitrification, and restoration prospects for agricultural catchments	ECOSPHERE												Globally intensive agriculture has both increased nitrogen pollution in adjacent waterways and decreased availability of terrestrially derived carbon frequently used by stream heterotrophs in nitrogen cycling. We tested the potential for carbon additions via leaf litter from riparian restoration plantings to act as a tool for enhancing denitrification in agricultural streams with relatively high concentrations of nitrate (1.3-8.1 mg/L) in Canterbury, New Zealand. Experimental additions of leaf packs (N = 200, mass = 350 g each) were carried out in 200-m reaches of three randomly selected treatment streams and compared to three control streams receiving no additional leaf carbon. Litter additions increased ecosystem respiration in treatment streams compared to control streams but did not affect gross primary production, indicating the carbon addition boosted heterotrophic activity, a useful gauge of the activities of microbes involved in denitrification. Bench-top assays with denitrifying enzymes using acetylene inhibition techniques also suggested that the coarse particulate organic matter added from leaf packs would have provided substrates suitable for high rates of denitrification. Quantifying denitrification directly in experimental reaches by open-channel methods based on membrane inlet mass spectrophotometry indicated that denitrification was around three times higher in treatment streams where litter was added compared to control streams. We further assessed the potential for riparian plantings to reduce large-scale downstream nitrogen losses through increasing in-stream denitrification by modeling the effects of increasing riparian vegetation cover on nitrogen fluxes. Here, we combined estimates of in-stream ecosystem processes derived from our experiment with a network model of catchment-scale nitrogen retention and removal based on empirical measurements of nitrogen flux in this typical agricultural catchment. Our model indicated leaf inputs associated with increased riparian cover had the potential to double the catchment level rate of denitrification, offering a promising way to mitigate nitrate pollution in agricultural streams. Altogether, our study indicates that overcoming carbon limitation and boosting heterotrophic processes will be important for reducing nitrogen pollution in agricultural streams and that combining empirical approaches for predictions suggests there are large potential benefits from riparian re-vegetation efforts at catchment scales.

In this study, circular bubble plume diffusers were used, for the first time, to restore water quality in the Aha Reservoir, a typical sub-deep reservoir in Southwest China. Axisymmetric intrusive gravity currents were formed with a horizontal radius of 250 m at the equilibrium depth and the intrusion of oxygen-enriched water occurred within the depth of 10-14 m, while thermal stratification remained intact. A total of 95% of the imported oxygen was dissolved, but most was consumed by organic matter and other reduced substances within the hypolimnion. The oxygen consumption of organic matter, NH4+ and remaining reduced materials, accounted for 41.4-52.5%, 25% and 13.3-24.4% of the total imported oxygen, respectively. Compared with the control sites, dissolved oxygen level in the hypolimnion increased 3-4 times, and concentrations of NH4+, total Fe and total Mn were reduced by 15.5%, 45.5% and 48.9%, respectively. A significant decrease in total phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations was observed in the experimental zone (0.04-0.02 mg/L and 1.9-1.7 mg/L, respectively). This indicates that circular bubble plumes have great potential for oxygenation of the hypolimnion and improving water quality in the sub-deep water system. Nevertheless, further efforts are needed to improve the discrete bubble model to elaborate the oxygen transmission dynamics and the plume formation processes in sub-deep water systems, incorporating oxygen consumption processes.																	1660-4601					NOV	2017	14	11							1298	10.3390/ijerph14111298								WOS:000416545200014	29072625

In Pisa (Italy) we performed a three-year survey on Legionella presence in 121 buildings with an independent hot water production (IB); 64 buildings with a central hot water production (CB); and 35 buildings with a solar thermal system for hot water production (TB). From all the 220 buildings Legionella spp. was researched in two hot water samples collected either at the recirculation point or on the first floor and on the last floor, while the potable water quality was analysed in three cold water samples collected at the inlet from the aqueduct network, at the exit from the autoclave, and at the most remote tap. Legionella pneumophila sg1, Legionella pneumophila sg2-16, and non-pneumophila Legionella species were detected in 26% of the hot water networks, mostly in CB and TB. In these buildings we detected correlations between the presence of Legionella and the total chlorine concentration decrease and/or the increase of the temperature. Cold water resulted free from microbiological hazards, with the exception of Serratia liquefaciens and Enterobacter cloacae isolated at the exit from two different autoclaves. We observed an increase in total microbial counts at 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C between the samples collected at the most remote taps compared to the ones collected at the inlet from the aqueduct. The study highlights a condition of potential risk for susceptible categories of population and supports the need for measures of risk assessment and control.																	1660-4601					NOV	2017	14	11							1296	10.3390/ijerph14111296								WOS:000416545200012	29072607

Seasonal variations of rotifers from the high altitude Llano reservoir (State of Mexico, Mexico)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: Llano reservoir is a high altitude waterbody and is of recreational importance in Mexico. It is also a source of revenue through fisheries. Though the reservoir was constructed nearly 6 decades ago, quantitative information on the zooplankton abundance is not available. The aim of the present study was to present data on the seasonal variations of rotifers from the high altitude waterbody Llano dam (State of Mexico) during a one year period. Methodology: Rotifer sampling was done monthly from 5 different littoral zones for one year (August 2014 to July 2015). Eighty liters of superficial water from the reservoir were concentrated to 200 ml through a plankton net of 50 mu m pore size and fixed in 4% formalin. Selected physico-chemical parameters (dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, conductivity and nutrients (NO3- and PO4-3) and Chlorophyll a were also measured. Results: Temperature varied from 10-20 degrees C and pH 5-8. The reservoir had low turbidity (<3 NTU). nitrates (<60 mu g L-1), phosphates (<5 mu g L-1) and chlorophyll a (6-8 mu g L-1). In all, 84 species of monogonont rotifers (from 18 families and 39 genera) and 13 cladoceran species (from 3 families) were recorded. Aspelta angusta, Eosphora thoa, Trichocerca insulana and Lepadella punctata are new records for Mexico. Polyarthra vulgaris had the highest frequency of occurrence (98%), followed by Trichocerca bidens (90%) and Trichotria tectractis (75%). During April, we recorded the highest density (825 ind. I-1) of all rotifer species together, meanwhile for the rest of months, the density was low <300 ind. I-1. Shannon-Wiener index varied from 1.0 to 4.2 bits ind. I-1, depending on the sampling period. The Sladetek's Q(B/T) index in this reservoir was generally 1. Interpretation: In addition to nutrient levels, Chla and Q(B/T), the total rotifer density as a useful measure to determine the trophic status of this waterbody was explored. Our data from nutrients and total rotifer density showed that the Llano reservoir appeared to be oligotrophic.

Plankton community characteristics of natural and man-made tropical lakes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim : Plankton community assemblages in both natural and man-made lakes are greatly influenced by the environmental variations, which in turn are dependent on the lake morphometric characteristics, edaphic conditions, climatic changes and the surrounding anthropogenic activities. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the pattern of phytoplankton and zooplankton composition and density, and their relationship with the water chemistry in three different lakes of Malaysia. Methodology : Water quality, phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance were measured in a natural lake and two reservoirs in Malaysia. Multivariate and univariate analyses were performed to compare the differences in community assemblages between a natural lake and a reservoir of same depth, and a shallow and a deep reservoir. Results : Marked lake variations were observed in the phytoplankton density. Dominant phytoplankton groups were Cryptophyta and Bacillariophyta in the shallow Bera Lake, Chlorophyta in the shallow Bukit Merah Reservoir and Euglenophyta and Chlorophyta in the deeper Durian Tunggal reservoir. Both man-made lakes had significantly higher (P < 0.05) plankton densities compared to the natural lake. The shallower Bukit Merah Reservoir had higher phytoplankton density compared to the deeper Durian Tunggal Reservoir. Dissolved oxygen and pH levels were correlated to the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in the Bera floodplain, whilst nutrient and chlorophyll-a concentrations were important factors affecting the phytoplankton and zooplankton assemblages, respectively,in the Durian Tunggal and Bukit Merah reservoirs. Interpretation : Plankton community in shallow tropical lakes have different characteristics and composition compared to the deeper ones, and thus requiring different management measures.

Terrestrial diatoms as tracers in catchment hydrology: a review	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Diatoms are remarkable organisms. They are present in almost all habitats containing water (e.g., lakes, streams, soils, bark) and rank among the most common algal groups in both freshwaters and marine ecosystems. The ubiquitous character of aquatic diatoms has triggered countless applications as environmental tracers for studies in water quality, paleoclimate reconstruction and sediment tracing. However, diatoms also occur in the terrestrial environment. It is this plethora of diatom life-forms that has recently triggered interest in their use as tracers of hydrological processes. The use of diatoms in catchment hydrology has been very limited. Part of the reason is that until recently, the taxonomy and ecology of terrestrial diatom assemblages were largely unknown. However, in the past decade, much work has been done to quantify terrestrial diatom reservoir size, dynamics, and potential depletion following precipitation events. Therefore, such terrestrial diatoms now hold promise for use in catchment hydrology-for tracing runoff flow sources and pathways across a wide range of spatial scales. Here we review the literature on terrestrial diatoms and describe the various sampling protocols that have been designed and tested for specific applications in hydrological processes research. We review and summarize the work on terrestrial diatom reservoir characterization, transport mechanisms and pathways to show how such diatom-based tracer work might be possible at the catchment scale for rainfall-runoff studies. Finally, we present a vision for future work that might take advantage of terrestrial diatoms in catchment hydrology and discuss the main challenges going forward. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Disrupted carbon cycling in restored and unrestored urban streams: Critical timescales and controls	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Carbon fixation and respiration in flowing waterways play significant roles in global and regional carbon budgets, yet how land use and watershed management interact with temporal disturbances (storms) to influence metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we combine long-term with synoptic sampling of metabolism and its variable controls in neighboring watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay to resolve limiting factors and critical timescales associated with recovery from disturbance. We found that, relative to predictions of the river continuum concept, focal streams have disrupted carbon cycles, with carbon balances closer to zero, and, in some cases, tighter coupling between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), attributable to carbon limitation. Carbon became limiting to ER where flashy storm hydrographs and simplified channel geomorphology inhibited accumulation of fine sediment. Shannon entropy analysis of timescales revealed that fine sediment served as a time-release capsule for nutrients and carbon over 4-6 months, fueling biogeochemical transformations. Loss of fines through hydraulic disturbance had up to 30-d impacts on GPP and 50-d impacts on ER in the stream with carbon limitation. In contrast, where GPP and ER were not tightly coupled, recovery occurred within 1 d. Results suggest that a complex interplay between nutrient and carbon limitation and mechanical and chemical disturbance governs patterns and consequences of disrupted carbon cycling in urban streams. Carbon limitation and tight GPP/ER coupling enhance the vulnerability of stream ecosystem functions, but best management practices that target stormflow reduction and channel geomorphic diversity can break that coupling and minimize carbon cycle disruptions.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2017	62			1			S160	S182		10.1002/lno.10613								WOS:000415924700012

Water quality longitudinal profile of the Paraiba do Sul River, Brazil during an extreme drought event	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												This work addresses the relationships between Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and water quality in the Paraiba do Sul River (PSR), located in one of the most populated regions in Brazil. We conducted a water sampling program (analyzing nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, turbidity, total carbon, oxygen concentration, and conductivity) during a severe drought period from 2014 to 2016. The 210 samples were spaced about 5 km apart from headwaters to the Atlantic Ocean and taken over 63 d. We calculated a water quality index and applied a self-organizing map (SOM) to explore the relationship between LULC and water quality. There was a significant influence on water quality from the urban area's socioeconomic profile. This observation reflects the influence of cities with a high population density and a low economic condition, which leads to further degradation and erosion of the riverbanks. The most degraded reservoir of the PSR (Funil) partially buffers these effects by retaining deposited sediments and nutrient loads, leading to downstream water quality improvement. Better management practices of the riverbanks in the lower reach contribute to additional water quality improvements. Three major clusters identified using the SOM had completely different and explainable water quality patterns, suggesting an abrupt change in water quality due to human interventions. This information is crucial to improve management projects for the river at a watershed level, and with the expectation of future water shortages.

The water samples were collected from the left bank, center and right bank of the river, and the follwing indicators were analyzed: lead, nickel, chromium, cadmium and copper. Heavy metals were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry with graphite furnace (GFAAS). Numerical modeling was performed using Delft3D software, taking into account a reference situation (a scenario regarding the pollutant dispersion for known concentrations) and a scenario that simulates an accidental pollution (where the concentrations of pollutants were increased by 50 % compared to the values corresponding to Class V of water quality according to M.O. 161-2006). In order to properly assess the pollutant dispersion, the construction of the numerical model was developed taking into account a number of complex hydraulic works (bottom sill, dredging operations on the Danube in the area of confluence and downstream, on the whole width of the fairway). The results of numerical modeling generated the pollutant dispersion maps and the dispersion coefficients (indicating the transport of substances). Higher levels of the monitored indicators were observed on Borcea, caused by water coming from different sources of pollution (industry, agriculture, etc.) and discharged at a low flow, limiting the dilution.																	0034-7752					NOV	2017	68	11					2477	2481										WOS:000416751800001

This study examined this nexus by elasticity and statistical approaches through the lens of three watersheds: The Yukon, Mekong and Murray. Here, this study reports the fundamental characteristics, explanations and ecological and management implications of terrestrial determinant influence on the response of water quality to climate drivers. The stability of the response, measured by climate elasticity of water quality (CEWQ), is highly dependent on terrestrial determinants, with strong impacts from anthropogenic biomes and low impacts from surficial geology. Compared to temperature elasticity, precipitation elasticity of water quality is more unstable due to its possible linkages with many terrestrial determinants. Correlation and linear models were developed for the interaction system, which uncovered many interesting scenarios. The results implied that watersheds with a higher ratio of rangeland biomes have a lower risk of instability as compared to watersheds with a higher proportion of dense settlement, cropland and forested biomes. This study discusses some of the most essential pathways where instability might adversely affect CEWQ parameters and recommends suggestions for policy makers to alleviate the instability impacts to bring sustainability to the water environment.																	2071-1050					NOV	2017	9	11							2118	10.3390/su9112118								WOS:000416793400196						
J	Kim, S; An, K				Kim, Suyeon; An, Kyungjin			Exploring Psychological and Aesthetic Approaches of Bio-Retention Facilities in the Urban Open Space	SUSTAINABILITY												Over the last decades, a number of bio-retention facilities have been installed in urban areas for flood control and green amenity purposes. As urban amenity facilities for citizens, bio-retentions have a lot potential; however, the literature on bio-retentions focused mostly on physiochemical aspects like water quality and runoffs. Hence, this paper aims to explore psychological aspects of bio-retentions such as perceptions and landscape aesthetic value for visitors. In order to achieve this purpose, the study employed on-site interviews and questionnaires in the chosen three case studies as research methodology. For the 3 different locations of bio-retention facilities, interviews and questionnaires were carried out. The surveys of 100 bio-retention users were conducted, investigating their general perceptions and landscape aesthetics of the bio-retention facilities. The paper found that only 34% of the interviewees recognised bio-detention facilities, illustrating that most visitors were not aware of such facilities and were unable to distinguish the differences between bio-retention and conventional gardens. On the other hand, the majority of interviewees strongly supported the concept and function of bio-retentions, especially those who recognised the differences in planting species with conventional urban open spaces. Such main findings also encourage further studies of seeking quantitative values by conducting a correlation analysis between the functions and aesthetics of bio-retention facilities.																	2071-1050					NOV	2017	9	11							2067	10.3390/su9112067								WOS:000416793400147

Onshore Wind Speed Modulates Microbial Aerosols along an Urban Waterfront	ATMOSPHERE												Wind blowing over aquatic and terrestrial surfaces produces aerosols, which include microbial aerosols. We studied the effect of onshore wind speeds on aerosol concentrations as well as total and culturable microbial aerosols (bacterial and viral) at an urban waterfront (New York, NY, USA). We used two distinct methods to characterize microbial aerosol responses to wind speed: A culture-based exposure-plate method measuring viable bacterial deposition near-shore (CFU accumulation rate); and a culture-independent aerosol sampler-based method measuring total bacterial and viral aerosols (cells m(-3) air). While ambient coarse (>2 mu m) and fine (0.3-2 mu m) aerosol particle number concentrations (regulated indicators of air quality) decreased with increasing onshore wind speeds, total and depositing culturable bacterial aerosols and total viral aerosols increased. Taxonomic identification of the 16S rDNA of bacterial aerosol isolates suggested both terrestrial and aquatic sources. Wind appears to increase microbial aerosol number concentrations in the near-shore environment by onshore transport at low wind speeds (<4 m s(-1)), and increased local production and transport of new microbial aerosols from adjacent water surfaces at higher wind speeds (>4 m s(-1)). This study demonstrates a wind-modulated microbial connection between water and air in the coastal urban environment, with implications for public health management and urban microbial ecology.																	2073-4433					NOV	2017	8	11							215	10.3390/atmos8110215								WOS:000416602500009						
J	Hill, TD; Roberts, BJ				Hill, Troy D.; Roberts, Brian J.			Effects of seasonality and environmental gradients on Spartina alterniflora allometry and primary production	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Predictions of how salt marsh primary production and carbon storage will respond to environmental change can be improved through detailed datasets documenting responses to real-world environmental variation. To address a shortage of detailed studies of natural variation, we examined drivers of Spartina alterniflora stem allometry and productivity in seven marshes across three regions in southern Louisiana. Live-stem allometry varied spatially and seasonally, generally with short stems weighing more (and tall stems weighing less) in the summer and fall, differences that persist even after correcting for flowering. Strong predictive relationships exist between allometry parameters representing emergent stem mass and mass accumulation rates, suggesting that S.alterniflora populations navigate a trade-off between larger mass at emergence and faster rates of biomass accumulation. Aboveground production and belowground production were calculated using five and four approaches, respectively. End-of-season aboveground biomass was a poor proxy for increment-based production measures. Aboveground production (Smalley) ranged from 390 to 3,350gm(-2)year(-1) across all marshes and years. Belowground production (max-min) was on average three times higher than aboveground; total production ranged from 1,400 to 8,500gm(-2)year(-1). Above- and belowground production were both positively correlated with dissolved nutrient concentrations and negatively correlated to salinity. Synthesis: Interannual variation in water quality is sufficient to drive above- and belowground productivity. The positive relationship between nutrients and belowground production indicates that inputs of nutrients and freshwater may increase salt marsh carbon storage and ecosystem resilience to sea level rise.

The following results were obtained. (1) The total non-carcinogenic risk values of 14 surface water samples were all lower than 1, which indicates that these surface water samples will not pose non-carcinogenic risk. Drinking water intake is the main exposure pathway of non-carcinogenic risk. (2) Among the 15 phreatic groundwater wells monitored, the total non-carcinogen levels at 6 points exceeded safe levels for children, which indicates that the local groundwater is harmful to children's health. The order of contaminants contributing to this risk is NO3-N > Mn > Fe > NH4-N > NO2-N. (3) Among the 29 points of confined groundwater monitoring wells, 2 points showed total non-carcinogenic risk values exceeding safe levels for children, which indicates that the local groundwater is unsafe to children health. The order of contaminants contributing to non-carcinogenic risk is NO3-N > Mn > Fe > NH4-N > NO2-N.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	22							UNSP 761	10.1007/s12665-017-7097-4								WOS:000416820300019

The other purposes of this study were to evaluate the physicochemical properties of the Maroon River water and assess the effects of each water quality parameter on the WQI values. Relationship between quality scale of hydrochemical parameters and the resulting WQI scores was determined employing linear regression analysis. Moreover, the suitability of water quality was evaluated for irrigation purposes using conventional indices, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and percent sodium (Na%). The monitoring stations were placed in high and very high categories according to the assessment of irrigation water quality with EC. Considering WQI, the upper (S1, S2, and S4) and lower (S3, S5, and S6) monitoring stations of the Maroon River distributed in category C3 (high salinity) and C4-C5 (very high salinity), respectively. The findings of WQI presented an increasing trend from upstream toward downstream in the Maroon River. The findings of the linear regression analysis showed no significant correlation between WQI scores with pH and SO42- concentrations even though the relationship is weak. These results suggest that pH and SO42- concentrations could be the secondary driving parameters behind the variations in WQI scores. It can be inferred that the Maroon River water is appropriate for irrigation based on Na% and SAR. However, it also exhibits high EC. Therefore, for mitigating the adverse impacts of polluted water authors recommend multidimensional management practices such as transferable discharge permit programs in the study area.

However, other factors of water quality such as the water age must be taken into account while forming DMAs. The current study uses genetic algorithm (GA) optimization methods to achieve the desired WDN segmentation conditions in terms of: (a) reducing the operating pressure, thus reducing the system's real losses; and (b) reducing the water age, thus improving the feeling of water freshness and preventing growth of disinfection byproducts. Techniques based on GA are a proven way to provide a very good solution to optimization problems. The solution is obtained using an objective function and setting boundary constraints. The formation of the objective functions is tested through Matlab's optimization toolbox. The logic of the objective functions' formulation for both the operating pressure and the water age optimization is recorded and analyzed. The method's application utilized a sample network model assisted by EPANET and Bentley's WaterGEMS software tools. The morphology of the DMAs is presented for each scenario, as well as the results of the network's segmentation according to the operating pressure and the water age.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		890	899		10.2166/hydro.2017.156								WOS:000416447000009

The present paper utilizes optimization methods to achieve desired segmentation conditions in terms of (a) operating pressure reduction, thus reducing the system's real water losses and (b) residual chlorine concentration reduction thus preventing disinfection byproducts' growth. Exploiting the numerous possibilities offered by the inter-connection of Matlab and EPANET software tools, an algorithm is developed in C++ language. The algorithm reads all significant data of a WDN as an output of EPANET. The first algorithm calculates the optimal allocation of a given number of closed isolation valves in terms of water losses' reduction, considering restrictions for network's proper operation. The second algorithm calculates the optimal formation of DMAs in terms of water quality improvement. Both algorithms can be applied in any WDN. The outcome is the optimal set of closed pipes that leads to the optimal formation of DMAs in a given network. The closing of pipes (by installing isolation valves) determines the optimal formation of DMAs. The basic concept of both algorithms and their application in a case study network's hydraulic model are presented.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		900	910		10.2166/hydro.2017.157								WOS:000416447000010						
J	Baouab, MH; Cherif, S				Baouab, M. Hassen; Cherif, Semia			Identification of indispensable components for a better drinking water quality management: Tunis case of study	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												In order to reduce the number of operations for the assessment of potable water treatment, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering are applied to large databases of raw and treated water of three treatment plants with various processes. It appears that the measurements can be divided into three clear groups, with a correlation higher than 0.8. The first contains salinity, conductivity, water hardness, calcium, magnesium and chlorides. The second includes turbidity and organic matter. The third includes pH and alkalinity. Despite the disparities in water quality and in all the cases, three parameters were sufficient to represent all the routine measurements: conductivity, turbidity and pH, which can represent the three principal components of the data. It can reduce by two-thirds of the measurement and analysis, dropping from 6,960 to 2,088 analysis annually. The analysis on the principal axes of the individuals, represented by raw and treated water from the three treatment plants, reveals that the quality of the raw water seems more important than the type of treatment process, in the resulting quality of treated water. These results could be generalized and easily adopted by other treatment plants whatever the process. They could offer substantial savings of time, chemicals, electricity and longevity of the devices.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		942	952		10.2166/hydro.2017.070								WOS:000416447000014

In this research first we developed a hydrological model (SWAT) to estimate recharge rates and its spatiotemporal distribution. Then, groundwater simulation of the basin was simulated and calibrated using MODFLOW 2000 and water quality was simulated and calibrated using MT3DMS. Afterwards, a multi-objective optimization model (MOPSO) and embed simulation models as tools to assess the objective function was carried out in order to produce a simulation-optimization model. Finally, a sustainability index to assess Pareto front's answers and three management scenarios (continuing previous operation, 30% increasing and reduction in previous operation) was developed. The results show that the majority of Pareto optimal answers have more sustainability index than a 30% reduction of operation with the best answer of 0.059. Relatively, the sustainability index of 30% reduction of operation is 0.05.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				NOV	2017	19	6			SI		973	992		10.2166/hydro.2017.007								WOS:000416447000016

The importance of thinking beyond the water-supply in cholera epidemics: A historical urban case-study	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES												Background Planning interventions to respond to cholera epidemics requires an understanding of the major transmission routes. Interrupting short-cycle (household, foodborne) transmission may require different approaches as compared long-cycle (environmentally-mediated/ waterborne) transmission. However, differentiating the relative contribution of short-and long-cycle routes has remained difficult, and most cholera outbreak control efforts focus on interrupting long-cycle transmission. Here we use high-resolution epidemiological and municipal infrastructure data from a cholera outbreak in 1853 Copenhagen to explore the relative contribution of short-and long-cycle transmission routes during a major urban epidemic. Methodology/Principal findings We fit a spatially explicit time-series meta-population model to 6,552 physician-reported cholera cases from Copenhagen in 1853. We estimated the contribution of long-cycle waterborne transmission between neighborhoods using historical municipal water infrastructure data, fitting the force of infection from hydraulic flow, then comparing model performance. We found the epidemic was characterized by considerable transmission heterogeneity. Some neighborhoods acted as localized transmission hotspots, while other neighborhoods were less affected or important in driving the epidemic. We found little evidence to support long-cycle transmission between hydrologically-connected neighborhoods. Collectively, these findings suggest short-cycle transmission was significant. Conclusions/Significance Spatially targeted cholera interventions, such as reactive vaccination or sanitation/hygiene campaigns in hotspot neighborhoods, would likely have been more effective in this epidemic than control measures aimed at interrupting long-cycle transmission, such as improving municipal water quality. We recommend public health planners consider programs aimed at interrupting short-cycle transmission as essential tools in the cholera control arsenal.

In spite of the development of lighting technologies, the detrimental effect of this form of light pollution has not declined. Several insect species are affected including the night-swarming mayfly Ephoron virgo: when encountering bridges during their mass swarming, these mayflies often fall victim to artificial lighting. We show a simple method for the conservation of these mayflies exploiting their positive phototaxis. With downstream-facing light-emitting diode beacon lights above two tributaries of the river Danube, we managed to guide egg-laying females to the water and prevent them from perishing outside the river near urban lights. By means of measuring the mayfly outflow from the river as a function of time and the on/off state of the beacons, we showed that the number of mayflies exiting the river's area was practically zero when our beacons were operating. Tributaries could be the sources of mayfly recolonization in case of water quality degradation of large rivers. The protection of mayfly populations in small rivers and safeguarding their aggregation and oviposition sites is therefore important.																	2054-5703					NOV	2017	4	11							171166	10.1098/rsos.171166								WOS:000416787500056	29291103

In developing countries, the major source of antibiotic contamination in surface water is improper disposal of effluents from industries, hospitals and domestic waste water treatment plants. The antibiotic pollution combined with other environmental pollution factors exerts selective pressure on environmental microbes, driving evolution and resulting in the spread of antibiotic resistance in a local to global scale. Present study aimed to determine the proliferation of ciprofloxacin resistant bacteria in aquatic environment of a river which is heavily impacted by industrial effluents. Correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic factors. Statistical analysis evaluated the effect of fluoroquinolones, heavy metals, total organic carbon and total nitrogen on the levels of resistant culture in samples from the natural settings.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				NOV	2017	31	4					456	462		10.1111/wej.12263								WOS:000416056200001

In Lebanon, we carried out experiments to assess the response of drip-irrigated table grapes grown under two water quality regimes (Freshwater (FW) and treated wastewater (TW) and two water levels (100% of evapotranspiration (ETc) and 75% of ETc). While in Jordan, we carried out experiments to assess the response of drip-irrigated fodder crops considering 4 irrigation levels (Q1: Rain fed; Q2: 80% of ETc; Q3: 100% of ETc; Q4: 120% of ETc) and three crop patterns (C1: Barley 100%; C2: Vetch 100%; C3: Mix 50% barley and 50% vetch). Based on the production and quality components, table grapes were successfully grown on plots that are supplied with TW. Fodder crops were successfully grown using TW with remarkable increase in biomass and grain yield production for the irrigated treatments.

Phytoplankton Production Characteristics in the Upper and Lower Pools of Volga Reservoir HPPs	WATER RESOURCES												Data of field observations of 1989-1991 were used to analyze the habitat conditions and the structural-functional characteristics of phytoplankton in near-dam reaches of Volga reservoirs. Averaged data show negative trends, manifesting themselves in a decline in the characteristics of phytoplankton development and production-destruction processes in the lower pools of HPPs against the background of a decrease in water temperature, water transparency, and dissolved oxygen content. Saprobity indices show water quality in near-dam reaches to correspond to beta-mesosaprobic zone and not to deteriorate in the lower pools, despite the decline in organic matter destruction. By the combination of abiotic characteristics and phytoplankton production indices, the upper and lower pools of Volga HPP reservoirs occupy close positions in the shortest network and fall in the clusters formed by stations in appropriate reservoirs.

Macrophytes as Indicators of the Ecological State of Small Rivers in Minsk Region	WATER RESOURCES												The ecological state of 18 small rivers in Minsk Region was for the first time estimated by jointly used macrophyte-based characteristics, including saprobity index, biological macrophyte index for rivers, and a scale of cenotic/supercenotic organization of aquatic and coastal-aquatic plants. Rivers with relatively safe ecological status were shown to dominate, while other rivers are in a safe and satisfactory state. The proposed approach to determining the ecological quality of watercourses is based on the calculation of a complex characteristic, i.e., an integral macrophyte index of small river ecological status; this index has been developed in the context of a classification scheme of surface water quality in the National Environmental Monitoring System of the Republic of Belarus.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				NOV	2017	44	6					840	848		10.1134/S0097807817060070								WOS:000417015800006

While several different systems have previously been used to study these lakes, no existing methodology adequately measures both the chemical and biotic parameters of these water bodies. Here, we present a novel Biotic Monitoring Yunnan Lakes (BMYL) index that provides a general assessment tool for ecological deterioration that is caused by organic pollution. Principal Component Analysis is used to analyze the occurrence of families of macroinvertebrates and chemical properties of the lakes. In brief, families of macroinvertebrates were given a score from 10 to 1 based on sensitivity to organic enrichment and eutrophication. Sampling at each lake yielded an Average Score per Lake (ASPL) which is calculated by dividing the total BMYL by the total number of scoring families. High ASPL values characterize a biologically intact lake containing relatively large numbers of high scoring taxa, while lower ASPL values denote a polluted lake that does not support many high scoring taxa. The results of the BMYL show a notably more accurate characterization of the long-term health of concerned aquatic ecosystems than studies that use abundance levels of species or a simple analysis of chemical parameter.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				NOV	2017	44	6					864	874		10.1134/S0097807817090020								WOS:000417015800008

Effects of bacilli, molasses, and reducing feeding rate on biofloc formation, growth, and gene expression in Litopenaeus vannamei cultured with zero water exchange	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The effects of reducing feeding rate and molasses on water quality, growth, and gene expression of Litopenaeus vannamei were evaluated in a super intensive system with zero water exchange. A bioassay of 35 days (0,75 +/- 0,22 g, 36 shrimp tank(-1), 450 shrimp m(-3)) with treatments in triplicate was performed: I) 100% commercial feed (control group) with water exchange; II) 100% commercial feed without water exchange; III) 100% commercial feed + Bacillus licheniformis BCR 4-3 + molasses without water exchange; IV) 90% commercial feed + B. licheniformis BCR 4-3 + molasses without water exchange, and V) 80% commercial feed + B. licheniformis BCR 4-3 + molasses without water exchange. Shrimp survival, weight, nitrogenous wastes, settleable solids (SS), and the relative expression (RT-qPCR) of stress and digestive genes were determined. Shrimp survival was 100% in all treatments. The reduced diet, bioflocs, and bacilli did not affect shrimp growth. The culture conditions reduced nitrogenous wastes and modulated mRNA expression of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and heat shock protein 70. Reduced feed ration can help to maintain water quality and lower costs in intensive shrimp cultures with bioflocs.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				NOV	2017	45	5					900	907		10.3856/vol45-issue5-fulltext-4								WOS:000416813500004

The experiment, conducted in twenty-one plastic tanks (750 L) was set up to evaluate water quality, growth; production and survival of shrimp, tilapia, and snapper, for 60 days. Three replicates were assigned to seven treatments: After 30 day, initial densities were unfolded (shrimp = 50 ind m(-3), tilapia = 16 ind m(-3) and red snapper = 8 ind m(-3)). Feeding rate was adjusted at 5 and 10% of body weight d(-1) for shrimp and fish, respectively. The shrimp-tilapia mix cultures produced the higher nitrogen and phosphorus in water concentrations. Significant lower survival values were obtained for shrimp (60.0 +/- 0.6%) cultured with snapper and for tilapia (79.0 +/- 3.1%) reared with shrimp. Mean final biomass for shrimp, tilapia and snapper were higher for the mix-cultures (2.04, 7.7 and 2.9 fold increase, respectively) with respect to their initial biomass. The mix culture system allowed an increase in total production with lower feed conversion ratios, thus contributing with the system sustainability.

In Brazil, the major volume of commercialized freshwater ornamental fish is originated from fish farms managed by small and midsized farmers. The aim of this study was to characterize the metazoan parasitic fauna associated with the main freshwater ornamental fish farmed in Southern Brazil. Between July 2014 and January 2015, 423 fishes belonging to nine freshwater species were examined: angelfish Pterophylum scalare, siamese fighting fish Betta splendens, telescope and comet goldfish Carassius auratus, zebrafish Danio rerio, blood red swordtail Xiphophorus helleri, caramel and wagtail platy fish Xiphophorus maculatus, black molly Poecilia sphenops, white cloud mountain minnow Tanichthys albonubes and goldfinned barb Puntius sachsii. Water quality was measured in fishponds from each facility. Specimens were obtained from three ornamental fish farms located in three micro-regions in the State of Santa Catarina (Biguacu, Camboriu e Joinville). Parasitological indexes were obtained after parasitological analysis of mucus, gills, and eyes. Trichodinids, Piscinoodinium pillulare, and Ichthyophthirius multifiliis were found in all fish farms analyzed. However, P. pillulare showed the greatest prevalence and mean intensity, compared to the other protozoa analyzed. 75% prevalence and mean intensity 57.5 were observed in the gills of P. scalare from fish farm Araquari. This study showed that fish farm Biguacu, was the facility presenting the greatest parasite diversity. P. scalare and C. auratus were the most parasitized fish species presenting the higher richness when compared to another species. These ornamental species are widely traded and require greater care in cultivation because it is essential to produce healthy fish with attractive features accepted by the market.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				NOV	2017	45	5					948	956		10.3856/vol45-issue5-fulltext-10								WOS:000416813500010

Connectivity and systemic resilience of the Great Barrier Reef	PLOS BIOLOGY												Australia's iconic Great Barrier Reef (GBR) continues to suffer from repeated impacts of cyclones, coral bleaching, and outbreaks of the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), losing much of its coral cover in the process. This raises the question of the ecosystem's systemic resilience and its ability to rebound after large-scale population loss. Here, we reveal that around 100 reefs of the GBR, or around 3%, have the ideal properties to facilitate recovery of disturbed areas, thereby imparting a level of systemic resilience and aiding its continued recovery. These reefs (1) are highly connected by ocean currents to the wider reef network, (2) have a relatively low risk of exposure to disturbances so that they are likely to provide replenishment when other reefs are depleted, and (3) have an ability to promote recovery of desirable species but are unlikely to either experience or spread COTS outbreaks. The great replenishment potential of these 'robust source reefs', which may supply 47% of the ecosystem in a single dispersal event, emerges from the interaction between oceanographic conditions and geographic location, a process that is likely to be repeated in other reef systems. Such natural resilience of reef systems will become increasingly important as the frequency of disturbances accelerates under climate change.

Among different forms of aquatic pollutants, chemical and biological agents create paramount threat to water quality when the safety standards are surpassed. There are many conventional remediatory strategies that are practiced such as resin-based exchanger and activated charcoal/carbon and reverse osmosis. Newer technologies using plants, microorganisms, genetic engineering, and enzyme-based approaches are also proposed for aquatic pollution management. However, the conventional technologies have shown impending inadequacies. On the other hand, new bio-based techniques have failed to exhibit reproducibility, wide specificity, and fidelity in field conditions. Hence, to solve these shortcomings, nanotechnology ushered a ray of hope by applying nanoscale zinc oxide (ZnO), titanium dioxide (TiO2), and tungsten oxide (WO3) particles for the remediation of water pollution. These nanophotocatalysts are active, cost-effective, quicker in action, and can be implemented at a larger scale. These nanoparticles are climate-independent, assist in complete mineralization of pollutants, and can act non-specifically against chemically and biologically based aquatic pollutants. Photocatalysis for environmental remediation depends on the availability of solar light. The mechanism of photocatalysis involves the formation of electron-hole pairs upon light irradiations at intensities higher than their band gap energies. In the present review, different methods of synthesis of nanoscale ZnO, TiO2, and WO3 as well as their structural characterizations have been discussed. Photodegradation of organic pollutants through mentioned nanoparticles has been reviewed with recent advancements. Enhancing the efficacy of photocatalysis through doping of TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles with non-metals, metals, and metal ions has also been documented in this report.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	33					25775	25797		10.1007/s11356-017-0252-3								WOS:000416332100027

However, their applicability and efficacy have rarely been tested in Indian streams and rivers. In the present study, benthic diatom assemblages were sampled at 27 sites along the Chambal River in Central India. PCA revealed three groups of sites, namely, heavily polluted (HVPL), moderately polluted (MDPL), and least polluted (SANT). A total of 100 diatom taxa belonging to 40 genera were identified. Brachysira vitrea (Grunow) was the most abundant species recorded from the least polluted sites with an average relative abundance of 29.52. Nitzschia amphibia (Grunow) was representative of heavily polluted sites (average relative abundance 31.71) whereas moderately polluted sites displayed a dominance of Achnanthidium minutissimum (KIitzing) with an average relative abundance of 26.33. CCA was used to explore the relationship between diatom assemblage composition and environmental variables. Seventeen different diatom indices were calculated using diatom assemblage data. The relationship between measured water quality variables and index scores was also investigated. Most of the diatom indices exhibited strong correlations with water quality variables including BOD, COD, conductivity, and nutrients, particularly phosphate. Best results were obtained for TDI and IPS indices which showed a high level of resolution with respect to discrimination of sites on the basis of pollution gradients. Water quality maps for the Chambal River were hence prepared in accordance with these two indices. However, satisfactory results with respect to water quality evaluation were also obtained by the application of EPI-D and IGD indices. The present study suggests that TDI and IPS are applicable for biomonitoring of rivers of Central India. Diatom indices, which are simpler to use such as IGD, may be considered, at least for a coarser evaluation of water quality.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	33					25955	25976		10.1007/s11356-017-0166-0								WOS:000416332100042	28940082

Study emphases covered publication outputs, language, categories, journals, countries/territories, institutions, words, and hot issues. The results indicated that the annual output of environmental monitoring publications increased steadily. The environmental sciences and analytical chemistry were the two most common categories. Environmental Monitoring and Assessment published the most articles. The USA and the UK ranked in the top two in terms of all five indicators. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took the leading position of the institutions in terms of publication output. The synthesized analysis by words in title, author keywords, and KeyWords Plus provided important clues for hot issues. Researchers paid more attention on water environment monitoring than other environmental factors. The contaminants including organic contaminants, heavy metal, and radiation were most common research focuses, and the organic contaminants and heavy metal of the degree of concern were gradually rising. Sensor and biosensor played an important role in the field of environmental monitoring devices. In addition to conventional device detection method, the remote sensing, GIS, and wireless sensor networks were the mainstream environmental monitoring methods. The international organization, social awareness, and the countries' positive and effective political and policies promoted the published articles.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	33					26079	26091		10.1007/s11356-017-0147-3								WOS:000416332100052

The overall field-effect transistor (FET) structure consists of a thermally reduced graphene oxide (rGO) channel with a thin layer of Al2O3 passivation as a top gate combined with sputtered gold nanoparticles that link with the glutathione (GSH) probe to attract Pb2+ ions in water. Using a preprogrammed microcontroller, chemo-capacitance based detection of lead ions has been demonstrated with this FET sensor. With a rapid response (similar to 1-2 s) and negligible signal drift, a limit of detection (LOD) < 1 ppb and excellent selectivity (with a sensitivity to lead ions 1 order of magnitude higher than that of interfering ions) can be achieved for Pb2+ measurements. The overall assay time (similar to 10 s) for background water stabilization followed by lead ion testing and calculation is much shorter than common FET resistance/current measurements (similar to minutes) and other conventional methods, such as optical and inductively coupled plasma methods (similar to hours). An approximate linear operational range (5-20 ppb) around 15 ppb (the maximum contaminant limit by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for lead in drinking water) makes it especially suitable for drinking water quality monitoring. The validity of the pulse method is confirmed by quantifying Pb2+ in various real water samples such as tap, lake, and river water with an accuracy similar to 75%. This capacitance measurement strategy is promising and can be readily extended to various FET-based sensor devices for other targets.

Moreover, ClO- is a powerful oxidizer for water treatment. The safety of drinking water is closely related to its content. Herein, m-phenylenediamine (mPD) is used as a precursor to prepare carbon dots (named m-CDs) with highly fluorescent quantum yield (31.58% in water), and our investigation shows that the strong fluorescent emission of m-CDs can be effectively quenched by ClO-. Based on these findings, we developed a novel fluorescent nanoprobe (m-CDs) for highly selective detection of ClO-. The linear range was from 0.05 to 7 mu M (R-2 = 0.998), and the limit of detection (S/N = 3) was as low as 0.012 mu M. Moreover, a portable agarose hydrogel solid matrix-based ratiometric fluorescent nanoprobe (m-CDs@[Ru(bpy)(3)](2+)) sensor was subsequently developed for visual on-site detection of ClO- with the naked eyes under a UV lamp, suggesting its potential in practical application with low cost and excellent performance in water quality monitoring. Additionally, intracellular detection of exogenous ClO- was demonstrated via ratiometric imaging microscopy.

Catfish survival, growth, whole-body proximate composition, body indices, liver histopathology and glycogen content were measured. Each treatment was triplicated in glass aquaria with each replicate containing 50 fish (500 fish/m(3)) with an initial weight +/- SD of 5.06 +/- 0.05 g. Glycerol significantly increased total biofloc production, and both the sucrose and glycerol treatments generally had lower nitrogenous levels, compared to the control. These levels spiked at week 2 in the rice bran treatment, leading to significantly lower survival compared to all other treatments. At both weeks 3 and 6, liver histopathology of fish in the rice bran treatment revealed substantial vacuolation and less glycogen while the highest was in fish from the glycerol treatment. Fish growth was unaffected among the treatments, but survival was highest in the glycerol treatment. Rice bran appears unsuitable for C. gariepinus, likely due to being a slower-releasing carbon source. Instead, glycerol is recommended based on significantly higher biofloc production and subsequently improved water quality and survival of C. gariepinus during their nursery culture.

Spatio-Temporal Variability in a Turbid and Dynamic Tidal Estuarine Environment (Tasmania, Australia): An Assessment of MODIS Band 1 Reflectance	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION												Patterns of turbidity in estuarine environments are linked to hydrodynamic processes. However, the linkage between patterns and processes remains poorly resolved due to the scarcity of data needed to resolve fine scale highly dynamic processes in tidal estuaries. The application of remote sensing technology to monitor dynamic coastal areas such as estuaries offers important advantages in this regard, by providing synoptic maps of larger, constantly changing regions over consistent periods. In situ turbidity measurements were correlated against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer Terra sensor 250 m surface reflectance product, in order to assess this product for examining the complex estuarine waters of the Tamar estuary (Australia). Satellite images were averaged to examine spatial, seasonal and annual patterns of turbidity. Relationships between in situ measurements of turbidity and reflectance is positively correlated and improves with increased tidal height, a decreased overpass-in situ gap, and one day after a rainfall event. Spatial and seasonal patterns that appear in seasonal and annual MODIS averages, highlighting the usefulness of satellite imagery for resource managers to manage sedimentation issues in a degraded estuary.

M.; Shahzad, Muhammad Imran; Waqas, Ahmad			Evaluation of Empirical and Machine Learning Algorithms for Estimation of Coastal Water Quality Parameters	ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION												Coastal waters are one of the most vulnerable resources that require effective monitoring programs. One of the key factors for effective coastal monitoring is the use of remote sensing technologies that significantly capture the spatiotemporal variability of coastal waters. Optical properties of coastal waters are strongly linked to components, such as colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and suspended solids (SS) concentrations, which are essential for the survival of a coastal ecosystem and usually independent of each other. Thus, developing effective remote sensing models to estimate these important water components based on optical properties of coastal waters is mandatory for a successful coastal monitoring program. This study attempted to evaluate the performance of empirical predictive models (EPM) and neural networks (NN)-based algorithms to estimate Chl-a and SS concentrations, in the coastal area of Hong Kong. Remotely-sensed data over a 13-year period was used to develop regional and local models to estimate Chl-a and SS over the entire Hong Kong waters and for each water class within the study area, respectively. The accuracy of regional models derived from EPM and NN in estimating Chl-a and SS was 83%, 93%, 78%, and 97%, respectively, whereas the accuracy of local models in estimating Chl-a and SS ranged from 60-94% and 81-94%, respectively. Both the regional and local NN models exhibited a higher performance than those models derived from empirical analysis. Thus, this study suggests using machine learning methods (i.e., NN) for the more accurate and efficient routine monitoring of coastal water quality parameters (i.e., Chl-a and SS concentrations) over the complex coastal area of Hong Kong and other similar coastal environments.

W.; Huang, Ju-Chang			Field Experiments of Chlorine Demand in Disinfection of Treated Primary Effluent	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												In the Hong Kong Harbour Area Treatment Scheme (HATS), a concentrated 10% chlorine solution (in sodium hypochlorite with a specific gravity of 1.2) is used directly to disinfect sewage that receives a chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT). The dense chlorine solution is injected into the treated sewage flow in the form of multiple dense jets. Field observations have revealed large variations of chlorine consumption in the treatment system. In view of the importance of the disinfection system to the environmental impact and operational cost of HATS, the mixing of a chlorine jet with the CEPT effluent and its associated chlorine consumption are studied for the first time using a 1: 2-scale sectional physical model located inside the sewage treatment plant, using sewage and a chlorine solution obtained on-site. The total residual chlorine (TRC) concentration distribution is measured at different cross sections of the chlorine mixing chamber. The overall disinfection efficiency is assessed by detailed measurement of the water quality of the outflow from the chamber, which receives only a few seconds of chlorine exposure. At a targeted dosing rate of 10-20 mg/L, only approximately 60-80% of the sewage flow is exposed to chlorine upon leaving the chamber, and approximately 70-80% of the chlorine mass flux is consumed within a very short distance (0.5-1 m, or a matter of several seconds) from the chlorine dosing unit. Overall, there is a 1-log Escherichia coli (E. coli) kill within the chlorine mixing chamber, with effective E. coli kill associated with a TRC concentration above 15 mg/L. The detailed field-scale model tests help to unravel the causes of the observed large TRC fluctuations in the plant and provide a basis for optimization of the chlorine disinfection operations (e.g., use of lower source chlorine concentration).

Because available water resources are much lower in the dry season, both the design and operational settings are optimized to satisfy water-demand, water-quality, and pressure constraints, as well as efficiency indices under stringent conditions. Because of the heterogeneity of the multiple decision variables and the complicated way they interact through the multiple objectives (some complimentary and some conflicting), it is not possible to fully automate the simultaneous sectorization, rehabilitation, and operational optimization. Therefore, a multistage approach is used where engineering judgment and network graph simplification and visualization tools are used to find a good feasible solution that serves as a first guess for further optimization of sectors and operational settings, to achieve feasible solutions with better cost of implementation, demand similarity among DMAs, and better pressure uniformity in operations. A multiobjective agent swarm optimization framework is used to iteratively change the sectors at the boundaries. For the final configuration, sequential linear programming is used to find optimal valve and pump settings. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Huang, HZ; Bi, CQ; Sang, SX; Miao, Y; Zhang, HJ				Huang, Huazhou; Bi, Caiqin; Sang, Shuxun; Miao, Yao; Zhang, Huajun			Signature of coproduced water quality for coalbed methane development	JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Coalbed methane is an unconventional natural gas resource with large reserves across the globe. In China, more than four billion cubic meters of coalbed methane are produced per year with large volumes of coproduced water. The various chemical constituents of coproduced water can be used as an exploration tool for coalbed methane development. This study investigated the composition of coproduced water from the lower Cretaceous Fuxin Formation in the Tiefa basin to determine its chemical signature. Water samples were collected from 12 wells in the Beier Mining Area and analyzed for chemical composition. The quality of the coproduced water after hydraulic fracturing is significantly chemically different from pristine formation water. Interplay is present between the gas production rate and the quality of the coproduced water. Wells with high gas production rate coproduce higher total dissolved solids waters that are enriched in sodium, potassium and bicarbonate but depleted in magnesium. This chemical signature may result from more methane generation, more gas production rate, long drainage time and more water production. Infill wells are not always good for the gas recovery of the existing wells because the fracturing fluids can be harmful to the existing wells in terms of the extent of depressurization and the flowing ability. The concentrations of chloride, sulfate, bicarbonate, carbonate and sodium in the fracturing fluids used in the infill wells are different from pristine formation water; therefore, they can act as indicative ions to explain the impact of the hydraulic fracturing of the infill wells on the existing well. Higher levels of chloride, sulfate and sodium and less bicarbonate and carbonate in the coproduced water from the existing wells means that more fracturing fluid from the infill wells, more proppant carried by the fracturing fluid and more pulverized coal produced by fracturing have entered the radius of pressure drop, which is harmful to the depressurization and the flowing ability of the existing wells and represents more harm to the gas production rate of the existing wells. Similarly, a smaller change of the indicative ion concentrations in the existing wells after the fracturing of infill wells means that the fracturing had less of an impact on the gas production rate.

J	Griffin, NJ				Griffin, Neil J.			The rise and fall of dissolved phosphate in South African rivers	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Eutrophication of water resources following nutrient loading is a global threat to water quality, and has been found to be one of the major threats to water quality in South Africa. Eutrophication is large-scale autotroph growth following nutrient enrichment and has several consequences, including loss of biodiversity, oxygen depletion, taste/odour generation and algal toxin production. Phosphate enrichment is often (but not always) the cause of freshwater eutrophication, and limitation of phosphate is commonly used as a means of controlling eutrophication. This study reports on a survey of trends in nutrient levels in South African freshwater resources. The research reported on here shows a significant decrease in dissolved phosphate levels in recent years, following a long period during which phosphate levels had been increasing with time. While changes in inorganic nitrogen were found, these changes did not match those in phosphate levels. Several potential causes of these changes were assessed, and it is concluded that no one cause can explain the changes observed. While the decrease in freshwater phosphate levels bodes well for water quality management, internal phosphorus cycling and other mechanisms are likely to mask the short-term impact of phosphate decreases. Significance: Eutrophication, caused by nutrient loading, is a threat to water quality. Phosphate levels in South African fresh water have risen steadily with time, but recently have shown a sharp decrease, which cannot easily be attributed to one phosphate source. The decrease has promise for eutrophication management but changes may not occur in the short term.																	0038-2353	1996-7489				NOV-DEC	2017	113	11-12					57	63	20170020	10.17159/sajs.2017/20170020								WOS:000416524200011

Geophysical characterisation of the groundwater-surface water interface	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Interactions between groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) have important implications for water quantity, water quality, and ecological health. The subsurface region proximal to SW bodies, the GW-SW interface, is crucial as it actively regulates the transfer of nutrients, contaminants, and water between GW systems and SW environments. However, geological, hydrological, and biogeochemical heterogeneity in the GW-SW interface makes it difficult to characterise with direct observations. Over the past two decades geophysics has been increasingly used to characterise spatial and temporal variability throughout the GW-SW interface. Geophysics is a powerful tool in evaluating structural heterogeneity, revealing zones of GW discharge, and monitoring hydrological processes. Geophysics should be used alongside traditional hydrological and biogeochemical methods to provide additional information about the subsurface. Further integration of commonly used geophysical techniques, and adoption of emerging techniques, has the potential to improve understanding of the properties and processes of the GW-SW interface, and ultimately the implications for water quality and environmental health.

Analytical estimation of annual runoff distribution in ungauged seasonally dry basins based on a first order Taylor expansion of the Fu's equation	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												The assessment of the mean annual runoff and its interannual variability in a basin is the first and fundamental task for several activities related to water resources management and water quality analysis. The scarcity of observed runoff data is a common problem worldwide so that the runoff estimation in ungauged basins is still an open question. In this context, the main aim of this work is to propose and test a simple tool able to estimate the probability distribution of the annual surface runoff in ungauged river basins in arid and semi-arid areas using a simplified Fu's parameterization of the Budyko's curve at regional scale. Starting from a method recently developed to derive the distribution of annual runoff, under the assumption of negligible inter-annual change in basin water storage, we here generalize the application to any catchment where the parameter of the Fu's curve is known. Specifically, we provide a closed-form expression of the annual runoff distribution as a function of the mean and standard deviation of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, and the Fu's parameter. The proposed method is based on a first order Taylor expansion of the Fu's equation and allows calculating the probability density function of annual runoff in seasonally dry arid and semi-arid geographic context around the world by taking advantage of simple easy-to-find climatic data and the many studies with estimates of the Fu's parameter worldwide. The computational simplicity of the proposed tool makes it a valuable supporting tool in the field of water resources assessment for practitioners, regional agencies and authorities.

Variable silver nanoparticle toxicity to Daphnia in boreal lakes	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Variable sensitivity of organisms to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) caused by changes in physico-chemical variables in aquatic ecosystems is receiving increasing attention. Variables such as dissolved organic carbon, pH, light, the presence of algae and bacteria, dissolved oxygen and different ions have all been studied individually, but it is still unclear how these variables in combination alter AgNP toxicity in natural ecosystems. Here we examined AgNP toxicity on survival of wild-caught Daphnia using AgNP suspensions placed in water from several different lakes at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area, which span a gradient of water quality parameters. The partitioning of AgNPs between particulate and dissolved organic matter fractions was also assessed due to the potential for algal sequestration and detoxification of AgNPs. We found that toxicity varied between lakes with LC50 values ranging between 34 and 292 mu g Ag L-1. Time of year in terms of days since ice-off and carbon to nitrogen ratios of particulate matter were the major predictors of toxicity between ecosystems. Total dissolved phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and particulate carbon to phosphorus ratios also played minor roles in influencing survival of Daphnia between water types. We found variable partitioning of silver into the particulate fraction within lakes and no significant differences between lakes. Silver associated with particulate organic matter increased with increasing concentrations of AgNPs in the ecosystem. Overall, we found strong evidence that AgNP toxicity is highly context dependent in natural lake ecosystems.																	0166-445X	1879-1514				NOV	2017	192						1	6		10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.09.004								WOS:000415768700001	28898784

Jasim			Experimentally derived acute and chronic copper Biotic Ligand Models for rainbow trout	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												We evaluated the effects of varying water chemistry ([Ca2+] = 0.2-3 mM, [Mg2+] = 0.05-3 mM, dissolved organic matter (DOM, natural, from maple leaves) = 0.3-10 mg of C L-1, pH = 5.0-8.5) on the acute (96-h, unfed fish) and chronic (30-d, fed fish) toxicity of waterborne Cu to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed in flow-through conditions. Acute and chronic Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) were developed from the obtained toxicity data-sets, using the Visual MINTEQ software. Our results indicate that Cu is predominantly an acute toxicant to rainbow trout, as there were no observable growth effects and the 96-h and 30-d LC50 values were similar, with mortality mostly occurring within the first few days of exposure. Calcium and DOM were greatly protective against both acute and chronic Cu toxicity, but Mg seemed to only protect against chronic toxicity. Additional protection by pH 5.0 in acute exposure and by pH 8.5 in chronic exposure occurred. In the range of conditions tested, the observed 96-h LC50 and 30-d LC20 values varied by a factor of 39 and 27 respectively. The newly developed acute and chronic BLMs explained these variations reasonably well (i.e. within a 2-fold error), except at pH >= 8 where the high observed acute toxicity could not be explained, even by considering an equal contribution of CuOH and Cu2+ to the overall Cu toxicity. The 96-h LC50 values of 59% of 90 toxicity tests from 19 independent studies in the literature were reasonably well predicted by the new acute BLM. The LC20 predictions from the new chronic BLM were reasonable for 7 out of 14 toxicity tests from 6 independent chronic studies (with variable exposure durations). The observed deviations from BLM predictions may be due to uncertainties in the water chemistry in these literature studies and/or to differences in fish sensitivity. A residual pH effect was also observed for both the acute and the chronic data-sets, as the ratio of predicted vs. observed LC values generally increased with the pH. Additional mechanistic studies are required to understand the influence of pH, Na, and Mg on Cu toxicity to trout. The present study presents the first experimentally developed chronic Cu BLM for the rainbow trout. To the best of our knowledge, it also presents the first acute Cu BLM that is based on a published data-set for trout. These newly developed BLMs should contribute to improving the risk assessment of Cu to fish in freshwater.

The sources of pollution are so vast and also include point and nonpoint sources, with intrinsic challenge for control and abatement. This paper focuses on pollutant concentrations and also the distance that the pollution is in contact with the river water as objective functions to determine two main necessary characteristics for water quality management in the river. These two necessary characteristics are named assimilative capacity and dilution flow. The mean area of unacceptable concentration and affected distance (X) are considered as two objective functions to determine the dilution flow by a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) optimization algorithm. The results demonstrate that the variation of river flow discharge in different seasons can modify the assimilation capacity up to 97%. Moreover, when using dilution flow as a water quality management tool, results reveal that the content of and X change up to 97% and 93%, respectively.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				NOV	2017	99	5					531	541		10.1007/s00128-017-2182-7								WOS:000415991900001	28951956

Individual and combined toxic effects of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) on embryogenesis, and larval survival of the Pacific oyster were investigated. The EC50 values of BaP, BDE-47 and their mixture on embryogenesis were 18.4, 203.3 and 72.0 A mu g/L respectively, while the LC50 values for 96 h larval mortality were 26.8, 244.5 and 108.9 A mu g/L respectively. The Marking-Dawson additive toxicity indices were -0.02 and -0.19, indicating an additive effect with a trend to antagonism. In addition, DNA strand breaks were also observed in oyster embryos after exposure. Our study suggests that BaP and BDE-47 exposure can cause developmental abnormalities, DNA damage and larval mortality. Furthermore, the toxicity of the mixture is slightly lower than individual pollutant. These data will be helpful to predict the toxicity of organic pollutants, and provide criteria for marine water quality standards.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				NOV	2017	99	5					582	588		10.1007/s00128-017-2164-9								WOS:000415991900008	28889174

A series of restoration measures have been implemented since 2009 in northern Lake Gehu. This study compared aquatic plants, water quality, sediment, and phytoplankton between restoration and control areas to investigate the effect of restoration measures. The results demonstrated that aquatic macrophyte coverage increased from 0% to 10.6%; mean TP, TN, and CODMn concentrations increased by 50.0%, 42.4%, and 40.8%, respectively, compared with those before the measures were carried out; the mean Secchi depth (SD) increased to 42.5 cm, which is 1.4 times higher than that before restoration; the mean euphotic depth (Z(eu)) in the summer increased from 91 to 130 cm; the mean chl a concentration decreased from 34.8 to 20.2 mu g/L, compared with that before restoration; the Shannon-Wiener index of phytoplankton increased by 28.7%. The mean TP and TN concentrations in sediments decreased by 63.8% and 52.4%, respectively, compared with that before dredging. These results indicate that the restoration in northern Lake Gehu was effective. To complete the transformation from an algae- to a macrophyte-stable state within the region, further measures must be adopted. This restoration of a eutrophic lake can serve as a reference for similar eutrophic lakes.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				NOV	2017	35	6					1417	1431		10.1007/s00343-017-6107-4								WOS:000415810900013

As Time Goes By: Examination of Temporal Stability Across Stated Preference Question Formats	ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS												We evaluate the temporal stability of willingness-to-pay values obtained from two identical stated-preference surveys undertaken in 2004 and 2012. The surveys employ two discrete-choice elicitation formats to value reductions in two health endpoints related to tap water consumption, and are explicitly designed to make direct comparisons between formats. We find no significant differences in real willingness-to-pay between the two surveys for either format-a result that is robust to the structure of heterogeneity used to model respondent preferences. Findings lend support, at least within the context of tap water quality, to the temporal transfer of nonmarket benefits over extended time periods.

ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS												How willingness to pay for environmental quality changes as incomes rise is a central question in several areas of environmental economics. This paper explores both theoretically and empirically whether or not the willingness to pay (WTP) for pollution control varies with income. Our model indicates that the income elasticity of the marginal WTP for pollution reduction is only constant under very restrictive conditions. Our empirical analysis tests the null hypothesis that the elasticity of the WTP for pollution control with respect to income is constant, employing a multi-country contingent valuation study of eutrophication reduction in the Baltic Sea. Our findings reject this hypothesis, and estimate an income elasticity of the WTP for eutrophication control of 0.1-0.2 for low-income respondents and 0.6-0.7 for high-income respondents. Thus, our empirical results suggest that the elasticity is not constant but is always less than one. This has implications for how benefits transfer exercises, and for theoretical explanations of the environmental Kuznets curve.

Spatial econometric methods and high resolution geographical information system data related to forest characteristics are used to explain the variation in individual-specific willingness to pay (WTP) values, derived from a discrete choice experiment study. We find that respondents' WTP is higher the closer they live to their nearest forest, and the scarcer forests are in the area where they live. Interestingly, the higher the ecological value of forests in respondents' area, the more people prefer extending areas of national forest protection. We also investigate spatial patterns in individual-specific WTP scores and in latent class membership probabilities, finding that preferences are indeed spatially clustered. We argue that this clustering should be taken into account in forest management and policy-making.

When the 10- to 30-day-ahead predicted concentrations of cyanobacteria cells or cyanotoxins exceed pre-defined limit values, an early warning automatically activates an action plan considering in-lake control, e.g. intermittent mixing and ad hoc water treatment in water works, respectively. Case studies of the sub-tropical Lake Wivenhoe (Australia) and the Mediterranean Vaal Reservoir (South Africa) demonstrate that ensembles of inferential models developed by the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA are capable of up to 30 days forecasts of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins using data collected in situ. The resulting models for Dolicospermum circinale displayed validity for up to 10 days ahead, whilst concentrations of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and microcystins were successfully predicted up to 30 days ahead. Implementing the proposed scheme for drinking water reservoirs enhances current water quality monitoring practices by solely utilising in situ monitoring data, in addition to cyanobacteria and cyanotoxin measurements. Access to routinely measured cyanotoxin data allows for development of models that predict explicitly cyanotoxin concentrations that avoid to inadvertently model and predict non-toxic cyanobacterial strains.

This review discusses key factors affecting the flocculation efficiency, based on results obtained in studies of the mechanisms underlying interactions between clay particles and HAB organisms. It further elaborates clay surface modification theory and methods for improving removal efficiency of HAB cells, followed by descriptions of various modified clays successfully prepared with removal efficiencies of HAB cells that are up to hundreds of times greater than natural clays and have lower dosing requirements of 4-10 t/km(2). Presently, modified clays are the most widely used method for the mitigation of HAB in the field in China. This review also evaluates potential ecological effects of modified clay disposal on water quality, typical aquatic organisms, benthic environments, and ecosystems. Both laboratory and field results have demonstrated that modified clays markedly can actually improve water quality after treatment and pose no negative effects on aquatic ecosystems.

Here, urease is immobilized on the electrodes using Poly(methyl methacrylate) polymer. The sensing technique is based on two-electrodes-based impediometry which gives an electrical output; hence, suitable to be further processed electronically. In this paper, ten different batches of sensors have been fabricated and tested over a year. Analyzing these experimental results, an optimized fabrication technique for the proposed sensor as well as suitable sensing principle has been developed. Such optimized sensor can measure 0.005% to 5% [wt(g)/vol(ml)] urea concentration in water.

Status of small water supplies in the Nordic countries: Characteristics, water quality and challenges	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Access to safe water is essential for public health and is one of the most important prerequisites for good living and safe food production. Many studies have shown that non-compliance with drinking water quality standards in small water supply systems is much higher than in large systems. Nevertheless, people, served by small water supply systems have the right to the same level of health protection. Actions are therefore needed to improve the situation. The objective of the present study was to carry out a baseline analysis of the situation in the Nordic region and provide recommendations for governmental policy and actions. Data were gathered on number of water supplies, population served, compliance with regulations and waterborne disease outbreaks from various sources in the Nordic countries. The collected data showed that there are about 12500 regulated water supplies, 9400 of which serve fewer than 500 persons. The number of unregulated and poorly regulated supplies is unknown, but it can be roughly estimated that these serve 10% of the Nordic population on a permanent basis or 2.6 million people. However, this does not tell the whole story as many of the very small water supplies serve transient populations, summerhouse dwellers and tourist sites, with many more users. Non-compliance regarding microbes is much higher in the small supplies. The population weighted average fecal contamination incidence rate in the Nordic region is eleven times higher in the smaller supplies than in the large ones, 0.76% and 0.07%, respectively. Registered waterborne disease outbreaks were also more frequent in the small supplies than in the large ones.																	1438-4639	1618-131X				NOV	2017	220	8					1309	1317		10.1016/j.ijheh.2017.08.006								WOS:000416184900010	28869189

Partial Least Squares Regression Calibration of an Ultraviolet-Visible Spectrophotometer for Measurements of Chemical Oxygen Demand in Dye Wastewater	JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY												Wastewater from the dye industry is typically analyzed using a standard method for measurement of chemical oxygen demand (COD) or by a single-wavelength spectroscopic method. To overcome the disadvantages of these methods, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy was combined with principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) in this study. Unlike the standard method, this method does not require digestion of the samples for preparation. Experiments showed that the PLSR model offered high prediction performance for COD, with a mean relative error of about 5% for two dyes. This error is similar to that obtained with the standard method. In this study, the precision of the PLSR model decreased with the number of dye compounds present. It is likely that multiple models will be required in reality, and the complexity of a COD monitoring system would be greatly reduced if the PLSR model is used because it can include several dyes. UV-Vis spectroscopy with PLSR successfully enhanced the performance of COD prediction for dye wastewater and showed good potential for application in on-line water quality monitoring.

J	Carmona, J				Carmona, Jose			Power Plant Output Augmentation by Evaporative Cooling Based on HRSG Blowdown Water Recycling in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia: A Novel Approach	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME												Water is a scarce natural resource fundamental for human life. Power plant architects, engineers, and power utilities owners must do everything within their hands and technical capabilities to decrease the usage of water in power plants. This paper illustrates the research carried out by Poyry Switzerland to reduce the water consumption on power and desalination combined cycle power plants, on which there are gas turbine evaporative cooling systems in operation. The present study analyzed the potential re-utilization and integration of the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) blowdown into the evaporative cooling system. Relatively clean demineralized water, coming from the HRSG blowdown, is routed to a large water tank, where it is blended with distillate water to achieve the required water quality, before being used on the gas turbine evaporative cooling system. To prove the feasibility of the HRSG blowdown recycling concept, the Ras Al Khair Power and Desalination Plant owned and operated by the Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC), located in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, was used as case study. Nevertheless, it is important to mention that the principles and methodology presented on this paper are applicable to every power and desalination combined cycle power plant making use of evaporative cooling. Sea water desalination is the primary source for potable water production on Saudi Arabia, with secondary sources being surface water and groundwater extracted from deep wells and aquifers. Saving water is of utmost importance for power plants located in locations where water is scarce, and as such, this paper aims to demonstrate that it is possible to decrease the water consumption of power and desalination combined cycle plants, on which evaporative cooling is used as gas turbine power booster, without having to curtail power production. The outcome of the study indicates that during the summer season, recycling the HRSG water blowdown into the gas turbine evaporative cooling systems would result on the internal water consumption for the gas turbine evaporative coolers decreasing by 545 ton/ day, or 23.79%, compared with the original plant design which does not contemplate blowdown re-use. Using evaporative cooling results on an overall gain of 186MW, or 10.27%, on gross power output, while CO2 emissions decrease by 46.8 ton CO2/h, which represents a 13.8% reduction compared with the case on which the evaporative cooling system is not in operation. A brief cost analysis demonstrated that implementation of the changes would result in a negligible increase of the operational expenses (OPEX) of the plant, i.e., implementation of the suggested modification has an unnoticeable impact on the cost of electricity (CoE). The payback of the project, due to limited operating hours on evaporative cooling every year, is of 12 years for a 30 year plant lifetime, while 2.22M USD of extra-revenue on potable water sales are generated as a result of implementing the proposed solution. Although in principle this value is modest, the effect of government subsidies on water tariffs as well as political and strategic cost of water is not included on the calculations. In conclusion, the study results indicate that water recycling, and reduction of plant's water footprint for power and desalination combined cycle plants using evaporative cooling, is not only technically possible but commercially feasible.																	0742-4795	1528-8919				NOV	2017	139	11							111701	10.1115/1.4036685								WOS:000415790100007

Toward a theory of farmer conservation attitudes: Dual interests and willingness to take action to protect water quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Water quality in the Midwestern United States is threatened as a result of agricultural runoff. Based on self-reported data from a survey of farmers in Indiana, we aim to provide a better understanding of how awareness of water quality problems, farm-as-business attitudes, and stewardship attitudes are related to each other and willingness to improve water quality. More specifically, we propose and test a structural equation model grounded in dual-interests theory to examine if and to what extent the relationships between awareness and farm-as-business attitudes are mediated by stewardship attitudes. We found evidence to support our model, particularly the importance of stewardship versus economic attitudes. Emphasizing economic incentives to increase adoption of conservation practices may need to be reconsidered given the growing evidence that pro-social variables influence conservation decisions. We draw attention to similarities and differences in applied environmental management and environmental psychology research, calling for greater integration across these approaches.

The Promise, Practice, and State of Planning Tools to Assess Site Vulnerability to Runoff Phosphorus Loss	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Over the past 20 yr, there has been a proliferation of phosphorus (P) site assessment tools for nutrient management planning, particularly in the United States. The 19 papers that make up this special section on P site assessment include decision support tools ranging from the P Index to fate-and-transport models to weather-forecast-based risk calculators. All require objective evaluation to ensure that they are effective in achieving intended benefits to protecting water quality. In the United States, efforts have been underway to compare, evaluate, and advance an array of P site assessment tools. Efforts to corroborate their performance using water quality monitoring data confirms previously documented discrepancies between different P site assessment tools but also highlights a surprisingly strong performance of many versions of the P Index as a predictor of water quality. At the same time, fate-and-transport models, often considered to be superior in their prediction of hydrology and water quality due to their complexity, reveal limitations when applied to site assessment. Indeed, one consistent theme from recent experience is the need to calibrate highly parameterized models. As P site assessment evolves, so too do routines representing important aspects of P cycling and transport. New classes of P site assessment tools are an opportunity to move P site assessment from general, strategic goals to web-based tools supporting daily, operational decisions.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1243	1249		10.2134/jeq2017.10.0395								WOS:000416288000012	29293848

Advances in high-performance computing and hydrologic or climate modeling have enabled rapid dissemination of real-time information that can assist landowners and conservation personnel with short-term management planning. This paper reviews short-term decision support tools for agriculture that are under various stages of development and implementation in the United States: (i) Wisconsin's Runoff Risk Advisory Forecast (RRAF) System, (ii) New York's Hydrologically Sensitive Area Prediction Tool, (iii) Virginia's Saturated Area Forecast Model, (iv) Pennsylvania's Fertilizer Forecaster, (v) Washington's Application Risk Management (ARM) System, and (vi) Missouri's Design Storm Notification System. Although these decision support tools differ in their underlying model structure, the resolution at which they are applied, and the hydroclimates to which they are relevant, all provide forecasts (range 24-120 h) of runoff risk or soil moisture saturation derived from National Weather Service Forecast models. Although this review highlights the need for further development of robust and well-supported short-term nutrient management tools, their potential for adoption and ultimate utility requires an understanding of the appropriate context of application, the strategic and operational needs of managers, access to weather forecasts, scales of application (e.g., regional vs. field level), data requirements, and outreach communication structure.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1257	1269		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0377								WOS:000416288000014	29293860

Thomas			Assessing Coastal Plain Risk Indices for Subsurface Phosphorus Loss	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Phosphorus (P) Index evaluations are critical to advancing nutrient management planning in the United States. However, most assessments until now have focused on the risks of P losses in surface runoff. In artificially drained agroecosystems of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, subsurface flow is the predominant mode of P transport, but its representation in most P Indices is often inadequate. We explored methods to evaluate the subsurface P risk routines of five P Indices from Delaware, Maryland (two), Virginia, and North Carolina using available water quality and soils datasets. Relationships between subsurface P risk scores and published dissolved P loads in leachate (Delaware, Maryland, and North Carolina) and ditch drainage (Maryland) were directionally correct and often statistically significant, yet the brevity of the observation periods (weeks to several years) and the limited number of sampling locations precluded a more robust assessment of each P Index. Given the paucity of measured P loss data, we then showed that soil water extractable P concentrations at depths corresponding with the seasonal high water table (WEPWT) could serve as a realistic proxy for subsurface P losses in ditch drainage. The associations between WEPWT and subsurface P risk ratings reasonably mirrored those obtained with sparser water quality data. As such, WEPWT is seen as a valuable metric that offers interim insight into the directionality of subsurface P risk scores when water quality data are inaccessible. In the long term, improved monitoring and modeling of subsurface P losses clearly should enhance the rigor of future P Index appraisals.

Vertical Stratification of Soil Phosphorus as a Concern for Dissolved Phosphorus Runoff in the Lake Erie Basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												During the re-eutrophication of Lake Erie, dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loading and concentrations to the lake have nearly doubled, while particulate phosphorus (PP) has remained relatively constant. One potential cause of increased DRP concentrations is P stratification, or the buildup of soil-test P (STP) in the upper soil layer (< 5 cm). Stratification often accompanies no-till and mulch-till practices that reduce erosion and PP loading, practices that have been widely implemented throughout the Lake Erie Basin. To evaluate the extent of P stratification in the Sandusky Watershed, certified crop advisors were enlisted to collect stratified soil samples (0-5 or 0-2.5 cm) alongside their normal agronomic samples (0-20 cm) (n = 1758 fields). The mean STP level in the upper 2.5 cm was 55% higher than the mean of agronomic samples used for fertilizer recommendations. The amounts of stratification were highly variable and did not correlate with agronomic STPs (Spearman's r = 0.039, p = 0.178). Agronomic STP in 70% of the fields was within the buildup or maintenance ranges for corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] (0-46 mg kg(-1) Mehlich-3 P). The cumulative risks for DRP runoff from the large number of fields in the buildup and maintenance ranges exceeded the risks from fields above those ranges. Reducing stratification by a one-time soil inversion has the potential for larger and quicker reductions in DRP runoff risk than practices related to drawing down agronomic STP levels. Periodic soil inversion and mixing, targeted by stratified STP data, should be considered a viable practice to reduce DRP loading to Lake Erie.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1287	1295		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0337								WOS:000416288000016	29293833

We compared risk ratings from 12 southern states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas) using data collected from benchmark sites in the South (Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Texas). Phosphorus Index ratings were developed using both measured erosion losses from each benchmark site and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation 2 predictions; mostly, there was no difference in P Index outcome. The derived loss ratings were then compared with measured P loads at the benchmark sites by using equivalent USDA-NRCS P Index ratings and three water quality models (Annual P Loss Estimator [APLE], Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender [APEX], and Texas Best Management Practice Evaluation Tool [TBET]). Phosphorus indices were finally compared against each other using USDA-NRCS loss ratings model estimate correspondence with USDA-NRCS loss ratings. Correspondence was 61% for APEX, 48% for APLE, and 52% for TBET, with overall P index correspondence at 55%. Additive P Indices (Alabama and Texas) had the lowest USDA-NRCS loss rating correspondence (31%), while the multiplicative (Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee) and component (Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina) indices had similar USDA-NRCS loss rating correspondence-60 and 64%, respectively. Analysis using Kendall's modified Tau suggested that correlations between measured and calculated P-loss ratings were similar or better for most P Indices than the models.

Edge-Of-Field Evaluation of the Ohio Phosphorus Risk Index	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Phosphorus Index (PI) has been the cornerstone for phosphorus (P)-based management and planning over the past twenty years, yet field-scale evaluation of many state PIs has been limited. In this study, P loads measured in surface runoff and tile discharge from 40 agricultural fields in Ohio with prevailing management practices were used to evaluate the Ohio PI. Annual P loads were highly variable among fields (dissolved reactive P: 0.03-4.51 kg ha(-1), total P: 0.03-6.88 kg ha(-1)). Both measured annual dissolved reactive P (R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.001) and total P (R-2 = 0.25, p < 0.001) loads were significantly related to Ohio PI score. The relationship between measured load and PI score substantially improved when averaged annual field values were used (dissolved reactive P: R-2 = 0.71, total P: R-2 = 0.73), indicating that the Ohio PI should be utilized to evaluate average annual risk of P loss, rather than as an annual risk tool. Comparison between the Ohio PI and other established local and national metrics resulted in large differences in potential P management recommendations for the monitored fields. In the near term, revision of Ohio PI risk categories and management recommendations using local P loading thresholds is needed. To meet the minimum criteria for state PI tools, future research efforts should focus on using measured field data (i) to incorporate new input factors (i.e., P application timing and leaching potential) into the Ohio PI, and (ii) to calibrate and validate the Ohio PI to provide better P risk assessments and management recommendations.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1306	1313		10.2134/jeq2016.05.0198								WOS:000416288000018	29293845

In this study, we compare field-scale P-loss predictions between the Annual P Loss Estimator (APLE), an empirically based annual time-step model, and the Texas Best Management Practice Evaluation Tool (TBET), a process-based daily time-step model based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. We first compared predictions of field-scale P loss from both models using field and land management data collected from 11 research sites throughout the southern United States. We then compared predictions of P loss from both models with measured P-loss data from these sites. We observed a strong and statistically significant (p < 0.001) correlation in both dissolved (r = 0.92) and particulate (r = 0.87) P loss between the two models; however, APLE predicted, on average, 44% greater dissolved P loss, whereas TBET predicted, on average, 105% greater particulate P loss for the conditions simulated in our study. When we compared model predictions with measured P-loss data, neither model consistently outperformed the other, indicating that more complex models do not necessarily produce better predictions of field-scale P loss. Our results also highlight limitations with both models and the need for continued efforts to improve their accuracy.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1314	1322		10.2134/jeq2016.04.0159								WOS:000416288000019	29293849

Multisite Evaluation of APEX for Water Quality: I. Best Professional Judgment Parameterization	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model is capable of estimating edge-of-field water, nutrient, and sediment transport and is used to assess the environmental impacts of management practices. The current practice is to fully calibrate the model for each site simulation, a task that requires resources and data not always available. The objective of this study was to compare model performance for flow, sediment, and phosphorus transport under two parameterization schemes: a best professional judgment (BPJ) parameterization based on readily available data and a fully calibrated parameterization based on site-specific soil, weather, event flow, and water quality data. The analysis was conducted using 12 datasets at four locations representing poorly drained soils and row-crop production under different tillage systems. Model performance was based on the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the coefficient of determination (r(2)) and the regression slope between simulated and measured annualized loads across all site years. Although the BPJ model performance for flow was acceptable (NSE = 0.7) at the annual time step, calibration improved it (NSE = 0.9). Acceptable simulation of sediment and total phosphorus transport (NSE = 0.5 and 0.9, respectively) was obtained only after full calibration at each site. Given the unacceptable performance of the BPJ approach, uncalibrated use of APEX for planning or management purposes may be misleading. Model calibration with water quality data prior to using APEX for simulating sediment and total phosphorus loss is essential.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1323	1331		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0226								WOS:000416288000020	29293832

Calibration of the APEX Model to Simulate Management Practice Effects on Runoff, Sediment, and Phosphorus Loss	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Process-based computer models have been proposed as a tool to generate data for Phosphorus (P) Index assessment and development. Although models are commonly used to simulate P loss from agriculture using managements that are different from the calibration data, this use of models has not been fully tested. The objective of this study is to determine if the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model can accurately simulate runoff, sediment, total P, and dissolved P loss from 0.4 to 1.5 ha of agricultural fields with managements that are different from the calibration data. The APEX model was calibrated with field-scale data from eight different managements at two locations (management-specific models). The calibrated models were then validated, either with the same management used for calibration or with different managements. Location models were also developed by calibrating APEX with data from all managements. The management-specific models resulted in satisfactory performance when used to simulate runoff, total P, and dissolved P within their respective systems, with r(2) > 0.50, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.30, and percent bias within +/-35% for runoff and +/-70% for total and dissolved P. When applied outside the calibration management, the management-specific models only met the minimum performance criteria in one-third of the tests. The location models had better model performance when applied across all managements compared with management-specific models. Our results suggest that models only be applied within the managements used for calibration and that data be included from multiple management systems for calibration when using models to assess management effects on P loss or evaluate P Indices.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1332	1340		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0272								WOS:000416288000021	29293861

The objective of this study was to compare predictions from the Texas Best Management Practice Evaluation Tool (TBET) against measured P-loss data to determine whether the model could be used to improve P Indices in the southern region. Measured P-loss data from field-scale study sites in Arkansas, Georgia, and North Carolina were used to assess the accuracy of TBET for predicting field-scale loss of P. We found that event-based predictions using an uncalibrated model were generally poor. Calibration improved runoff predictions and produced scatterplot regression lines that had slopes near one and intercepts near zero. However, TBET predictions of runoff met the performance criteria (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >= 0.3, percent bias <= 35%, and mean absolute error <= 10 mm) in only one out of six comparisons: North Carolina during calibration. Sediment predictions were imprecise, and dissolved P predictions underestimated measured losses. In North Carolina, total P-loss predictions were reasonably accurate because TBET did a slightly better job of predicting sediment losses from cultivated land. In Arkansas and Georgia, where the experimental sites were in forage production, the underprediction of dissolved P led directly to the underpredictions of total P. We conclude that TBET cannot be used to improve southern P Indices, but a curve number approach could be incorporated into P Indices to improve runoff predictions.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1341	1348		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0210								WOS:000416288000022	29293843

Multisite Evaluation of APEX for Water Quality: II. Regional Parameterization	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Phosphorus (P) Index assessment requires independent estimates of long-term average annual P loss from fields, representing multiple climatic scenarios, management practices, and landscape positions. Because currently available measured data are insufficient to evaluate P Index performance, calibrated and validated process-based models have been proposed as tools to generate the required data. The objectives of this research were to develop a regional parameterization for the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model to estimate edge-of-field runoff, sediment, and P losses in restricted-layer soils of Missouri and Kansas and to assess the performance of this parameterization using monitoring data from multiple sites in this region. Five site-specific calibrated models (SSCM) from within the region were used to develop a regionally calibrated model (RCM), which was further calibrated and validated with measured data. Performance of the RCM was similar to that of the SSCMs for runoff simulation and had Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) > 0.72 and absolute percent bias (|PBIAS|) < 18% for both calibration and validation. The RCM could not simulate sediment loss (NSE < 0, |PBIAS| > 90%) and was particularly ineffective at simulating sediment loss from locations with small sediment loads. The RCM had acceptable performance for simulation of total P loss (NSE > 0.74, |PBIAS| < 30%) but underperformed the SSCMs. Total P-loss estimates should be used with caution due to poor simulation of sediment loss. Although we did not attain our goal of a robust regional parameterization of APEX for estimating sediment and total P losses, runoff estimates with the RCM were acceptable for P Index evaluation.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1349	1356		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0254								WOS:000416288000023	29293851

Larry			Evaluation of the APEX Model to Simulate Runoff Quality from Agricultural Fields in the Southern Region of the United States	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model has been widely applied to assess phosphorus (P) loss in runoff water and has been proposed as a model to support practical decisions regarding agricultural P management, as well as a model to evaluate tools such as the P Index. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of APEX to simulate P losses from agricultural systems to determine its potential use for refinement or replacement of the P Index in the southern region of the United States. Uncalibrated and calibrated APEX model predictions were compared against measured water quality data from row crop fields in North Carolina and Mississippi and pasture fields in Arkansas and Georgia. Calibrated models satisfactorily predicted event-based surface runoff volumes at all sites (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE] > 0.47, |percent bias [PBIAS]| < 34) except Arkansas (NSE < 0.11, |PBIAS| < 50) but did not satisfactory simulate sediment, dissolved P, or total P losses in runoff water. The APEX model tended to underestimate dissolved and total P losses from fields where manure was surface applied. The model also overestimated sediments and total P loads during irrigation events. We conclude that the capability of APEX to predict sediment and P losses is limited, and consequently so is the potential for using APEX to make P management recommendations to improve P Indices in the southern United States.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1357	1364		10.2134/jeq2017.07.0258								WOS:000416288000024	29293856

Use of Annual Phosphorus Loss Estimator (APLE) Model to Evaluate a Phosphorus Index	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Phosphorus (P) Index was developed to provide a relative ranking of agricultural fields according to their potential for P loss to surface water. Recent efforts have focused on updating and evaluating P Indices against measured or modeled P loss data to ensure agreement in magnitude and direction. Following a recently published method, we modified the Maryland P Site Index (MD-PSI) from a multiplicative to a component index structure and evaluated the MD-PSI outputs against P loss data estimated by the Annual P Loss Estimator (APLE) model, a validated, field-scale, annual P loss model. We created a theoretical dataset of fields to represent Maryland conditions and scenarios and created an empirical dataset of soil samples and management characteristics from across the state. Through the evaluation process, we modified a number of variables within the MD-PSI and calculated weighting coefficients for each P loss component. We have demonstrated that our methods can be used to modify a P Index and increase correlation between P Index output and modeled P loss data. The methods presented here can be easily applied in other states where there is motivation to update an existing P Index.

Revised Method and Outcomes for Estimating Soil Phosphorus Losses from Agricultural Land in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Current restoration efforts for the Chesapeake Bay watershed mandate a timeline for reducing the load of nutrients and sediment into receiving waters. The Chesapeake Bay watershed model (WSM) has been used for two decades to simulate hydrology and nutrient and sediment transport; however, spatial limitations of the WSM preclude edge-of-field scale representation of phosphorus (P) losses. Rather, the WSM relies on literature-derived, county-scale rates of P loss (targets) for simulated land uses. An independent field-scale modeling tool, Annual Phosphorus Loss Estimator (APLE), was used as an alternative to the current WSM approach. Identical assumptions of county-level acreage, soil properties, nutrient management practices, and transport factors from the WSM were used as inputs to APLE. Incorporation of APLE P-loss estimates resulted in greater estimated total P loss and a revised spatial pattern of P loss compared with the WSM's original targets. Subsequently, APLE's revised estimates for P loss were substituted into the WSM and resulted in improved WSM calibration performance at up to 79% of tributary monitoring stations. The incorporation of APLE into the WSM will improve its ability to assess P loss and the impact of field management on Chesapeake Bay water quality.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1388	1394		10.2134/jeq2016.05.0201								WOS:000416288000028	29293854

G.; Arriaga, Francisco J.; Stock, Melanie			Quantifying the Impact of Seasonal and Short-term Manure Application Decisions on Phosphorus Loss in Surface Runoff	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Agricultural phosphorus (P) management is a research and policy issue due to P loss from fields and water quality degradation. Better information is needed on the risk of P loss from dairy manure applied in winter or when runoff is imminent. We used the SurPhos computer model and 108 site-years of weather and runoff data to assess the impact of these two practices on dissolved P loss. Model results showed that winter manure application can increase P loss by 2.5 to 3.6 times compared with non-winter applications, with the amount increasing as the average runoff from a field increases. Increased P loss is true for manure applied any time from late November through early March, with a maximum P loss from application in late January and early February. Shifting manure application to fields with less runoff can reduce P loss by 3.4 to 7.5 times. Delaying manure application when runoff is imminent can reduce P loss any time of the year, and sometimes quite significantly, but the number of times that application delays will reduce P loss is limited to only 3 to 9% of possible spreading days, and average P loss may be reduced by only 15% for winter-applied manure and 6% for non-winter-applied manure. Overall, long-term strategies of shifting manure applications to low runoff seasons and fields can potentially reduce dissolved P loss in runoff much more compared with near-term, tactical application decisions of avoiding manure application when runoff is imminent.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1395	1402		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0220								WOS:000416288000029	29293831

Seasonal Manure Application Timing and Storage Effects on Field-and Watershed-Level Phosphorus Losses	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Timing of manure application to agricultural soils remains a contentious topic in nutrient management planning, particularly with regard to impacts on nutrient loss in runoff and downstream water quality. We evaluated the effects of seasonal manure application and associated manure storage capacity on phosphorus (P) losses at both field and watershed scales over an 11-yr period, using long-term observed data and an upgraded, variable-source water quality model called Topo-SWAT. At the field level, despite variation in location and crop management, manure applications throughout fall and winter increased annual total P losses by 12 to 16% and dissolved P by 19 to 40% as compared with spring. Among all field-level scenarios, total P loss was substantially reduced through better site targeting (by 48-64%), improving winter soil cover (by 25-46%), and reducing manure application rates (by 1-23%). At the watershed level, a scenario simulating 12 mo of manure storage (all watershed manure applied in spring) reduced dissolved P loss by 5% and total P loss by 2% but resulted in greater P concentrations peaks compared with scenarios simulating 6 mo (fall-spring application) or 3 mo storage (four-season application). Watershed-level impacts are complicated by aggregate effects, both spatial and temporal, of manure storage capacity on variables such as manure application rate and timing, and complexities of field and management. This comparison of the consequences of different manure storage capacities demonstrated a tradeoff between reducing annual P loss through a few high-concentration runoff events and increasing the frequency of low peaks but also increasing the annual loss.

A new subroutine that couples existing matrix-excess and matrix-desiccation macropore flow theory and a modified P routine is implemented in the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender (APEX) model. The original and modified formulation were applied and evaluated for a case study in a poorly drained field in Western Ohio with 31 months of surface and subsurface monitoring data. Results highlighted that a macropore subroutine in APEX improved edge-of-field discharge calibration and validation for both tile and total discharge from satisfactory and good, respectively, to very good and improved dissolved reactive P load calibration and validation statistics for tile P loads from unsatisfactory to very good. Output from the calibrated macropore simulations suggested median annual matrix-desiccation macropore flow contributions of 48% and P load contributions of 43%, with the majority of loading occurring in winter and spring. While somewhat counterintuitive, the prominence of matrix-desiccation macropore flow during seasons with less cracking reflects the importance of coupled development of macropore pathways and adequate supply of the macropore flow source. The innovative features of the model allow for assessments of annual macropore P contributions to tile drainage and has the potential to inform P site assessment tools.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1413	1423		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0218								WOS:000416288000031	29293822

Managing Surface Water Inputs to Reduce Phosphorus Loss from Cranberry Farms	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) production in Massachusetts represents one-fourth of the US cranberry supply, but water quality concerns, water use, and wetland protection laws challenge the future viability of the state's cranberry industry. Pond water used for harvest and winter flooding accounts for up to two-thirds of phosphorus (P) losses in drainage waters. Consequently, use of P sorbing salts to treat pond water holds promise in the mitigation of P losses from cranberry farms. Laboratory evaluation of aluminum (Al)-, iron (Fe)-, and calcium (Ca)-based salts was conducted to determine the application rate required for reducing P in shallow (0.4 m) and deep (3.2 m) water ponds used for cranberry production. Limited P removal (< 22%) with calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate was consistent with their relatively low solubility in water. Calcium hydroxide reduced total P up to 49%, but increases in pond water pH (> 8) could be detrimental to cranberry production. Ferric sulfate and aluminum sulfate applications of 15 mg L-1 (ppm) resulted in near-complete removal of total P, which decreased from 49 +/- 3 to < 10 mg P L-1 (ppb). However, ferric sulfate application lowered pH below the recommend range for cranberry soils. Field testing of aluminum sulfate demonstrated that at a dose of 15 mg L-1 (similar to 1.4 Al mg L-1), total P in pond water was reduced by 78 to 94%. Laboratory and field experiments support the recommendation of aluminum sulfate as a cost-effective remedial strategy for reducing elevated P in surface water used for cranberry production.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2017	46	6					1472	1479		10.2134/jeq2017.04.0134								WOS:000416288000037	29293836

In areas where in-stream chemical and hydrological data are limited but where estimates of nutrient loads are needed to guide management, it is necessary to apply more generalized models that make few assumptions about underlying processes. This paper presents the selection and application of a model to estimate total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in two semiarid and adjacent catchments exposed to pollution risk in north-central Ethiopia. Using specific criteria to assess model suitability resulted in the use of the Pollution Load (PLOAD) model. The model relies on estimates of nutrient loads from point sources such as industries and export coefficients of land use, and it is calibrated using measured TN and TP loads from the catchments. The performance of the calibrated PLOAD model was increased, reducing the sum of errors by 89 and 5% for the TN and TP loads, respectively. The results were validated using independent field data. Next, two scenarios were evaluated: (i) use of riparian buffer strips, and (ii) enhanced treatment of industrial effluents. The model estimated that combined use of the two scenarios could reduce TN and TP loads by nearly 50%. Our modeling is particularly useful for initial characterization of nutrient pollution in catchments. With careful calibration and validation, PLOAD model can serve an important role in planning industrial and agricultural development in data-poor areas.

The responsibility for implementing BMPs typically falls on loggers, with implications for higher harvesting costs and, possibly, reduced logging productivity. Two methods were used to assess the impacts of BMPs on logging operations in the northeastern United States. First, a case study was conducted using shift-level production and activity data and machine rate calculations to assess the impacts of BMP implementation for eight harvest operations, ranging from single-operator hand-felling systems to fully mechanized whole-tree and cut-to-length systems. Second, a survey was conducted in which loggers were asked to estimate the number of days required to complete a hypothetical timber harvest with and without a set of prescribed BMPs and to indicate their minimum acceptable contract rates for each. The combined results revealed a range of costs from $0/ac to $62/ac and decreases in productivity between 0 and 20%.																	0022-1201	1938-3746				NOV	2017	115	6					503	512		10.5849/JOF.2016-031R1								WOS:000415599700001

Broad spatial distributions of discharging groundwater are often difficult to measure directly. We present high resolution estimates of direct groundwater discharge across 43% of the Great Lakes coastline based on a water budget approach that uses hydroclimatic models and high-resolution hydrographic data available within the United States. We also integrate land use data to identify coastal areas vulnerable to high groundwater-borne nutrient loads. Estimated rates of direct groundwater discharge along the Great Lakes coast are highly variable, but generally are greatest for Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. Almost one-third of Lake Erie's United States coastline is vulnerable to groundwater sources of nutrients. To assess uncertainties and limitations in our vulnerability analysis, a vulnerable site along Lake Erie was selected for detailed field measurements of direct groundwater discharge rates and nutrient fluxes. Measured discharge rates were significantly lower than water budget-based estimates (354 +/- 25 m(3) y(-1) m(-1) compared to 588 +/- 181 m(3) y(-1) m(-1)). Dissolved phosphorous concentrations in the lakebed were elevated compared to onshore groundwater, while nitrate concentrations were lower, indicative of a highly reactive sediment-water interface. Some of the measured phosphorus may be locally sourced from desorption of legacy P or mineralization of organic matter in the lakebed, which our vulnerability framework does not include. Much of the land-derived nitrogen may be transformed along groundwater flow paths prior to discharge. While model-based estimates of direct groundwater discharge and vulnerability to nutrient loading are important for managing Great Lakes water quality, direct field observations remain essential for quantifying fluxes.

J	Mannina, G; Cosenza, A; Viviani, G				Mannina, Giorgio; Cosenza, Alida; Viviani, Gaspare			Micropollutants throughout an integrated urban drainage model: Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The paper presents the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of an integrated urban drainage model which includes micropollutants. Specifically, a bespoke integrated model developed in previous studies has been modified in order to include the micropollutant assessment (namely, sulfamethoxazole - SMX). The model takes into account also the interactions between the three components of the system: sewer system (SS), wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and receiving water body (RWB). The analysis has been applied to an experimental catchment nearby Palermo (Italy): the Nocella catchment. Overall, five scenarios, each characterized by different uncertainty combinations of sub-systems (i.e., SS, WWTP and RWB), have been considered applying, for the sensitivity analysis, the Extended FAST method in order to select the key factors affecting the RWB quality and to design a reliable/useful experimental campaign. Results have demonstrated that sensitivity analysis is a powerful tool for increasing operator confidence in the modelling results. The approach adopted here can be used for blocking some non identifiable factors, thus wisely modifying the structure of the model and reducing the related uncertainty. The model factors related to the SS have been found to be the most relevant factors affecting the SMX modeling in the RWB when all model factors (scenario 1) or model factors of SS (scenarios 2 and 3) are varied. If the only factors related to the WWTP are changed (scenarios 4 and 5), the SMX concentration in the RWB is mainly influenced (till to 95% influence of the total variance for S-SMX,S-max) by the aerobic sorption coefficient. A progressive uncertainty reduction from the upstream to downstream was found for the soluble fraction of SMX in the RWB. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Swain, JB; Patra, KC				Swain, Janaki Ballav; Patra, Kanhu Charan			Streamflow estimation in ungauged catchments using regionalization techniques	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Continuous streamflow regionalization in ungauged catchments is contemplated as a challenging task. In a developing country like India where the subject of prediction in ungauged basins (PUB) is not prevalent, thirty-two catchments were specified in order to analyze continuous streamflow estimation. Spatial proximity (Inverse Distance Weighted, Kriging, and global mean), regression and physical similarity were the regionalization approaches implemented in conjunction with SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) for streamflow estimation in each catchment treated as ungauged in turn. Kriging and IDW were the two methods that produced superior results than other applied techniques in terms of Nash-Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE), RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) Percentage bias (PBIAS) and Peak percent threshold statistics (PPTS). Physical similarity and regression approaches, which were based on catchment attributes exhibited better results than global mean approach. Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) tool analyzed the uncertainty associated with regionalization techniques in terms of 95% prediction uncertainty (95PPU). The comparative assessment proposes that presence of well gauged catchments in proximity with the ungauged catchment is more beneficial than catchments having resemblance between them in terms of physiographic attributes for continuous streamflow prediction.

J	Han, DM; Currell, MJ; Cao, GL; Hall, B				Han, Dongmei; Currell, Matthew J.; Cao, Guoliang; Hall, Benjamin			Alterations to groundwater recharge due to anthropogenic landscape change	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The impacts of anthropogenic modifications to the landscape on groundwater recharge rates, locations, and mechanisms are reviewed. The two major categories of change examined are conversion of land for agriculture and urbanization, both of which have significant effects on groundwater recharge. Techniques for identifying and quantifying the changes in recharge due to these impacts are discussed. Land-clearing for agriculture and surface water transfer for irrigation have resulted in order of magnitude increases in recharge rates in many semi-arid regions worldwide, causing ongoing land and water salinization and water-logging problems. While increased recharge by irrigation return flow may alleviate shallow groundwater depletion in some settings, this is complicated by the effect of unsaturated zone thickening, which reduces the fraction of potential recharge becoming actual recharge, and may result in new water quality risks such as nitrate contamination. Expansion of urban and peri-urban land and their associated surface and sub-surface infrastructure results in complex water balance changes that re-distribute groundwater recharge locations, modify recharge mechanism(s) and result in variable impacts on recharge rates (e.g., overall net decrease, increase or minimal change) and quality. While changes to groundwater recharge resulting from conversion of land for agriculture are relatively well understood, less is documented about the changes resulting from urbanization, due to a paucity of data from field-based studies. Two case studies from Beijing, China and Melbourne Australia are examined, which highlight these impacts and demonstrate some potential methodological techniques for this topic.

Integrated planning for regional development planning and water resources management under uncertainty: A case study of Xining, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Economic restructuring, water resources management, population planning and environmental protection are subjects to inner uncertainties of a compound system with objectives which are competitive alternatives. Optimization model and water quality model are usually used to solve problems in a certain aspect. To overcome the uncertainty and coupling in reginal planning management, an interval fuzzy program combined with water quality model for regional planning and management has been developed to obtain the absolutely "optimal" solution in this study. The model is a hybrid methodology of interval parameter programming (IPP), fuzzy programing (FP), and a general one-dimensional water quality model. The method extends on the traditional interval parameter fuzzy programming method by integrating water quality model into the optimization framework. Meanwhile, as an abstract concept, water resources carrying capacity has been transformed into specific and calculable index. Besides, unlike many of the past studies about water resource management, population as a significant factor has been considered. The results suggested that the methodology was applicable for reflecting the complexities of the regional planning and management systems within the planning period. The government policy makers could establish effective industrial structure, water resources utilization patterns and population planning, and to better understand the tradeoffs among economic, water resources, population and environmental objectives.

Historical patterns of acidification and increasing CO2 flux associated with Florida springs	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Florida has one of the highest concentrations of springs in the world, with many discharging into rivers and predominantly into eastern Gulf of Mexico coast, and they likely influence the hydrochemistry of these adjacent waters; however, temporal and spatial trends have not been well studied. We present over 20 yr of hydrochemical, seasonally sampled data to identify temporal and spatial trends of pH, alkalinity, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), and CO2 flux from five first-order-magnitude (springs that discharge greater than 2.83 m(3) s(-1)) coastal spring groups fed by the Floridan Aquifer System that ultimately discharge into the Gulf of Mexico. All spring groups had pCO(2) levels (averages 3174.3-6773.2 atm) that were much higher than atmospheric levels of CO2 and demonstrated statistically significant temporal decreases in pH and increases in CO2 flux, pCO(2), and alkalinity. Total carbon flux emissions increased from each of the spring groups by between 3.48 x 10(7) and 2.856 x 10(8) kg C yr(-1) over the time period. By 2013 the Springs Groups in total emitted more than 1.1739 x 10(9) kg C yr(-1). Increases in alkalinity and pCO(2) varied from 90.9 to 347.6 mol kg(-1) and 1262.3 to 2666.7 atm, respectively. Coastal data show higher CO2 evasion than the open Gulf of Mexico, which suggests spring water influences nearshore waters. The results of this study have important implications for spring water quality, dissolution of the Florida carbonate platform, and identification of the effect and partitioning of carbon fluxes to and within coastal and marine ecosystems.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2017	62	6					2404	2417		10.1002/lno.10573								WOS:000415930800005						
J	Walsh, JR; Lathrop, RC; Vander Zanden, MJ				Walsh, Jake R.; Lathrop, Richard C.; Vander Zanden, M. Jake			Invasive invertebrate predator, Bythotrephes longimanus, reverses trophic cascade in a north-temperate lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Trophic cascades can determine the structure of aquatic food webs, a role often used to manage water quality in lakes. However, trophic cascades are subject to multiple interacting drivers of environmental change. For example, invasive species can dramatically alter food webs, though we know less about invasive species effects on managed trophic cascades. Here, we investigate the changing food web dynamics of Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, U.S.A.) over a 40-yr time period. Piscivore stocking (biomanipulation) beginning in 1988 coupled with a 1987 die-off of cisco (the dominant zooplanktivore) led to decreased zooplanktivory that cascaded to increases in the large-bodied herbivorous zooplankton Daphnia pulicaria and greater water clarity. In 2009, the invasive spiny water flea Bythotrephes longimanus was first detected in Lake Mendota and soon reached record densities. As a result of this invasive invertebrate predator, zooplanktivory increased to 47% of the earlier cisco period. Concomitant with the spiny water flea population explosion were declines in D. pulicaria and water clarity as both exhibited a strong negative relationship to zooplanktivory across the 40-yr time series. We argue that the trophic cascade of 1987-1988 created an environment of high food resources and low fish planktivory that promoted the proliferation of Bythotrephes as it functionally replaced cisco in Lake Mendota's food web. Our results highlight how a manipulated, eutrophic lake was vulnerable to adverse impacts by invasive species, calling attention to the importance of understanding interactions among drivers of environmental change.																	0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2017	62	6					2498	2509		10.1002/lno.10582								WOS:000415930800011

Model skill was assessed by comparison to satellite-derived Chl a and field-measured water quality variables. We evaluated model sensitivity to scenarios of varying mussel filter feeding intensity, tributary phosphorus loads, and warm vs. cool winter-spring climate scenarios. During the winter-spring phytoplankton bloom, spatial patterns of Chl a were controlled by variables that influenced surface mixed layer depth: deep mixing reduced net phytoplankton growth through light limitation and by exposing the full water column to mussel filter feeding. Onset of summer and winter stratification promoted higher surface Chl a initially by increasing mean light exposure and by separating the euphotic zone from mussels. During the summer stratified period, areas of relatively high Chl a were associated with coastal plumes influenced by tributary-derived nutrients and coastal upwelling-downwelling. While mussels influenced spatial and temporal distribution of Chl a, lake-wide, annual mean primary production was more sensitive to phosphorus and warm/cool meteorology scenarios than to mussel filter feeding scenarios. Although Chl a and primary production declined over the quagga mussel invasion, our results suggest that increased nutrient loads would increase lake-wide productivity even in the presence of mussels; however, altered spatial and temporal patterns of productivity caused by mussel filter feeding would likely persist.

Multi-effect air gap membrane distillation process for pesticide wastewater treatment	MEMBRANE WATER TREATMENT												A multi-effect air gap membrane distillation (ME-AGMD) module for pesticide wastewater treatment is studied with internal heat recovery, sensible heat of brine recovery, number of stages and the use of fresh feed as cooling water in a single module is implemented in this study. A flat sheet polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) membrane was used in the 4-stage ME-AGMD module. The maximum value of permeate flux could reach 38.62 L/m(2)h at feed -coolant water temperature difference about 52 degrees C. The performance parameter of the module like, specific energy consumption and gain output ratio (GOR) was investigated for the module with and without heat recovery. Also, the module performance was characterized with respect to the separation efficiency of several important water quality parameters. The removal efficiency of the module was found to be >98.8% irrespective water quality parameters. During the experiment the membrane fouling was caused due to the deposition of the salt/crystal on the membrane surface. The membrane fouling was controlled by membrane module washing cycle 9 h and also by acidification of the feed water (pH=4) using 0.1M HCl solution.																	2005-8624	2092-7037				NOV	2017	8	6					529	541		10.12989/mwt.2017.8.6.529								WOS:000416093300002

The objective was to map the sources of AMD contamination, including discrete sources visible at the surface and diffuse inputs that were not readily apparent. This was achieved using geochemical sampling, in-stream and in-seep fluid electrical conductivity (EC) logging, and electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) of the subsurface. The low pH of the AMD-impacted water correlated to high fluid EC values that served as a target for the ERI. From ERI, we identified two likely sources of diffuse contamination entering the stream: (1) the subsurface extent of two seepage faces visible on the surface, and (2) rainfall runoff washing salts deposited on the streambank and in a tailings pile on the east bank of Lion Creek. Additionally, rainfall leaching through the tailings pile is a potential diffuse source of contamination if the subsurface beneath the tailings pile is hydraulically connected with the stream. In-stream fluid EC was lowest when stream discharge was highest in early summer and then increased throughout the summer as stream discharge decreased, indicating that the concentration of dissolved solids in the stream is largely controlled by mixing of groundwater and snowmelt. Total dissolved solids (TDS) load is greatest in early summer and displays a large diel signal. Identification of diffuse sources and variability in TDS load through time should allow for more targeted remediation options.

Spatial distribution maps were prepared using GIS software so that the quality of the mine water could be easily understood. Metal concentrations were higher in the pre-monsoon season than in the post-monsoon season, irrespective of location, but there were more significant seasonal variations in the opencast mine water than in the underground mine water. The concentrations of Al, Ba, Fe, Mn, and Ni exceeded the desirable as well as the permissible drinking water limits in both seasons. The quality of the surface water as well as the groundwater in the region may be adversely affected by the high metal concentrations in this mine water.

Evaluation of the Impact of Na-SO4 Dominated Ionic Strength on Effluent Water Quality in Bench-Scale Vertical Flow Bioreactors Using Spent Mushroom Compost	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Passive treatment systems (PTSs) are frequently used to treat mine drainage that contains elevated concentrations of Fe, sulfate, and trace metals. Vertical flow bioreactors (VFBRs), often designed specifically to remove trace metals from mine drainage and retain them in an organic substrate, are a common PTS component. Many factors, including ionic strength, affect the performance of VFBR and their ability to remove trace metals. A paired-comparison study was performed in which two sets of columns were constructed, filled with an organic substrate, and fed synthetic mine water of differing ionic strengths, dominated by Na and sulfate, for 1 year. Elevated ionic strength significantly increased the rate of removal of Cd and Zn, and possibly Pb. Conversely, elevated ionic strength significantly decreased the rate of removal of Ni and Mn and even caused the eventual release of Mn from the substrate.

Recently, several attempts have been made to use eDNA metabarcoding as an alternative tool. However, until now, most applied metabarcoding studies have been based on the taxonomic assignment of sequences that provides reference to morphospecies ecology. Usually, only a small portion of metabarcoding data can be used due to a limited reference database and a lack of phylogenetic resolution. Here, we investigate the possibility to overcome these limitations using a taxonomy-free approach that allows the computing of a molecular index directly from eDNA data without any reference to morphotaxonomy. As a case study, we use the benthic diatoms index, commonly used for monitoring the biological quality of rivers and streams. We analysed 87 epilithic samples from Swiss rivers, the ecological status of which was established based on the microscopic identification of diatom species. We compared the diatom index derived from eDNA data obtained with or without taxonomic assignment. Our taxonomy-free approach yields promising results by providing a correct assessment for 77% of examined sites. The main advantage of this method is that almost 95% of OTUs could be used for index calculation, compared to 35% in the case of the taxonomic assignment approach. Its main limitations are under-sampling and the need to calibrate the index based on the microscopic assessment of diatoms communities. However, once calibrated, the taxonomy-free molecular index can be easily standardized and applied in routine biomonitoring, as a complementary tool allowing fast and cost-effective assessment of the biological quality of watercourses.																	1755-098X	1755-0998				NOV	2017	17	6					1231	1242		10.1111/1755-0998.12668								WOS:000415921900036	28296259

However, unambiguous morphological identification of EPT species, especially their immature life stages, is a challenging, yet fundamental task. A comprehensive DNA barcode library based upon taxonomically well-curated specimens is needed to overcome the problematic identification. Once available, this library will support the implementation of fast, cost-efficient and reliable DNA-based identifications and assessments of ecological status. This study represents a major step towards a DNA barcode reference library as it covers for two-thirds of Germany's EPT species including 2,613 individuals belonging to 363 identified species. As such, it provides coverage for 38 of 44 families (86%) and practically all major bioindicator species. DNA barcode compliant sequences (500bp) were recovered from 98.74% of the analysed specimens. Whereas most species (325, i.e., 89.53%) were unambiguously assigned to a single Barcode Index Number (BIN) by its COI sequence, 38 species (18 Ephemeroptera, nine Plecoptera and 11 Trichoptera) were assigned to a total of 89 BINs. Most of these additional BINs formed nearest neighbour clusters, reflecting the discrimination of geographical subclades of a currently recognized species. BIN sharing was uncommon, involving only two species pairs of Ephemeroptera. Interestingly, both maximum pairwise and nearest neighbour distances were substantially higher for Ephemeroptera compared to Plecoptera and Trichoptera, possibly indicating older speciation events, stronger positive selection or faster rate of molecular evolution.																	1755-098X	1755-0998				NOV	2017	17	6					1293	1307		10.1111/1755-0998.12683								WOS:000415921900041	28449274

Integration of Hydraulic and Water Quality Modelling in Distribution Networks: EPANET-PMX	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Simulation models for water distribution networks are used routinely for many purposes. Some examples are planning, design, monitoring and control. However, under conditions of low pressure, the conventional models that employ demand-driven analysis often provide misleading results. On the other hand, almost all the models that employ pressure-driven analysis do not perform dynamic and/or water quality simulations seamlessly. Typically, they exclude key elements such as pumps, control devices and tanks. EPANET-PDX is a pressure-driven extension of the EPANET 2 simulation model that preserved the capabilities of EPANET 2 including water quality modelling. However, it cannot simulate multiple chemical substances at once. The single-species approach to water quality modelling is inefficient and somewhat unrealistic. The reason is that different chemical substances may co-exist in water distribution networks. This article proposes a fully integrated network analysis model (EPANET-PMX) (pressure-dependent multi-species extension) that addresses these weaknesses. The model performs both steady state and dynamic simulations. It is applicable to any network with various combinations of chemical reactions and reaction kinetics. Examples that demonstrate its effectiveness are included.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				NOV	2017	31	14					4485	4503		10.1007/s11269-017-1760-0								WOS:000412744400007

Its security has significant impacts on both the socioeconomic system and ecological system. Recently, studies have focused on the urban water security system (UWSS) in terms of either water quantity or water quality. In this study, water resources, water environment, and water disaster issues in the UWSS were combined to establish an evaluation index system with system dynamics (SD) and geographic information systems (GIS). The GIS method performs qualitative analysis from the perspective of the spatial dimension; meanwhile, the SD method performs quantitative calculation about related water security problems from the perspective of the temporal dimension. We established a UWSS model for Guizhou province, China to analyze influencing factors, main driving factors, and system variation law, by using the SD method. We simulated the water security system from 2005 to 2025 under four scenarios (Guiyang scenario, Zunyi scenario, Bijie scenario and combined scenario). The results demonstrate that: (1) the severity of water security in cities is ranked as follows: three cities are secure in Guizhou province, four cities are in basic security and two cities are in a situation of insecurity from the spatial dimension of GIS through water security synthesis; and (2) the major driving factors of UWSS in Guizhou province include agricultural irrigation water demand, soil and water losses area, a ratio increase to the standard of water quality, and investment in environmental protection. A combined scenario is the best solution for UWSS by 2025 in Guizhou province under the four scenarios from the temporal dimension of SD.

The experimental results showed that the vortex wave flow state in the membrane module could be formed when the Reynolds number (Re) of liquid was adjusted between 450 and 1,050, and the membrane flux declined more slowly in the vortex wave flow state than those in the laminar flow state and turbulent flow state. The MBR system was used to treat domestic wastewater under the condition of vortex wave flow state for 30 days. The results showed that the removal efficiency for CODcr and NH3-N was 82% and 98% respectively, and the permeate quality met the requirement of 'Water quality standard for urban miscellaneous water consumption (GB/T 18920-2002)'. Analysis of the energy consumption of the MBR showed that the average energy consumption was 1.90 +/- 0.55 kWh/m(3) (permeate), which was only two thirds of conventional MBR energy consumption.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2465	2472		10.2166/wst.2017.400								WOS:000415638000021	29144304					
J	Chen, H; Zuo, QT; Zhang, YY				Chen, Hao; Zuo, Qi-ting; Zhang, Yong-yong			Preliminary results of water quality assessment using phytoplankton and physicochemical approaches in the Huai River Basin, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Water pollution has been a significant issue in the Huai River Basin (HRB) of China since the late 1970s. In July and December 2013, two field investigations were carried out at 10 sites along the main streams of the basin. The monitoring indices contained both physicochemical variables and the structure and composition of phytoplankton communities. The correlations between communities and physicochemical variables were analyzed using cluster analysis and redundancy analysis. Moreover, water quality was evaluated using the comprehensive nutrition state index (TLI) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H). Results indicated that more phytoplankton species were present in December than in July, but total density was less in December. Phytoplankton communities in the midstream of the Shaying River were affected by the same physicochemical factors throughout the year, but ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus had the greatest influence on these sites in July and December, respectively. The water pollution status of the sampling sites was much greater in the Shaying River midstream than at other sites. TLI was more suitable than H for assessing water quality in the study area. These results provide valuable information for policy makers and stakeholders in water quality assessment, water ecosystem restoration, and sustainable basin management in the HRB.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	9					2554	2564		10.2166/wst.2017.418								WOS:000415638000030	29144313					
J	Zhang, ZC				Zhang, Zhenchao			The flocculation mechanism and treatment of oily wastewater by flocculation	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In the present study, the performance of compound flocculants composed of different concentrations of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) and cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM), the influencing mechanism of the flocculation process and the effects of temperature, settling time, and speed and time of stirring were investigated. The results show that the poor water quality with high concentrations of oil, suspended solids (SS) and polymer greatly increases the oily wastewater emulsion stability and the difficulty of the flocculation treatment process. The compound flocculant in oily wastewater treatment can achieve best results at optimum conditions of temperature 45 degrees C, settling time 60 min, and two stirring stages, 250 r.min(-1) for 3 min followed by 100 r.min(-1) for 7 min. At the PAC dosage of 80 mg.L-1 and the CPAM dosage of 0.8 mg.L-1, the turbidity of oily wastewater is reduced from 153.8 NTU to 11.2 NTU, and the turbidity removal rate reaches 92.69%. Through further measurements, oil content and SS content are less than 10 mg.L-1, which meets the requirement of the Daqing oilfield re-injection standard.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2630	2637		10.2166/wst.2017.414								WOS:000415999900006	29168702

In this study, water columns were collected at 22 sites in the littoral zone of Lake Taihu in 2014 to investigate the distribution and concentration of nutrients and the stable isotope signatures of POM, and their potential interrelation. Generally, mean concentration of nitrogen forms (NH4+-N) showed substantial variation, probably because they had received large amounts of wastewater from various local industrial enterprises. Source analysis by stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios showed that the main POM sources were phytoplankton. Contrasting correlations were obtained between delta N-15 and N concentrations in effluent river mouths when compared with influent river mouths. In effluent river mouths, there was a significant positive correlation between delta N-15 and nitrogen concentration (total nitrogen and ammonia-nitrogen), in contrast with the negative correlation in influent river mouths. According to these results, more factors should be taken into consideration when stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes of POM are used to assess the feeding relationship between consumers and prey, as well as the energy flow pathways that support the lake pelagic food webs.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2690	2697		10.2166/wst.2017.439								WOS:000415999900013	29168709					
J	Elci, A				Elci, Alper			Evaluation of nutrient retention in vegetated filter strips using the SWAT model	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient fluxes in stream basins need to be controlled to achieve good water quality status. In stream basins with intensive agricultural activities, nutrients predominantly come from diffuse sources. Therefore, best management practices (BMPs) are increasingly implemented to reduce nutrient input to streams. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of vegetated filter strip (VFS) application as an agricultural BMP. For this purpose, SWAT is chosen, a semi-distributed water quality assessment model that works at the watershed scale, and applied on the Nif stream basin, a small-sized basin in Western Turkey. The model is calibrated with an automated procedure against measured monthly discharge data. Nutrient loads for each sub-basin are estimated considering basin-wide data on chemical fertilizer and manure usage, population data for septic tank effluents and information about the land cover. Nutrient loads for 19 sub-basins are predicted on an annual basis. Average total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads are estimated as 47.85 t/yr and 13.36 t/yr for the entire basin. Results show that VFS application in one sub-basin offers limited retention of nutrients and that a selection of 20-m filter width is most effective from a cost-benefit perspective.

Nutrient modeling for a semi-intensive IMC pond: an MS-Excel approach	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Semi-intensive Indian Major Carp (IMC) culture was practised in polythene lined dugout ponds at the Aquacultural Farm of Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal for 3 consecutive years at three different stocking densities (S. D), viz., 20,000, 35,000 and 50,000 numbers of fingerlings per hectare of water spread area. Fingerlings of Catla, Rohu and Mrigal were raised at a stocking ratio of 4:3:3. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) value along with other fishpond water quality parameters was monitored at 1 day intervals to ensure a good water ecosystem for a better fish growth. Water exchange was carried out before the TAN reached the critical limit. Field data on TAN obtained from the cultured fishponds stocked with three different stocking densities were used to study the dynamics of TAN. A developed model used to study the nutrient dynamics in shrimp pond was used to validate the observed data in the IMC pond ecosystem. Two years of observed TAN data were used to calibrate the spreadsheet model and the same model was validated using the third year observed data. The manual calibration based on the trial and error process of parameters adjustments was used and several simulations were performed by changing the model parameters. After adjustment of each parameter, the simulated and measured values of the water quality parameters were compared to judge the improvement in the model prediction. Forward finite difference discretization method was used in a MS-Excel spreadsheet to calibrate and validate the model for obtaining the TAN levels during the culture period. Observed data from the cultured fishponds of three different S. D were used to standardize 13 model parameters. The efficiency of the developed spreadsheet model was found to be more than 90% for the TAN estimation in the IMC cultured fishponds.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				NOV	2017	76	10					2858	2866		10.2166/wst.2017.458								WOS:000415999900030	29168726

Comparison of boiling and chlorination on the quality of stored drinking water and childhood diarrhoea in Indonesian households	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION												We compared the impact of a commercial chlorination product (brand name Air RahMat) in stored drinking water to traditional boiling practices in Indonesia. We conducted a baseline survey of all households with children <5 years in four communities, made 11 subsequent weekly home visits to assess acceptability and use of water treatment methods, measured Escherichia coli concentration in stored water, and determined diarrhoea prevalence among children <5 years. Of 281 households surveyed, boiling (83%) and Air RahMat (7%) were the principal water treatment methods. Multivariable log-binomial regression analyses showed lower risk of E. coli in stored water treated with Air RahMat than boiling (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56-1.00). The risk of diarrhoea in children <5 years was lower among households using Air RahMat (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.19-0.97) than boiling, and higher in households with E. coli concentrations of 1-1000 MPN/100 ml (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.04-2.28) or >1000 MPN/100 ml (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.09-3.19) in stored water than in households without detectable E. coli. Although results suggested that Air RahMat water treatment was associated with lower E. coli contamination and diarrhoeal rates among children <5 years than water treatment by boiling, Air RahMat use remained low.																	0950-2688	1469-4409				NOV	2017	145	15					3294	3302		10.1017/S0950268817002217								WOS:000415376600019	28942755

Assessing Target Strength, Abundance, and Biomass for Three Commercial Pelagic Fish Species along the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia Using a Split-Beam Echo Sounder	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Decapterus maruadsi (round scad), Megalaspis cordyla (torpedo scad), and Selar boops (oxeye scad) are commercially important small pelagic fish species of Malaysia. Despite their commercial and ecological value, little is known about their target strength (TS), spatial and vertical distributions, and biomass estimates. A split-beam acoustic survey was performed in the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia (ECPM) in March-June 2009. The calibrated echo sounder allowed determination of TS, estimation of fish density (spatial distribution) and biomass, and produced density maps along depth gradients (vertical distribution). The TS-length relationships indicated that the logarithmic TS was proportional to the squared length. Additional water parameters that included salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were collected to examine fish density changes in relation to water quality and depth. Results revealed that the small pelagic fish formed small schools that were scattered over a wide area of the ECMP; mean density varied between 1.1 and 1.9 t/km(2). The maximum fish density was in the spatial coverage between 102.875 degrees E, 6.000 degrees N and 103.125 degrees E, 6.500 degrees N. The mean total biomass was about 18,610 t. Optimum fish density was estimated around water depths between 40 and 60 m. Fish density mainly decreased with decreasing DO and with increasing depth. The demonstrated acoustic method can be used as a monitoring tool for national fish stock surveys.

It is hypothesized that environmental exposures (such as air and water quality) trigger the innate immune response thereby activating a pro-inflammatory cascade. Objective: To examine potential environmental factors in pediatric MS using geographic information systems (GIS). Methods: Pediatric MS cases and healthy controls were identified as part of an ongoing multicenter case-control study. Subjects' geographic locations were mapped by county centroid to compare to an Environmental Quality Index (EQI). The EQI examines 5 individual environmental components (air, land, water, social, built factors). A composite EQI score and individual scores were compared between cases and controls, stratified by median proximity to enrollment centers (residence< 20 or >= 20 miles from the recruiting center), using logistic regression. Results: Of the 287 MS cases and 445 controls, 46% and 49% respectively live in areas where the total EQI is the highest (worst environmental quality). Total EQI was not significantly associated with the odds for MS (p = 0.90< 20 miles from center; p = 0.43 >= 20 miles); however, worsening air quality significantly impacted the odds for MS in those living near a referral center (OR = 2.83; 95% CI 1.5, 5.4) and those who reside >= 20 miles from a referral center (OR = 1.61; 95% CI 1.2, 2.3). Conclusion: Among environmental factors, air quality may contribute to the odds of developing MS in a pediatric population. Future studies will examine specific air constituents and other location-based air exposures and explore potential mechanisms for immune activation by these exposures.																	2211-0348	2211-0356				NOV	2017	18						164	169		10.1016/j.msard.2017.09.004								WOS:000415341300034	29141802

Saline water irrigation managements on growth of ornamental plants	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL												Biosaline agriculture is an option for using waters with lower quality. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the growth of ornamental species under irrigation with increasing water salinity levels in two methods of water application. The study was conducted in a greenhouse, in the municipality of Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil. The treatments were distributed in randomized blocks in split plots, with six levels of water salinity in the plots (0.6 - control, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4, 3.0 and 3.6 dS m(-1)), two methods of water application in the subplots (localized and sprinkler irrigation) and four ornamental species in the sub-subplots (Catharanthus roseus, Allamanda cathartica, Ixora coccinea and Duranta erecta), with four replicates. Increase in irrigation water electrical conductivity reduced the growth of the studied ornamental species. It was not possible to establish an ideal method for irrigation of ornamental species. Effects of non-localized irrigation on leaf growth were more evident in the species C. roseus and D. erecta, which showed higher specific leaf area.																	1807-1929					NOV	2017	21	11					739	745		10.1590/1807-1929/agriambi.v21n11p739-745								WOS:000415387100001

Hydrochemistry of alluvial aquifer in the Cobra River sub-basin	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL												The regional characteristics of waters from alluvial aquifers are different, since they depend on geology and climate. Also, there may be local variation in the quality of the available water when the water source is superficial (rivers and lakes) or is underground due to geology. In order to investigate the groundwater quality of the alluvial aquifer in the Sub-Basin of the Cobra River (RN) for construction of underground dams, five wells, four in the main river and one in the tributary, were monitored in dry and rainy seasons, during two hydrological years. Fifteen water samples from 'Amazonas' wells were collected for hydrochemical assessment. Multivariate analysis were performed to evaluate the origin of aquifer recharge and water hydrochemical characteristics. Hydrochemical assessment results indicated that Na+ and Cl- ions have greater influence on the salinization of the studied area. There are risks of worsening salinization and toxicity problems in the middle and lower courses of the Cobra River Sub-Basin.																	1807-1929					NOV	2017	21	11					785	790		10.1590/1807-1929/agriambi.v21n11p785-790								WOS:000415387100009

Beneficiary households assessed the components of the intervention including its relevance and adequacy in improving understanding of water quality issues. Motivating and constraining factors to participation in the randomized experiment are also assessed. We also estimate the correlates of participation in the intervention. Social and economic benefits derived from the intervention based on perceptions are compared with impacts of the intervention using an instrumental variable approach. We found evidence that subjective analysis estimates of the effects of the intervention are higher than the objective analysis estimates. Households generally perceived the intervention to be relevant in improving their understanding of water quality issues. However, there are differing opinions based on random assignment into either child or adult treatment groups on most- and least-liked attributes of the intervention, and also motivating and constraining factors affecting participation in the intervention. The factors that statistically and significantly influenced participation in the intervention include educational attainment, ethnicity, religious denomination and marital status of the household heads, in addition to the location of residence.																	1366-7017					NOV	2017	19	6					1206	1224		10.2166/wp.2017.177								WOS:000415345400013

Factors influencing streambed hydraulic conductivity and their implications on stream-aquifer interaction: a conceptual review	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The estimation and modeling of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) is an emerging interest due to its connection to water quality, aquatic habitat, and groundwater recharge. Existing research has found ways to sample and measure K at specific sites and with laboratory tests. The challenge undertaken was to review progress, relevance, complexity in understanding and modeling via statistical and geostatistical approaches, literature gaps, and suggestions toward future needs. This article provides an overview of factors and processes influencing streambed hydraulic conductivity (K) and its role in the stream-aquifer interaction. During our synthesis, we discuss the influence of geological, hydrological, biological, and anthropogenic factors that lead to variability of streambed substrates. Literature examples document findings to specific sites that help to portray the role of streambed K and other interrelated factors in the modeling of hyporheic and groundwater flow systems. However, studies utilizing an integrated, comprehensive database are limited, restricting the ability of broader application and understanding. Examples of in situ and laboratory methods of estimating hydraulic conductivity suggest challenges in acquiring representative samples and comparing results, considering the anisotropy and heterogeneity of fluvial bed materials and geohydrological conditions. Arriving at realistic statistical and spatial inference based on field and lab data collected is challenging, considering the possible sediment sources, processes, and complexity. Recognizing that the K for a given particle size group includes several to many orders of magnitude, modeling of streambed K and groundwater interaction remain conceptual and experimental. Advanced geostatistical techniques offer a wide range of univariate or multi-variate interpolation procedures such as kriging and variogram analysis that can be applied to these complex systems. Research available from various studies has been instrumental in developing sampling options, recognizing the significance of fluvial dynamics, the potential for filtration, transfer, and storage of high-quality groundwater, and importance to aquatic habitat and refuge during extreme conditions. Efforts in the characterization of natural and anthropogenic conditions, substrate materials, sediment loading, colmation, and other details highlight the great complexity and perhaps need for a database to compile relevant data. The effects on streambed hydraulic conductivity due to anthropogenic disturbances (in-stream gravel mining, contaminant release, benthic activity, etc.) are the areas that still need focus. An interdisciplinary (hydro-geo-biological) approach may be necessary to characterize the magnitude and variability of streambed K and fluxes at local, regional scales.

The effective classification and recycling of urban water resources that are available here are therefore significant for the sustainable utilization of water in winter cities, and snow is a potential water resource. In this research, the water quality of the snow and the pollutant composition in the vehicle roads of a typical residential community of Harbin are analyzed. It is concluded that there is a large amount of suspended substances, including chemical oxygen demand (COD), salt, ammonia, and oil in this snow. There are 27 main pollutants. The oily substances are dominated by hexadecane and are accompanied by toxic substances, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene (BTEX), and naphthalene. As snow is a carrier of pollutants, the underground space of the urban shallow green belt is proposed to be used to establish a snow-melting system that would integrate biological treatment devices. This method allows the year-round collection, storage, and utilization of rainwater for use in city planning and municipal technology, realizing multiple objectives and having a significant influence on further urban development.

The relative sensitivity of freshwater species to antimony(III): Implications for water quality guidelines and ecological risk assessments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Antimony (Sb) is a pollutant in many jurisdictions, yet its threat to aquatic biota is unclear. Water quality guidelines (WQGs) for Sb are not well established and large uncertainty factors are commonly applied in derivation. We constructed freshwater species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) for Sb(III) using available acute toxicity data sourced from temperate and tropical regional studies. A tiered ecological risk assessment (ERA) approach using risk quotients (RQs) was applied for characterisation of risks presented by Sb(III) concentrations measured in the freshwater environment. Multiple parametric models were fitted for each SSD, with the optimal model used to derive the 5% hazardous concentration (HC5), defined as protective of 95% of species, and the corresponding predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). The HC5 values for whole and temperate SSDs were estimated at 781 and 976 mu g L-1 Sb(III), respectively, while the PNECs for both datasets were 156 and 195 mu g L-1 Sb(III), respectively. Due to limited tropical data, a temperate-to-tropic extrapolation factor of 10 was used to estimate an interim PNEC for tropical regions of 20 mu g L-1 Sb(III). Based on published freshwater Sb(III) concentration values across a range of locations, potential ecological risks posed by Sb(III) in some freshwater systems studied would be classified as medium to high risk, but the majority of locations sampled would fall into the low ecological risk category. Our results facilitate the understanding of toxic effects of Sb(III) to freshwater species but also demonstrate that data for Sb ERA are extremely limited.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	32					25276	25290		10.1007/s11356-017-0168-y								WOS:000414958700044	28929352

The Water Framework Directive (WFD) specifies and sets forth the achievement of the good ecological status. However, the assessment of the water quality of the lake as a complex system requires a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation procedure. Measurements were carried out around the Lake Balaton at ten different locations/sites and 13 physical-chemical parameters were monitored at each measurement site. For the interpretation of the water chemistry parameters the Aquatic Environmental Assessment (AEA) method devised by authors was used for the water body of the Lake Balaton. The AEA method can be used for all types of the water bodies since it is flexible and using individual weighting procedure for the water chemistry parameters comprehensive information can be obtain. The AEA method was compared with existing EIA methods according to a predefined criterion system and proved to be the most suitable tool for evaluating the environmental impacts in our study.

Evaluating the US Food Safety Modernization Act Produce Safety Rule Standard for Microbial Quality of Agricultural Water for Growing Produce	JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION												The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has defined standards for the microbial quality of agricultural surface water used for irrigation. According to the FDA produce safety rule (PSR), a microbial water quality profile requires analysis of a minimum of 20 samples for Escherichia coli over 2 to 4 years. The geometric mean (GM) level of E. coli should not exceed 126 CFU/100 mL, and the statistical threshold value (STV) should not exceed 410 CFU/100 mL. The water quality profile should be updated by analysis of a minimum of five samples per year. We used an extensive set of data on levels of E. coli and other fecal indicator organisms, the presence or absence of Salmonella, and physicochemical parameters in six agricultural irrigation ponds in West Central Florida to evaluate the empirical and theoretical basis of this PSR. We found highly variable log-transformed E. coli levels, with standard deviations exceeding those assumed in the PSR by up to threefold. Lognormal distributions provided an acceptable fit to the data in most cases but may underestimate extreme levels. Replacing censored data with the detection limit of the microbial tests underestimated the true variability, leading to biased estimates of GM and STV. Maximum likelihood estimation using truncated lognormal distributions is recommended. Twenty samples are not sufficient to characterize the bacteriological quality of irrigation ponds, and a rolling data set of five samples per year used to update GM and STV values results in highly uncertain results and delays in detecting a shift in water quality. In these ponds, E. coli was an adequate predictor of the presence of Salmonella in 150-mL samples, and turbidity was a second significant variable. The variability in levels of E. coli in agricultural water was higher than that anticipated when the PSR was finalized, and more detailed information based on mechanistic modeling is necessary to develop targeted risk management strategies.																	0362-028X	1944-9097				NOV	2017	80	11					1832	1841		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-17-122								WOS:000415056400006	28990819

The water-energy nexus is typically characterized in resource use efficiency terms such as energy intensity. This study aims to explore the quantitative results of the nexus in terms of energy intensity and environmental impacts (mainly greenhouse gas emissions) on existing water systems within urban water cycles. We also characterized the influence of water risks on the water-energy nexus, including baseline water stress (a water quantity indicator) and return flow ratio (a water quality indicator). For the 20 regions and 4 countries surveyed (including regions with low to extremely high water risks that are geographically located in Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America), their energy intensities were positively related to the water risks. Regions with higher water risks were observed to have relatively higher energy and GHG intensities associated with their water supply systems. This mainly reflected the major influence of source water accessibility on the nexus, particularly for regions requiring energy-intensive imported or groundwater supplies, or desalination. Regions that use tertiary treatment (for water reclamation or environmental protection) for their wastewater treatment systems also had relatively higher energy and GHG emission intensities, but the intensities seemed to be independent from the water risks. On-site energy recovery (e.g., biogas or waste heat) in the wastewater treatment systems offered a great opportunity for reducing overall energy demand and its associated environmental impacts. Future policy making for the water and energy sectors should carefully consider the water energy nexus at the regional or local level to achieve maximum environmental and economic benefits. The results from this study can provide a better understanding of the water-energy nexus and informative recommendations for future policy directions for the effective management of water and energy.

Conservation aquaculture: Shifting the narrative and paradigm of aquaculture's role in resource management	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												In the 21st century, aquaculture is generally characterized as a foe to conservation efforts. Yet, much has changed in the two seemingly disparate practices over the last two decades, motivating an updated evaluation of the scientific evidence for how aquaculture currently impacts conservation, as well as prospects for further alignment and research. Here we present a new perspective on conservation aquaculture, which we redefine as "the use of human cultivation of an aquatic organism for the planned management and protection of a natural resource." Looking across scales of conservation aquaculture that include single species to ecosystem level benefits (and limitations), we highlight ways aquaculture has historically, and is currently being integrated into conservation (e.g., habitat restoration of oyster beds) and areas that could be improved for the protection of critical species and habitats (e.g., aquarium trade of coral reef species). With a more strategic focus, there appears to be notable conservation aquaculture potential via the cultivation of species for harvest that could provide wild harvest alleviation through replacement or supplement particularly for over-exploited species and/or ecosystem services, such as improved water quality and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry on the planet, aligning farming practices with conservation objectives is particularly pressing to ensure that growth happens in the service of conservation in the most effective and sustainable way possible. The sheer potential of conservation aquaculture suggests a tale of redemption for aquaculture and opportunity for conservationists to bring in a new age of collaborative practices to address global issues.																	0006-3207	1873-2917				NOV	2017	215						162	168		10.1016/j.biocon.2017.09.012								WOS:000414883000019						
J	Peters, JR; Granek, EF; de Rivera, CE; Rollins, M				Peters, Joseph R.; Granek, Elise F.; de Rivera, Catherine E.; Rollins, Matthew			Prozac in the water: Chronic fluoxetine exposure and predation risk interact to shape behaviors in an estuarine crab	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Predators exert considerable top-down pressure on ecosystems by directly consuming prey or indirectly influencing their foraging behaviors and habitat use. Prey is, therefore, forced to balance predation risk with resource reward. A growing list of anthropogenic stressors such as rising temperatures and ocean acidification has been shown to influence prey risk behaviors and subsequently alter important ecosystem processes. Yet, limited attention has been paid to the effects of chronic pharmaceutical exposure on risk behavior or as an ecological stressor, despite widespread detection and persistence of these contaminants in aquatic environments. In the laboratory, we simulated estuarine conditions of the shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis, and investigated whether chronic exposure (60 days) to field-detected concentrations (0, 3, and 30 ng/L) of the antidepressant fluoxetine affected diurnal and nocturnal risk behaviors in the presence of a predator, Cancer productus. We found that exposure to fluoxetine influenced both diurnal and nocturnal prey risk behaviors by increasing foraging and locomotor activity in the presence of predators, particularly during the day when these crabs normally stay hidden. Crabs exposed to fluoxetine were also more aggressive, with a higher frequency of agonistic interactions and increased mortality due to conflicts with conspecifics. These results suggest that exposure to field-detected concentrations of fluoxetine may alter the trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk among crabs in estuaries. This fills an important data gap, highlighting how intra- and interspecific behaviors are altered by exposure to field concentrations of pharmaceuticals; such data more explicitly identify potential ecological impacts of emerging contaminants on aquatic ecosystems and can aid water quality management.																	2045-7758					NOV	2017	7	21					9151	9161		10.1002/ece3.3453								WOS:000414873600044	29152204

Appraisal of seasonal variation of groundwater quality near an uncontrolled municipal solid waste landfill in Kolkata, India	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												The present study was aimed to evaluate the impact of leachate derived from uncontrolled municipal landfill on surrounding groundwater quality in Kolkata, India. Seasonal variation of twenty physico-chemical parameters in pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) season were analysed in forty groundwater samples around the landfill site. Groundwater pollution was identified by the spatial distribution maps of TDS, Na+, Cl-, Mn and Fe along with the heavy metals like Pb, Hg and Cr in both the seasons. Hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater samples showed that the area was dominated by brackish water, [Ca+2-Cl-], [Mg+2-Cl-] and [Na+-Cl-] type in PRM season whereas [Na+-HCO3-] type dominated in POM season. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was also applied to identify the source of groundwater pollution. In PRM season, groundwater samples closer to the active landfill site were physico-chemically different from upstream samples but more related to downstream samples. However, in POM season, groundwater samples closer to the active landfill site represented distinctly different physico-chemical characteristics from upstream and downstream samples as a result of high influx of leachate pollutants. In specific, the present study urges for proper pollution control measures along with landfill leachate treatment process to improve the surrounding water quality.																	1790-7632					NOV	2017	19	3					367	376										WOS:000414537400002						
J	Kanat, G				Kanat, Gurdal			Risk Perception and Bottled Drinking Water Consumption in Istanbul City	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Parallel to the increase in public concern about the safety of drinking water globally, the demand for bottled water has increased in almost every country. Although tap water is significantly cheaper than bottled water, consumers concerned about the safety of tap water. They still prefer the bottled water despite several checks implemented in tap water networks. The present paper aims to discuss network water quality in the city of Istanbul, Turkey and to present the findings on a related survey conducted by the authors. The survey was conducted with the participation of 980 individuals living in different districts in Istanbul and the findings were assessed to determine the public perception about tap water quality and bottled water consumption especially after the experienced years of drought and water quality concerns. Findings demonstrated that several individuals never drink tap water and certain individuals do not utilize tap water at all. It was found that only 4% in the surveyed group drink tap water without hesitation. Based on survey findings, the abovementioned group was mainly among the lowest income group in the sample. When purchasing bottled water, several individuals preferred the well-known brands. It was found that the most significant reasons for preferring bottled water were the nice taste of the bottled spring water, which was perceived not to exist in tap water. It was concluded that drinking water treatment facilities and regulations are required to cater the future quality demands. Furthermore, it was determined that adequate inspections and controls on network water are necessary.																	1790-7632					NOV	2017	19	3					521	532										WOS:000414537400018

It could affect water quality and marine ecosystems due to pollutants and trace elements transported through groundwater. Relations between different characteristics of aquifers and SGD have been investigated extensively before, but the role of fractures in SGD still remains unknown. In order to better understand the mechanism of groundwater flow and solute transport through fractures in SGD, one-dimensional analytical solutions of groundwater hydraulic head and velocity through a synthetic horizontal fracture with periodic boundary conditions were derived using a Laplace transform technique. Then, numerical solutions of solute transport associated with the given groundwater velocity were developed using a finite-difference method. The results indicated that SGD associated with groundwater flow and solute transport was mainly controlled by sea level periodic fluctuations, which altered the hydraulic head and the hydraulic head gradient in the fracture. As a result, the velocity of groundwater flow associated with SGD also fluctuated periodically. We found that the pollutant concentration associated with SGD oscillated around a constant value, and could not reach a steady state. This was particularly true at locations close to the seashore. This finding of the role of fracture in SGD will assist pollution remediation and marine conservation in coastal regions.

Transport and potential attenuation of nitrogen in shallow groundwaters in the lower Rangitikei catchment, New Zealand	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												Intensive agricultural activities are generally associated with nitrogen leaching from agricultural soils, and this nitrogen has the potential to percolate and contaminate groundwater and surface waters. We assessed surface water and groundwater interactions, and nitrogen leaching and its potential attenuation in shallow groundwater in the lower Rangitikei River catchment (832 km(2)), New Zealand. We combined regional- and local-scale field surveys and experiments, nutrient budget modelling, and hydraulic and geochemical methods, to gain an insight into leaching, transformation and transport of nitrogen via groundwaters to the river in the study area. Concurrent river flow gaugings (in January 2015) and a piezometric map, developed from measured depths to groundwater in 110 bores (in October 2014), suggest groundwater discharges to the Rangitikei River in the upper parts of the study area, while there is groundwater recharge near the coast. The groundwater redox characterisation, based on sampling and analysis of 15 mostly shallow bores (< 30 m below ground level (bgl)), suggests groundwater across the lower Rangitikei catchment in general is under anoxic/reduced conditions. The groundwater typically has low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (< 1 mg/L), suggesting the subsurface environment is conducive to potential attenuation by 'denitrification' of NO3-N in groundwater. We further measured NO3-N attenuation in shallow groundwater piezometers (3-6 m bgl) using single-well push-pull tests. We found generally low levels (< 0.5 mg/L) of NO3-N in shallow groundwater piezometers (> 5 m bgl), despite being installed under intensive land uses, such as dairying and cropping. Our in-field push-pull tests showed NO3-N reduction at four shallow groundwater piezometers, with the rates of reduction varying from 0.04 mg N L-1 h(-1) to 1.57 mg N h(-1). This highlights the importance of a sound understanding of not only the sources, but also transport and transformation, or fate, of nutrients leached from farms, to mitigate the likely impacts of land use on water quality and ecosystem health in agricultural catchments.																	0169-7722	1873-6009				NOV	2017	206						55	66		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2017.10.002								WOS:000414891200006	29033220

This raises questions about whether and how risk information is understood and acted upon, and how responses vary across contexts. To characterize such variation, we stratified a randomized experiment related to household water quality across two periurban areas in Cambodia. When we showed specific evidence of water contamination to lower-SES households who were initially more optimistic about water safety, they altered their beliefs about health risk and increased their demand for a treatment product. However, demand for the treatment product among higher and initially more pessimistic SES households did not change significantly. These findings highlight the importance of better understanding heterogeneity in the specific drivers of responses to health risk information. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Mitigation of acidified salmon rivers - effects of liming on young brown trout Salmo trutta	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												In southern Norway, 22 acidified rivers supporting anadromous salmonids were mitigated with lime to improve water quality and restore fish populations. In 13 of these rivers, effects on Salmo trutta and Salmo salar densities were monitored over 10-12years, grouped into age 0 and age1year fish. These rivers had a mean annual discharge of between 49 and 855m(3)s(-1), and six of them were regulated for hydro-power production. Salmo salar were lost in six of these rivers prior to liming, and highly reduced in the remaining seven rivers. Post-liming, S. salar became re-established in all six rivers with lost populations, and recovered in the seven other rivers. Salmo trutta occurred in all 13 study rivers prior to liming. Despite the improved water quality, both age 0 and age1year S. trutta densities decreased as S. salar density increased, with an average reduction of >50% after 10years of liming. For age 0year S. trutta this effect was less strong in rivers where S. salar were present prior to liming. In contrast, densities of S. trutta increased in unlimed streams above the anadromous stretches in two of the rivers following improved water quality due to natural recovery. Density increases of both age 0 and age1year S. salar showed a positive effect of river discharge. The results suggest that the decline in S. trutta density after liming is related to interspecific resource competition due to the recovery of S. salar. Thus, improved water quality through liming may not only sustain susceptible species, but can have a negative effect on species that are more tolerant prior to the treatment, such as S. trutta.

In this paper, the scale experiments for different surface roughness of GFRP and 13Cr stainless steel were carried out to obtain the corresponding mass gain in real oilfield conditions. The laws of temperature, surface roughness, time, contact angle and surface free energy of pipeline on scaling mechanism were analyzed from the macroscopic and microscopic view. Water quality and scale analysis indicated that the oil field was prone to form calcium carbonate and a small amount of magnesium carbonate mixed scale. GFRP scale deposition experiments revealed that the fouling would increase as time going and temperature rising and there existed a critical temperature at which the scale reached the highest scaling rate. GFRP hydrolysis experiments showed that the slight hydrolysis of GFRP caused by ions erosion would increase as temperature rising and scale deposition process would be adequately affected under high temperature. The surface free energy of 13Cr and GFRP with different roughness would be calculated to study the effects of contact angle and surface free energy on scale deposition. The results indicated that the mass gain had no liner relation with the surface roughness but would increase with the decreasing of contact angle and surface free energy on same material surface. It was also identified that there was a minimum fouling surface roughness, that is, the scale deposition is minimal at this roughness. The microscopic tests indicated that time could have a significant influence on scale grain size, consequently causing larger yield stress or hardness of scale grain formed early in the scale inner layer. GFRP shows better performance when reducing scale formation at the initial period. These results laid the theoretical foundation for the determination of fluid temperature, surface roughness, surface modification and the program of scale removal and inhibition.																	0920-4105	1873-4715				NOV	2017	159						522	531		10.1016/j.petrol.2017.09.018								WOS:000414657200043

In this study, geochemical analyses (conventional ions, stable isotopes, and trace elements) were conducted on 38 water samples collected from 11 CBM wells, an adjacent river and the coal mine in the Bide-Santang Basin, western Guizhou, China. Variations in water quality caused by aquifer recharge, water-rock interactions, and the oxidation environment were revealed using principle component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis. Li, Ga, Rb, Sr, and Ba were selected as characteristic trace elements, whose concentrations tend to increase with increasing producing layer depth. The water samples recorded an obvious D drift trend relative to the local meteoric water line (LMWL). Fracturing fluid from contaminated wells recorded elevated Cl- and Na+ concentrations and high delta 18O and dD values. The geochemical parameters of delta (the degree of D drift), delta D, delta O-18, Cl- +Na+ and characteristic trace element concentrations in produced water serve as indicators of the production and water source of CBM wells. Templates were created to discriminate between sources of produced water, including shallow groundwater, coal seam water, and fracturing fluid water. High-production wells are characterized by producing coal seam water, while lowproduction wells are characterized by producing shallow groundwater. The upper CBM system is susceptible to shallow groundwater recharge that involves multiple limestone aquifers, so it is recommended that the middle and lower CBM systems should be a priority for CBM development.																	0920-4105	1873-4715				NOV	2017	159						666	678		10.1016/j.petrol.2017.09.068								WOS:000414657200057

Most local supply systems are developed and maintained by the local community and are in a poor condition. Based on a national strategy, this issue should be resolved with the construction of regional systems using artificial reservoirs. In this paper, case studies from three areas in Serbia are shown in order to offer the alternative to regional water supply with the development of autonomous groundwater supply systems in remote settlements, especially in cases when water supply from surface water inevitably leads to the deterioration in quality and quantity of resources. The research conducted included monitoring of regime parameters and conducting multiple chemical analyses in order to determine the stability of resources, both in the qualitative and quantitative sense, as well as other important factors for development of supply systems. It can be concluded that, if properly and continuously monitored and developed by public waterworks companies, those autonomous groundwater systems would be able to provide the required amount of quality resources for the water supply of remote settlements where necessary.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				NOV	2017	66	7					454	468		10.2166/aqua.2017.129								WOS:000414671500004

The input data included monitored riverine loads, point sources and land use categories from a total of 50 rivers/catchment areas. Two independent studies were conducted: the estimation of emission coefficients for the whole of Estonia and for a smaller study area near Tallinn. The results from both cases showed that drained peat soils were the highest diffuse source contributor in unit-area loads. The results show that the unit-area loads from drained peat soils were up to 2.3 times higher than from arable land. Moreover, a comparison of emission coefficients for the whole of Estonia and for the Tallinn catchment area indicated that coefficients can vary significantly between sources and single years. Additional detailed studies and monitoring are needed to support these conclusions.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				NOV	2017	66	7					469	480		10.2166/aqua.2017.036								WOS:000414671500005

Adopting measures such as developing common methodologies, tools and techniques addressing water quality and quantity issues, water losses and pricing policies is a top priority. Regarding the harmonization of procedures and legislative framework, the requirements of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60 are respected. An approach to face these challenges is being developed through the cooperation of several organizations and stakeholders involved in the implementation of the DRINKADRIA project. This paper discusses its specific objectives and outputs linked to: (a) promotion of sustainable provision of drinking water, by setting joint cross-border recommendations on drinking water resources management; (b) undertaking of methods and technologies, through the implementation of pilot actions; and (c) stimulating capacity building, through the exchange of know-how and the development of a regional network of water supply experts. A set of standardized protocols on the applicable management of water supply systems and resources in the Adriatic area is being developed and tested by the beneficiaries involved. The relevant pilot actions aim at improving water supply and water resources management. Eventually, DRINKADRIA's measurable results will support decision makers in the adaptation of effective and efficient measures and policies.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				NOV	2017	66	7					489	508		10.2166/aqua.2017.079								WOS:000414671500007

Effectiveness of silver and copper infused ceramic drinking water filters in reducing microbiological contaminants	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												A series of bench-scale experiments were conducted on ceramic filters with various amounts of silver and/or copper nanoparticles fired-in during the manufacturing process. The experiments were designed to determine the efficacy of the filters on the removal of pathogens from drinking water. Escherichia coli and MS2 were employed as non-pathogenic surrogates for pathogenic organisms. Experiments were run on 23 ceramic filters - 10 replicates, one single filter, and two blanks - for approximately 10 days. Influent and effluent turbidity, E. coli, and MS2 concentrations were monitored regularly. Results showed that all ceramic filter configurations exceeded WHO standards for removal of bacteria under highly protective conditions, but few met these criteria for bacteriophage. The filters containing various concentrations of silver nanoparticles (25-100%) achieved an additional 2 log removal over the blank, copper, and mixed copper/silver filters for bacteria; however, it was difficult to determine the effect of nanoparticles on the removal of bacteriophage. A significant variation in effluent quality between filters of the same composition was observed, indicating the importance of variations in the manufacturing process on effluent water quality. Given the potential health risks of inadequate filtration, it is recommended that the quality control process be examined and upgraded.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				NOV	2017	66	7					528	536		10.2166/aqua.2017.028								WOS:000414671500010

Bioremediation of pollutant-contaminated water	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												Raw water resources in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate are affected by many contaminants particularly during the winter season and low demand period of the Nile River, in which water level decreases and organic matter increases resulting in decreased dissolved oxygen, and increased ammonia, nitrite and bacterial load in the water. In this study, physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of water samples taken seasonally from selected sampling sites on seven main canals in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate were tested and studied to monitor nitrification process occurrence and study its effect on water quality. The main results of the study included turbidity, conductivity, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate and showed increased values during the winter season. Heavy metals levels showed that iron increased in winter and aluminum increased in spring, while copper increased in winter and spring seasons. Total bacterial count, total coliform and algal count increased in the winter season. Activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria also increased markedly during the winter season which could be explained by increased ammonia concentration during the same period which enhanced nitrification process occurrence. This study proved that nitrification in environments which provide unfavorable conditions for autotrophic nitrifying bacteria may result from the activity of heterotrophic microorganisms; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens was isolated and identified to be involved.

We used morphological image processing to identify candidate ecological restoration areas based on their proximity to existing natural vegetation. We identified 1,102,720 candidate ecological restoration areas across the continental United States. Candidate ecological restoration areas were concentrated in the Great Plains and eastern United States. We populated the database of candidate ecological restoration areas with 17 attributes related to site content and context, including factors such as soil fertility and roads (site content), and number and area of potentially conjoined vegetated regions (site context) to facilitate its use for site prioritization. We demonstrate the utility of the database in the state of North Carolina, U.S.A. for a restoration objective related to restoration of water quality (mandated by the U.S. Clean Water Act), wetlands, and forest. The database will be made publicly available on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's EnviroAtlas website (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov) for stakeholders interested in ecological restoration.

The effect of rivers, streams, and canals on property values	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Rivers, streams, and canals support a variety of critical agricultural, industrial, transportation, ecological, and household uses. They also provide important aesthetic, recreational, and sociocultural benefits. This review paper synthesizes the evidence to date regarding the value of these linear water features as aesthetic and recreational resources to adjacent and nearby residents. Specifically, it summarizes 25 studies that have used the hedonic pricing method to calculate the effects of views of and proximity to rivers, streams, and canals on surrounding residential property values. The majority of studies indicated that significant positive property price effects are associated with river, stream, and canal view and proximity, though these effects appear less definitive in rural than urban settings. Implications of the body of evidence for planning, management, and development are discussed, and potential effects of climate change and diversion policies are highlighted. Improvements in measurement facilitated by advanced geographic information systems and rigorous spatially explicit regression techniques are noted.

Cost-effective treatment of swine wastes through recovery of energy and nutrients	WASTE MANAGEMENT												Wastes from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are challenging to treat because they are high in organic matter and nutrients. Conventional swine waste treatment options in the U.S., such as uncovered anaerobic lagoons, result in poor effluent quality and greenhouse gas emissions, and implementation of advanced treatment introduces high costs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the performance and life cycle costs of an alternative system for treating swine CAFO waste, which recovers valuable energy (as biogas) and nutrients (N, P, K+) as saleable fertilizers. The system uses in-vessel anaerobic digestion (AD) for methane production and solids stabilization, followed by struvite precipitation and ion exchange (IX) onto natural zeolites (chabazite or clinoptilolite) for nutrient recovery. An alternative approach that integrated struvite recovery and IX into a single reactor, termed STRIEX, was also investigated. Pilot- and bench-scale reactor experiments were used to evaluate the performance of each stage in the treatment train. Data from these studies were integrated into a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) to assess the cost-effectiveness of various process alternatives. Significant improvement in water quality, high methane production, and high nutrient recovery (generally over 90%) were observed with both the AD-struvite-IX process and the AD-STRIEX process. The LCCA showed that the STRIEX system can provide considerable financial savings compared to conventional systems. AD, however, incurs high capital costs compared to conventional anaerobic lagoons and may require larger scales to become financially attractive. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Antonini, K; Langer, M; Farid, A; Walter, U				Antonini, Kelly; Langer, Martin; Farid, Ahmed; Walter, Ulrich			SWEET CubeSat - Water detection and water quality monitoring for the 21st century	ACTA ASTRONAUTICA												Water scarcity and contamination of clean water have been identified as major challenges of the 21st century, in particular for developing countries. According to the International Water Management Institute, about 30% of the world's population does not have reliable access to clean water. Consequently, contaminated water contributes to the death of about 3 million people every year, mostly children. Access to potable water has been proven to boost education, equality and health, reduce hunger, as well as help the economy of the developing world. Currently used in-situ water monitoring techniques are sparse, and often difficult to execute. Space-based instruments will help to overcome these challenges by providing means for water level and water quality monitoring of medium to-large sweet (fresh) water reservoirs. Data from hyperspectral imaging instruments on past and present governmental missions, such as Envisat and Aqua, has been used for this purpose. However, the high cost of large multi-purpose space vessels, and the lack of dedicated missions limits the continuous monitoring of inland and coastal water quality. The proposed CubeSat mission SWEET (Sweet Water Earth Education Technologies) will try to fill this gap. The SWEET concept is a joint effort between the Technical University of Munich, the German Space Operations Center and the African Steering Committee of the IAF. By using a novel Fabry-Perot interferometer based hyperspectral imager, the mission will deliver critical data directly to national water resource centers in Africa with an unmatched cost per pixel ratio and high temporal resolution. Additionally, SWEET will incorporate education of students in CubeSat design and water management. Although the aim of the mission is to deliver local water quality and water level data to African countries, further coverage could be achieved with subsequent satellites. Finally, a constellation of SWEET-like CubeSats would extend the coverage to the whole planet, delivering daily data to ensure reliable access to clean water for millions of people worldwide.																	0094-5765	1879-2030				NOV	2017	140						10	17		10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.07.046								WOS:000413798700002

The Lunar Palace 1, a ground-based bioregenerative life support system experimental facility, has been developed by our team and a 105-day closed bioregenerative life support experiment with multi-crew involved has been accomplished within this large-scale facility. During the 105-day experiment, activated carbon-absorption/ultra-filtration, membrane biological activated carbon reactor and reduced pressure distillation technology have been used to purify the condensate water, sanitary & kitchen wastewater and urine, respectively. The results demonstrated that the combination of those technologies can achieve 100% regeneration of the water inside the Lunar Palace 1. The purified condensate water (the clean water) could meet the standards for drinking water quality in China (GB5749-2006). The treatment capacity of the membrane-biological activated carbon reactor for sanitary & kitchen wastewater could reach 150 kg/d. During the 105-d experiment, the average volume loading of the bioreactor was 0A41 kgCOD/(m(3)d), and the average COD removal efficiency was about 853%. The quality of the purified sanitary & kitchen wastewater (the greywater) could meet the standards for irrigation water quality (GB 5084-2005). In addition, during the 105-day experiment, the total excreted urine volume of three crew members was 346 L and the contained water was totally treated and recovered. The removal efficiency of ion from urine was about 88.12%. Moreover, partial nitrogen within the urine was recovered as well and the average recovery ratio was about 20.5%. The study laid a foundation for the water recycling technologies which could be used in BLSS for lunar or Mars bases.																	0094-5765	1879-2030				NOV	2017	140						420	426		10.1016/j.actaastro.2017.08.026								WOS:000413798700042

They are still frequently managed by either mowing, chemical weeding, dredging or burning to ensure their optimal hydraulic capacity. Ditches were recently reported also to improve water quality and sustain biodiversity. These ditch functions are related to specific ditch properties. By contrastingly modifying ditch properties, maintenance operations were supposed to regulate these functions. There is, therefore, a need to re-examine the design and maintenance strategies of ditches to optimize the whole range of ecosystem services that they provide. In this study, we address the innovator question of how maintenance operations affect the yearly evolution of ditch properties, and in turn, the panel of functions that ditches support. During one year, we monitored the vegetation, litter, soil properties, and ash cover of five ditches that were being unmanaged, dredged, mowed, burned, and chemically weeded, respectively, with timing and frequency as generally operated by farmers in the study area. We then used indicators to evaluate the effect that the evolution of these properties has on the ditch water conveyance, herbicide retention and biodiversity conservation functions. We found that the evolution of these properties significantly contrasted among the 5 maintenance strategies. All the maintenance operations cleared the vegetation, which improves the hydraulic capacity by up to 3 times. The optimal hydraulic capacity is maintained longer after chemical weeding and dredging, but these operations have negative impacts on the herbicide retention and biodiversity conservation functions. The litter and ash layers generated by mowing and burning, respectively, improve the herbicide retention by up to 45%. Our results confirm that maintenance can be an efficient tool for optimizing ditch functions. The choice of maintenance operation and timing are key to successfully optimizing most of the functions that ditches can support. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanisms for how these multiple scale factors and their interactions affect the sediment denitrifying communities remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the community composition, diversity, and abundance of nitrite reductase genes (nirK and nirS)-encoding denitrifiers in 74 sediment samples from 22 Yangtze lakes using clone library and quantitative PCR techniques. Information of location, climate, catchment land use, water quality, sediment properties, and plant communities at each sampling site was analyzed to elucidate the effects of regional, landscape, and local factors on the characteristics of sediment denitrifying communities. Results of canonical correspondence analysis indicated that local factors were the key determinants of denitrifying community composition, accounting for over 20% of the total variation. Additionally, certain regional and landscape factors, including elevation and catchment built-up land, were also significantly related to the composition of denitrifying communities.

Nineteen water samples were collected in dry season and 15 water quality parameters including TSS, TDS, pH, DO, BOD, Cl-, F-, NO32-, NO2-, SO42-, Ca, Mg, K, Zn and Pb were measured. The univariate overview of water quality parameters are TSS 25.154 +/- 8.674 mg/l, TDS 840.400 +/- 311.081 mg/l, pH 7.574 +/- 0.256 pH unit, DO 4.544 +/- 0.933 mg/l, BOD 0.758 +/- 0.179 mg/l, Cl- 51.494 +/- 28.095 mg/l, F- 0.771 +/- 0.153 mg/l, NO32- 2.211 +/- 0.878 mg/l, NO2- 4.692 +/- 5.971 mg/l, SO42- 69.545 +/- 53.873 mg/l, Ca 48.458 +/- 22.690 mg/l, Mg 19.676 +/- 7.361 mg/l, K 12.874 +/- 11.382 mg/l, Zn 0.027 +/- 0.029 mg/l, Pb 0.096 +/- 0.154 mg/l. The water quality data were subjected to R-mode PCA which resulted in five major components. PC1 explains 28% of total variance and indicates the roadside and brick field dust settle down (TDS, TSS) in the nearby water body. PC2 explains 22.123% of total variance and indicates the agricultural influence (K, Ca, and NO2-). PC3 describes the contribution of nonpoint pollution from agricultural and soil erosion processes (SO42-, Cl-, and K). PC4 depicts heavy positively loaded by vehicle emission and diffusion from battery stores (Zn, Pb). PC5 depicts strong positive loading of BOD and strong negative loading of pH. Cluster analysis represents three major clusters for both water parameters and sampling sites. The site based on cluster showed similar grouping pattern of R-mode factor score map. The present work reveals a new scope to monitor the roadside water quality for future research in Bangladesh.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3511	3525		10.1007/s13201-017-0619-0								WOS:000413254300008

Sample collection, handling and processing followed the standard methods recommended by APHA and analyzed in quality assured laboratories using appropriate analytical methods and instrumental techniques. The results show that the quality parameters in all drinking water resources are within the permissible limits set by Omani and WHO standards; and the drinking water quality index is good or medium in quality based on NFS-WQI classification criteria, indicating their suitability for human consumption. There is an indication of the presence of high nitrate concentrations in some groundwater wells, which require more investigations and monitoring program to be conducted on regular basis to ensure good quality water supply for the residents in the mountain. The trilinear Piper diagram shows that most of the drinking water resources of the study area fall in the field of calcium and bicarbonate type with some magnesium bicarbonate type indicating that most of the major ions are natural in origin due to the geology of the region. This study is a first step towards providing indicators on groundwater quality of this fragile mountain ecosystem, which will be the basis for future planning decisions on corrective demand management measures to protect groundwater resources of Al Jabal Al Akhdar.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3539	3552		10.1007/s13201-017-0621-6								WOS:000413254300010						
J	Prasad, B; Maiti, D; Kumar, A				Prasad, Bably; Maiti, Deblina; Kumar, Adarsh			Ground water quality evaluation in the lean period of a mining township	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Groundwater of mining towns is very much affected due to mining activity. During mining of mineral from underground, huge quantity of ground water is pumped out to make mining possible. Groundwater samples have been collected from the 20 sampling sites of Dhanbad, a mining Township, in the lean period (summer) of the years 2011 and 2014. Four samples have been obtained from open well and 16 from hand pumps. Water quality parameters such as pH, total hardness, Ca hardness, Mg Hardness, chloride, sulphate, total dissolved solids, and heavy metals have been evaluated. The values of pH, total hardness, Ca hardness, Mg hardness, chloride, sulphate, and total dissolved solids have increased in 2014 as compared to 2011 which may be due to increase in mineral content in the lean period and decrease in the rate of recharge of aquifers in 2014. The concentration of heavy metals has decreased in 2014 as compared to 2011 which may be due to less leaching of heavy metals from the ground strata. From the overall study, it has been concluded that most of the water quality parameters of all the 20 groundwater samples in the year 2014 are not exceeding the acceptable concentration level, as mentioned in Indian drinking water specifications. Groundwater in the year 2014 has not shown any significant change in its quality as compared to the year 2011. In the incoming years, quality of groundwater will not show any drastic change unless and until any anthropogenic activity other than mining will affect it.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3553	3560		10.1007/s13201-017-0626-1								WOS:000413254300011

A method of groundwater quality assessment based on fuzzy network-CANFIS and geographic information system (GIS)	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The process of water quality testing is money/time-consuming, quite important and difficult stage for routine measurements. Therefore, use of models has become commonplace in simulating water quality. In this study, the coactive neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) was used to simulate groundwater quality. Further, geographic information system (GIS) was used as the pre-processor and post-processor tool to demonstrate spatial variation of groundwater quality. All important factors were quantified and groundwater quality index (GWQI) was developed. The proposed model was trained and validated by taking a case study of Mazandaran Plain located in northern part of Iran. The factors affecting groundwater quality were the input variables for the simulation, whereas GWQI index was the output. The developed model was validated to simulate groundwater quality. Network validation was performed via comparison between the estimated and actual GWQI values. In GIS, the study area was separated to raster format in the pixel dimensions of 1 km and also by incorporation of input data layers of the Fuzzy Network-CANFIS model; the geo-referenced layers of the effective factors in groundwater quality were earned. Therefore, numeric values of each pixel with geographical coordinates were entered to the Fuzzy Network-CANFIS model and thus simulation of groundwater quality was accessed in the study area. Finally, the simulated GWQI indices using the Fuzzy Network-CANFIS model were entered into GIS, and hence groundwater quality map (raster layer) based on the results of the network simulation was earned. The study's results confirm the high efficiency of incorporation of neuro-fuzzy techniques and GIS. It is also worth noting that the general quality of the groundwater in the most studied plain is fairly low.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3633	3647		10.1007/s13201-016-0508-y								WOS:000413254300018

Rama			Classification of heavy metal ions present in multi-frequency multi-electrode potable water data using evolutionary algorithm	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Access to potable water for the common people is one of the most challenging tasks in the present era. Contamination of drinking water has become a serious problem due to various anthropogenic and geogenic events. The paper demonstrates the application of evolutionary algorithms, viz., particle swan optimization and genetic algorithm to 24 water samples containing eight different heavy metal ions (Cd, Cu, Co, Pb, Zn, Ar, Cr and Ni) for the optimal estimation of electrode and frequency to classify the heavy metal ions. The work has been carried out on multi-variate data, viz., single electrode multi-frequency, single frequency multi-electrode and multi-frequency multi-electrode water samples. The electrodes used are platinum, gold, silver nanoparticles and glassy carbon electrodes. Various hazardous metal ions present in the water samples have been optimally classified and validated by the application of Davis Bouldin index. Such studies are useful in the segregation of hazardous heavy metal ions found in water resources, thereby quantifying the degree of water quality.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3679	3689		10.1007/s13201-016-0514-0								WOS:000413254300022

Engineering and environmental remediation scenarios due to leakage from the Gulf War oil spill using 3-D numerical contaminant modellings	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The transport groundwater modelling has been undertaken to assess potential remediation scenarios and provide an optimal remediation options for consideration. The purpose of the study was to allow 50 years of predictive remediation simulation time. The results depict the likely total petroleum hydrocarbon migration pattern in the area under the worst-case scenario. The remediation scenario simulations indicate that do nothing approach will likely not achieve the target water quality within 50 years. Similarly, complete source removal approach will also likely not achieve the target water quality within 50 years. Partial source removal could be expected to remove a significant portion of the contaminant mass, but would increase the rate of contaminant recharge in the short to medium term. The pump-treat-reinject simulation indicates that the option appears feasible and could achieve a reduction in the area of the 0.01 mg/L TPH contour area for both Raudhatain and Umm Al-Aish by 35 and 30%, respectively, within 50 years. The rate of improvement and the completion date would depend on a range of factors such as bore field arrangements, pumping rates, reinjection water quality and additional volumes being introduced and require further optimisation and field pilot trials.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3707	3718		10.1007/s13201-016-0517-x								WOS:000413254300024

The NSF-WQI range obtained for the sampling sites was 61-70 indicating a medium water quality. The HPI value was 98.6 slightly below the critical value for drinking water of 100, and the water quality in the upstream stations is better than downstream due to decrease in water and the accumulation of contaminants along the river. This study explains the significance of applying the water quality indices that show the aggregate impact of ecological factors in charge of water pollution of surface water and which permits translation of the monitoring data to assist the decision makers.

J	Kim, CM; Parnichkun, M				Kim, Chan Moon; Parnichkun, Manukid			Prediction of settled water turbidity and optimal coagulant dosage in drinking water treatment plant using a hybrid model of k-means clustering and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Coagulation is an important process in drinking water treatment to attain acceptable treated water quality. However, the determination of coagulant dosage is still a challenging task for operators, because coagulation is nonlinear and complicated process. Feedback control to achieve the desired treated water quality is difficult due to lengthy process time. In this research, a hybrid of k-means clustering and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (k-means-ANFIS) is proposed for the settled water turbidity prediction and the optimal coagulant dosage determination using full-scale historical data. To build a well-adaptive model to different process states from influent water, raw water quality data are classified into four clusters according to its properties by a k-means clustering technique. The sub-models are developed individually on the basis of each clustered data set. Results reveal that the sub-models constructed by a hybrid k-means-ANFIS perform better than not only a single ANFIS model, but also seasonal models by artificial neural network (ANN). The finally completed model consisting of sub-models shows more accurate and consistent prediction ability than a single model of ANFIS and a single model of ANN based on all five evaluation indices. Therefore, the hybrid model of k-means-ANFIS can be employed as a robust tool for managing both treated water quality and production costs simultaneously.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3885	3902		10.1007/s13201-017-0541-5								WOS:000413254300040						
J	Unnisa, SA; Bi, SZ				Unnisa, Syeda Azeem; Bi, Shaik Zainab			Groundwater quality characterization around Jawaharnagar open dumpsite, Telangana State	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												In the present work groundwater samples were collected from ten different data points in and around Jawaharnagar municipal dumpsite, Telangana State Hyderabad city from May 2015 to May 2016 on monthly basis for groundwater quality characterization. Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) value was determined using correlation matrix to identify the highly correlated and interrelated water quality standards issued by Bureau of Indian Standard (IS-10500:2012). It is found that most of the groundwater samples are above acceptable limits and are not potable. The chemical analysis results revealed that pH range from 7.2 to 7.8, TA 222 to 427 mg/l, TDS 512 to 854 mg/l, TH 420 to 584 mg/l, Calcium 115 to 140 mg/l, Magnesium 55 to 115 mg/l, Chlorides 202 to 290 mg/l, Sulphates 170 to 250 mg/l, Nitrates 6.5 to 11.3 mg/l, and Fluoride 0.9 to 1.7 mg/l. All samples showed higher range of physicochemical parameters except nitrate content which was lower than permissible limit. Highly positive correlation was observed between pH-TH (r = 0.5063), TA-Cl- (r = 0.5896), TDS-SO4 (-) (r = 0.5125), Mg2+-NO3 (-) (r = 0.5543) and Cl--F- (r = 0.7786). The groundwater samples in and around Jawaharnagar municipal dumpsite implies that groundwater samples were contaminated by municipal leachate migration from open dumpsite. The results revealed that the systematic calculations of correlation coefficient between water parameters and regression analysis provide qualitative and rapid monitoring of groundwater quality.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3911	3918		10.1007/s13201-017-0544-2								WOS:000413254300042

Water quality assessment and hydrochemical characterization of Zamzam groundwater, Saudi Arabia	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												This study focuses on chemical and microbial analyses of 50 Zamzam water samples, Saudi Arabia. The soluble ions, trace elements, total colony counts, total coliform group, and E. coli were determined and compared with WHO standards. The obtained results indicated that the dissolved salts, soluble cations and anions, Pb, Cd, As, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, PO4 (3-), NO2 (-), Br-, F-, NH4 (+), and Li+, were within permissible limits for all samples. Yet, 2% of waters contain NO3 (-) at slightly high concentration. The water quality index (WQI) reveals that 94% of the samples were excellent for drinking (class I). While the remaining was unsuitable due to total coliform group contamination "class (V)". Durov diagram suggest no clear facies and dominant water type can be noted. It indicates mixing processes of two or more different facies might be occurring in the groundwater system. All studied waters were undersaturated with respect to halite, gypsum, fluorite, and anhydrite. These minerals tend to dissolve and increase water salinity. A direct relationship between Zamzam water salinity and rainfall is recorded. The water salinity fluctuated between 4500 mg L-1 (year 1950) and 500 mg L-1 (year 2015) based on rainfall extent. The approach applied can be used to similar groundwater worldwide.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3985	3996		10.1007/s13201-017-0549-x								WOS:000413254300047

In order to accomplish these, groundwater sampling from 30 shallow and deep wells in the plain were carried out in July 2012. The water samples were analyzed for various physicochemical parameters such as pH, EC, Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, Cl-, CO3 (2-), HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-) and NO3 (-). Chadha's diagram demonstrates that most of the groundwaters belonged to the Na-Cl and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl hydrochemical facies. The concentrations of some major ions in groundwater are above the permissible limit for drinking and domestic purposes except for a few locations. The results of saturation index computation show that dissolution of gypsum, anhydrite, halite and silicate minerals occurs frequently across the study area, whereas the groundwater is supersaturated with regard to calcite and dolomite. Cross-plots show that weathering and dissolution of different rocks and minerals, ion exchange, reverse ion exchange and anthropogenic activities, especially agricultural activities, are effective in hydrogeochemistry of the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					3997	4011		10.1007/s13201-017-0550-4								WOS:000413254300048						
J	Sreedhar, Y; Nagaraju, A				Sreedhar, Y.; Nagaraju, A.			Groundwater quality around Tummalapalle area, Cuddapah District, Andhra Pradesh, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation was assessed in Tummalapalle area. Forty groundwater samples were analysed for major cations, anions and other parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total alkalinity and total hardness (TH). The parameters such as sodium adsorption ratio, adjusted sodium adsorption ratio (adj.SAR), per cent sodium, potential salinity, residual sodium carbonate, non-carbonate hardness, Kelly's ratio and permeability index were calculated for the evaluation of irrigation water quality. Groundwater chemistry was also analysed by statistical analysis, USSL, Wilcox, Doneen, Piper and Chadhas diagrams, to find out their suitability for irrigation. TDS and TH were used as main parameters to interpret the suitability of groundwater for drinking purpose. The correlation coefficient matrix between the hydrochemical parameters was carried out using Pearson's correlation to infer the possible water-rock interactions responsible for the variation of groundwater chemistry and this has been supported by Gibbs diagram. The results indicate that the groundwater in Tummalapalle area is alkaline in nature. Ca-Mg-HCO3 is the dominant hydrogeochemical facies. Water chemistry of the study area strongly reflects the dominance of weathering of rock-forming minerals such as bicarbonates and silicates. All parameters and diagrams suggest that the water samples of the study are good for irrigation, and the plots of TDS and TH suggest that 12.5% of the samples are good for human consumption.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					4077	4089		10.1007/s13201-017-0564-y								WOS:000413254300054

Assessment of heavy metal contamination in the sediment of the River Ghaghara, a major tributary of the River Ganga in Northern India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The present study includes a systematic analysis of sediment contamination by heavy metals of the River Ghaghara flowing through the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in Indian Territory. To estimate the geochemical environment of the river, seven heavy metals, namely Co, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, Zn, and Pb were examined from the freshly deposited river bed sediment. All the sediment samples were collected on a seasonal basis for the assessment of fluctuation in 2014-2015 and after preparation samples were analyzed using standard procedure. Result showed that heavy metal concentration ranged between 11.37 and 18.42 mg/kg for Co, 2.76 and 11.74 mg/kg for Cu, 61.25 and 87.68 mg/kg for Cr, 15.29 and 25.59 mg/kg for Ni, 0.21 and 0.28 mg/kg for Cd, 13.26 and 17.59 mg/kg for Zn, 10.71 and 14.26 mg/kg for Pb in different season. Metal contamination factor indicates the anthropogenic input in the river sediment was in the range of (0.62-0.97) for Co, (0.04-0.26) for Cu, (0.68-0.97) for Cr, (0.22-0.38) for Ni, (0.70-0.93) for Cd, (0.14-0.19) for Zn, and (0.54-0.71) for Pb. The highest contamination degree of the sediment was noticed as 4.01 at Ayodhya and lowest as 3.16 at Katerniaghat. Geo-accumulation index was noted between (0 and 1) which showed that sediment was uncontaminated to moderately contaminated and may have adverse affects on freshwater ecology of the river. Pollution load index (PLI) was found highest at Chhapra which was 0.45 and lowest at Katerniaghat which was 0.35 and it indicates that the river sediment has a low level of contamination. Significant high correlation was observed between Co, Cu, and Zn, it suggests same source of contamination input is mainly due to human settlement and agriculture activity. Positive correlation between Zn, Co, Cu, Cr, and Ni indicated a natural origin of these elements in the river sediment. Cluster analysis suggests grouping of similar polluted sites. The strong similarity between Co, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cu, and Cd showed relationship of these metals come from the same origin, which is possibly from natural and anthropogenic input which was also confirmed by correlation analysis. Using the various pollution indicators it was found that the river bed sediment is less contaminated by toxic metals during the study but the sediment quality may degrade in the near future due to increasing anthropogenic inputs in the river basin, hence proper management strategies are required to control the direct dumping of wastewater in the river.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				NOV	2017	7	7					4133	4149		10.1007/s13201-017-0572-y								WOS:000413254300059

Through cellulose self-locking and inter-locking, several micro-nano TNTs networks with higher specific surface area are obtained and applied to toxic heavy metal Pb2+ cations removal. It not only makes abundant toxic Pb2+ ions exchange with the inter-layer Na+ ions of TNTs, but also allows many Pb2+ ions to be deposited onto the TNTs surface. As expected, heavy metal Pb2+ removal performance of the as-prepared TNTs networks miraculously reaches 5.24 mmol g(-1). Moreover, the prepared titanate network is also exhibited a good co-removal capacity of multicomponent ions (Pb2+, Sr2+ and Cs+) and superior acid/alkali adaptability. Therefore, the as-fabricated TNTs network with cellulose sheets as structure promoter could be regarded as a promising water purifier.																	0144-8617	1879-1344				NOV 1	2017	175						756	764		10.1016/j.carbpol.2017.08.048								WOS:000411112500086	28917927

Mobile phosphorus stratification in sediments by aluminum immobilization	CHEMOSPHERE					2nd International Conference on Biological Waste as Resource (BWR) - Environmental Impact and Emerging Concerns of Biological Waste Treatment and Recycling Processes	MAY 25-28, 2017	Hong Kong Polytechn Univ, Hung Hom, PEOPLES R CHINA		Hong Kong Polytechn Univ			There is a great heterogeneity in the distribution of mobile phosphorus (P) in natural sediments, while the assessment of P immobilization by amendment agents has mostly neglected this feature. In this study, the effects of aluminum sulfate (ALS) on P immobilization were investigated via a 60-day microcosm experiment using sampled sediment cores. The high-resolution dialysis (HR-Peeper) and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) techniques were first employed to establish the profiles of soluble reactive P (SRP) and DGT-labile P in aluminum-amended sediments at 2 and 1 mm resolutions, respectively. Both concentrations of two mobile P forms decreased with increasing ALS dosages. The static layers with extremely low P concentrations (<= 0.060 mg L-1 for SRP and <= 0.024 mg L-1 for DGT-labile P) were observed in the upper 6-16 mm sediment layers at 6-15 ALS/P-mobile treatments (mobile P is the sum of NH4Cl-P, BD-P, and NaOH-nrP; mol mol(-1)). The static layer was followed by an active layer in which the upward release potential (R-AL decreased from 33.4 to 21.9 for SRP and from 92.2 to 51.0 for DGT-labile P, respectively. As the formation of the static layer is a key to sustaining P immobilization in sediments, the minimal dosage of 9 ALS/P-mobile is required for ALS capping. Modeling with DGT Induced Fluxes in Sediments (DIFS) showed a greater increase in adsorption rate constant (k(1), maximum 7.2-fold) compared to adsorption rate constant (k(1), maximum 2.2-fold), demonstrating that the release of P from sediment solids became increasingly difficult after ALS amendment.

Interplay of water quality and vegetation in restored wetland plant assemblages from an agricultural landscape	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality degradation from excessive fertilizer use and runoff is a worldwide problem. While this degradation impacts wetlands, these systems can also be a vehicle for water quality improvement. Restoration of wetlands in agricultural landscapes has recently increased, but little work has evaluated the relationship of plant assemblages and water quality parameters in restored, non-treatment wetlands. This study examines the impact of self-designed wetland plant assemblages on nitrogen and sediment dynamics. Thirty mesocosms were seeded with soil from restored wetlands and allowed to develop from the seed bank to emergent assemblages. During the 2015 growing season (seven to nine months after establishment), these assemblages were exposed to treatment loads of nitrogen and sediment, common stressors to wetlands in agricultural landscapes. Water samples were taken up to five days post-treatment in July and September to quantify interactions between the stressors and plant assemblages. Analyses showed plant assemblage identify was not structured by treatment, but by the site of soil origin. Treatment removal rates were influenced by total amount of the stressor present, with nitrogen removal rates being higher, in relative terms, in low nitrogen amended treatments. Additionally, plant quality, not quantity, was linked to nitrogen and sediment loss rates, and over time, elevated nitrogen and sediment loads were associated with decreased plant assemblage quality. This study demonstrates the ability of plants from restored wetlands to affect nutrient and sediment dynamics, with three significantly differing plant assemblages all exhibiting substantial nutrient and sediment reduction capacity. Nevertheless, we also found that in a relatively short time (seven to nine months) common stressors in agricultural settings can significantly impact wetland plant assemblage quality, and that this may be linked to a reduced capacity for nutrient and sediment removal.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		A				255	262		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.034								WOS:000412127500030

Hydrologic and water quality performance of regenerative stormwater conveyance installed to stabilize an eroded outfall	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Conveying concentrated urban runoff to outfall locations frequently leads to stream bank erosion, channel incision, and the formation of headcuts. Installed in an incised eroded channel, regenerative stormwater conveyance (RSC) is a grade-control and treatment system that uses a series of pools and cascades with an underlying sand bed. As a recently developed practice, RSC performance evaluations are needed to improve the design and guide regulatory accreditation. An eroded channel with a 10% longitudinal slope was stabilized with a five-cell system and monitored for a 14-month period. A small capture volume (6-mm design event) and groundwater intrusion resulted in minimal hydrologic benefit. Hydrologic mitigation was attained only for storms less than 12.7 mm. The RSC converted a substantial 50% of inflow to media flow at the second cell; however, the media flow entirely reemerged as surface flow in the saturated downstream pools. Small but statistically significant reductions in event mean concentrations occurred: 17% total suspended sediment (TSS), 17% total phosphorus (TP), and 3% total nitrogen (TN). Water quality improvements occurred primarily between the upstream and second cell, indicating limited processing by the wetter downstream pools. Comparisons between inter-event outflow grab samples and storm event outflow concentrations show nitrogen export during inter-event periods (47% increase in TN concentration). Due to elevated inter-event concentrations, overall mass loading of nitrogen increased. Hydrologic and water quality benefits were garnered only in the first three cells where groundwater intrusion was minimal. Future implementations of RSC are encouraged to account for seasonal high water table elevations that interact with the RSC media and adequately size pool and sand layer capture volumes.

Increasing floodplain connectivity through urban stream restoration increases nutrient and sediment retention	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stream restoration practices frequently aim to increase connectivity between the stream channel and its floodplain to improve channel stability and enhance water quality through sediment trapping and nutrient retention. To measure the effectiveness of restoration and to understand the drivers of these functional responses, we monitored five restored urban streams that represent a range of channel morphology and restoration ages. High and low elevation floodplain plots were established in triplicate in each stream to capture variation in floodplain connectivity. We measured ecosystem geomorphic and soil attributes, sediment and nutrient loading, and rates of soil nutrient biogeochemistry processes (denitrification; N and P mineralization) then used boosted regression trees (BRT) to identify controls on sedimentation and nutrient processing. Local channel and floodplain morphology and position within the river network controlled connectivity with increased sedimentation at sites downstream of impaired reaches and at floodplain plots near the stream channel and at low elevations. We observed that nitrogen loading (both dissolved and particulate) was positively correlated with denitrification and N mineralization and dissolved phosphate loading positively influenced P mineralization; however, none of these input rates or transformations differed between floodplain elevation categories. Instead, continuous gradients of connectivity were observed rather than categorical shifts between inset and high floodplains. Organic matter and nutrient content in floodplain soils increased with the time since restoration, which highlights the importance of recovery time after construction that is needed for restored systems to increase ecosystem functions. Our results highlight the importance of restoring floodplains downstream of sources of impairment and building them at lower elevations so they flood frequently, not just during bankfull events. This integrated approach has the greatest potential for increasing trapping of sediment, nutrients, and associated pollutants in restored streams and thereby improving water quality in urban watersheds.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		A				284	295		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.006								WOS:000412127500033

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed wetlands have been utilized with varying levels of success in an effort to reduce nutrient concentrations entering waterways. In south Florida, stormwater treatment areas (STAs) have been utilizedto remove excessive phosphorus (P) from surface waters for more than two decades with remarkableresults. Even though the STAs have been operational for more than two decade, further improvementof P removal performance is necessary to achieve the desired outflow concentrations. This commentary critically reviews a recently published manuscript concerning the ability of alternative vegetativecommunities' ability to improve STA treatment efficiency. The commentary provides clarification of Everglades STA effluent limit and the total P water quality criterion established for the Everglades ProtectionArea. The commentary also addresses fundamental issues with the authors' experimental design andinterpretability in light of the studies treatment fidelity, controls and scalability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Drivers of landscape evolution: multiple regimes and their influence on carbon sequestration in a sub-tropical peatland	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Typically, restoration goals target a point in history, i.e., the pre-human-influence state, however, ecosystems are dynamic and restoration goals must consider the potential evolution of the system, along with primary causes of landscape degradation and the resultant resilience. Using the Everglades as a case study, known disturbances were linked to biogeochemical and vegetation patterns to compare the divergence of the anthropogenically impacted landscape from that expected during natural peatland evolution. Specifically, landscape soil biogeochemistry of similar to 1,100 sites was examined in context of hydroperiod, spatial and temporal trends in water quality from the 1940s through present, elevation, and vegetation communities. This provided a link between carbon (C) accumulation and the influence of anthropogenic alterations. The network of canals created to manage water resulted in a greater ratio of surface water to rainfall contribution to the water budget, restored connectivity of groundwater to surface water, and facilitated overdrainage and mineral and nutrient enrichment of the ecosystem, causing multiple regime shifts and evidence of C loss. This study suggests that restoration can promote the accumulation of minerotrophic peats, but it is difficult to recreate the trajectory towards the ombrotrophic peatland, one of the end members and most C rich portions of the ecosystem, given changes in source waters and connectivity. In addition, a comparison with the literature and paleoecological data confirmed that while phosphorus (P) and C accumulation are positively related, even relatively small increases in P content reduced the proportional C content of peat soils. Overall, this study highlights the need to consider the potential natural trajectories of landscape development, the multiple coexisting resultant regimes, and the importance of soil biogeochemical properties when establishing and prioritizing restoration goals. Given the resilience and feedback loops of the anthropogenically impacted areas, active management of these areas may be necessary if we are to restore the vegetation community composition and biogeochemical characteristics to those of natural regimes, however, some legacy effects will constrain future restoration efforts.																	0012-9615	1557-7015				NOV	2017	87	4					578	599		10.1002/ecm.1269								WOS:000414241400003

To ensure the safety of water consumption of cities in Jingjinji area, we investigated the abundance of three classes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water and sediment of six water supply reservoirs in this area. The results showed that the detection frequency of sul1, tetM and ermB were 100%. However, the content ranges of these genes were different (10(-5) to 10(-2)/16S gene copies for sul1, 10(-5) to 10(-3)/16S gene copies for ermB, and 10(-5) to 10(-3)/16S gene copies for tetM). The content of ribosome protection proteins (RPP) genes were the highest in all selected tet genes. The highest abundance of ARGs in water and sediment samples was sampled from Panjiakou reservoir and Guanting reservoir, respectively. Except COD, chla and tetM, there are no significant correlation between water quality parameters and ARGs. Overall, this study provides integrated profiles of the three types of ARGs in water supply reservoirs of Jingjinji area and thus helps to re-evaluate the effects of human activities to water supply reservoirs.

Inhibition in fertilisation of coral gametes following exposure to nickel and copper	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												The mining and production of nickel in tropical regions have the potential to impact on ecologically valuable tropical marine ecosystems. Currently, few data exist to assess the risks of nickel exposure to tropical ecosystems and to derive ecologically relevant water quality guidelines. In particular, data are lacking for keystone species such as scleractinian corals, which create the complex structural reef habitats that support many other marine species. As part of a larger study developing risk assessment tools for nickel in the tropical Asia-Pacific region, we investigated the toxicity of nickel on fertilisation success in three species of scleractinian corals: Acropora aspera, Acropora digitifera and Platygyra daedalea. In the literature, more data are available on the effects of copper on coral fertilisation, so to allow for comparisons with past studies, the toxicity of copper to A. aspera and P. daedalea was also determined. Overall, copper was more toxic than nickel to the fertilisation success of the species tested. Acropora aspera was the most sensitive species to nickel (NOEC < 280 mu g Ni/L), followed by A. digitifera with an EC10 of 2000 mu g Ni/L and P. daedalea (EC10 > 4610 mu g Ni/L). Acropora aspera was also the more sensitive species to copper with an EC10 of 5.8 mu g Cu/L. The EC10 for P. daedalea was 16 mu g Cu/L, similar to previous studies. This is the first time that the toxicity of nickel on fertilisation success in Acropora species has been reported, and thus provides valuable data that can contribute to the development of reliable water quality guidelines for nickel in tropical marine waters.

Contribution of waste water treatment plants to pesticide toxicity in agriculture catchments	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Pesticide residues are frequently found in water bodies and may threaten freshwater ecosystems and biodiversity. In addition to runoff or leaching from treated agricultural fields, pesticides may enter streams via effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). We compared the pesticide toxicity in terms of log maximum Toxic Unit (log mTU) of sampling sites in small agricultural streams of Germany with and without WWTPs in the upstream catchments. We found an approximately half log unit higher pesticide toxicity for sampling sites with WWTPs (p < 0.001). Compared to fungicides and insecticides, herbicides contributed most to the total pesticide toxicity in streams with WWTPs. A few compounds (diuron, terbuthylazin, isoproturon, terbutryn and Metazachlor) dominated the herbicide toxicity. Pesticide toxicity was not correlated with upstream distance to WWTP (Speannan's rank correlation, rho = -0.11, p > 0.05) suggesting that other context variables are more important to explain WWTP-driven pesticide toxicity. Our results suggest that WWTPs contribute to pesticide toxicity in German streams.

J	Zhao, JS; Zhang, R				Zhao, Jinsong; Zhang, Run			Species sensitivity distribution for pentachlorophenol to aquatic organisms based on interval ecotoxicological data	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Species sensitivity distribution (SSD) model is often used to extrapolate the chemicals' effects from the ecotoxicological data on individual species to ecosystems, and is widely applied to derive water quality criteria or to assess ecological risk. Because of the influence of various factors, the ecotoxicological data of a specific chemicals to an individual usually exist in a range. The feasibility of interval ecotoxicological data directly applied to build SSD model has not been clearly stated. In the present study, by means of Bayesian statistics, the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of pentachlorophenol (PCP) to 161 aquatic organisms, which were organized into 7 groups, i.e., single determined value, geometric mean estimation, median estimation, interval data, and combination of single determined data with other groups, were used to develop SSD models and to estimate the minimum sample sizes. The results showed that the interval data could be directly applied to build SSD model, and when combined with single point data could give the narrowest credible interval that indicates a stable and robust SSD model. Meanwhile, the results also implied that at least 6-14 ecotoxicological data were required to build a stable SSD model. It suggests that the utilization of interval data in building SSD model can effectively enhance the availability of ecotoxicological data, reduce the uncertainty brought by sample size or point estimation, and provide a reliable way to widen the application of SSD model.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				NOV	2017	145						193	199		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.07.029								WOS:000411917100024	28734222

However, it has ecological risk, as suggested by comparison of habitat and white and red blood cell count in two wild fish species (Barbus meridionalis and Squalius laietanus) before and after an input of recycled water in Ripoll River (NE Spain) in 2009. Due to the lack of normal ranges for blood variables in wild fish, we surveyed seasonally the same river reaches in 2013 to test if blood alterations from 2009 compromised the viability of the fish populations. By examining other indicators of river health in baseline and polluted sites (fish abundance, mass-length relationships, and community indices in fish, diatoms and invertebrates), we tested for the superior utility of blood tests in biomonitoring. The comparison of water quality and scores of diatoms and invertebrate indices between polluted and reference sites showed that polluted sites improved from 2009 to 2013. The abundance of B. meridionalis also increased in polluted sites, but that of S. laietanus declined in 2013 compared to 2009. These results contrast with results of blood analyses in 2009, which suggested that B. meridionalis was more seriously affected by pollution than S. laietanus. The fish index did not reveal the risk of recycled water to fish health, whereas fish mass-length relationships suggested that S. laietanus individuals in 2013 had a better body condition in polluted than in reference sites. Given that the two fish species had opposite results in reference sites, and that the physical habitat was more suitable for B. meridionalis in polluted sites in 2013 than was for S. laietanus, trends in population size are not only explained by pollution. The role of phenology is suggested by peaks in blood disorders during the breeding season. However, more long-term studies combining indicators of river health at the individual and community scales are needed to fully assess the ecological risk of recycled water in this river. These studies will also help to develop blood tests as reliable health indicators in wild fish populations.

J	Kumari, J; Paul, B				Kumari, Juli; Paul, Biswajit			Geochemical and environmental risk assessment of hazardous elements in river sediment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The peninsular river Damodar is the life line of eastern India, facing critical pollution problems due to sewage, industrial waste disposal as well as coal mining along the river valley. Sediment samples were collected and analyzed for various geochemical phases of hazardous elements, and associated environmental risks were evaluated. This paper provides chemical fractionation of nine (Cd, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Pb, Co, Cr, Fe) elements from river sediment by using Tessier five step sequential extraction method. The study was aimed (1) to understand dynamics and mobility of elements in different geochemical fractions; (2) to evaluate bioavailability and ecological risk of these elements by RAC; and (3) to identify contaminated and uncontaminated sites by using cluster analysis. The result of the study revealed maximum bioavailable fraction was that of Cd. Bioavailable elements in studied sediment followed the order Cd (23.76%) > Mn (14.19%) > Zn (13.54%) > Ni (12.82%) > Cu (7.12%) > Pb (7.05%) > Co (6.09%) > Fe (4.98%) > Cr (2.03%). Maximum % of the reducible fraction was found for Fe (14.38%) while in organic fraction Cu (11.25%) was maximum. Residual fraction dominates in all elements with a maximum percentage of 83.85% for Co. Risk assessment by RAC reveals that the river was under medium risk due to Cd, Mn, Zn and Ni while at low risk for rest of the elements. Cluster analysis shows that three sampling sites were highly contaminated, three were moderately contaminated and six were contaminated while only one site was uncontaminated.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	21							731	10.1007/s12665-017-7073-z								WOS:000414335900010						
J	Sener, S; Karakus, M				Sener, Sehnaz; Karakus, Murat			Investigating water quality and arsenic contamination in drinking water resources in the Tavsanli District (Kutahya, Western Turkey)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Arsenic is a natural component of the earth's crust, and it is transported into surface water and groundwater through the dissolution of rocks, minerals and ores. In addition, arsenic leaching processes contaminate water sources and this geogenic arsenic contamination causes significant water quality problems in many parts of the world. In this study, water quality, arsenic contamination and human health risks of drinking water resources in the Tavsanli District were determined and the origins were discussed. For this purpose, geological and hydrogeological properties were investigated. In situ measurements and chemical analyses were carried out on water samples taken from drinking water sources such as wells, springs and surface waters for hydrogeochemical studies. According to the obtained results, water resources are Ca-Mg-HCO3, Mg-HCO3 and Na-HCO3 type. Total As (AsT) concentration of the water samples sometimes exceeds the permissible limit given by the TSI-266 (Standards for drinking waters, Turkish Standards Institution, Ankara, 2005) and WHO (Guidelines for drinking-water quality, World Health Organization, Geneva, 2008) for drinking water. H3AsO30 and HAsO42- are dominant arsenic species in groundwater and surface water, respectively. Typically high total arsenic concentrations can be found in regions characterized by magmatic rocks. In addition, As concentrations in surface waters were found to be higher than in groundwater in the region, due to the anthropogenic influence of mining activities in the region.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				NOV	2017	76	21							750	10.1007/s12665-017-7101-z								WOS:000414335900028						
J	Nygren, NA; Tapio, P; Horppila, J				Nygren, Nina A.; Tapio, Petri; Horppila, Jukka			Will the Oxygen-Phosphorus Paradigm Persist? - Expert Views of the Future of Management and Restoration of Eutrophic Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In the age of climate change, the demand and lack of pure water challenges many communities. Substantial amount of effort is put in every year to manage and restore degraded lakes while the long-term effects of those efforts are only poorly known or monitored. Oxygenation, or aeration, is used extensively for the restoration of eutrophic lakes, although many studies question whether this process improves the status of the lakes in the long-term. The desired effect of oxygenation is based on paradigmatic theories that, in the light of recent literature, might not be adequate when long-term improvements are sought. This article canvasses expert views on the feasibility of the 'oxygen-phosphorus paradigm' as well as the future of the management and restoration of eutrophic lakes, based on an international, two-rounded, expert panel survey (Delphi study), employing 200 freshwater experts from 33 nationalities, contacted at three conferences on the topic. The conclusion is that the oxygen-phosphorus paradigm seems to be rather persistent. The experts considered oxygenation to be a valid short-term lake restoration method, but not without harmful side-effects. In addition, experts' low level of trust in the adequacy of the scientific knowledge on the effects of restorations and in the use of the scientific knowledge as a basis of choice of restoration methods, could be signs of a paradigm shift towards an outlook emphasizing more effective catchment management over short-term restorations. The expert panel also anticipated that reducing external nutrient loads from both point and diffuse sources will succeed in the future.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2017	60	5					947	960		10.1007/s00267-017-0919-z								WOS:000412755900011	28799010

Midwestern US Farmers Perceive Crop Advisers as Conduits of Information on Agricultural Conservation Practices	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Nonpoint source pollution from agricultural land uses continues to pose one of the most significant threats to water quality in the US, with measurable impacts across local, regional, and national scales. The impact and the influence of targeted conservation efforts are directly related to the degree to which farmers are familiar with and trust the entities providing the information and/or outreach. Recent research suggests that farmers consistently rank independent and retail-affiliated crop advisers as among the most trusted and influential sources for agronomic information, but little is understood about whether farmers are willing to receive advice from crop advisers on the use of practices that conserve soil and water, and, if so, whether crop advisers will be perceived as influential. We present survey data from farmers (n = 1461) in Michigan's Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron) watershed to explore these questions. Results suggest that farmers view crop advisers as trustworthy sources of information about conservation, and influential on management practices that have large conservation implications. We discuss these results, along with perceived barriers and opportunities to crop advisers partnering with traditional conservation agencies to enhance the impact of voluntary conservation programs.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2017	60	5					974	988		10.1007/s00267-017-0927-z								WOS:000412755900013	28856397

The framework includes data quality assurance and quality control processes, automated kriging interpolation along undulating paths, and local hotspot and cluster analyses. These methods are implemented in an interactive Web application developed using the Shiny package in the R programming environment to support near-real time analysis along with 2-and 3-D visualizations. The approach is demonstrated using historical sampling data from an undulating vehicle deployed at three rivermouth sites in Lake Michigan during 2011. The normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of the interpolation averages approximately 10% in 3-fold cross validation. The results show that the framework can be used to track river plume dynamics and provide insights on mixing, which could be related to wind and seiche events. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A management-oriented water quality model for data scarce catchments	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Due to the degeneration of water quality globally, water quality models could increasingly be utilised within water resource management. However, a lack of observed data as well as financial resources often constrain the number of potential water quality models that could practically be utilised. This study presents the Water Quality Systems Assessment Model (WQSAM). WQSAM directly utilises flow data generated by systems models to drive water quality simulations. The model subscribes to requisite simplicity by constraining the number of variables simulated as well as the processes represented to only those most important to water quality management, in this case, nutrients and salinity. The model application to the upper Olifants River catchment in South Africa is described. WQSAM was able to use the limited observed data to simulate representative frequency distributions of water quality, and the approach used within WQSAM was shown to be suitable for application to data scarce catchments.

These models have guided agricultural management by simulating effects of landscape structure, farming system changes and their spatial arrangement on stream water quality. Such models generate many intermediate results that should be managed, analyzed and transformed into usable information. We describe a data warehouse (N-Catch) built to store and analyze simulation data from the spatially distributed agro-hydrological model TNT2. We present scientific challenges to and tools for building data warehouses and describe the three dimensions of N-Catch: space, time and an original hierarchical description of cropping systems. We show how to use OLAP to explore and extract all kinds of useful high-level information by aggregating the data along these three dimensions and how to facilitate exploration of the spatial dimension by coupling N-Catch with GIS. Such tool constitutes an efficient interface between science and society, simulation remaining a research activity, exploration of the results becoming an easy task accessible for a large audience.

J	Choudhury, D; Gupta, S				Choudhury, Dharitri; Gupta, Susmita			Impact of waste dump on surface water quality and aquatic insect diversity of Deepor Beel (Ramsar site), Assam, North-east India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water and aquatic insects were collected seasonally from site 1, the low-lying area of the dump near Deepor Beel, and from sites 2 and 3 of the main wetland and analysed. While dissolved oxygen (DO) increased from site 1 to site 3 in each season, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solid (TDS), total alkalinity (TA) and free CO2 (F-CO2) decreased. Pb and Cd were found to exceed the limits set for drinking water in all the sites and seasons. Species richness (SpR) was found highest (23) at site 2 and lowest (14) at site 1. Sensitive species was absent. The Shannon (H') values at site 1 were < 1 while at sites 2 and 3 were > 1 in most of the seasons. Biological monitoring scores (Biological Monitoring Working Party and Stream Invertebrate Grade Number-Average Level) in different sites and seasons inferred severely poor to moderate water quality. At site 1, significant negative correlations were seen for Pb and Cr with SpR while Ni and Cu with insect density (ID). At site 2, TA had highly significant positive correlations with SpR and ID while Cu showed negative correlation with SpR. At site 3, ID had significant negative relationships with air temperature, water temperature, depth, TA, F-CO2, PO43- and Cr. Canonical correspondence analysis triplot has clearly separated site 1 associated with tolerant species and highly influenced by TA, TDS, EC, F-CO2, Cr, Ni, Cd and Zn confirming high anthropogenic activities on that site. Tolerant and semitolerant species were present at site 2 (influenced by depth and transparency) and site 3 (influenced by Pb and WT) both. Results of this study discerned that the dump site is the point source of pollution.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							540	10.1007/s10661-017-6233-7								WOS:000413605000010	28986729

Water quality issues are also a concern and have worsened with the recent intensification of urbanization and industrialization. In this study, violations to water quality standards established by local legislation were calculated as a percentage for 26 selected parameters over a monitoring period of 14 years. The violation percentages were analyzed spatially using the Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by multiple comparison analysis. Temporal analysis was performed using the Mann-Kendall test and Spearman correlation. Some parameters could be identified as cause for concern due to high violation levels, such as the fecal coliform indicator (FCI) and phosphorus-both related to domestic and effluent disposal without treatment or with insufficient treatment-and color, turbidity, manganese, and total suspended solids-which can be affected by erosive processes of natural and anthropogenic causes. The study found that these violations are concentrated in the most urbanized and industrialized areas of the basin. Some metallic parameters, such as iron and arsenic violations, may be related to mining activities in the rich soil of the Iron Quadrangle area located within the Minas Gerais State. Trend analysis results indicated that most monitoring stations did not have significant modification (elevation or reduction) trends over time, which, together with the high violation percentages, might indicate the maintenance of a scenario of constant pressure upon water resources, in particular in those more urbanized areas.

Models for estimation of the presence of non-regulated disinfection by-products in small drinking water systems	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Among all the organic disinfection by-products (DBPs), only trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) are regulated in drinking water, while most DBPs are not. Very little information exists on the occurrence of non-regulated DBPs, particularly in small water systems (SWS). Paradoxically, SWS are more vulnerable to DBPs because of a low capacity to implement adequate treatment technologies to remove DBP precursors. Since DBP analyses are expensive, usually SWS have difficulties to implement a rigorous characterization of these contaminants. The purpose of this study was to estimate non-regulated DBP levels in SWS from easy measurements of relevant parameters regularly monitored. Since no information on non-regulated DBPs in SWS was available, a sampling program was carried out in 25 SWS in two provinces of Canada. Five DBP families were investigated: THMs, HAAs, haloacetonitriles (HANs), halonitromethanes (HNMs), and haloketones (HKs). Multivariate linear mixed regression models were developed to estimate HAN, HK, and HNM levels from water quality characteristics in the water treatment plant, concentrations of regulated DBPs, and residual disinfectant levels. The models obtained have a good explanatory capacity since R-2 varies from 0.77 to 0.91 according to compounds and conditions for application (season and type of treatment). Model validation with an independent database suggested their ability for generalization in similar SWS in North America.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							577	10.1007/s10661-017-6296-5								WOS:000413605000047	29063230					
J	Haider, H				Haider, Husnain			Performance assessment framework for groundwater treatment plants in Arid Environments: a case of Buraydah, Saudi Arabia	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In arid environmental regions, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), each and every drop of groundwater needs to be efficiently utilized to meet growing water demands. Ground water treatment plants (WTPs) are regularly being monitored by the municipalities to ensure safe water supply. However, analyzing large data to assess the performance of a WTP has always been a daunting task for plant's management. Most of existing performance assessment frameworks were developed for surface WTPs. In this research, an assessment framework using performance-based water quality indices (PWQI) is developed to facilitate senior management of ground WTPs for effective decisionmaking. The framework is also implemented on a case study of Buraydah, Qassim, Saudi Arabia. Five most important water quality parameters (WQPs) have been selected to assess the performance of different components of the WTP, including raw water, pre-treatment, ultrafiltration, sand filtration, reverse osmosis, and final product. Depending on the relative importance ofWQPs for a specific treatment process, different weighting schemes have been developed for each treatment process using fuzzy analytical hierarchical process (FAHP) to address the possible uncertainties in data and imprecision in expert opinion. Subsequently, fuzzy weighted sum method (FWSM) is employed to develop aggregated PWQI for assessing average monthly performance during the year 2016. Study results show that all the units consistently performed Bhigh,<^> and the plant is meeting drinking water quality standards throughout the year. Hypothetical scenario analysis revealed robustness of the developed framework by showing lacking performance in case failure of different units.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							544	10.1007/s10661-017-6271-1								WOS:000413605000014	28988396

Multi-criteria evaluation of hydro-geological and anthropogenic parameters for the groundwater vulnerability assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Groundwater contamination assessment is a challenging task due to inherent complex dynamisms associated with the groundwater. DRASTIC is a very widely used rapid regional tool for the assessment of vulnerability of groundwater to contamination. DRASTIC has many lacunas in the form of subjectivities associated with weights and ratings of its hydrogeological parameters, and, therefore, the accuracy of the DRASTIC-based vulnerability map is questioned. The present study demonstrates the optimisation of the DRASTIC parameters along with a scientific consideration to the anthropogenic factors causing groundwater contamination. The resulting scientific consistent weights and ratings to DRASTIC parameters assist in the development of a very precise groundwater vulnerability map highlighting different zones of different gravity of contamination. One of the most important aspects of this study is that we have considered the impact of vadose zone in a very comprehensive manner by considering every sub-surface layer from the earth surface to the occurrence of groundwater. The study area for our experiment is Fatehgarh Sahib district of Punjab which is facing several groundwater issues.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							564	10.1007/s10661-017-6267-x								WOS:000413605000034	29035418

Relative performance of three stream bed stability indices as indicators of stream health	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Bed stability is an important stream habitat attribute because it affects geomorphology and biotic communities. Natural resource managers desire indices of bed stability that can be used under a wide range of geomorphic conditions, are biologically meaningful, and are easily incorporated into sampling protocols. To eliminate potential bias due to presence of instream wood and increase precision of stability values, we modified a stream bed instability index (ISI) to include measurements of bankfull depth (dbf) and median particle diameter (D-50) only in riffles and increased the pebble count to decrease variability (i.e., increase precision) in D-50. The new riffle-based instability index (RISI) was compared to two established indices: ISI and the riffle stability index (RSI). RISI and ISI were strongly associated with each other but neither was closely associated with RSI. RISI and ISI were closely associated with both a diatom-and two macrovertebrate-based stream health indices, but RSI was only weakly associated with the macroinvertebrate indices. Unexpectedly, precision of D50 did not differ between RISI and ISI. Results suggest that RISI is a viable alternative to both ISI and RSI for evaluating bed stability in multiple stream types. With few data requirements and a simple protocol, RISI may also better conform to riffle-based sampling methods used by some water quality practitioners.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							563	10.1007/s10661-017-6291-x								WOS:000413605000033	29035417

High-frequency measurements reveal spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved organic matter in an urban water conveyance	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Stormwater runoff in urban areas can contribute high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to receiving waters, potentially causing impairment to the aquatic ecosystem of urban streams and downstream water bodies. Compositional changes in DOM due to storm events in forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes have been well studied, but in situ sensors have not been widely applied to monitor stormwater contributions in urbanized areas, leaving the spatial and temporal characteristics of DOM within these systems poorly understood. We deployed fluorescent DOM (FDOM) sensors at upstream and downstream locations within a study reach to characterize the spatial and temporal changes in DOM quantity and sources within an urban water conveyance that receives stormwater runoff. Baseflow FDOM decreased over the summer season as seasonal flows upstream transported less DOM. FDOM fluctuated diurnally, the amplitude of which also declined as the summer season progressed. During storms, FDOM concentrations were rapidly elevated to values orders of magnitude greater than baseflow measurements, with greater concentrations at the downstream monitoring site, revealing high contributions from stormwater outfalls between the two locations. Observations from custom, in situ fluorometers resembled results obtained using laboratory methods for identifying DOM source material and indicated that DOM transitioned to a more microbially derived composition as the summer season progressed, while stormwater contributions contributed DOM from terrestrial sources. Deployment of a mobile sensing platform during varying flow conditions captured spatial changes in DOM concentration and composition and revealed contributions of DOM from outfalls during stormflows that would have otherwise been unobserved.

It has received much attention due to the ecological problems caused by rapid expansion in recent years. The objective of this paper was to monitor the mining area and its surrounding land cover over the period 1976-2016 utilizing Landsat images, and the network structure of land cover changes was determined to visualize the relationships and pattern of the mining-induced land cover changes. In addition, the responses of the surrounding landscape pattern were analysed by constructing gradient transects. The results show that the mining area was increasing in size, especially after 2000 increased by 71.68 km(2)), and this caused shrinkage of the surrounding lands, including alpine meadow wet-land (53.44 km(2)), alpine meadow (6.28 km(2)) and water (6.24 km(2)). The network structure of the mining area revealed the changes in lands surrounding the mining area. The impact of mining development on landscape patterns was mainly distributed within a range of 16 km. Alpine meadow wetland was most affected in Juhugeng, while alpine meadow was most affected in Jiangcang. The results of this study provide a reference for the ecological assessment and restoration of the Muli coal mine land.

J	Shi, RG; Xu, MM; Liu, AF; Tian, Y; Zhao, ZS				Shi, Rongguang; Xu, Mengmeng; Liu, Aifeng; Tian, Yong; Zhao, Zongshan			Characteristics of PAHs in farmland soil and rainfall runoff in Tianjin, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Rainfall runoff can remove certain amounts of pollutants from contaminated farmland soil and result in a decline in water quality. However, the leaching behaviors of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with rainfall have been rarely reported due to wide variations in the soil compositions, rainfall conditions, and sources of soil PAHs in complex farmland ecosystems. In this paper, the levels, spatial distributions, and composition profiles of PAHs in 30 farmland soil samples and 49 rainfall-runoff samples from the Tianjin region in 2012 were studied to investigate their leaching behaviors caused by rainfall runoff. The contents of the Sigma(16)PAHs ranged from 58.53 to 3137.90 mu g/kg in the soil and 146.58 to 3636.59 mu g/L in the runoff. In total, most of the soil sampling sites (23 of 30) were contaminated, and biomass and petroleum combustion were proposed as the main sources of the soil PAHs. Both the spatial distributions of the soil and the runoff PAHs show a decreasing trend moving away from the downtown, which suggested that the leaching behaviors of PAHs in a larger region during rainfall may be mainly affected by the compounds themselves. In addition, 4- and 5-ring PAHs are the dominant components in farmland soil and 3- and 4-ring PAHs dominate the runoff. Comparisons of the PAH pairs and enrichment ratios showed that acenaphthylene, acenaphthene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, and fluoranthene were more easily transferred into water systems from soil than benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[ghi]perylene, and indeno[123-cd]pyrene, which indicated that PAHs with low molecular weight are preferentially dissolved due to their higher solubility compared to those with high molecular weight.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							558	10.1007/s10661-017-6290-y								WOS:000413605000028	29032441

Potential pollutants from various sources are deteriorating drinking water quality in different seasons, and associated health risks were not clearly known. We determined seasonal and spatial variations of urban drinking water characteristics and associated health risks in Agaro, Jimma, and Metu towns, Southwest Ethiopia. Seventy-two samples were collected during dry and rainy seasons of 2014 and 2015. The majority (87.4%) of physicochemical parameters was found within the recommended limits. However, free residual chlorine in Jimma and Agaro town water sources was lower than the recommended limit and negatively correlated with total and fecal coliform counts (r = -0.585 and -0.638). Statistically significant differences were observed at pH, turbidity, and total coliform between dry and rainy seasons (p < 0.05). A Kruskal-Wallis H test revealed a statistically significant difference in electrical conductivity, total hardness, fluoride, iron, and fecal coliform across the study towns (p < 0.05). The Agaro town water source was the highest in fluoride concentration (3.15 mg/l). The daily exposure level for high fluoride concentration in Agaro town was estimated between 0.19 and 0.41 mg/kg day, and the average cumulative hazard index of fluoride was > 3.13 for all age groups. Water quality variations were observed in all conventional water treatment systems in the rainy season, and further research should focus on its optimization to safeguard the public.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				NOV	2017	189	11							569	10.1007/s10661-017-6277-8								WOS:000413605000039	29043452

In this study, the profiling of ARGs was investigated using high-throughput qPCR from water samples of 13 catchment areas in East Tiaoxi River, China. High prevalence of ARG5 indicated significant antibiotic resistance pollution in the research area (absolute abundance: 6.1 x 10(8) -2.1 x 10(10) copies/L; relative abundance: 0.033-0.158 copies/cell). Conventional water qualities (COD, TN, TP, NH3-N), bacterial communities and mobile gene elements (MGEs) were detected and analyzed as factors of ARGs shift. Nutrient and MGEs showed positive correlation with most ARGs (P < 0.05) and bacteria community was identified as the key contributing factor driving ARGs alteration. With the land use study and field investigation, country area, especially arable, was expected as a high spot for ARGs shift and pathogen breeding. Comparing to environmental background, promotion of ARGs and marked shift of bacterial community were observed in country and urban city areas, indicating that human activities may lead to the spread of ARGs. Analysis of factors affecting ARG5 in this study may shed new light on the mechanism of the maintenance and propagation of ARGs in urban rivers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Time-averaged concentrations are effective for predicting chronic toxicity of varying copper pulse exposures for two freshwater green algae species	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Intermittent, fluctuating and pulsed contaminant discharges may result in organisms receiving highly variable contaminant exposures. This study investigated the effects of dissolved copper pulse concentration and exposure duration on the toxicity to two freshwater green algae species. The effects of single copper pulses of between 1 and 48 h duration and continuous exposures (72 h) on growth rate inhibition of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chlorella sp. were compared on a time-averaged concentration (TAC) basis. Relationships were then derived between the exposure concentration and duration required to elicit different levels of toxicity expressed as inhibition concentration (IC). Continuous exposure IC50's of 3.0 and 1.9 mu g/L were measured on a TAC basis for P. subcapitata and Chlorella sp., respectively. Algal growth rates generally recovered to control levels within 24-48 h of the copper pulse removal, with some treatments exhibiting significantly (p < 0.05) higher rates of cell division than controls in this recovery period. For both algae, when exposed to treatments with equivalent TACs, the continuous exposure elicited similar or slightly greater growth rate inhibition than the pulsed exposures. To elicit equivalent inhibition, the exposure concentration increased as the exposure duration decreased, and power models fitted this relationship reasonably well for both species. Water quality guideline values (WQGVs) are predominantly derived using data from continuous exposure toxicity bioassays, despite intermittent contaminant exposures often occurring in aquatic systems. The results indicate the WQGV for copper may be relaxed for pulsed exposures by a factor less than or equivalent to the TAC and still achieve a protection to these sensitive algae species.

Levels of Metals Pb, Mn, Fe in the Period 2006-2007 in the Surface Water and Groundwater of Alfeios Catchment, Greece	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												The aim of the present paper was to evaluate the concentration of heavy metals (lead, manganese and iron) in surface water and groundwater in Alfeios River Basin in the period 2006-2007. Four seasonal sampling campaigns were conducted in 2006 and three campaigns in 2007. At least eleven sampling sites were selected across the main river and its major tributaries, Enipeus, Kladheos, Selinous, Erymanthos, Ladhon and Lousios. At each station, in situ measurements were performed and samples of water were taken for laboratory analysis. Furthermore, in situ measurements were conducted and samples of water were collected from wells and boreholes (drills) in the area near the river to assess the interaction between surface water and groundwater. The mean Pb concentrations in surface waters were found lower than the limit value of 7.2 mu g/L in inland waters. The origin of the selected heavy metals is rather natural in the Alfeios River basin, with the exception of the anthropogenic contributions of Pb from the Lousios River catchment and of Fe from the Megalopolis' mine. These data could be useful for the evaluation of the water quality, which is required by the implementation of the Alfeios River Basin Management Plan.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				NOV	2017	4			1			S23	S34		10.1007/s40710-017-0233-z								WOS:000414369000003

Permeable Biosorbent Barrier for Wastewater Remediation	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Chromium is one of the heavy metals that significantly affect water quality in Mongolia. The present study is focused on the remediation of surface water contaminated with chromium (III) by a permeable barrier in order to prevent sediment pollution. The adsorption capacity of the selected materials (13X zeolite and vermiculite) was investigated at different sorbent dosages, pH and initial Cr(III) concentration. The equilibrium adsorption studies showed that vermiculite has a higher Cr(III) removal efficiency in comparison with 13X zeolite. A fungal isolate obtained from the sediment samples collected near Tuul River (Mongolia) was selected from enriched Luria-Bertani medium, showing a good performance for Cr(III) removal (78.2% for an initial concentration of 50 mg/L). The fungal isolate was genetically typed by DNA sequencing and was identified as belonging to the Alternaria alternata species. 13X zeolite showed the best performance for Cr removal in the permeable barrier assays compared to vermiculite, achieving a total removal of 96% and a global uptake of 2.49 mg/g. After 13 days of operation none of the barriers reached saturation with chromium.

Over the last decades, a number of water quality indices (WQI) has been created and applied towards this goal. In most cases, the WQI is applied in characterizing the overall quality of a water system by integrating all available data, regardless of sampling station and time. This approach may result in misleading interpretation of data and wrong or ineffective policy responses to water quality deterioration. The present study investigates whether this approach is the most appropriate or if it is necessary to take into consideration the water quality of each individual sampling. Two natural lakes in Greece were chosen as case studies and an alternative to National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index was applied at each sampling site and at the overall water body. The use of the water quality index presented in this study is proved to be good practice in evaluating and characterizing the water quality of lakes as it can be easily adjusted to local specific conditions. The physico-chemical characterization of an aquatic system by water quality indices is preferable to be made only if the water quality indices, calculated for each individual sampling site, show homogeneity. The identification of the considered critical parameters, which significantly affect the quality of a water body, is of high importance in order to reduce the monitoring cost without influencing the reliability of the final result.

J	Ochoo, B; Valcour, J; Sarkar, A				Ochoo, Benjamin; Valcour, James; Sarkar, Atanu			Association between perceptions of public drinking water quality and actual drinking water quality: A community-based exploratory study in Newfoundland (Canada)	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Studying public perception on drinking water quality is crucial for managing of water resources, generation of water quality standards, and surveillance of the drinking-water quality. However, in policy discourse, the reliability of public perception concerning drinking water quality and associated health risks is questionable. Does the public perception of water quality equate with the actual water quality? We investigated public perceptions of water quality and the perceived health risks and associated with the actual quality of public water supplies in the same communities. The study was conducted in 45 communities of Newfoundland (Canada) in 2012. First, a telephone survey of 100 households was conducted to examine public perceptions of drinking water quality of their respective public sources. Then we extracted public water quality reports of the same communities (1988-2011) from the provincial government's water resources portal. These reports contained the analysis of 2091 water samples, including levels of Disinfection By-Products (DBPs), nutrients, metals, ions and physical parameters. The reports showed that colour, manganese, total dissolved solids, iron, turbidity, and DBPs were the major detected parameters in the public water. However, the majority of the respondents (> 56%) were either completely satisfied or very satisfied with the quality of drinking water. Older, higher educated and high income group respondents were more satisfied with water quality than the younger, less educated and low-income group respondents. The study showed that there was no association with public satisfaction level and actual water quality of the respective communities. Even, in the communities, supplied by the same water system, the respondents had differences in opinion. Despite the effort by the provincial government to make the water-test results available on its website for years, the study showed existing disconnectedness between public perception of drinking water quality and actual quality. We had little scope to explore the possible explanations, and hence further studies are required to verify the age, gender educational status and income differential about the satisfaction of public service like water supply.																	0013-9351	1096-0953				NOV	2017	159						435	443		10.1016/j.envres.2017.08.019								WOS:000413280500049	28858757

In this study, the response of anaerobic sludge to the presence of Bi2WO6 nano-particles (NPs) was investigated in the anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). As the concentration of Bi2WO6 in the reactor was controlled around 1 mg/L, there was no significant difference in effluent water quality or bacterial activities before and after NP exposure, partially due to the microbial-induced NP aggregation and stable complex formation. However, with the increasing dosage of Bi2WO6 from 5 to 40 mg/L, great influences on the AnMBR performance were observed, including the reduction of COD removal efficiency, inhibition of the mechanization step, increased production of soluble microbial products, and enhanced secretion of extracellular polymer substrates. Additional investigation with high-throughput sequencing was conducted, clearly demonstrating that Bi2WO6 NPs induced changes in the bacterial community.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	31					24261	24271		10.1007/s11356-017-0022-2								WOS:000413649700019	28889223

Cuprous oxide was aerially applied to three catchments of Pinus radiata of varying age classes in the central North Island of New Zealand. Copper was monitored in stream water and sediments prior to and for 1 month after application. Copper deposits collected from tracer plates deployed above the water surface along the stream channels within the treated areas at each site ranged from 13 to 406 ppm. Lowest concentrations occurred above small stream channels with dense overhead riparian vegetation. Peak copper concentrations in stream water across the three sites ranged from 28 to 60 mu g L-1 and were below the analytical detection limit within hours. Copper concentrations were higher and persisted for longer in stream sediment (range 1.7-6.1 mg kg(-1), sampled at two sites only). Copper concentrations in sediments were below environmental guidelines. Copper concentrations in water and sediment indicated a low risk to aquatic organisms based on the exposure times to the concentrations measured in this study.

The effects of a chronic exposure to such discharges are complex to understand due to the combined effects of environmental physico-chemical parameters (e.g., high salinity) and different pollutants that can modulate the physiological responses of this species to stress. In this context, we assessed the biological effects in a marine species P. rustica, by a multibiomarker approach that provided information on the health status of organisms in response to such an environmental stress. We measured biomarkers in the whole soft tissues of limpets as indicators of neurotoxicity (AChE activity), oxidative stress (CAT, SOD, GR, and GPx activities), biotransformation (GST), oxidative damage (LPO through TBARS levels), and genotoxicity (CSP 3-like activity). In parallel, hydrological parameters were measured in the Bay of Oran, at four selected sites: site H considered as a "hotspot," located at Bousfer desalination plant; two other sites E and W, at the east and the west of H respectively; finally, site R "reference" located in Madragh, which is considered as a remote clean site. Our analyses revealed that the activities of antioxidant defense enzymes reached the highest levels in P. rustica collected from site H. The activation of antioxidant defense system in these organisms translated the alteration of their status health, reflecting a level of environmental disruption generated by the desalination plant brine discharges and the high salinity in this area. We also observed that the tissues of limpets collected from site H as well as the two other sites, E and W, had undergone molecular damage, confirmed by the high levels of CSP 3-like activity. This damage resulted from chronic exposure to environmental conditions, potentially genotoxic, due to the desalination plant discharges. The present results indicate the adverse impact of brine effluents from desalination plants on marine fauna and suggest the need for a more consistent approach to environmental management of brine discharges.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	31					24521	24532		10.1007/s11356-017-0081-4								WOS:000413649700041	28900807

The receiving waters are frequently polluted by the initial stormwater from the separate stormwater system and the wastewater from sewage pipes through stormwater pipes. Consequently, calculating the intercepted runoff depth has become a problem that must be resolved immediately for initial stormwater pollution management. The accurate calculation of intercepted runoff depth provides a solid foundation for selecting the appropriate size of intercepting facilities in drainage and interception projects. This study establishes a separate stormwater system for the Yishan Building watershed of Fuzhou City using the InfoWorks Integrated Catchment Management (InfoWorks ICM), which can predict the stormwater flow velocity and the flow of discharge outlet after each rainfall. The intercepted runoff depth is calculated from the stormwater quality and environmental capacity of the receiving waters. The average intercepted runoff depth from six rainfall events is calculated as 4.1 mm based on stormwater quality. The average intercepted runoff depth from six rainfall events is calculated as 4.4 mm based on the environmental capacity of the receiving waters. The intercepted runoff depth differs when calculated from various aspects. The selection of the intercepted runoff depth depends on the goal of water quality control, the self-purification capacity of the water bodies, and other factors of the region.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				NOV	2017	24	31					24681	24689		10.1007/s11356-017-9800-0								WOS:000413649700055	28913681

The evolving role of government in the adaptive governance of freshwater social-ecological systems in the western US	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												The role of government within the western United States is shifting, as government command and control policies inadequately address freshwater management complexity. As growing human and environmental needs intensify water resource governance challenges, government is increasingly combining existing regulatory structures with collaborative exchange mechanisms, such as Investments in Watershed Services (IWS). We explored the changing role of government through IWS in the west, a region that holds one of the highest concentrations of IWS globally. Through a survey, we collected and analysed information on the influence of government in IWS. All 48 identified IWS contained some form of government presence: as program participants, regulation drivers, or land managers, and in both voluntary and regulatory contexts. Government influence on IWS varies across water issue (in-stream flow, water quality, and source water protection), and level of government (local, state and federal). Our work demonstrates how the government is expanding its roles and responsibilities, moving beyond historic command and control roles to support and facilitate new mechanisms. Although most government presence in early IWS was regulatory, local, state and federal governments are increasingly participating directly in IWS. State government have expanded regulatory structures for instream flow, and federal and local government are collaborating in source water protection. We found that government is reactionary, pragmatic, and incremental in their responses to water management. Our work provides the first government-specific analysis of IWS in the western US, and provides insights into the evolving role of government in adaptive governance of freshwater resources.

This study developed an online analytical technique-high-performance liquid chromatography followed by photochemical reaction and chemiluminescence detection (HPLCPR-CL)-for determination of the concentration of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and three other N-nitrosamines. Its feasibility for near real-time analysis was evaluated by analyzing an ultrafiltration (UF)-treated wastewater before and after a pilotscale reverse osmosis (RO) treatment system. The online instrument with a method detection limit of 0.3-2.7 ng L-1 requires a direct injection (i.e., no sample pre-concentration) of only 20-200 mu L sample volume for the determination of N-nitrosamine concentrations every 20 min. NDMA concentrations in UF-treated wastewater were successfully monitored in a range of 50-200 ng L-1 over the course of 24 h. Likewise, NDMA concentrations in RO permeate ranged from 26-81 ng L-1 over the course of 48 h. The online monitor was capable of recording variations in N-nitrosamine concentration in RO permeate that occurred following changes in feedwater concentration and temperature. This study demonstrates the potential for online water quality assurance via direct measurement of trace levels of organic contaminants, which is highly relevant to the implementation of potable reuse.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				NOV 1	2017	3	6					1032	1036		10.1039/c7ew00296c								WOS:000413934800004

Peracetic acid disinfection kinetics for combined sewer overflows: indicator organisms, antibiotic resistance genes, and microbial community	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) degrade water quality and end-of-pipe treatment is one potential solution for retrofitting this outdated infrastructure. The goal of this research was to evaluate peracetic acid (PAA) as a disinfectant for CSOs using viability based molecular methods for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), indicator organism marker gene BacHum, and 16S rRNA genes. Simulated CSO effluent was prepared using 23-40% wastewater, representing the higher end of the range of wastewater concentrations reported in CSO effluent. PAA residual following disinfection was greatest for samples with the lowest initial COD. Treatment of simulated CSO effluent (23% wastewater) with 100 mg min L-1 PAA (5 mg L-1 PAA, 20 min) was needed to reduce viable cell sul1, tet(G), and BacHum (1.0 +/- 0.63-3.2 +/- 0.25- log) while 25 to 50 mg min L-1 PAA (5 mg L-1 PAA, 5-10 min) was needed to reduce viable cell loads (0.62 +/- 0.56-1.6 +/- 0.08log) in 40% wastewater from a different municipal treatment plant. Increasing contact time after the initial decrease in viable cell gene copies did not significantly improve treatment. A much greater applied Ct of 1200 mg min L-1 PAA (20 mg L-1 PAA, 60 min) was required for significant log reduction of 16S rRNA genes (3.29 +/- 0.13-log). No significant losses of mexB were observed during the study. Data were fitted to a Chick-Watson model and resulting inactivation constants for sul1 and tet(G) > BacHum > 16S rRNA. Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene indicated the initial viable and total microbial communities were distinct and that treatment with PAA resulted in marked increases of the relative abundance of select phyla, particularly Clostridia which increased by 1-1.5 orders of magnitude. Results confirm that membrane disruption is a mechanism for PAA disinfection and further treatment is needed to reduce total ARGs in CSO effluent.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				NOV 1	2017	3	6					1061	1072		10.1039/c7ew00184c								WOS:000413934800008	29333272

Development and experimental validation of the composition and treatability of a new synthetic bathroom greywater (SynGrey)	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Bathroom greywater, including bathing and handwashing wastewater, can be reused for toilet flushing to reduce 35% of residential water demand. Despite these potential savings, greywater reuse is underutilized and the development of innovative treatment technologies is impeded by a lack of validated synthetic recipes to support laboratory-scale experimentation. The objective of this work was to develop and validate a new, representative synthetic bathroom greywater to enable reproducible and translatable treatment studies. A literature review compiled data from 49 real bathroom greywaters, which was used to set 20 water quality criteria for a synthetic recipe. A new synthetic greywater - SynGrey - was developed to match real bathroom greywater composition across all criteria and was found to be more representative of real greywater than existing recipes. SynGrey's validity was evaluated by comparing its treatability against a real bathroom greywater including via chlorination, aerobic biodegradation, adsorption, and coagulation. Total chlorine residuals were statistically similar between SynGrey and the real bathroom greywater, but doses were an order of magnitude higher than for drinking water. The readily biodegradable fraction of total chemical oxygen demand was about 40% for both greywaters. The dissolved organic carbon percent removal by activated carbon was similar between SynGrey and the real greywater (+/- 14%). Alum coagulation achieved comparable effluent turbidity, but SynGrey had a much more narrow dose curve, and coagulation achieved substantially greater total organic carbon removal from the real greywater. SynGrey represents a superior synthetic recipe for laboratory-scale experimentation to facilitate the evaluation, selection, and optimization of greywater reuse technologies.

ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												With the aim to refine water analysis in fish bioconcentration studies, automated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) was used as an alternative approach to conventional solvent extraction (liquid-liquid extraction [LLE]) for the extraction of 3 hydrophobic organic chemicals (HOCs; log K-OW 5.5-7.8) from flow-through studies with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The results showed that total concentrations extracted by SPME combined with internal standards and LLE are equal. The results further verify the possibility of simultaneous extraction of total and freely dissolved HOC concentrations by SPME. Freely dissolved concentrations allow the assessment of sorption and bioavailability of HOCs in bioconcentration studies and their potential impact on resulting bioconcentration factors (BCFs). Reduction in freely dissolved water concentrations can result in an underestimation of BCFs if they are calculated based on total water concentrations. For polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153, a significant increase in BCF value was observed when freely dissolved concentrations were taken into account. However, log BCF values calculated based on freely dissolved concentrations did not correlate linearly with log K-OW values above 5 to 6. This pointed to further influences besides a reduction in freely dissolved water concentrations by sorption to organic matter. The results can aid in assessment of the factors that influence bioconcentration systems and also give important information regarding the possible replacement of LLE by SPME for water analysis of highly HOCs in fish bioconcentration studies.

Development of biotic ligand model-based freshwater aquatic life criteria for lead following us environmental protection agency guidelines	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) current ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) for lead (Pb) in freshwater were developed in 1984. The criteria are adjusted for hardness, but more recent studies have demonstrated that other parameters, especially dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH, have a much stronger influence on Pb bioavailability. These recent studies have been used to support development of a biotic ligand model (BLM) for Pb in freshwater, such that acute and chronic Pb toxicity can be predicted over a wide range of water chemistry conditions. Following USEPA guidelines for AWQC development and using a methodology consistent with that used by the USEPA in developing its recommended BLM-based criteria for copper in 2007, we propose acute and chronic BLM-based AWQC for Pb in freshwater. In addition to the application of the BLM approach that can better account for site-specific Pb bioavailability, the toxicity data sets presented are much more robust than in 1984, and there are now sufficient chronic Pb toxicity data available that use of an acute-to-chronic ratio is no longer necessary. Over a range of North American surface waters with representative water chemistry conditions, proposed acute BLM-based Pb criteria ranged from approximately 20 to 1000g/L and chronic BLM-based Pb criteria ranged from approximately 0.3 to 40g/L. The lowest criteria were for water with low DOC (1.2mg/L), pH (6.7), and hardness (4.3mg/L as CaCO3), whereas the highest criteria were for water with high DOC (9.8mg/L), pH (8.2), and hardness (288mg/L as CaCO3).

Updated species sensitivity distribution evaluations for acute and chronic lead toxicity to saltwater aquatic life	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA's) ambient water quality criteria (AWQC) for lead (Pb) in salt water were developed in 1984. The acute and chronic criteria are 210 and 8.1g/L dissolved Pb, respectively. Because data were limited in 1984, the chronic criterion was derived using an acute-to-chronic ratio, but there are now sufficient toxicity data such that an acute-to-chronic ratio is no longer needed. Based on the data now available, the proposed updated acute and chronic salt water Pb AWQC (following USEPA methods) are 100 and 10 mu g/L, respectively. In the European Union, a chronic salt water predicted no-effect concentration based on the median 5th percentile hazardous concentration (HC5-50) was developed in 2008 for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals program, which forms the basis for deriving chronic environmental quality standards for Pb in European marine waters. The salt water HC5-50 previously derived for Pb was 6.1g/L, whereas the proposed, updated chronic salt water HC5-50 derived following European Union methods is 11.0 mu g/L. Thus, despite differences in derivation methodologies, the proposed AWQC and HC5-50 values are very consistent. Studies evaluating the effect of water quality factors on bioavailability and toxicity of Pb in salt water are limited; the effect of water quality on Pb toxicity in salt water should be considered in future studies.

Effects of nitrogenous wastes on survival of the Barton Springs salamander (Eurycea sosorum)	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The objective of our study was to determine the acute toxicity of 3 common aquatic nitrogenous toxicants to the federally endangered Barton Springs salamander (Eurycea sosorum). Based on our findings, the 96-h median lethal concentrations (96-h LC50) for un-ionized ammonia-N, nitrite-N, and nitrate-N to E. sosorum are 2.0 +/- 0.32, 31.7 +/- 4.02, and 968.5 +/- 150.6mg/L, respectively. These results establish a benchmark for the tolerance of plethodontid salamanders to these toxicants and indicate that current water quality criteria are adequate for their protection.

J	Schiffer, S; Liber, K				Schiffer, Stephanie; Liber, Karsten			Estimation of vanadium water quality benchmarks for the protection of aquatic life with relevance to the Athabasca Oil Sands region using species sensitivity distributions	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Elevated vanadium (V) concentrations in oil sands coke, which is produced and stored on site of some major Athabasca Oil Sands companies, could pose a risk to aquatic ecosystems in northern Alberta, Canada, depending on its future storage and utilization. In the present study, V toxicity was determined in reconstituted Athabasca River water to various freshwater organisms, including 2 midge species (Chironomus dilutus and Chironomus riparius; 4-d and 30-d to 40-d exposures) and 2 freshwater fish species (Oncorhynchus mykiss and Pimephales promelas; 4-d and 28-d exposures) to facilitate estimation of water quality benchmarks. The acute toxicity of V was 52.0 and 63.2mg/L for C. dilutus and C. riparius, respectively, and 4.0 and 14.8mgV/L for P. promelas and O. mykiss, respectively. Vanadium exposure significantly impaired adult emergence of C. dilutus and C. riparius at concentrations 16.7 (31.6% reduction) and 8.3 (18.0% reduction) mg/L, respectively. Chronic toxicity in fish presented as lethality, with chronic 28-d LC50s of 0.5 and 4.3mg/L for P. promelas and O. mykiss, respectively. These data were combined with data from the peer-reviewed literature, and separate acute and chronic species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) were constructed. The acute and chronic hazardous concentrations endangering only 5% of species (HC5) were estimated as 0.64 and 0.05mgV/L, respectively. These new data for V toxicity to aquatic organisms ensure that there are now adequate data available for regulatory agencies to develop appropriate water quality guidelines for use in the Athabasca Oil Sands region and elsewhere. Until then, the HC5 values presented in the present study could serve as interim benchmarks for the protection of aquatic life from exposure to hazardous levels of V in local aquatic environments.

Widespread occurrence and potential for biodegradation of bioactive contaminants in Congaree National Park, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Organic contaminants with designed molecular bioactivity, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, originate from human and agricultural sources, occur frequently in surface waters, and threaten the structure and function of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Congaree National Park in South Carolina (USA) is a vulnerable park unit due to its location downstream of multiple urban and agricultural contaminant sources and its hydrologic setting, being composed almost entirely of floodplain and aquatic environments. Seventy-two water and sediment samples were collected from 16 sites in Congaree National Park during 2013 to 2015, and analyzed for 199 and 81 targeted organic contaminants, respectively. More than half of these water and sediment analytes were not detected or potentially had natural sources. Pharmaceutical contaminants were detected (49 total) frequently in water throughout Congaree National Park, with higher detection frequencies and concentrations at Congaree and Wateree River sites, downstream from major urban areas. Forty-seven organic wastewater indicator chemicals were detected in water, and 36 were detected in sediment, of which approximately half are distinctly anthropogenic. Endogenous sterols and hormones, which may originate from humans or wildlife, were detected in water and sediment samples throughout Congaree National Park, but synthetic hormones were detected only once, suggesting a comparatively low risk of adverse impacts. Assessment of the biodegradation potentials of 8 C-14-radiolabeled model contaminants indicated poor potentials for some contaminants, particularly under anaerobic sediments conditions.

J	Maloney, EM; Morrissey, CA; Headley, JV; Peru, KM; Liber, K				Maloney, Erin M.; Morrissey, Christy A.; Headley, John V.; Peru, Kerry M.; Liber, Karsten			Cumulative toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticide mixtures to Chironomus dilutus under acute exposure scenarios	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Extensive agricultural use of neonicotinoid insecticide products has resulted in the presence of neonicotinoid mixtures in surface waters worldwide. Although many aquatic insect species are known to be sensitive to neonicotinoids, the impact of neonicotinoid mixtures is poorly understood. In the present study, the cumulative toxicities of binary and ternary mixtures of select neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam) were characterized under acute (96-h) exposure scenarios using the larval midge Chironomus dilutus as a representative aquatic insect species. Using the MIXTOX approach, predictive parametric models were fitted and statistically compared with observed toxicity in subsequent mixture tests. Single-compound toxicity tests yielded median lethal concentration (LC50) values of 4.63, 5.93, and 55.34g/L for imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam, respectively. Because of the similar modes of action of neonicotinoids, concentration-additive cumulative mixture toxicity was the predicted model. However, we found that imidacloprid-clothianidin mixtures demonstrated response-additive dose-level-dependent synergism, clothianidin-thiamethoxam mixtures demonstrated concentration-additive synergism, and imidacloprid-thiamethoxam mixtures demonstrated response-additive dose-ratio-dependent synergism, with toxicity shifting from antagonism to synergism as the relative concentration of thiamethoxam increased. Imidacloprid-clothianidin-thiamethoxam ternary mixtures demonstrated response-additive synergism. These results indicate that, under acute exposure scenarios, the toxicity of neonicotinoid mixtures to C. dilutus cannot be predicted using the common assumption of additive joint activity. Indeed, the overarching trend of synergistic deviation emphasizes the need for further research into the ecotoxicological effects of neonicotinoid insecticide mixtures in field settings, the development of better toxicity models for neonicotinoid mixture exposures, and the consideration of mixture effects when setting water quality guidelines for this class of pesticides.

Risk assessment of imidacloprid use in forest settings on the aquatic macroinvertebrate community	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The isolated effects of a single insecticide can be difficult to assess in natural settings because of the presence of numerous pollutants in many watersheds. Imidacloprid use for suppressing hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae (Annand) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae), in forests offers a rare opportunity to assess potential impacts on aquatic macroinvertebrates in relatively pristine landscapes. Aquatic macroinvertebrate communities were assessed in 9 streams in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (southern Appalachian Mountains, USA). The streams flow through hemlock conservation areas where imidacloprid soil drench treatments were applied for hemlock woolly adelgid suppression. Sites were located upstream and downstream of the imidacloprid treatments. Baseline species presence data (pre-imidacloprid treatment) were available from previous sample collections at downstream sites. Downstream and upstream sites did not vary in numerous community measures. Although comparisons of paired upstream and downstream sites showed differences in diversity in 7 streams, higher diversity was found more often in downstream sites. Macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups and life habits were similar between downstream and upstream sites. Downstream and baseline stream samples were similar. While some functional feeding group and life habit species richness categories varied, variations did not indicate poorer quality downstream communities. Imidacloprid treatments applied according to US Environmental Protection Agency federal restrictions did not result in negative effects to aquatic macroinvertebrate communities, which indicates that risks of imidacloprid use in forest settings are low.

H.; Bruun, Hans Henrik			Recovery of lake vegetation following reduced eutrophication and acidification	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In recent decades, many aquatic ecosystems in Europe and North America have experienced reduced inputs of nutrients and acidifying substances because of improved sewage treatment and reduced emission of sulphur oxides. We evaluated the consequences of these efforts to changes in water chemistry, species richness and community composition of aquatic macrophytes in 56 lakes in Denmark around 1990 and again around 2010. 2. Reductions in lake water concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen were strongest in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes, for example, lakes which had been heavily affected by domestic sewage. These changes translated into decreased algal biomass in the most eutrophied lakes. Oligo- and mesotrophic lakes did not change significantly in terms of nutrients or algal biomass. Water clarity increased across all lakes but not significantly in specific trophic lake groups. Alkalinity and pH increased significantly (up to 2pH-units) in low-alkaline lakes, while well-buffered high-alkaline lakes (>0.5meq/L) did not show any change. 3. Macrophyte species richness per lake increased, on average, by 13% during the 20-year study period. The increase was strongest in species preferring nutrient-rich conditions and could be directly attributed to reductions in phytoplankton biomass in lakes of medium water clarity. The similarity among all lakes in terms of species composition increased over the study period. This development was closely related to higher average species richness and was mainly caused by recolonisation of lakes, recovering from past eutrophication, by relatively common species (e.g., Lemna trisulca, Sparganium emersum and Potamogeton berchtoldii). Higher pH in low-alkaline lakes was accompanied by a shift from acid-tolerant to more acid-sensitive species. 4. Our results demonstrate that investment in pollution control has been successful in terms of markedly improving water quality of lakes and, with a time lag, macrophyte species richness. Although relatively common species have spread across lakes and resulted in homogenised macrophyte communities, continued efforts to reduce pollution could ensure the survival of rare specialist species and perhaps even increase their abundance in the future.

Here, we quantify and identify drivers of spatial and temporal beta diversity in diatom assemblages between historical and modern times. Location: United States of America. Major Taxa: StudiedDiatoms. Tim Period: pre-AD 1850 and c. 2007. Methods: Using sedimentary genus-level diatom data from 169 lakes and species-level data for 52 lakes, we computed spatial beta diversity across all lakes and within ecoregions for 2007 and pre-AD 1850 time points. We also computed local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD) and analysed them with respect to environmental variables. Total beta diversity was partitioned into replacement and abundance difference components to identify mechanisms possibly responsible for spatial beta at each time point. Temporal beta diversity indices (TBI) were also computed for each lake by comparing the diatom data of all lakes at the time points. TBIs were decomposed into taxon losses and gains to facilitate interpretation. TBIs and their components were related to contemporary land cover. Results: Temporal beta diversity varied significantly as a function of forest cover, with higher temporal beta in lakes from watersheds with contemporary lower forest cover. Spatial beta diversity was similar between the historical and 2007 time points. Lakes with substantial local contributions to beta diversity were differentiated by water quality and land cover variables at a local scale, but showed no systematic regional pattern. Main conclusions: Spatial beta diversity of diatoms across the U.S.A. does not appear to have changed between pre-AD 1850 and 2007, suggesting that broad-scale land use and hydrological alteration of the landscape has not homogenized these communities. Temporal beta diversity occurred through genus gains and losses and was significantly related to land cover in watersheds. These analyses, pairing spatial and temporal beta diversity, provide insight into the mechanisms maintaining diatom diversity.

Inactive supply wells as conduits for flow and contaminant migration: conditions of occurrence and suggestions for management	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Water supply wells can act as conduits for vertical flow and contaminant migration between water-bearing strata under common hydrogeologic and well construction conditions. While recognized by some for decades, there is little published data on the magnitude of flows and extent of resulting water quality impacts. Consequently, the issue may not be acknowledged widely enough and the need for better management persists. This is especially true for unconsolidated alluvial groundwater basins that are hydrologically stressed by agricultural activities. Theoretical and practical considerations indicate that significant water volumes can migrate vertically through wells. The flow is often downward, with shallow groundwater, usually poorer in quality, migrating through conduit wells to degrade deeper water quality. Field data from locations in California, USA, are presented in combination with modeling results to illustrate both the prevalence of conditions conducive to intraborehole flow and the resulting impacts to water quality. Suggestions for management of planned wells include better enforcement of current regulations and more detailed consideration of hydrogeologic conditions during design and installation. A potentially greater management challenge is presented by the large number of existing wells. Monitoring for evidence of conduit flow and solute transport in areas of high well density is recommended to identify wells that pose greater risks to water quality. Conduit wells that are discovered may be addressed through approaches that include structural modification and changes in operations.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				NOV	2017	25	7					2163	2183		10.1007/s10040-017-1588-y								WOS:000413970900017

Measuring water quality from individual fractures in open wellbores using hydraulic isolation and the dissolved oxygen alteration method	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												This study describes a low-cost method for sampling individual fractures in open wellbores in crystalline bedrock utilizing naturally occurring flow conditions in the well. The method entails using the dissolved oxygen alteration method (DOAM) to identify transmissive fractures and vertical flow direction. After obtaining information about relative hydraulic gradients, flow direction in the well is modified using a single control pump to isolate fractures of interest for sampling. Additional dissolved oxygen, injected during the DOAM procedure, serves as a tracer to ensure the water quality in the sampling zone is characteristic of the fracture of interest by requiring a tracer-free zone prior to sampling. Sampling procedures are described conceptually for nine bedrock wells with varying flow conditions containing one, two, or three transmissive inflowing fractures. The method was demonstrated in two crystalline bedrock wells containing one and two transmissive inflowing fractures.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				NOV	2017	25	7					2199	2206		10.1007/s10040-017-1657-2								WOS:000413970900019						
J	Suter, G; Cormier, S; Barron, M				Suter, Glenn; Cormier, Susan; Barron, Mace			A weight of evidence framework for environmental assessments: Inferring quantities	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has developed a generally applicable framework for a weight-of-evidence (WoE) process for deriving quantitative values from multiple estimates. These guidelines are intended for environmental assessments that require the generation of quantitative parameters such as degradation rates or that develop quantitative products such as criterion values or magnitudes of effects. The basic steps are to weigh evidence for the environmental quality to be quantified, generate the value by merging estimates or by identifying the best estimate, and weight the results to determine confidence in the numerical value. When multiple data sets or outputs of multiple models are available, it may be appropriate to weigh the evidence. Use of the framework to weigh multiple estimates may increase the accuracy of quantitative results compared to a single estimate from a default method. Its use can provide greater transparency compared to ad hoc weighing of evidence. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:1045-1051. Published 2017.

Industrial pilots representing small real-size treatment units were set up downstream of a conventional secondary treatment of a wastewater treatment plant in the South of France and their performance followed for 2 y. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is used to compare the environmental impacts of different treatment processes. Five tertiary treatment trains were studied: 1) sand filtration (SF) ?storage followed by ultraviolet (UV) dynamic reactor disinfection (SF-UVD), 2) sand filtration + UV batch reactor disinfection (SF-UVB), 3) ultrafiltration (UF), 4) ultrafiltration and UV batch reactor disinfection (UF-UVB), and 5) microfiltration (MF) and storage followed by dynamic UV disinfection (MF-UVD). The chosen functional unit is "To supply 1 m(3) of water with a quality in compliance with the highest standard of the French reuse regulations." The combination of SF with UV disinfection or the use of UF alone was found to be equivalent in terms of environmental impact for most of the midpoint indicators chosen. Combination of UF with UV disinfection was significantly more impacting because the electricity consumption was nearly doubled. This study was conducted on an industrial pilot; it may thus be representative of industrial facilities implemented to treat higher water flows.

Chemometric approach integrated with capillary electrophoresis for the investigation of public water system sources and quality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A chemometric approach coupled with capillary electrophoresis based on the hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis has been applied for the investigation of the water quality in the Golcuk-Isparta region (Lake District of Turkey). In the research area, Egirdir Lake, Golcuk Lake and surrounding ground and domestic waters have been utilized as drinking water resources. Golcuk Lake is distinctive in terms of high fluoride content (3.50 +/- 0.21 mg/mL) which is endemic in volcanic areas where the water flow through volcanic rocks and sediments. Based on the analysis of major anions chloride, sulfate, nitrate and fluoride with capillary electrophoresis, twenty-four drinking water sampling sites in the research area were classified into four classes using the hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis. Combining the research area investigation results of hierarchical cluster and principal component analysis, it was found that fluoride concentration is the major diagnostic variable to determine the quality of drinking waters, and all the other anions are the important classification factors to predict the resources of the drinking water samples, individually. To sum up, this study reveals the potential of the use of capillary electrophoresis in combination with chemometric techniques for the determination of the quality and origin of drinking waters.

Field experiments were conducted during the maize growing seasons of 2014 and 2015 in the North China Plain to investigate the effects of lateral depth, irrigation level, and water quality on the deep percolation and the nitrate (NO3-N) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) leaching under semi-humid conditions. The experiments were designed with three lateral depths of 0 cm (D1), 15 cm (D2), and 30 cm (D3) beneath the soil surface along with three irrigation levels of 70% (I1), 100% (I2), and 130% (I3) of crop evapotranspiration requirements. Secondary sewage effluent and groundwater were used as irrigation water. The results indicated that the intensive rainfall caused most of the deep percolation and NO3-N leaching during the maize growing seasons. A high irrigation level usually produced more deep percolation and NO3-N leaching, but no significant difference was found among the treatments. In general, the cumulative NO3-N leaching beyond the root zone increased as lateral depth increased. In addition, the lateral depth obviously influenced the distribution of E. coli in soil, and subsurface drip irrigation usually induced E. coli contamination deeper in the soil. With relatively high nitrate and E. coli concentration, sewage effluent irrigation significantly increased the risk of NO3-N leaching beyond the root zone in the 2014 season, but imposed an insignificant influence on the presence of E. coli in soil. Furthermore, no E. coli was detected in the leachate following an irrigation event with sewage effluent or a rainfall event during the both maize growing seasons. A dripline depth of 15 cm with deficit irrigation can be conductive to reducing NO3 leaching as well as avoiding sewage effluent contact contamination during the maize growing season in the semi-humid region of the North China Plain.																	0342-7188	1432-1319				NOV	2017	35	6					469	482		10.1007/s00271-017-0553-9								WOS:000412922600001

Evaluation of fog and rain water collected at Delta Barrage, Egypt as a new resource for irrigated agriculture	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Alternative clean water resources are needed in Egypt to face the current water shortage and water quality deterioration. Therefore, this research investigates the suitability of harvesting fog and rain water for irrigation using a pilot fog collector for water quantity, water quality, and economic aspects. A pilot fog collector was installed at one location at Delta Barrage, Egypt. Freeze liquid nitrogen was fixed at the back of the fiberglass sheet to increase the condensation rate. The experiment was conducted during the period from November 2015 to February 2016. In general, all physicochemical variables are observed with higher values in the majority of fog than rain water. The fog is assumed to contain higher concentrations of anthropogenic emissions. TDS in both waters collected are less than 700 mg/l at sodium content less than 60%, classifying these waters as good for various plants under most conditions. In addition, SAR calculated values are less than 3.0 in each of fog and rain water, which proves the water suitability for all irrigated agriculture. Al and Fe concentrations were found common in all samples with values less than the permissible limits of the guidelines. These metals originate from soil material, ash and metal surfaces. The sensitive heavy metals (Cd and Pb) were within the permissible limits of the guideline in fog water, indicating this water is suitable for irrigation. On the contrary, rain water that has heavy metals is not permitted in irrigation water as per the Egyptian law. As per WQI, the rain water is classified as good quality while fog is classified as medium quality. Regarding the water quantity, a significant increase in the harvested fog quantity was observed after cooling the collector surface with freeze liquid nitrogen. The current fog collector produced the lowest water quantity among different fog collectors worldwide. However, these comparative results confirmed that quantity is different from one location to another worldwide even in the same country. The cost of the unit water volume of harvested water by the current pilot collector is relatively low among different collectors worldwide. This study proves that fog harvesting in Egypt is feasible using the current pilot collector in terms of water quantity, water quality, and economy. But it recommends collection of fog at various locations and times, since both water quantity and water quality are variable in time and space. It is more or less viable solution to meet the shortage of water in Egypt. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A wood-slice substrate was selected: (i) as a water absorber to convert liquid-sample analysis to solid-sample analysis; (ii) to eliminate the influence of a water matrix to spectral analysis (e.g., light blocking due to water splashing and plasma emission quenching due OH groups) in the plasma during direct analysis of water samples. The wood slice after treatment was ablated by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser to produce plasma. Then, the lead atoms in the plasma were re-excited by a second tunable dye laser resonantly. The LIF signal of lead was detected to improve its sensitivity to spectral analysis significantly. Under the assistance of this matrix-converting method, the calibration curve of lead in water samples was created and the limit of detection was found to be 0.32 ppb, two orders of magnitude better than that obtained by analyzing water samples directly using the same LIBS-LIF technique. This sample-pretreatment procedure was rapid and easy to handle. Upon combination with LIBS-LIF, ultrasensitive detection of trace amounts of toxic metal elements in water could be realized. This approach could be applied in water-quality control and monitoring of environmental pollution.																	0267-9477	1364-5544				NOV 1	2017	32	11					2292	2299		10.1039/c7ja00244k								WOS:000414343900021						
J	Eriander, L				Eriander, Louise			Light requirements for successful restoration of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) in a high latitude environment - Acclimatization, growth and carbohydrate storage	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The short growth season in high latitude environments pose challenges for eelgrass restoration, particularly in areas that receive little light due to e.g. depth or reduced water quality conditions. In order to improve our understanding of the acclimatization potential of eelgrass to low light and the light requirement for successful restoration of eelgrass, an indoor mesocosm study was performed assessing three light (3, 5 and 10 mol photons m(- 2) day(-1)) and two temperature conditions (12 and 20 degrees C). The aim of the study was to determine if eelgrass transplants originating from a shallow donor meadow with high light could acclimatize to low light conditions and how different light conditions affect growth characteristics and carbohydrate storage of transplants. A second aim was to investigate how eelgrass grown under different light conditions cope during severe shading (zero light) under the two temperature conditions, and how severe shading affect the carbohydrate stock of transplants. The results demonstrate that eelgrass can acclimatize to light levels from 10 down to 3 mol photons m(-2) day(-1) by adjustments in morphology, pigmentation and growth strategy, but with a significant reduction in the production of lateral branches below 5 mol photons m(-2) day(-1). Temperature had a strong positive effect on shoot morphology and above ground biomass production independent of light treatment, but less effect on branching. Furthermore, the study shows that acclimatized eelgrass transplants can store carbohydrates at light levels down to 3 mol photons m(-2) day(-1), but that losses occur in relation to the transplantation process and as a result of severe shading. Survival of transplants during severe shading conditions demonstrated large temperature dependent effects, with no effects of previous light conditions. The results from this study provide important insight into the phenotypic response by eelgrass to environmental conditions and could have important implications for management and restoration of eelgrass in high latitude environments with respect to acclimatization potential and the minimum light requirement for successful restoration.																	0022-0981	1879-1697				NOV	2017	496						37	48		10.1016/j.jembe.2017.07.010								WOS:000412252700006

Because the inevitable release of pollutants into aquatic environments due to an ineffective control of industrial and agricultural pollution, the evaluation of the interaction of NOM with heavy metals, nanoparticles, organic pollutants and other pollutants in the aquatic environment, has greatly increased. Three-dimensional (3-D) fluorescence has the potential to reveal the interaction mechanisms between NOM and pollutants as well as the source of NOM pollution. In water purification engineering system, the 3-D fluorescence can indicate the variations of NOM composition and gives an effective prediction of water quality as well as the underline water purification mechanisms. Inadequately treated NOM is a cause of precursors of disinfection byproducts (DBPs), posing a potential threat to human health. Effective control and measurement/evaluation of NOM have long been an important factors in the prevention of water pollution. Overall, 3-D fluorescence allows for a rapid identification of organic components thus indicating possible sources of water pollution, mechanisms of pollutant interactions, and possible DBPs formed during conventional treatment of this water. This article reviews the 3-D fluorescence characteristics of NOM in natural water and typical water purification systems. The 3-D fluorescence was effective for indicating the variabilities in NOM composition and chemistry thus providing a better understanding of NOM in natural water system and water engineering system.

Forestry best management practices for erosion control in haul road ditches near stream crossings	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Poorly designed and maintained forest road stream crossings can directly link erosion sources to streams. Forestry best management practices (BMPs) provide techniques that are useful for preventing sedimentation associated with ditch erosion. However, few studies have quantified ditch BMP sediment reductions. Thus, our primary objective was to evaluate erosion control effectiveness due to ditch BMPs and secondarily to quantify ditch BMP implementation costs. Sixty ditch segments near stream crossings were reconstructed, and five ditch BMP treatments were applied using a completely randomized design resulting in 11 to 13 replications per treatment. Ditch BMP treatments were (1) bare ditch (Bare), (2) grass seed with lime fertilizer (Seed), (3) grass seed with lime fertilizer and erosion control mat (Mat), (4) rock check dams (Dam), and (5) completely rocked (Rock). Silt fence sediment traps and sediment pins were measured over one year to determine treatment effectiveness. Trapped sediment deposits indicated that median erosion rates were greatest for Dam (6.14 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [2.74 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]), followed by Bare (4.92 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [2.19 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]), Rock (1.73 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [0.77 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]), Seed (1.04 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [0.46 tn ac(-1) y(-1)]), and Mat (0.82 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [0.37 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]). Results suggested that Mat treatments had significantly lower erosion rates than Bare and Dam, while Rock and Seed provided intermediate levels. Costs of BMP treatments were least expensive for Seed (US$6.10 approach(-1)), followed by Mat (US$21.33 approach(-1)), Dam (US$71.43 approach(-1)), and Rock (US$141.08 approach(-1)). Results suggest that erosion began to accelerate disproportionately when bare soil levels were between 30% and 50%; therefore, minimum soil cover of 50% is recommended for ditches.

Metal contamination of bed sediments in the Irwell and Upper Mersey catchments, northwest England: exploring the legacy of industry and urban growth	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Manchester is often heralded as the first industrial city. Large volumes of physical and liquid contaminants were released into its river network throughout the industrial period up to the latter part of the twentieth century. Water quality has improved dramatically in recent decades, but, given their environmental significance, it is important to ascertain the extent to which a legacy of contamination persists in the modern bed sediments. Fine-grained bed sediments were sampled at 40 sites in the Mersey and Irwell catchments. Sediments were wet sieved to isolate the < 63-mu m grain size fraction. Metal concentrations were determined using XRF. Particle size characteristics were also measured. Sediments were subjected to a five-step sequential extraction procedure to ascertain the environmental significance of metal concentrations. Alongside archival research of past industry, enrichment factors, multivariate statistical techniques and conditional inferences trees were used to identify sources of heavy metals. Bed sediment-associated heavy metal(loid) concentrations were as follows: As (9.89-110 mg kg(-1)), Cr (76.5-413 mg kg(-1)), Cu (53.1-383 mg kg(-1)), Pb (80.4-442 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (282-1020 mg kg(-1)). Enrichment factors ranged from moderate to extremely severe, with Pb showing the greatest enrichment across the catchments. Chemical mobility was generally low, but metal(loid) partitioning identified the influence of anthropogenic sources. Statistical analysis highlighted a number of point sources associated with former industrial sites that operated during the industrial period. Conditional inference trees highlighted the role of the textile industry on Cu concentrations in addition to indicating the complexity of sources, fluxes and stores of sediment-associated contamination throughout the system. Fine-grained sediment-associated metal(loid)s in the Mersey and Irwell catchments are anthropogenically enriched. Concentrations also exceed sediment quality guidelines. A lack of distinct spatial patterning points to a complex network of contaminant inputs across the catchments, even in the headwaters. Whilst potential modern urban sources are likely to be important, spatial patterns and multivariate/data mining techniques also highlighted the importance of releases from former industrial sites as well as the reworking of historically contaminated floodplains and soils.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				NOV	2017	17	11					2648	2665		10.1007/s11368-017-1668-6								WOS:000412738900007						
J	Tas, S; Lundholm, N				Tas, Seyfettin; Lundholm, Nina			Temporal and spatial variability of the potentially toxic Pseudo-nitzschia spp. in a eutrophic estuary (Sea of Marmara)	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Spatial and temporal variability and bloom formation of the potentially toxic diatom Pseudo-nitzschia spp. was investigated weekly to monthly from October 2009 to October 2010 in a eutrophic estuary, the Golden Horn. Pseudo-nitzschia spp. were detected in 195 of 512 samples (38%) collected throughout the year. Two species, P. calliantha and P. pungens, were identified based on the SEM examination. Blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia occurred in the lower and middle estuary in January and May. The bloom in January mainly comprised P. calliantha. In the bloom in early May, P. calliantha made up 72% of the Pseudo-nitzschia cells and P. pungens 28%. However, the contribution of P. pungens increased to 83% in late May. The Pseudo-nitzschia blooms occurred at low temperature (9-15 degrees C) and moderate salinity (17-18), and for P. calliantha a significant negative correlation was found with temperature and a significant positive correlation with salinity. The percentage of Pseudo-nitzschia cells decreased gradually from lower to upper estuary (59-14%), correlating with a decrease in Secchi depth (5.5-0.5 m). Principal components analyses (PCA) were used to explore the spatial and temporal variability of environmental factors in relation to Pseudo-nitzschia abundances, and showed that NH4, pH, Secchi depth and DO values were the most important factors reflecting spatial differences, while temperature, salinity, Chl-a and Si:N were more important factors showing temporal differences. High abundances of P. pungens correlated mainly with pH, Secchi depth and DO values, whereas P. calliantha also correlated with NO3 + NO2. Low light availability due to high concentrations of suspended material and very variable environmental conditions (e.g. pH, DO and NH4) may have limited growth of Pseudo-nitzschia in the upper estuary. Regular monitoring of Pseudo-nitzschia is important for improving the understanding of the influence of environmental parameters on bloom dynamics in the study area.

We evaluated the ability of dead-end hollow fiber ultrafiltration (D- HFUF) and single agar layer (SAL) procedure to concentrate and enumerate coliphages from 1L and 10L volumes of ambient surface waters (lake, river, marine), river water with varying turbidities (3.74-118.7 NTU), and a simulated combined sewer overflow (CSO) event. Percentage recoveries for surface waters were 40-79% (somatic) and 35-94% (F +). The method performed equally well in all three matrices at 1L volumes, but percent recoveries were significantly higher in marine waters at 10L volumes when compared to freshwater. Percent recoveries at 1L and 10L were similar, except in river water where recoveries were significantly lower at higher volume. In highly turbid waters, D-HFUF-SAL had a recovery range of 25-77% (somatic) and 21-80% (F +). The method produced detectable levels of coliphages in diluted wastewater and in unspiked surface waters, emphasizing its applicability to CSO events and highlighting its utility in recovery of low coliphage densities from surface waters. Thus D-HFUF-SAL is a good candidate method for routine water quality monitoring of coliphages.																	0166-0934	1879-0984				NOV	2017	249						58	65		10.1016/j.jviromet.2017.08.006								WOS:000413177000008	28843788					
J	Elsebaie, IH; Fouli, H; Amin, M				Elsebaie, Ibrahim H.; Fouli, Hesham; Amin, Mohab			Evaporation reduction from open water tanks using palm-frond covers: Effects of tank shape and coverage pattern	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												The limited fresh water resources and increasing future demand for water necessitate the importance of optimum use of water; especially in arid/semi-arid regions. The purpose of this study is to examine reducing evaporation losses from open water bodies using palm-frond sheets as cover material. Four open constant-depth water tanks with two different surface areas have been used in the study. The tanks had square and rectangular surface areas. The tanks were covered with two patterns of palm-frond sheets: a) staggered strips-no strips covering half of the surface area (strips-covered), and b) single sheet covering half of the surface area (A 1/2 -covered). Data of cumulative evaporation depths were recorded daily continuously from the covered tanks, as well as from the uncovered tanks, to assess the relative efficiency of evaporation reduction. The results indicated that the strips-covered pattern outperformed the A 1/2 -covered; it reduced the evaporation depth by approximately 20% and 24% for the square and rectangular surface tanks; respectively, when compared to the A 1/2 -covered pattern. Moreover, the strips-covered pattern resulted in approximately 76% less evaporation depth compared to the uncovered reference tanks. Additionally, water quality analyses showed that such palm-based cover materials have insignificant effect on the water quality. These results confirmed that evaporation can be reduced and controlled using environment friendly safe techniques.																	1226-7988	1976-3808				NOV	2017	21	7					2977	2983		10.1007/s12205-017-0539-4								WOS:000413305000048

Isolation and characterization of metaldehyde-degrading bacteria from domestic soils	MICROBIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY												Metaldehyde is a common molluscicide, used to control slugs in agriculture and horticulture. It is resistant to breakdown by current water treatment processes, and its accumulation in drinking water sources leads to regular regulatory failures in drinking water quality. To address this problem, we isolated metaldehyde-degrading microbes from domestic soils. Two distinct bacterial isolates were cultured, that were able to grow prototrophically using metaldehyde as sole carbon and energy source. One isolate belonged to the genus Acinetobacter (strain designation E1) and the other isolate belonged to the genus Variovorax (strain designation E3). Acinetobacter E1 was able to degrade metaldehyde to a residual concentration <1nM, whereas closely related Acinetobacter strains were completely unable to degrade metaldehyde. Variovorax E3 grew and degraded metaldehyde more slowly than Acinetobacter E1, and residual metaldehyde remained at the end of growth of the Variovorax E3 strain. Biological degradation of metaldehyde using these bacterial strains or approaches that allow insitu amplification of metaldehyde-degrading bacteria may represent a way forward for dealing with metaldehyde contamination in soils and water.

Total As concentrations in well water samples varied between 40 g/L and 120 mu g/L. Additionally, the occurrence of As(III) in each studied well water exceeded 80% of the total As content. On the other hand, As(V) was found to be the predominant species (as 90%) in water samples with reduced As concentrations (i.e., after treatments at waterworks) below the health limit value of 10 mu g/L prescribed by the 98/83/EC Council Directive. Moreover, As could not be detected in the As(III)-associated fractions of several samples. Generally, a reasonable agreement was found between the results obtained with HR-CS-GFAAS and TXRF. Nevertheless, As concentrations in the As(III)-associated fractions collected after the flocculation and coagulation steps were below the detection limit of the TXRF method at a higher extent. Preliminary application of this simple As speciation approach enables a proper choice of reagents and their dosage for similar water treatment technologies and hence, a reduction in the water treatment costs. The current SPE method coupled off-line to cost-effective atomic spectrometric detection for monitoring inorganic As species in waters represents an alternative approach to conventional As speciation methods, thus it could be extensively exploited for routine analysis in water quality control laboratories.

The analytical methodology combines measurement with portable laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and direct chemometric treatment of the LIBS spectra. With this aim, suspended particular matter (SPM) samples were collected during five storm events, every 2 h with an automatic water sampler in three control points (gauging stations) of an urban river (Deba River, Basque Country, Spain). SPM samples were analyzed in situ by a handheld laser induced breakdown spectrometry (HH-LIBS), and the complete LIBS spectra were statistically analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) after outlier identification by k-nearest neighbors (kNN). The PCA results showed differentiation between monitored localizations and the period when the storm event occurred. It was also possible to identify important discriminant variables, some of them corresponding to hazardous elements such as Pb, Cr, Ni, and Cu. Basing on the correlation between variables, it was possible to identify their sources (urban/municipal contamination, anthropogenic activities, etc.). Moreover, thanks to this methodology, it was possible to predict the mobilization of hazardous elements at the end of a storm event and determine the environmental risk assessment in an urban river.

It is apparent that this integrated aquaculture-agriculture system is stilted to environmental and hydrological conditions found in specific areas. Production strategies devised by farmers demonstrate that the diversified culture of shrimp with rice is technically feasible. Shrimp-rice agroecosystems exhibit several synergistic effects between systems components that result in efficient resource use and enhanced production, whilst avoiding negative environmental impacts. Integrated cropping enhances agro-biodiversity and reduces dependence on external inputs (agrochemicals, feed and fertiliser). Diversified shrimp-rice culture produces a valuable export crop, stimulating economic development and staple cereal, fish and vegetable crops that enhance human nutrition and food security. The contribution that diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems make to social-ecological resilience is evaluated using the DPSIR (Driving forces, Pressures, State, Impacts, Responses) framework. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) associated with prevailing practices are reviewed using the SWOT framework. We conclude, that with appropriate safeguards, diversified shrimp-rice agroecosystems could contribute to climate change adaptation and enhance production from land affected by salinization. Policy-support and practical action is needed to support and promote diversified shrimp-farming agroecosystems as they can contribute to social-ecological resilience in vulnerable coastal communities.

Physico-chemical characteristics and phytoplankton biodiversity in Sulur lake of Coimbatore, South India	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Phytoplankton is playing an important role in maintaining the global carbon cycle. All through photosynthesis, phytoplankton uses carbon and returns to oxygen in water and atmosphere. The present study dealt physico-chemical characteristics and phytoplankton diversity in freshwater perennial lake of Sulur (Lat. 11 degrees 01 ' 46.11 '' N and Long. 77 degrees 07 ' 08.52 '' E), Coimbatore District, South India, for the period of one year from March 2011 - February 2012. Totally 50 species of phytoplankton (14 species of cyanophyceae, 19 species of chlorophyceae, 14 species of bacillariophyceae and 3 species of euglenophyceae) were recorded from the Sulur lake. The overall phytoplankton species composition was caused by chlorophyceae (49%) followed by cyanophyceae (24%), bacillariophyceae (23%) and euglenophyceae (4%). Phytoplankton population was positively correlated with various physico-chemical parameters, such as atmospheric and water temperature, pH, salinity, electrical conductivity, total dissolves solids and dissolved oxygen in the lake water. Population density of phytoplankton was higher in Sulur Lake which might be due to higher nutrients and favorable water quality condition. The result was confirmed by the presence of some phytoplankton species known to be highly tolerant to organic pollution and others as pollution indicators. Phytoplankton species recorded in this study were registered as pollution indicator species producing an odor compound that impact water quality. The study revealed that the Sulur lake possesses appreciable quantum of phytoplankton and it can be used for fish culture with continuous monitoring of physico-chemical parameters.																	2278-4535					NOV	2017	12	11					72	82										WOS:000413683900011

To investigate the stream-groundwater interaction mechanisms in the lateral hyporheic zone, this study examined Ma'an Creek in Chongqing during the dry season from December 2015 to April 2016. The water level, water temperature, pH and Cl- concentration in the hyporheic zone and groundwater were monitored in situ. The sediment permeability coefficient, stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen and concentration of DOC were analyzed. The results show that the water level changes of hyporheic zone and the movement of hyporheic flow were influenced significantly by the permeability coefficient of sediment. The hyporheic flow approximately 10 cm from the stream bank was clearly affected by precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration. During the study period, the groundwater recharged the stream, and the impact of groundwater on the hyporheic flow gradually decreased with the flow path. The hyporheic flow approximately 30 cm from the stream bank was still mainly affected by groundwater. Approximately 10-30 cm from the stream bank, the mixing of groundwater with precipitation and stream water intensified. Due to the sediment properties, moisture accumulated approximately 10 cm from the stream bank and drained into the stream via hyporheic flow, with potential impacts on stream water quality.																	1674-7313	1869-1897				NOV	2017	60	11					2033	2040		10.1007/s11430-016-9103-9								WOS:000413691300009

The study was started in June 2014 and water samples were taken from three stations for 12 months. In total, 21 physicochemical parameters and 7 heavy metals were investigated to determine the water quality. Such a detailed study has been done firstly in this pond used for irrigation purpose. As a result of performing analyses, it was found that the water quality was suitable for both the Alpsari Pond hosting aquatic animals and aquatic life. According to the SWQMR, the actual water quality was detected as a level Class (I-III-IV). The result is that the pond is under pollution pressure due to domestic and animal wastes.																	1303-2712					NOV	2017	17	6					1231	1243		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_6_16								WOS:000409436300016

However, the hydraulics condition within PSR, which is an essential prerequisite of the water quality studies, still remains unclear. Consequently, the objective of this study is to analyze the hydraulic conditions within PSR by means of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The influences of configuration parameters on the hydraulic conditions were tested including propeller diameter, inclined angle of the propeller, distance between the top and inner cylinder, distance between the bottom and inner cylinder, outer cylinder length, baffle length, number of the baffles, rotational speed of the propeller, and inner and outer cylinder diameters. According to the CFD analysis, an optimal structure of PSR was suggested. The data presented here could facilitate the PSR application and improve the simulation of water quality in distribution systems.

J	Mangadze, T; Wasserman, RJ; Dalu, T				Mangadze, Tinotenda; Wasserman, Ryan J.; Dalu, Tatenda			Use of Diatom Communities as Indicators of Conductivity and Ionic Composition in a Small Austral Temperate River System	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The aim of this study was to determine if benthic diatoms can be used as effective and reliable indicators of ionic composition and conductivity in different stream order categories. Samples were collected on two occasions from 22 sampling sites within the Bloukrans River system, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The data collected were subjected to multivariate statistical technique, i. e. CCA, to determine environmental gradients along which the diatom species were distributed as well as to elucidate hypothesised differences in community structure per stream order. Significant differences between the two sampling periods were observed in dissolved oxygen, temperature, Na, B, Ca, Zn, Cu, Cr, K, Fe, phosphate, conductivity, salinity and nitrate, while significant stream order variation was observed for conductivity, salinity, Mg, Ca and sediment nitrates. Study sites were grouped into two broad categories (stream order 1 and 2/3 sites) based on CCA. As pollution increased, low to moderate pollution-tolerant species such as Fragilaria tenera, Cyclostephanos dubius and Gyrosigma acuminatum were replaced by high pollution-tolerant species such as Nitzschia palea, Gomphonema parvulum, Tryblionella apiculata, Diploneis vulgaris and Staurosira elliptica. This shows that diatom assemblages are appropriate indicators of ionic composition/conductivity and hydromorphological characteristics (e. g. stream size) of running waters. The results highlight the importance of creating regional calibration datasets which will make it possible to develop procedures to determine conductivity and ion concentration effects on biota.

J	Vithana, CL; Sullivan, LA; Shepherd, T				Vithana, Chamindra L.; Sullivan, Leigh A.; Shepherd, Troy			Effect of schwertmannite and jarosite on the formation of hypoxic blackwater during inundation of grass material	WATER RESEARCH												This study focused on understanding the effect of schwertmannite and jarosite, commonly found in floodplains containing acid sulfate soil materials, on the characteristics of the hypoxic blackwaters that can form when floodplain vegetation experiences prolonged inundation. The formation of these 'blackwaters' was simulated in the laboratory by inundating flood-intolerant pasture grass leaf material in both the presence of schwertmannite/jarosite (schwertmannite and jarosite treatments) minerals and their absence (control treatment) at 27.5 degrees C for 32 days. The presence of either schwertmannite or jarosite was able to decrease the concentrations of DOC, nutrients (e.g. NH3 and PO43-) and the biological oxygen demand (BOD) in the incubating water compared to the control treatment. Being fresh and labile, the pasture grass material liberated DOC immediately following inundation with a concomitant decrease in dissolved O-2 thereby resulting in anoxic and reducing conditions in the incubating water. With the onset of anoxic and reducing conditions, the biogeochemical cycling of DOC in schwertmannite and jarosite treatments might have proceeded via microbially mediated iron(III) and sulfate reduction and electron shuttling processes. Under anoxic, slightly acidic conditions, microbially mediated iron(III) reduction and subsequent dissolution of schwertmannite and jarosite were triggered by liberating Fe2+, SO42- and alkalinity to the incubating water. The resultant increase in pH led to SO42- reduction in schwertmannite, and the Fe2+ catalysed transformation of both schwertmannite and jarosite to goethite. Schwertmannite almost completely transformed to goethite within two weeks of incubation. Iron(III) in goethite (formed from schwertmannie transformation) was also reduced and likely proceeded via direct microbial reduction or via electron shuttling using the humic acids in the incubating water derived from pasture grass. These findings are highly useful in managing the coastal low lying acid sulfate soils landscapes which are subject to frequent flooding during wet seasons. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Meyers, G; Kapelan, Z; Keedwell, E				Meyers, Gregory; Kapelan, Zoran; Keedwell, Edward			Short-term forecasting of turbidity in trunk main networks	WATER RESEARCH												Water discolouration is an increasingly important and expensive issue due to rising customer expectations, tighter regulatory demands and ageing Water Distribution Systems (WDSs) in the UK and abroad. This paper presents a new turbidity forecasting methodology capable of aiding operational staff and enabling proactive management strategies. The turbidity forecasting methodology developed here is completely data-driven and does not require hydraulic or water quality network model that is expensive to build and maintain. The methodology is tested and verified on a real trunk main network with observed turbidity measurement data. Results obtained show that the methodology can detect if discolouration material is mobilised, estimate if sufficient turbidity will be generated to exceed a preselected threshold and approximate how long the material will take to reach the downstream meter. Classification based forecasts of turbidity can be reliably made up to 5 h ahead although at the expense of increased false alarm rates. The methodology presented here could be used as an early warning system that can enable a multitude of cost beneficial proactive management strategies to be implemented as an alternative to expensive trunk mains cleaning programs.

Linking terrestrial phosphorus inputs to riverine export across the United States	WATER RESEARCH												Humans have greatly accelerated phosphorus (P) flows from land to aquatic ecosystems, causing eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia. A variety of statistical and mechanistic models have been used to explore the relationship between P management on land and P losses to waterways, but our ability to predict P losses from watersheds often relies on small scale catchment studies, where detailed measurements can be made, or global scale models that that are often too coarse-scaled to be used directly in the management decision-making process. Here we constructed spatially explicit datasets of terrestrial P inputs and outputs across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) for 2012. We use this dataset to improve understanding of P sources and balances at the national scale and to investigate whether well standardized input data at the continental scale can be used to improve predictions of hydrologic P export from watersheds across the U.S. We estimate that in 2012 agricultural lands received 0.19 Tg more P as fertilizer and confined manure than was harvested in major crops. Approximately 0.06 Tg P was lost to waterways as sewage and detergent nationally based on per capita loads in 2012. We compared two approaches for calculating non-agricultural P waste export to waterways, and found that estimates based on per capita P loads from sewage and detergent were 50% greater than Discharge Monitoring Report Pollutant Loading Tool. This suggests that the tool is likely underestimating P export in waste the CONUS scale. TP and DIP concentrations and TP yields were generally correlated more strongly with runoff than with P inputs or P balances, but even the relationships between runoff and P export were weak. Including P inputs as independent variables increased the predictive capacity of the best-fit models by at least 20%, but together inputs and runoff explained 40% of the variance in P concentration and 46-54% of the variance in P yield. By developing and applying a high-resolution P budget for the CONUS this study confirms that both hydrology and P inputs and sinks play important roles in aquatic P loading across a wide range of environments.

Sirajul			The public health significance of latrines discharging to groundwater used for drinking	WATER RESEARCH												Faecal contamination of groundwater from pit latrines is widely perceived as a major threat to the safety of drinking water for several billion people in rural and peri-urban areas worldwide. On the floodplains of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta in Bangladesh, we constructed latrines and monitored piezometer nests monthly for two years. We detected faecal coliforms (FC) in 3.3-233% of samples at four sites. We differentiate a near-field, characterised by high concentrations and frequent, persistent and contiguous contamination in all directions, and a far-field characterised by rare, impersistent, discontinuous low-level detections in variable directions. Far-field FC concentrations at four sites exceeded 0 and 10 cfu/100 ml in 2.4-9.6% and 0.2-2.3% of sampling events respectively. The lesser contamination of in-situ groundwater compared to water at the point-of-collection from domestic wells, which itself is less contaminated than at the point-of-consumption, demonstrates the importance of recontamination in the well-pump system. We present a conceptual model comprising four sub-pathways: the latrine aquifer interface (near-field); groundwater flowing from latrine to well (far-field); the well-pump system; and post-collection handling and storage. Applying a hypothetical dose-response model suggests that 1-2% of the diarrhoeal disease burden from drinking water is derived from the aquifer, 29% from the well-pump system, and 70% from post-collection handling. The important implications are (i) that leakage from pit latrines is a minor contributor to faecal contamination of drinking water in alluvial deltaic terrains; (ii) fears of increased groundwater pollution should not constrain expanding latrine coverage, and (iii) that more attention should be given to reducing contamination around the well-head.

While beneficial, coagulation or ozonation alone is unable to both efficiently control membrane fouling and product water quality in many cases. Thus, in this study an emerging alternative of ferrous iron/peroxymonosulfate (Fe(II)/PMS), which can act as both an oxidant and a coagulant was employed prior to UF for treatment of natural surface water, and compared with conventional coagulation and ozonation. The results showed that the Fe(II)/PMS-UF system exhibited the best performance for dissolved organic carbon removal, likely due to the dual functions of coagulation and oxidation in the single process. The fluorescent and UV-absorbing organic components were more susceptible to ozonation than Fe(II)/PMS treatment. Fe(II)/PMS and ozonation pretreatments significantly increased the removal efficiency of atrazine, p-chloronitrobenzene and sulfamethazine by 12-76% and 50-94%, respectively, whereas coagulation exerted a minor influence. The Fe(II)/PMS pretreatment also showed the best performance for the reduction of both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling, and the performance was hardly affected by membrane pore size and surface hydrophobicity. In addition, the characterization of hydraulic irreversible organic foulants confirmed its effectiveness. These results demonstrate the potential advantages of applying Fe(II)/PMS as a pretreatment for UF to simultaneously control membrane fouling and improve the permeate quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Another common phenomenon at the terminus of pipelines is leakage, which is considered helpful by allowing seepage of low-quality drinking water resulting from long-term stagnation. In this study, the effect of laminar flow on alleviating water quality deterioration under different leakage conditions was investigated, and the potential thresholds of the flow rate, which can affect the iron release process, were discussed. Based on a galvanized pipe and ductile cast iron pipe pilot platform, which was established at the terminus of pipelines, this research was carried out by setting a series of leakage rate gradients to analyze the influence of different leakage flow rates on iron release, as well as the relationship with chemical and biological parameters. The results showed that the water quality parameters were obviously influenced by the change in flow velocity. Water quality was gradually improved with an increase in flow velocity, but its change regularity reflected a diversity under different flow rates (p < 0.05). The iron release was remarkably correlated to the redox potential, dissolved oxygen, pH, iron-oxidized bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The cumulative total iron release (r = 0.587, p < 0.05) and total iron release rate (r = 0.71, p < 0.022) were significantly influenced by the changes in flow velocity. In short, they tended first to increase and then to decrease with an increasing flow velocity with the threshold as approximately 40% of the critical laminar flow velocity (1.16 x 10(-3) m/s). For the pipes at the terminus of the drinking water distribution system, when the bulk water was at the critical laminar flow velocity, the concentration of total iron, the quantity and rate of total iron release remain relatively in an ideal and safe situation.

However, the accumulation and distribution of harbored elements and microbes in the different niches (loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm) and their corresponding potential contribution to water quality deterioration remain unknown. This precludes an in-depth understanding of water quality deterioration and the development of proactive management strategies. The present study quantitatively evaluated the distribution of elements, ATP, Aeromonas spp., and bacterial communities in distribution pipes (PVC-U, D = 110 mm, loose deposit and biofilm niches) and household connection pipes (HDPE, D = 32 mm, HDPE biofilm niches) at ten locations in an unchlorinated distribution system. The results show that loose deposits in PVC-U pipes, acting as sinks, constitute a hotspot (highest total amount per meter pipe) for elements, ATP, and target bacteria groups (e.g., Aeromonas spp., Mycobacterium spp., and Legionella spp.). When drinking water distribution system niches with harbored elements and microbes become sources in the event of disturbances, the highest quality deterioration potential (QDP) is that of HDPE biofilm; this can be attributed to its high surface-to-volume ratio. 16s rRNA analysis demonstrates that, at the genus level, the bacterial communities in the water, loose deposits, PVC-U biofilm, and HDPE biofilm were dominated, respectively, by Polaromorws spp. (2-23%), Nitrosipra spp. (1-47%), Flavobacterium spp. (1-36%), and Flavobacterium spp. (5-67%). The combined results of elemental composition and bacterial community analyses indicate that different dominant bio-chemical processes might occur within the different niches for example, iron arsenic oxidizing in loose deposits, bio-calumniation in PVC-U biofilm, and methane oxidizing in HDPE biofilm. The release of 20% loose deposits, 20% PVC-U biofilm and 10% HDPE biofilm will cause significant changes of water bacterial community. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Benthic cyanobacteria: A source of cylindrospermopsin and microcystin in Australian drinking water reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria represent a health hazard worldwide due to their production of a range of highly potent toxins in diverse aquatic environments. While planktonic species have been the subject of many investigations in terms of risk assessment, little is known about benthic forms and their impact on water quality or human and animal health. This study aimed to purify isolates from environmental benthic biofilms sampled from three different drinking water reservoirs and to assess their toxin production by using the following methods: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Microscopic observation of the isolates allowed the identification of various filamentous cyanobacterial genera: Anabaena (benthic form), Calothrix and Nostoc from the Nostocales and Geitlerinema, Leptolyngbya, Limnothrix, Lyngbya, Oxynema, Phormidium and Pseudanabaena representing non-heterocystous filamentous cyanobacteria. The Phormidium ambiguum strain AWQC-PHO021 was found to produce 739 ng/mg of dry weight (d/w) of cylindrospermopsin and 107 ng/mg (d/w) of deoxycylindrospermopsin. The Nostoc linckia strain AWQC-NOS001 produced 400 ng/mg (d/w) of a microcystin analogue.

The implications of drought and water conservation on the reuse of municipal wastewater: Recognizing impacts and identifying mitigation possibilities	WATER RESEARCH												As water agencies continue to investigate opportunities to increase resilience and local water supply reliability in the face of drought and rising water scarcity, water conservation strategies and the reuse of treated municipal wastewater are garnering significant attention and adoption. Yet a simple water balance thought experiment illustrates that drought, and the conservation strategies that are often enacted in response to it, both likely limit the role reuse may play in improving local water supply reliability. For instance, as a particular drought progresses and agencies enact water conservation measures to cope with drought, Influent flows likely decrease while influent pollution concentrations increase, particularly salinity, which adversely affects wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) costs and effluent quality and flow. Consequently, downstream uses of this effluent, whether to maintain streamflow and quality, groundwater recharge, or irrigation may be impacted. This is unfortunate since reuse is often heralded as a drought-proof mechanism to increase resilience. The objectives of this paper are two-fold. First, we illustrate using a case study from Southern California during its most recent drought how drought and water conservation strategies combine to reduce influent flow and quality and, subsequently, effluent flow and quality. Second, we use a recently developed regional water reuse decision support model (RWRM) to highlight cost-effective strategies that can be implemented to mitigate the impacts of drought on effluent water quality. While the solutions we identify cannot increase the flow of influent or effluent coming into or out of a treatment plant, they can improve the value of the remaining effluent in a cost-effective manner that takes into account the characteristics of its demand, whether it be for landscaping, golf courses, agricultural irrigation, or surface water augmentation.

Multiparametric monitoring of microbial faecal pollution reveals the dominance of human contamination along the whole Danube River	WATER RESEARCH												The microbial faecal pollution of rivers has wide-ranging impacts on a variety of human activities that rely on appropriate river water quality. Thus, detailed knowledge of the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution is crucial for watershed management activities to maintain safe water use. In this study, the microbial faecal pollution levels were monitored by standard faecal indicator bacteria (SFIB) along a 2580 km stretch of the Danube, the world's most international river, as well as the Danube's most important tributaries. To track the origin of faecal pollution, host-associated Bacteroidetes genetic faecal marker qPCR assays for different host groups were applied in concert with. SFIB. The. spatial resolution analysis was followed by a time resolution analysis of faecal pollution patterns over 1 year at three selected sites. In this way, a comprehensive faecal pollution map of the total length of the Danube was created, combining substantiated information on both the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution. Within the environmental data matrix for the river, microbial faecal pollution constituted an independent component and did not cluster with any other measured environmental parameters. Generally, midstream samples representatively depicted the microbial pollution levels at the respective river sites. However, at a few, somewhat unexpected sites, high pollution levels occurred in the lateral zones of the river while the midstream zone had good water quality. Human faecal pollution was demonstrated as the primary pollution source along the whole river, while animal faecal pollution was of minor importance. This study demonstrates that the application of host-associated genetic microbial source tracking markers in concert with the traditional concept of microbial faecal pollution monitoring based on SFIB significantly enhances the knowledge of the extent and origin of microbial faecal pollution patterns in large rivers. It constitutes a powerful tool to guide target-oriented water quality management in large river basins. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The traditional methods of sewage water quality monitoring are found to be inefficient as they are either fundamentally incorrect, too expensive or based on sampling methods. Therefore, to overcome the challenge, the manuscript has proposed a sewage water quality monitoring framework using multi-parametric sensor for water quality monitoring. It uses cheap and portable multi-parametric sensors, smart-phone and an ad hoc network. The functionality of the proposed framework is tested at sewage treatment plant of Thapar University, Patiala, Punjab in India. The obtained measurements suggest for re-usability of treated sewage water for domestic and irrigation purposes. The sensor's sleep and wake-up states enhances the framework's performance in terms of sustainability for longer time.																	0929-6212	1572-834X				NOV	2017	97	1					881	913		10.1007/s11277-017-4542-3								WOS:000413303700050

Regional differences in impacts to water quality from the bioenergy mandate	BIOMASS & BIOENERGY												The bioenergy mandate under Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA 2007) will result in large scale land-use changes in the US if it is ever fully realized. Energy crops such as switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and miscanthus (Miscanthus X giganteus) can grow well throughout the continental United States; however, most studies on the water quality impacts of land-use change from bioenergy policy are based in the Midwest. Insufficient research has been conducted to determine whether the results from the Midwest are applicable to other regions in the United States. This study compares water quality impacts of converting from corn to switchgrass in the Midwest (Upper Cedar watershed) and Southeast (Lumber watershed) with nitrogen loading to surface water as a proxy metric for overall water quality impacts using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The analysis shows that the fraction of nitrogen runoff compared to the fertilizer applied is 36% in Upper Cedar as compared to 6% in Lumber. Existing management practices like tile-drainage and land-cover like riparian wetlands contribute to this difference in the baseline nitrate export from each watershed. The potential reduction in nitrogen loading per potential liter of ethanol to surface waters, which account for both nitrate export and productivities, from the baseline corn-soy to switchgrass is about 40% for the Upper Cedar watershed and around 80% for the Lumber watershed. Although, the trend in reduction is similar in both watersheds, this study shows that results extrapolated from the Midwest may not be representative of other bioenergy producing regions.

Traditional method for COD measurement is a complex, time-consuming and highly toxic reagents participated procedure. In this study, microbial fuel cell (MFC) was successfully integrated into CW for indicating COD concentration. Results showed that there are two linear correlations between bioelectrical signals (output voltage from MFC) and COD concentration (acetate), which are COD from 0 to 500 mg/L (101.99 +/- 7.42 to 631.74 +/- 7.41 mV, R-2 = 0.9710) and then from 500 to 1000 mg/L (631.74 +/- 7.41 to 668.46 +/- 0.01 mV, R-2 = 0.9245). Furthermore, results also revealed the specificity of the system in terms of different types of carbon source. Overall, this work presented the feasibility of using CW-MFC for insitu sensing COD during the wastewater treatment process, which will be a promising technique for water quality monitoring within CWs.

J	Butler, MJ; Dolan, TW				Butler, Mark J.; Dolan, Thomas W., III			Potential Impacts of Everglades Restoration on Lobster and Hard Bottom Communities in the Florida Keys, FL (USA)	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is intended to restore the Everglades ecosystem (FL, USA) by altering its hydrology, with likely consequences for "downstream" estuarine and marine communities in Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. Spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) are among several species of special concern with respect to CERP because they are of economic and ecological importance and because their nursery habitat may be impacted. We used agent-based, spatially explicit modeling to evaluate the possible impacts of changing water quality (temperature, salinity, harmful algal blooms (HABs)) on spiny lobsters and sponges, the latter of which provide shelter for juvenile lobsters. In our simulations, lobster abundance declined 6-24% in scenarios where salinity either decreased alone or in combination with HABs that kill sponges and are associated with changing water quality. The most severe decline in lobsters occurred when salinity was lowest and HABs occurred annually. One third of this decline was attributable to decreased salinity that increased lobster mortality and movement. However, the greatest impacts on lobsters were indirect. CERP-associated changes in salinity along with HABs caused a die-off of large sponges, resulting in higher predatory mortality on lobsters that depend on sponges for shelter in hard bottom nursery habitats. Sponges declined by similar to 50% in simulations with HABs, whereas decreased salinity alone led to sponge mortality of 9-18%. In contrast, higher temperatures increased juvenile lobster growth and eventual recruitment by approximately 7%. Our results suggest that returning Florida Bay to more estuarine, pre-development conditions is likely to result in an ecosystem reversal that is detrimental to stenohaline marine taxa, a scenario with significant socioeconomic implications.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				NOV	2017	40	6					1523	1539		10.1007/s12237-017-0256-8								WOS:000411505400001

Interactive Effects of Physical and Biogeochemical Feedback Processes in a Large Submersed Plant Bed	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Submersed plants are sensitive to nutrient loading because excess algal growth creates light-limiting conditions. However, submersed plant beds can also modify nutrient cycling through feedback loops whereby algal growth is limited and plant growth is enhanced. Whereas most studies on the effect of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds on nutrient cycling concentrate on either biogeochemical or physical controlling mechanisms, we use a holistic approach that analyzes how these processes interact. We measured a suite of physical and biological processes in a large SAV bed and developed a simple, 1-dimensional reactive transport model to investigate the mechanisms underlying SAV bed effects on nutrient cycling. We observed lower water column concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIN and DIP) inside relative to outside the SAV bed during the summer. Sediment denitrification (mean N-2-N flux in August = 46 mu mol m(-2) h(-1)) and plant nutrient assimilation (August rates = 385 mu mol N and 25 mu mol P m(-2) h(-1)) were mechanisms of nutrient removal. We also found that the physical structure of the bed decreased advection and tidal dispersion, resulting in increased water residence time that enhanced biologically mediated nutrient loss. These processes create conditions that enable SAV to outcompete other primary producers, as water column nutrient concentrations were low enough to limit algal growth and associated light attenuation, while sediment pore water concentrations were sufficient to satisfy SAV nutrient demand. These findings suggest that interactions between physical and biological feedback processes in SAV beds can play a key role in structuring shallow aquatic ecosystems.

J	Zhou, XY; Lei, K; Meng, W; Khu, ST				Zhou, Xi-Yin; Lei, Kun; Meng, Wei; Khu, Soon-Thiam			Industrial structural upgrading and spatial optimization based on water environment carrying capacity	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The industrial wastewater accompanying rapid industrialization has caused severe pollution problems, especially in China. Addressing industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on water environment carrying capacity has become an urgent issue. This paper establishes an analytical framework that uses a combination of economic and water environment information for industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on water environment carrying capacity. This framework promotes the practical application of water environment carrying capacity theory for socio-ecological sustainability. The input-output table, information entropy method and a simulation platform of water environment carrying capacity using a multi-agent system are integrated into the analytical framework. A spatial assessment of the water environment carrying capacity, industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization is performed for Changzhou, China. With the measures implementation of industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization, the economic scale of the electrical equipment and machinery industry, which is the most important industry in Changzhou City, would reach 126,814.68 billion yuan, nearly 73 times its current value. In addition, the total local industrial economy would reach 3319.81 billion yuan, nearly 1.6 times its current scale. Due to the industrial concentration, the increased economic scale would create additional benefits, including the whole study region reaching the water quality goal and the water quality in urban areas significantly improving. The measures of industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization would help to achieve a mutually beneficial balance between environmental protection and economic development. The analytical framework establishes the internal link between industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization based on the water environment carrying capacity. The links from water quality to industrial structure upgrading and spatial optimization are also established. These connections could support the fine-scale management of water environments and could help local governments to plan sustainable socio-ecologic development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of mechanical aeration in the waste-treatment cells of split-pond aquaculture systems on water quality	AQUACULTURE												Split-pond systems divide a traditional pond into a 1: 4 relationship where 20% of the water surface area is designated to fish production and 80% is designated to waste-treatment. Water passes from the fish cell to the waste cell for water quality improvement and flows back to the fish cell. The present study was conducted on a commercial catfish farm in west Alabama that has eight split-ponds, each with a fish-holding section of about 8000 m(2). Two, 10-hp floating, electric paddlewheel aerators were placed in the waste cells of each of four ponds -treatment ponds; while four ponds - the controls - had un-aerated waste cells. Analyses were made for pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, Secchi disk visibility, chlorophyll a, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN; nitrogen in NH3 + NH4+), ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrite-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand (total and soluble), biological oxygen demand, and acidification potential. In Year 1 (2014) ammonia-nitrogen was greater in treatment ponds than control ponds. In Year 2 (2015), greater concentrations for control than treatment ponds were found for TAN, ammonia-nitrogen, total nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand (soluble and total). In Year 3 (2016), greater concentrations were found for control ponds than treatment ponds for TAN, ammonia-nitrogen, total phosphorus, and soluble chemical oxygen demand. Nevertheless, no differences were found between treatments and control ponds for production, yield, and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Best management practices that could help the farmer minimize fish mortality and improve production from previous research are discussed.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				NOV 1	2017	480						32	41		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.001								WOS:000411904700005

This is to improve water quality, and to maintain a hygienic environment for the wellbeing of aquatic organisms. However, chlorination can result in formation of regulated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) that can be carcinogenic and toxic. This study aims to evaluate if an optimal balance can be achieved between minimal regulated DBP formation and effective microbial inactivation with either chlorination or monochloramination for application in the Red Sea aquaculture waters. Upon chlorination, the concentration of total trihalomethanes (THMs), primarily bromoform, exceeded the regulatory limit of 80 mu g/L even at the lowest tested concentration of chlorine (1 mg/L) and contact time (1 h). Comparatively, regulated THMs concentration was only detectable at 30 mu g/L level in one of the three sets of monochloraminated marine aquaculture waters. The average log reduction of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) by chlorine ranged from 2.3-log to 3.2-log with different contact time. The average log reduction of ARB by monochloramine was comparatively lower at 1.9 to 2.9-log. Although viable Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from monochloraminated samples as opposed to chlorinated samples, the abundance of S. aureus was not high enough to result in any significant microbial risks. Both chlorination and monochloramination did not provide any significant improvement in the reduction of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study demonstrates that a systematic evaluation is needed to determine the optimal disinfectant required to balance both microbial and chemical risks. Compared to chlorine, monochloramine may be a more appropriate disinfection strategy for the treatment of aquaculture effluents prior to discharge or for recirculatory use in the aquaculture facility.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				NOV 1	2017	480						94	102		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.014								WOS:000411904700014

Prolonged transport of rainbow trout fingerlings in plastic bags: Optimization of hauling conditions based on survival and water chemistry	AQUACULTURE												Breeding and seed production of rainbow trout is limited to government operated hatcheries in India, which often necessitates the transport of stock size fish to geographically distant farm units. Therefore, the present field study was carried out to derive suitable conditions for prolonged transport of rainbow trout fingerlings in plastic bags. Critical factors such as starvation period (24 vs. 72 h), loading density (13.3, 26.7 and 40 g/L), addition of salt (0, 3 and 6 g/L) and mild sedation with clove oil (0, 10, 20 and 40 mu L/L) were evaluated based on fish survival and changes in total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), un-ionized ammonia (NH3-N), CO2 and pH of the transport water. The experimental fish (mean weight 4 +/- 2 g and mean total length 5.5 +/- 1.5 cm) were packed in plastic bags containing 6 L of stream water and 12 L of pressurized oxygen atmosphere, and transported by road in a refrigerated truck, at a constant temperature of 13 degrees C. The total distance covered and duration taken was 750 km and 40 h, respectively. On the basis of zero fish mortality and least adverse water quality after transport, we suggest that a starvation period of 72 h, loading density of 26.7 g/L and light sedation of fish with 40 mu L/L clove oil prior to packing is suitable for transporting rainbow trout juveniles in plastic bags up to 40 h. To ascertain the benefit of adding salt to the transport medium, we need to further investigate the aspects of delayed mortality and long term fish welfare.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				NOV 1	2017	480						103	107		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.012								WOS:000411904700015

A case study in the Fitzroy Basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The decline in health of the Great Barrier Reef and the pressure on allocating funds efficiently has increased efforts to prioritise where public funds are invested. The Fitzroy basin and coastal catchments is 152,000 square kilometres and geographically diverse. Past work has identified that sediment loads leaving the catchment are posing a high risk to the ongoing health of the Reef and that there is a need to prioritise funds to achieve cost effective outcomes. In this paper we aim to present an alternative approach to effective prioritisation of sediment reductions. The approach integrates spatial information regarding the sediment source and process, levels of adoption, bare ground cover, and cost into a function to rank neighbourhood catchments. The results demonstrate the complexity of the issue and the challenge the Fitzroy Basin Association faces when allocating funds. They also illustrate that there are effective opportunities in particular priority areas within the catchment in which on-ground actions could be undertaken, proving it to be a useful approach in prioritising future investments aimed at achieving cost effective sediment reductions to the Reef.

Use of spatially distributed time-integrated sediment sampling networks and distributed fine sediment modelling to inform catchment management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Under the EU Water Framework Directive, suspended sediment is omitted from environmental quality standards and compliance targets. This omission is partly explained by difficulties in assessing the complex dose-response of ecological communities. But equally, it is hindered by a lack of spatially distributed estimates of suspended sediment variability across catchments. In this paper, we demonstrate the inability of traditional, discrete sampling campaigns for assessing exposure to fine sediment. Sampling frequencies based on Environmental Quality Standard protocols, whilst reflecting typical manual sampling constraints, are unable to determine the magnitude of sediment exposure with an acceptable level of precision. Deviations from actual concentrations range between -35 and +20% based on the interquartile range of simulations. As an alternative, we assess the value of low-cost,, suspended sediment sampling networks for quantifying suspended sediment transfer (SST). In this study of the 362 km(2) upland Esk catchment we observe that spatial patterns of sediment flux are consistent over the two year monitoring period across a network of 17 monitoring sites. This enables the key contributing sub-catchments of Butter Beck (SST: 1141 t km(2) yr(-1)) and Glaisdale Beck (SST: 841 t km(2) yr(-1)) to be identified. The time -integrated samplers offer a feasible alternative to traditional infrequent and discrete sampling approaches for assessing spatio-temporal changes in contamination. In conjunction with a spatially distributed diffuse pollution model (SCIMAP), time-integrated sediment sampling is an effective means of identifying critical sediment source areas in the catchment, which can better inform sediment management strategies for pollution prevention and control.

This study is an attempt to estimate the daily patterns of nutrients transport in the catchment reservoir systems through the application of the ensemble of complementary models SWAT-SALMO. SWAT quantifies flow, nitrate and phosphate loadings originating in catchments before entering downstream reservoirs meanwhile SALMO determines phosphate, nitrate, and chlorophyll-a concentrations within the reservoirs. The study applies to the semi-arid Millbrook catchment-reservoir system that supplies drinking water to north-eastern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. The catchment hosts viti-and horticultural land uses. The warm-monomictic, mesotrophic reservoir is artificially aerated in summer. After validating the simulation results for both Millbrook catchment and reservoir, a comprehensive scenario analysis has been conducted to reveal cascading effects of altered management practices, land uses and climate conditions on water quality in the reservoir. Results suggest that the effect on reservoir condition in summer would be severe, most likely resulting in chlorophyll-a concentrations of greater than 40 mu g/l if the artificial destratification was not applied from early summer. A 50% curbing of water diversion from an external pipeline to the catchment will slightly limit chlorophyll-a concentrations by 1.22% as an effect of reduced inflow phosphate loads. The simulation of prospective land use scenarios converting 50% of present pasture in the Millbrook catchment into residential and orchards areas indicates an increase of summer chlorophyll-a concentrations by 9.5-107.9%, respectively in the reservoir. Global warming scenarios based on the high emission simulated by SWAT-SALMO did result in earlier growth of chlorophyll-a but overall the effects on water quality in the Millbrook reservoir was not significant. However scenarios combining global warming and land use changes resulted in significant eutrophication effects in the reservoir, especially in the unmanaged condition with stratification in summer. This study has demonstrated that complementary model ensembles like SWAT SALMO allow to comprehend more realistically cascading effects of distinct catchment processes on internal reservoir's processes, and facilitate integrated management scenarios.

For this purpose, taking the Sanbanxi Reservoir as a case study, a 2-D hydrodynamic and temperature model covering the whole reservoir was built and calibrated to simulate the flow and temperature fields under different TCC scenarios, and the change rules of thermal stability and outflow temperature are obtained. When the water-retaining proportion (P-r) of bottom TCC increases, the temperature difference between inflow and outflow monotonously decreases, while the thermal stability first increases and later decreases. The maximum thermal stability exists at P-r = 62.5%; it goes against water quality improvement and should be avoided in practice. A bottom-TCC with P-r > 80% is practical for deep reservoirs such as Sanbanxi Reservoir to decrease the temperature difference between inflow and outflow without the increase of thermal stability. In terms of top-TCC, as P-r increases, the temperature difference between inflow and outflow monotonously increases and thermal stability decreases. The top-TCCs are recommended when a smaller thermal stability is more preferentially considered than outflow temperature, or a cool outflow in the summer is required for downstream coldwater fishes. In addition, the TCC cannot decrease or increase the outflow temperature all of the time throughout the whole year, and it primarily changes the phase and variation range of the outflow temperature. This study quantitatively estimates the potential effect of TCCs on the thermal structure and water environment management and provides a theoretical basis for the application of TCC.

J	McAndrew, B; Ahn, C				McAndrew, Brendan; Ahn, Changwoo			Developing an ecosystem model of a floating wetland for water quality improvement on a stormwater pond	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												An ecosystem model was developed to assist with designing and implementing a floating wetland (FW) for water quality management of urban stormwater ponds, focusing on nitrogen (N) removal. The model is comprised of three linked submodels: hydrology, plant growth, and nitrogen. The model was calibrated with the data that resulted from a FW constructed and implemented as part of an interdisciplinary pedagogical project on a university campus, titled "The Rain Project", which raised awareness of stormwater issues while investigating the potential application of green infrastructure for sustainable stormwater management. The FW had been deployed during the summer of 2015 (i.e., May through mid September) on a major stormwater pond located at the center of the Fairfax Campus of George Mason University near Washington, D.C. We used the model to explore the impact of three design elements of FW (i.e., hydraulic residence time (HRT), surface area coverage, and primary productivity) on the function of FW. Model simulations showed enhanced N removal performance as HRT and surface area coverage increased. The relatively low macrophyte productivity observed indicates that, in the case of our pond and FW, N removal was very limited. The model results suggest that even full pond surface coverage would result in meager N removal (similar to 6%) at a HRT of one week. A FW with higher plant productivity, more representative of that reported in the literature, would require only 10% coverage to achieve similar N removal efficiency (similar to 7%). Therefore, macrophyte productivity appears to have a greater impact on FW performance on N removal than surface area coverage or pond HRT. The outcome of the study shows that this model, though limited in scope, may be useful in aiding the design of FW to augment the performance of degraded stormwater ponds in an effort to meet local water quality goals.

Unconventional gas development facilitates plant invasions	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Vegetation removal and soil disturbance from natural resource development, combined with invasive plant propagule pressure, can increase vulnerability to plant invasions. Unconventional oil and gas development produces surface disturbance by way of well pad, road, and pipeline construction, and increased traffic. Little is known about the resulting impacts on plant community assembly, including the spread of invasive plants. Our work was conducted in Pennsylvania forests that overlay the Marcellus and Utica shale formations to determine if invasive plants have spread to edge habitat created by unconventional gas development and to investigate factors associated with their presence. A piecewise structural equation model was used to determine the direct and indirect factors associated with invasive plant establishment on well pads. The model included the following measured or calculated variables: current propagule pressure on local access roads, the spatial extent of the pre-development road network (potential source of invasive propagules), the number of wells per pad (indicator of traffic density), and pad age. Sixty-one percent of the 127 well pads surveyed had at least one invasive plant species present. Invasive plant presence on well pads was positively correlated with local propagule pressure on access roads and indirectly with road density pre-development, the number of wells, and age of the well pad. The vast reserves of unconventional oil and gas are in the early stages of development in the US. Continued development of this underground resource must be paired with careful monitoring and management of surface ecological impacts, including the spread of invasive plants. Prioritizing invasive plant monitoring in unconventional oil and gas development areas with existing roads and multi-well pads could improve early detection and control of invasive plants.

Capsules filled with chromogenic reagent were fixed inside reservoirs. A series of reservoirs were mounted on a revolver. The device can automatically open the reservoirs and the capsule, so that the water sample can come inside then mix and react with the chromogenic reagent. During the reactions, the color data of samples were recorded dynamically and the chromogenic reaction rate constants were derived. According to different reaction rate constants, the concentration of target substance can be determined since the concentration and rate constant are positively correlated. A prototype was built and experiments were carried out to determine concentration of a typical nutrient, nitrite, in water samples to evaluate the effectiveness of the device. It was found that the limit of detection (LOD) for nitrite was approximately 0.01 mg/L. With minor modification, the device can be used to monitor quality parameters in natural water, and wastewater from sewage, agriculture, fishery or industry.

Therefore, monitoring of Hg2+ levels in water is very important in terms of waste management, environmental analysis, toxicology, water safety, and water quality. Here, we provide a highly sensitive and selective colon metric assay to detect Hg2+ in aqueous solution using iodide responsive core-shell Cu@Au nanoparticles (Cu@Au NPs). Iodide can induce an appreciable color change of the Cu@Au NP solution from gray to red by transforming the interconnected, irregularly shaped nanoparticles to the single, separated, and nearly spherical ones. In the presence of Hg2+, the formation of Cu@Au-Hg nanoalloys can protect the Cu@Au NPs from absorbing more iodide in the solution, the solution color turns pale red. When Hg absorbed on the surface of Cu@Au NPs reaches saturation, Hg prevents iodide from reacting with Cu@Au NPs, thus the solution color remains gray. This method exhibits a wide response range from 0.1 nM to 70 nM, and the detection limit (LOD) of 0.037 nM is obtained. Besides, our Cu@Au NPs-based colorimetric sensor exhibits excellent selectivity for Hg2+. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Smart phone assisted detection and quantification of cyanide in drinking water by paper based sensing platform	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL												An organometallic dye, europium tetrakis dibenzoylmethide triethylammonium (EuD(4)TEA) and gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) impregnated paper based sensor platform have been utilized for development of fluorescence turn-on cyanide assay in aqueous media. The ordinary filter paper with 6 mu m pore size were employed as solid support that facilitates impregnation of EuD4TEA and gold nanoparticles and provides durability. Detection mechanism relying on two processes (i) dissolution of gold nanoparticles causing fluorescence recovery and (ii) ligand exchange of triethyl amine with CN group stimulating cyanide specific fluorescence enhancement. The paper platform exhibit naked eye distinguishable color transition upon CN- addition from 10(-2) to 10(-12) M. To standardize the methodology a homemade image processing algorithm has been developed that enabling calibration of color change and quantify CN- concentration. The described algorithm is applicable to Android smart phones and facilitate transforming these devices into a quantitative cyanide detector. The overall methodology provides instrument free cyanide detection and therefore rapid control of water quality and safety at off-field conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, ultrasonic (US) treatment has been well-known as an advanced treatment process for the removal of complex inorganic and organic contaminants in water and WW. US treatment has shown substantial advantages, such as cleanliness, safety, energy savings, and negligible or no secondary pollution products. This review provides a summary of recent research on the removal of EDCs and PPCPs by US treatment and also provides information valuable for applications of US treatment in water and WW treatment. The removal of numerous EDCs and PPCPs of different classes was reviewed based on the current literature to (i) address key factors (water quality conditions (pH, temperature, background common ions, and promoters/scavengers), US frequency, power, and reactor type) influencing the sonodegradation of EDCs and PPCPs and their intermediates during US treatment, (ii) evaluate the effects of various catalysts and hybrid processes on sonodegradation, and (iii) discuss EDC and PPCP removal according to their properties. Additionally, areas of future research in US treatment for the removal of EDCs and PPCPs from water are suggested. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The phosphate adsorption by RC-BOFS was rapid in the first 0.5 h and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model fit the data better than the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The maximum phosphate adsorption capacities of RC-BOFS under different pH were in the following order: 3.57 mg P g(-1) (pH 5) > 2.47 mg P g(-1) (pH 7) > 1.46 mg P g(-1) (pH 9). Small-size RC-BOFS (0.8-2.3 mm) was more efficient with 23% higher phosphate adsorption than big-size RC-BOFS (2.3-4.6 mm). Characterization of RC-BOFS before and after phosphate adsorption by XRD, FTIR and SEM-EDS indicated that phosphate adsorption by RC-BOFS was dominated by metal oxide and precipitation by calcium and was closely related to the slag chemical properties. The phosphate saturation time in constructed wetland with coarse sand was predicted about 292 days, whereas the longevity of constructed wetland with adding about 25% RC-BOFS to the coarse sand can significantly increase up to 1349 days. It was concluded that the horizontal flow constructed wetland with sand 75%: RC-BOFS 25% ratio could achieve high phosphate removal rate and near-neutral pH for meeting the acceptable water quality discharge standard from water treatment plant.

Investigating the effects of heat activated persulfate on the degradation of furfural, a component of hydraulic fracturing fluid chemical additives	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Improper well casings and produced water handling can lead to hydraulic fracturing fluid migration and groundwater pollution. Interactions among the chemical components can cause compositional changes in hydraulic fracturing fluids. This study focuses on degradation or transformations of 3furfuraldehyde (or furfural) by activated-persulfate oxidation, two chemicals reported in hydraulic fracturing additives. As hydraulic fracturing conditions may be conducive to persulfate activation, the degradation of furfural was examined using elevated temperatures, varying persulfate dosing and Fe (III) concentration, initial pH, and the presence of other chemical additives (e.g., a gelling agent and an enzyme breaking agent). Experiments showed furfural degradation using activated persulfate followed pseudo-first order kinetics with respect to the furfural concentration. Impacts of pH and ferric sulfate concentrations were investigated at different temperatures and the results were fit to the Arrhenius model to establish the activation energy. Decreasing the pH to 2.54 caused an increase in the furfural removal. The addition of ferric sulfate to solutions with pH 5.4 had no impact on the activation energy of furfural oxidation, which was 107 kJ mol(-1), while decreasing the pH to 2.54 allowed for the activation energy to decrease to 75 kJ mol(-1). Quenching with methanol and tert-butyl alcohol indicated significant hydroxyl radical contributions to furfural degradation compared to sulfate radicals during thermal persulfate activation in the presence of iron and acidic conditions. Furthermore, furfural degradation was monitored in the presence of other hydraulic fracturing chemical additives establishing furfural degradation does not occur as rapidly. However, furfural does still degrade in this matrix and this indicates that persulfate may break down other chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids more preferentially than the target gelling agent.

The screening of organic matter in mineral and tap water by UHPLC-HRMS	TALANTA												It is highly desirable to screen for a large variety of organic compounds in water. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HAMS) can analyse semi-polar to polar organic compounds in tap and mineral water. The use of UHPLC-HRMS is well consolidated for lipidomic, metabolomic and proteomic studies; based on the detection of a very large number of compounds of a variety of organic functions. Water analysis is usually performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques that are efficient for volatile organic compounds. Therefore the use of UHPLC-HRMS as a screening method based on an untargeted omic approach for the analysis of organic compounds with polar functional groups is welcome. This UHPLC-HRMS method was developed and tested with tap water and mineral water. We analysed six different brands of mineral water from France, Spain, Norway and Brazil and tap water from Jandaia do Sul, PR, Brazil to test the approach and demonstrate how UHPLC-HRMS may be used as a screening method for water quality. Forty-seven different ions were observed in tap and mineral water and their intensities were submitted to principal component analysis (PCA) evaluation. Fifteen ions were identified comparing the mass spectrometric results to metabolomic and lipidomic libraries.

J	Diaz-Gonzalez, M; Baldi, A; Fernandez-Sanchez, C				Diaz-Gonzalez, Maria; Baldi, Antonio; Fernandez-Sanchez, Cesar			Compact sampling device based on wax microfluidics	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL												There is an increasing demand for sampling devices that can provide spatial and temporal information on water quality. Microfluidic systems, applied in combination with the rapid developments in unmanned vehicles (i.e. drones) show the potential to address this challenge. This work reports on the design, fabrication and performance of a low-cost, self-contained sampling device based on a wax microfluidics technology. The sampler with a total size of 18.25 x 18.25 mm(2) integrates 14 electrically controlled wax microvalves that connect the collection outlets to the central chamber. These new wax microvalves are capable of multiple actuation and have small-footprint (0.2 mm(2)), fast-response (<= 0.15 s), and very low energy consumption (< 25 mJ). The sampler device is simple to operate, leak-proof to at least 100 kPa and can be easily fabricated in a single wax stamp transfer using soft-lithography. Water samples containing known concentrations of heavy metals were collected using the wax-valve sampler and further analysed by ICP-MS demonstrating the perfect isolation of the collected samples. Thanks to its small size and low power requirements, the sampler devices described here could be very useful for water sampling from small unmanned vehicles like underwater drones.

Nierop			The efficacy of chemical sanitizers on the reduction of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli affected by bacterial cell history and water quality	FOOD CONTROL												Washing fresh produce with potable water helps to remove microorganisms, providing about a 1- to 2 log reduction, but this process can also pose an opportunity for cross-contamination of bacteria in the washing tank. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of three chemical sanitizers, sodium hypochlorite, chlorine dioxide, and a silver-copper solution on the reduction of S. Typhimurium and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli as well as to evaluate the impact bacterial cell history and water quality had on sanitizer efficacy. This was investigated with three scenarios representing different contamination routes and history of cells: (i) on starved and non-starved cells in potable water, (ii) on starved and non-starved cells in lettuce wash water and on lettuce leaf punches, and (iii) on non starved cells in organically loaded process wash water (PWW). Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) were more effective in preventing cross-contamination in the potable water than the silver-copper solution. Starved and non-starved bacterial cells displayed minor differences in their susceptibility to sanitizing agents in the (i) potable water and (ii) lettuce wash water demonstrating that other conditions greater influenced sanitizer efficacy. Particularly, the organic load of the water, wash water temperature, and pathogen attachment and release from the produce were shown to affect a sanitizer's efficacy during washing. Furthermore, results emphasize that chemical sanitizer use should focus more on wash water disinfection, rather than produce decontamination, to prevent pathogenic cross-contamination during processing. Future research should investigate the feasibility of ClO2 application during pilot-scale processing. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Belowground stressors and long-term seagrass declines in a historically degraded seagrass ecosystem after improved water quality	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Continued seagrass declines in ecosystems with improved water quality may be driven by sediment stressors. One of the most cited examples of a seagrass ecosystem with declines is Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, where 75% of seagrasses (2169 ha) were lost in the 1960s-1980s due to poor water quality. Water quality has subsequently improved in Cockburn Sound, yet shoot density declines continue in some areas. Here, we investigated if sediment stressors (sulfide intrusion and heavy metals) contributed to declining Posidonia sinuosa shoot densities in Cockburn Sound. Seagrass d34S were depleted at sites with a history of seagrass declines, indicating seagrasses at these sites were under sulfide stress. Heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cr, Cu and Cd) in sediments and seagrasses did not show clear patterns with shoot density or biomass, and largely decreased from similar measurements in the late 1970s. However, seagrass cadmium concentrations were negatively correlated to seagrass biomass and shoot density. High cadmium concentrations interfere with sulfur metabolism in terrestrial plants, but impacts on seagrasses remain to be explored. Given that sulfide intrusion can prevent recolonization and drive seagrass declines, management plans in degraded seagrass ecosystems should include management of sediment stressors and water quality to provide comprehensive management.

Seasonal Patterns of Dry Deposition at a High-Elevation Site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In the Colorado Rocky Mountains, high-elevation barren soils are deficient in carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) and enriched in nitrogen (N). The seasonal variability of dry deposition and its contributions to alpine elemental budgets is critical to understanding how dry deposition influences biogeochemical cycling in high-elevation environments. In this 2 year study, we evaluated dry and wet deposition inputs to the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research (NWT LTER) site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. The total organic C flux in wet + dry (including soluble and particulate C) deposition was > 30 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1) and represents a substantial input for this C-limited environment. Our side-by-side comparison of dry deposition collectors with and without marble insert indicated that the insert improved retention of dry deposition by similar to 28%. Annual average dry deposition fluxes of water-soluble organic carbon (4.25 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1)) and other water-soluble constituents, including ammonium (0.16 kg NH4 + ha(-1) yr(-1)), nitrate (1.99 kg NO3- ha(-1) yr(-1)), phosphate (0.08 kg PO43- ha(-1) yr(-1)), and sulfate (1.20 kg SO42- ha(-1) yr(-1)), were comparable to those in wet deposition, with highest values measured in the summer. Backward trajectory analyses implicate air masses passing through the arid west and Four Corners, USA, as dominant source areas for dry deposition, especially in spring months. Synchronous temporal patterns of deposition observed at the NWT LTER site and a distant Rocky Mountain National Park Clean Air Status and Trends Network site indicate that seasonal dry deposition patterns are regional phenomena with important implications for the larger Rocky Mountain region. Plain Language Summary High-elevation environments are considered to be our pristine reference sites; however, these environments are rapidly changing due to climatic and other anthropogenic influences. In the Colorado Rocky Mountains, dust transport and transport of particulate pollutants from urban and agricultural areas may provide substantial inputs of carbon (C) and nutrients to alpine and other high-elevation environments. Although these inputs may have implications for water quality and ecosystem and human health, they have not been well documented. Our 2 year study of both dry and wet deposition inputs to a high-elevation site in the Colorado Rocky Mountains demonstrated that dry inputs were comparable to those in wet deposition, with highest values measured in the summer. The annual organic C input to the study site from the atmosphere was very high and was related to nutrient deposition from adjacent urban and agricultural areas. Spring dust transport with sources in the arid west and Four Corners, USA, also had a measurable influence on the deposition of C, nutrients, and calcium, and magnesium. Similar seasonal deposition patterns at our site and another distant Rocky Mountain site indicate that dry deposition is a regional phenomenon with important implications for the larger Rocky Mountain region.																	2169-897X	2169-8996				OCT 27	2017	122	20					11183	11200		10.1002/2016JD026416								WOS:000417195200036						
J	El Din, ES; Zhang, Y				El Din, Essam Sharaf; Zhang, Yun			Estimation of both optical and nonoptical surface water quality parameters using Landsat 8 OLI imagery and statistical techniques	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Traditional surface water quality assessment is costly, labor intensive, and time consuming; however, remote sensing has the potential to assess surface water quality because of its spatiotemporal consistency. Therefore, estimating concentrations of surface water quality parameters (SWQPs) from satellite imagery is essential. Remote sensing estimation of nonoptical SWQPs, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and dissolved oxygen (DO), has not yet been performed because they are less likely to affect signals measured by satellite sensors. However, concentrations of nonoptical variables may be correlated with optical variables, such as turbidity and total suspended sediments, which do affect the reflected radiation. In this context, an indirect relationship between satellite multispectral data and COD, BOD, and DO can be assumed. Therefore, this research attempts to develop an integrated Landsat 8 band ratios and stepwise regression to estimate concentrations of both optical and nonoptical SWQPs. Compared with previous studies, a significant correlation between Landsat 8 surface reflectance and concentrations of SWQPs was achieved and the obtained coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.85. These findings demonstrated the possibility of using our technique to develop models to estimate concentrations of SWQPs and to generate spatiotemporal maps of SWQPs from Landsat 8 imagery.

This study investigates the effect of different doses of gamma irradiation (50-300 Gy) on the physio-biochemical and molecular mechanism of highland barley under heavy metal stress. Growth data showed that 50-Gy gamma irradiation had the maximal beneficial effects on the highland barley seedlings under lead/cadmium stress. The results of oxidative parameters demonstrated that 50-Gy gamma-irradiated seedlings had lower hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde contents under lead/cadmium stress compared to non-irradiated seedlings. Moreover, the activities of antioxidant enzyme and proline levels in 50-Gy gamma-irradiated seedlings were drastically higher than those in non-irradiated seedlings under lead/cadmium stress. Additionally, transmission electron microscopy results revealed that the 50-Gy gamma-irradiated seedlings exhibited improved chloroplasts ultrastructure compared with non-irradiated seedlings exposed to lead/cadmium stress. Notably, transcriptional expression analysis showed that 50-Gy gamma irradiation could significantly affect the expression of genes related to heavy metal transport and abscisic acid metabolism under lead/cadmium stress. Collectively, these results provide insights into the physio-biochemical and molecular mechanisms of low-dose-gamma-irradiation-enhanced heavy metal tolerance in highland barley seedlings, thus proposing gamma irradiation as a potential technology to mitigate heavy metal toxicity in crops.																	2045-2322					OCT 27	2017	7								14233	10.1038/s41598-017-14601-8								WOS:000413907000056	29079762

Modelling for management: Coral photo-physiology and growth potential under varying turbidity regimes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Suspended and deposited sediments can negatively impact coral health by reducing light penetration and smothering coral tissue. As coral sediment thresholds vary among species and between locations, setting sediment thresholds for the management of activities that increase sediment loads continues to be a challenging goal. Static threshold values used to date do not take into account temporal and spatial variations in a coral's ability to acclimate to high sediment loads leading to either management approaches that are overly conservative or do not protect corals. This study presents a numerical model that quantifies the relationship between coral photosynthesis and growth potential under varying turbidity-driven light regimes. The model accounts for coral acclimation potential as well as a dynamic energy transfer between host and symbiont using field data collected from nearshore reefs in Singapore combined with both established and novel mathematical relationships. The model yielded photosynthetic and respiratory outputs that were comparable to in situ data collected, illustrating the predictive capability of modelling coral growth potential to declines in light driven by suspended sediments. The inclusion of more than one coral species into the model allows for variations in responses to sediments among different coral morphologies and taxa, and will strengthen the predictive capacity for management of sediment related events. As demonstrated here, the model can be used to identify least risk scenarios for dredging operations as a means of both conserving coral reefs as well as ensuring cost-effective management practices.

Samples were collected every 3 months from the Antas reservoir (CAB, P41-E and P14) and from the UTM (P41-S). Chemical and acute 48h toxicity tests using Ceriodaphnia silvestrii and Daphnia magna analyses were carried out to determine the potential environmental risks due to discharging the uranium mine effluents into this reservoir. All the water samples taken from the treated effluent (P41-S) were positively correlated with elevated concentrations of uranium, manganese, aluminum, zinc and fluoride and with high electrical conductivity and pH values, being considered toxic. In November 2014 water samples taken from the reservoir showed chemical concentrations above the legislation limits for fluoride (4.5 mg L-1) uranium (0.082 mg L-1), sulfate (662.4 mg L-1), manganese (1.125 mg L-1) and aluminum (1.55 mg L-1), and in July 2015 for fluoride (2.55 mg L-1), uranium (0.01 mg L-1) and manganese (0.36 mg L-1). The extremely high average value for hardness (543.55 mg L-1) possibly reduced the toxicity potential of this chemical species mixture with respect to the bioindicators. The influence of the variation in water hardness on the toxicity of the cladocerans was discussed.

Partitioning of Antibiotic Resistance Genes and Fecal Indicators Varies Intra and Inter-Storm during Combined Sewer Overflows	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) degrade water quality through the release of microbial contaminants in CSO effluent. Improved understanding of the partitioning of microbial contaminants onto settleable particles can provide insight into their fate in end-of-pipe treatment systems or following release during CSO events. Sampling was performed across the hydrograph for three storm events as well as during baseflow and wet weather in three surface waters impacted by CSO. qPCR was performed for select antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and a marker gene for human fecal indicator organisms (BacHum) in samples processed the partitioning of microbial contaminants on settleable particles versus suspended in the aqueous phase. Amplicon sequencing was performed on both fractions of storm samples to further define the timing and partitioning of microbial contaminants released during CSO events. Samples collected at the CSO outfall exhibited microbial community signatures of wastewater at select time points early or late in the storm events. CSOs were found to be a source of ARG. In surrounding surface waters, sul1 was higher in samples from select locations during wet weather compared to baseflow. Otherwise, ARG concentrations were variable with no differences between baseflow and wet weather conditions. The majority of ARG at the CSO outfall were observed on the attached fraction of samples: 64-79% of sul1 and 59-88% of tet(G). However, the timing of peak ARG and human fecal indicator marker gene BacHum did not necessarily coincide with observation of the microbial signature of wastewater in CSO effluent. Therefore, unit processes that remove settleable particles (e.g., hydrodynamic separators) operated throughout a CSO event would achieve up to (0.5-0.9)-log removal of ARG and fecal indicators by removing the attached fraction of measured genes. Secondary treatment would be required if greater removal of these targets is needed.																	1664-302X					OCT 20	2017	8								2024	10.3389/fmicb.2017.02024								WOS:000413410900002	29104562

In order to re-evaluate its diversity in Irish waters, light and scanning electron microscopy was used to examine populations at 209 river sites and in 85 lakes. The full range of morphological variation of all common and sometimes challenging Brachysira populations was investigated. The study revealed two new species, Brachysira praegeri sp. nov. and Brachysira conamarae sp. nov. and compared them to all closely related taxa. The study also recorded B. intermedia and B. neglectissima which are new records for Ireland. Further taxonomic clarification is required for a diatom resembling B. intermedia and the complex of taxa around the polymorphic B. microcephala. Individual Brachysira taxa differed with respect to their optima along an alkalinity-pH gradient, but the trophic requirements of all forms were comparable, suggesting that species may be merged for routine water quality assessment. Nevertheless, it is recommended that Brachysira morphotypes be enumerated separately until their taxonomy is more fully resolved and their significance for the biodiversity of epilithic communities has been clearly established.																	1179-3155	1179-3163				OCT 20	2017	326	1					1	27		10.11646/phytotaxa.326.1.1								WOS:000413198300001

Predicting how water quality will respond to global changes not only requires water quality data, but also information about the ecological context of individual water bodies across broad spatial extents. Because lake water quality is usually sampled in limited geographic regions, often for limited time periods, assessing the environmental controls of water quality requires compilation of many data sets across broad regions and across time into an integrated database. LAGOS-NE accomplishes this goal for lakes in the northeastern-most 17 US states. LAGOS-NE contains data for 51 101 lakes and reservoirs larger than 4 ha in 17 lake-rich US states. The database includes 3 data modules for: lake location and physical characteristics for all lakes; ecological context (i.e., the land use, geologic, climatic, and hydrologic setting of lakes) for all lakes; and in situ measurements of lake water quality for a subset of the lakes from the past 3 decades for approximately 2600-12 000 lakes depending on the variable. The database contains approximately 150 000 measures of total phosphorus, 200 000 measures of chlorophyll, and 900 000 measures of Secchi depth. The water quality data were compiled from 87 lake water quality data sets from federal, state, tribal, and non-profit agencies, university researchers, and citizen scientists. This database is one of the largest and most comprehensive databases of its type because it includes both in situ measurements and ecological context data. Because ecological context can be used to study a variety of other questions about lakes, streams, and wetlands, this database can also be used as the foundation for other studies of freshwaters at broad spatial and ecological scales.

Such studies have been applied to topics as diverse as human health and environmental ecology. Fewer studies have investigated taxa outside of bacteria, however. We present here data demonstrating the utility of studying taxa outside of bacteria including algae, diatoms, archaea and fungi. Here, we show how location along the Cuya-hoga River as well as a transient rainfall event heavily influence the microbial composition. Our data reveal how individual OTUs vary between samples and how the patterns of OTU abundance can accurately predict sampling location. The clustering of samples reveals that these taxa are all sensitive to water conditions in unique ways and demonstrate that, for our dataset, algae was most distinctive between sample groups, surpassing bacteria. Diversity between sampling sites could allow studies investigating pollution or water quality to identify marker OTUs or patterns of OTU abundance as indicators to assess environmental conditions or the impact of human activity. We also directly compare data derived from primers amplifying distinct taxa and show that taxa besides bacteria are excellent indicators of water condition.

We analysed the relations among concentration of total phosphorus (TP) in the Slapy Reservoir (a middle reservoir of the Vltava River Cascade, Czechia), and socio-economic and climatic factors from 1963 to 2015. The study was based on a time series analysis, using conventional statistical tools, and the identification of breaking points, using a segmented regression. Results indicated clear longterm trends and seasonal patterns of TP, with annual average TP increasing up until 1991 and decreasing from 1992 to 2015. Trends in annual, winter and spring average TP concentrations reflected a shift in development of sewerage and sanitary infrastructure, agricultural application of fertilizers, and livestock production in the early 1990s that was associated with changes from the planned to the market economy. No trends were observed for average TP in autumn. The summer average TP has fluctuated with increased amplitude since 1991 in connection with recent climate warming, changes in thermal stratification stability, increased water flow irregularities, and short-circuiting of TP-rich inflow during high flow events. The climate-change-induced processes confound the generally declining trend in lake-water TP concentration and can result in eutrophication despite decreased phosphorus loads from the catchment. Our findings indicate the need of further reduction of phosphorus sources to meet ecological quality standards of the EU Water Framework Directive because the climate change may lead to a greater susceptibility of the aquatic ecosystem to the supply of nutrients.

Pesticide fate on catchment scale: conceptual modelling of stream CSIA data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) has proven beneficial in the characterization of contaminant degradation in groundwater, but it has never been used to assess pesticide transformation on catchment scale. This study presents concentration and carbon CSIA data of the herbicides S-metolachlor and acetochlor from three locations (plot, drain, and catchment outlets) in a 47 ha agricultural catchment (Bas-Rhin, France). Herbicide concentrations at the catchment outlet were highest (62 mu gL(-1)) in response to an intense rainfall event following herbicide application. Increasing delta C-13 values of S-metolachlor and acetochlor by more than 2% during the study period indicated herbicide degradation. To assist the interpretation of these data, discharge, concentrations, and delta C-13 values of S-metolachlor were modelled with a conceptual mathematical model using the transport formulation by travel-time distributions. Testing of different model setups supported the assumption that degradation half-lives (DT50) increase with increasing soil depth, which can be straightforwardly implemented in conceptual models using travel-time distributions. Moreover, model calibration yielded an estimate of a field-integrated isotopic enrichment factor as opposed to laboratory-based assessments of enrichment factors in closed systems. Thirdly, the Rayleigh equation commonly applied in groundwater studies was tested by our model for its potential to quantify degradation on catchment scale. It provided conservative estimates on the extent of degradation as occurred in stream samples. However, largely exceeding the simulated degradation within the entire catchment, these estimates were not representative of overall degradation on catchment scale. The conceptual modelling approach thus enabled us to upscale sample-based CSIA information on degradation to the catchment scale. Overall, this study demonstrates the benefit of combining monitoring and conceptual modelling of concentration and CSIA data and advocates the use of traveltime distributions for assessing pesticide fate and transport on catchment scale.					van der Velde, Ype/0000-0002-2183-2573; Lutz, Stefanie/0000-0001-9583-7337												1027-5606	1607-7938				OCT 18	2017	21	10					5243	5261		10.5194/hess-21-5243-2017								WOS:000413201600001

Susceptibility of Goethite to Fe2+-Catalyzed Recrystallization over Time	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Recent work has shown that iron oxides, such as goethite and hematite, may recrystallize in the presence of aqueous Fe2+ under anoxic conditions. This process, referred to as Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization, can influence water quality by causing the incorporation/release of environmental contaminants and biological nutrients. Accounting for the effects of Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization on water quality requires knowing the time scale over which recrystallization occurs. Here, we tested the hypothesis that nanoparticulate goethite becomes less susceptible to Fe2+-catalyzed recrystallization over time. We set up two batches of reactors in which Fe-55(2+) tracer was added at two different time points and tracked the Fe-55 partitioning in the aqueous and goethite phases over 60 days. Less Fe-55 uptake occurred between 30 and 60 days than between 0 and 30 days, suggesting goethite recrystallization slowed with time. Fitting the data with a box model indicated that 17% of the goethite recrystallized after 30 days of reaction, and an additional 2% recrystallized between 30 and 60 days. The decreasing susceptibility of goethite to recrystallize as it reacted with aqueous Fe2+ suggested that recrystallization is likely only an important process over short time scales.

Acid Rock Drainage Treatment Using Membrane Distillation: Impacts of Chemical-Free Pretreatment on Scale Formation, Pore Wetting, and Product Water Quality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Acid rock drainage (ARD) is a metal-rich wastewater that forms upon oxidation of sulfidic minerals. Although ARD impacts >12,000 miles of rivers in the U.S. and has an estimated cleanup cost of $32-$72 billion, the low pH and high metal concentrations in ARD make rapid, high volume treatment without chemical addition difficult. This research focuses on a novel method of ARD treatment, membrane distillation (MD). In MD, heated ARD is separated from a cooled distillate by a hydrophobic, water-excluding membrane. Because water only passes through the membrane in the vapor phase, nonvolatile sulfate and heavy metals are retained in the concentrate stream. A preliminary in silico analysis using an electrolyte thermodynamic model indicated that MD of 10 different mine wastes yields product water containing no contaminants at concentrations >0.2 ppm. MD tests of synthetic ARD used a similar to 34 degrees C temperature difference, operated at 80% recovery, and produced an initial flux of 38.4 +/- 1.1 L.m(-2).h(-1). This flux decreased slightly after scaling by iron oxyhydroxide; however, membranes maintained >99% dissolved solids rejection. Both flux decline and membrane scale formation decreased after a chemical-free, thermal precipitation pretreatment. These results indicate that MD can purify contaminated, acidic wastewater using low-grade heat sources, such as geothermal energy, without chemical addition.

Distribution System Operational Deficiencies Coincide with Reported Legionnaires' Disease Clusters in Flint, Michigan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We hypothesize that the increase in reported Legionnaires disease from June 2014 to November 2015 in Genesee County, MI (where Flint is located) was directly linked to the switch to corrosive Flint River water from noncorrosive Detroit water from April 2014 to October 2015. To address the lack of epidemiological data linking the drinking water supplies to disease incidence, we gathered physiochemical and biological water quality data from 2010 to 2016 to evaluate characteristics of the Flint River water that were potentially conducive to Legionella growth. The treated Flint River water was 8.6 times more corrosive than Detroit water in short-term testing, releasing more iron, which is a key Legionella nutrient, while also directly causing disinfectant to decay more rapidly. The Flint River water source was also 0.8-6.7 degrees C warmer in summer months than Detroit water and exceeded the minimum Legionella growth temperature of 20 degrees C more frequently (average number of days per year for Detroit was 63 versus that for the Flint River, which was 157). The corrosive water also led to 1.3-2.2 times more water main breaks in 2014-2015 compared to 2010-2013; such disruptions have been associated with outbreaks in other locales. Importantly, Legionella spp. and Legionella pneumophila decreased after switching back to Detroit water, in terms of both gene markers and culturability, when August and October 2015 were compared to November 2016.

Physicochemical Factors Influence the Abundance and Culturability of Human Enteric Pathogens and Fecal Indicator Organisms in Estuarine Water and Sediment	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												To assess fecal pollution in coastal waters, current monitoring is reliant on culture-based enumeration of bacterial indicators, which does not account for the presence of viable but non-culturable or sediment-associated micro-organisms, preventing effective quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). Seasonal variability in viable but non-culturable or sediment-associated bacteria challenge the use of fecal indicator organisms (FIOs) for water monitoring. We evaluated seasonal changes in FIOs and human enteric pathogen abundance in water and sediments from the Ribble and Conwy estuaries in the UK. Sediments possessed greater bacterial abundance than the overlying water column, however, key pathogenic species (Shigella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella spp., hepatitis A virus, hepatitis E virus and norovirus GI and GII) were not detected in sediments. Salmon ell a was detected in low levels in the Conwy water in spring/summer and norovirus GII was detected in the Ribble water in winter. The abundance of E. coli and Enterococcus spp. quantified by culture-based methods, rarely matched the abundance of these species when measured by qPCR. The discrepancy between these methods was greatest in winter at both estuaries, due to low CFU's, coupled with higher gene copies (GC). Temperature accounted for 60% the variability in bacterial abundance in water in autumn, whilst in winter salinity explained 15% of the variance. Relationships between bacterial indicators/pathogens and physicochemical variables were inconsistent in sediments, no single indicator adequately described occurrence of all bacterial indicators/pathogens. However, important variables included grain size, porosity, clay content and concentrations of Zn, K, and Al. Sediments with greater organic matter content and lower porosity harbored a greater proportion of non-culturable bacteria (including dead cells and extracellular DNA) in winter. Here, we show the link between physicochemical variables and season which govern culturability of human enteric pathogens and FIOs. Therefore, knowledge of these factors is critical for accurate microbial risk assessment.

We tracked changes in metal content in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica, along the NW Mediterranean from 2003 to 2010. While Cu, Cd and Ni showed a large inter-site variation, likely due to local factors, Fe, Mn and Pb showed little local variation and synchronous interannual variability across sites, most likely due to large-scale sources. Zn showed equal importance of local and large-scale sources of variation. Temporal trends of Ni, Zn, Cd, Cu remained almost stable. In contrast, Fe, Mn and Pb slightly increased in the last decade. These trends suggest that metals like Cu, Cd, Ni can be effectively managed at local scale. Whereas, elements like Fe, Mn and Pb have an important large-scale component that needs to be managed across the frontiers of national jurisdictions.

The conversion of natural land-covers into human land uses were detected for protected and unprotected coastal stretches highlighting that the only establishment of a protected area is not enough to stem undesirable land-use outcomes. A survey analysis was also conducted to assess attitudes of beach users and to evaluate their perception of natural habitats, beach and coastal water quality, and coastal dynamic over time. The results of 2071 questionnaires showed that there is similarity between subjective and objective data. However, several beach users perceived a bad quality of coastal water in the legally unprotected coastal area. The implications from a planning and management perspective are discussed.

Waters quality of the Arapiranga and Murucupi rivers were regular to good and bad to good, respectively. Anthropogenic influence on the Murucupi River was higher, mainly by the disposal of domestic effluents from the urban agglomerate and of the industrial waste tailing basins upstream of this river. Due to its less inhabited environment and further away from the area urban and industrial, the Arapiranga River was more preserved.

We conducted dilute-acid extractions and standard elutriate tests to investigate the potential of this exploitation to (1) create a new seafloor with elevated trace metal content, (2) mobilise trace metals during iron sand extraction and, (3) enrich the returning process seawater, which feeds iron sand through mills, with trace metals. We found that recruits of freshly uncovered sediment may encounter higher-than-natural concentrations of cadmium, nickel and chromium (but not of copper, lead, and zinc) and propose to investigate the bioavailability of these metals. Elutriate test with raw and milled iron sand revealed that, for nickel and copper, dilution of the process seawater may be required to meet the local water quality guideline. We argue that this dilution can be achieved by adjustment of the mass and seawater balance of the offshore extraction process.

In this study, the Bay of Izmir (in the eastern Aegean Sea), which is a critical area because of its relationship with marine transportation and industrial and commercial activities, was evaluated for its microbiological and physicochemical parameters through a monitoring program. The data were obtained from seasonally assembled surface seawater samples from 2015 to 2017 at 23 sampling stations. Bacteriological investigations were performed by membrane filtration technique. During the monitoring period, for stations at the inner and middle-outer part, it was found that the inner part is exposed to more number of fecal coliforms (8.8 x 10(2) cfu/100 mL) and fecal streptococci (1.1 x 10(3) cfu/100 mL). The monitoring analysis performed in this study showed that there was negative correlation between physicochemical parameters and the level of fecal bacteria, but no significance was recorded by the Pearson correlation test. Fecal contamination parameters should be routinely monitored for improving the environmental conditions of coastal cities.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				OCT 15	2017	123	1-2					400	403		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.052								WOS:000415776600059	28863975

Acute infectious gastroenteritis is an important cause of illness and death among children in low-income countries. In addition to rotavirus vaccination, actions to improve nutrition status, sanitation, and water quality are important to reduce enteric infections, which are frequent also among asymptomatic children. The aim of this study was to investigate if the high prevalence of these infections reflects that they often are not cleared properly by the immune response or rather is due to frequent pathogen exposure. Methods. Rectal swabs were collected at time of acute diarrhea and 14 days later from 127 children, aged 2-59 months and living in rural Zanzibar, and were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting multiple pathogens. Results. At baseline, detection rates >20% were found for each of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, norovirus GII, and adenovirus. At follow-up, a large proportion of the infections had become cleared (34-100%), or the pathogen load reduced, and this was observed also for agents that were presumably unrelated to diarrhea. Still, the detection frequencies at follow- up were for most agents as high as at baseline, because new infections had been acquired. Neither clearance nor reinfection was associated with moderate malnutrition, which was present in 21% of the children. Conclusions. Children residing in poor socioeconomic conditions, as in Zanzibar, are heavily exposed to enteric pathogens, but capable of rapidly clearing causative and coinfecting pathogens.

Observations in recent years suggest that this resistance may be weakening, shown by: significant increases of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and decreases of dissolved oxygen (DO), common occurrences of phytoplankton taxa that can form Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB), and algal toxins in water and mussels reaching levels of concern. As a result, managers now ask: what levels of chl-a in SFB constitute tipping points of phytoplankton biomass beyond which water quality will become degraded, requiring significant nutrient reductions to avoid impairments? We analyzed data for DO, phytoplankton species composition, chl-a, and algal toxins to derive quantitative relationships between three indicators (HAB abundance, toxin concentrations, DO) and chl-a. Quantile regressions relating HAB abundance and DO to chl-a were significant, indicating SFB is at increased risk of adverse HAB and low DO levels if chl-a continues to increase. Conditional probability analysis (CPA) showed chl-a of 13 mg m(-3) as a "protective" threshold below which probabilities for exceeding alert levels for HAB abundance and toxins were reduced. This threshold was similar to chl-a of 13-16 mg m(-3) that would meet a SFB-wide 80% saturation Water Quality Criterion (WQC) for DO. Higher "at risk" chl-a thresholds from 25 to 40 mg m(-3) corresponded to 0.5 probability of exceeding alert levels for HAB abundance, and for DO below a WQC of 5.0 mg L-1 designated for lower South Bay (LSB) and South Bay (SB). We submit these thresholds as a basis to assess eutrophication status of SFB and to inform nutrient management actions. This approach is transferrable to other estuaries to derive chl-a thresholds protective against eutrophication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Mattone, C; Sheaves, M				Mattone, Carlo; Sheaves, Marcus			Patterns, drivers and implications of dissolved oxygen dynamics in tropical mangrove forests	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Estuarine mangrove forests regulate and facilitate many ecological processes, and provide nursery ground for many commercially important species. However, mangroves grow in sediments with high carbon loading and high respiration rates which can potentially influencing the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics of tidal water flowing into mangrove forests, as bacteria strip DO from the incoming water to carry out metabolic functions. In turn this is likely to influence the way nekton and other aquatic organisms utilize mangrove forests. Despite these possibilities, previous work has focused on looking at DO dynamics within mangrove creeks, with little research focusing on understanding DO dynamics within the mangrove forests themselves during tidal inundation or of DO levels of pools within the forest remaining once the tide has ebbed. The present study investigates the pattern in DO at various distances within an estuarine Rhizophora stylosa forest in tropical north Queensland. DO levels were recorded at 5 min interval over 2 days and multiple tidal cycles, data were collected between 2013 and 2014 for a total of 32 tidal cycles encompassing multiples seasons and tidal amplitudes. There were substantial fluctuations in DO, often varying from normoxic to hypoxic within the same tidal cycle. A range of factors influenced DO dynamics, in particular: tidal height, amount of sunlight, tidal phase, and distance from the outer edge of the mangrove forest. In fact, spring tides tend to have high DO saturation, particularly during the flooding phase, however as the tide starts ebbing, DO depletes rapidly especially in areas further inside the forest. Moreover during tidal disconnection the remnant pools within the forest quickly became anoxic. These variations in DO suggest that the use of mangrove forests by animals is likely to be constrained by their ability to withstand low DO levels, and provides a plausible explanation for the apparent paucity of benthic organism observed inside similar mangrove forest in previous studies of South Pacific mangroves. Low DO levels coupled with low densities of benthic prey also provides a likely explanation for the limited utilisation of landwards areas of these forests by fish and other nekton.

Post-fire hillslope debris flows: Evidence of a distinct erosion process	GEOMORPHOLOGY												After wildfire a hitherto unexplained erosion process that some authors have called 'miniature debris flows on hillslopes' and that leave behind levee-lined rills has been observed in some regions of the world. Despite the unusual proposition of debris flow on planar hillslopes, the process has not received much attention. The objectives of this study were to (1) accumulate observational evidence of Hillslope Debris Flows (HDF) as we have defined the process, to (2) understand their initiation process by conducting runoff experiments on hillslopes, to (3) propose a conceptual model of HDF, and to (4) contrast and classify HDF relative to other erosion and transport processes in the post-wildfire hillslope domain. HDF have been observed at relatively steep slope gradients (0.4-0.8), on a variety of geologies, and after fire of at least moderate severity and consist of a lobe of gravel-to cobble-sized material 0.2-1 m wide that is pushed by runoff damming up behind it. During initiation, runoff moved individual particles that accumulated a small distance downslope until the accumulation of grains failed and formed the granular lobe of the HDF. HDF are a threshold process, and runoff rates of 0.5 L s(-1) 2 L s(-1) were required for their initiation during the experiments. The conceptual model highlights HDF as a geomorphic process distinct from channel debris flows, because they occur on planar, unconfined hillslopes rather than confined channels. HDF can erode very coarse non-cohesive surface soil, which distinguishes them from rill erosion that have suspended and bedload transport. On a matrix of slope and grain size, HDF are enveloped between purely gravity-driven dry ravel, and mostly runoff driven bedload transport in rills.

Biomass was high (306.3 Mg ha(-1)) in original mature forests (MF), and 92.3% lower in strongly degraded (SD) sites. This suggests disproportionally high CO2-emissions via riparian forest degradation and calls for their preferential conservation and restoration to contain global warming. Degradation affected vegetation structure, especially plant size distribution, whereas overall plant abundance did not differ between degradation levels. 'Aninga' (Montrichardia arborescens and M. linifera) forms a conspicuous vegetation component in the aquatic zone, with 12.6% biomass and 58.4% abundance shares, relatively constant up to mid-level degradation but significantly lower in SD. Aninga's forefront position breaks the kinetic energy of waves and currents, making it ideal for erosion-control, we establish allometric equations for aninga biomass estimation. Erosion caused land loss in the aquatic and semiaquatic sections of degraded sites. The biomass share of potentially N2 fixing Fabaceae was significantly higher in both aquatic (41.4%) and semiaquatic (44.8%) zones than in terra firme (6.3%). High denitrification N-losses in alternately aerobe-anaerobe zones could reduce N availability and give N-2-fixing legumes a competitive edge; we therefore recommend N-2-fixing legumes for riparian forest restoration. We find low to moderate changes of vegetation indicators up to mid-level degradation, as opposed to systematically differing SD, pointing to a critical degradation threshold beyond which dysfunctionality impedes riparian ecosystem functioning.

Unionid shells (Hyriopsis cumingii) record manganese cycling at the sediment-water interface in a shallow eutrophic lake in China (Lake Taihu)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Aquatic eutrophication is becoming a serious environmental problem throughout the world. The utility of bi-valves as bio-filters to improve water quality and reduce algal blooms has been widely acknowledged, but the potential usefulness of bivalve shells as retrospective monitors of eutrophication-induced environmental change has received little attention. Here, we present the first multi-year, high-resolution Mn/Ca-shell records of the freshwater mussel, Hyriopsis cumingii (Lea, 1852) from a shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Taihu, China). Mn/Ca-shell time series of the two studied shells exhibit a high degree of synchrony after being placed in a precise temporal context by means of growth pattern analysis. There is a large inter-annual variability of Mn/Casheii records during 20112015, with the highest value occurring in 2013. Mn/Ca-shell also displays a pronounced intra-annual variability with maxima consistently occurring during late spring/early summer. The high reproducibility of Mn/Ca-shell time-series among contemporaneous specimens highlights the existence of strong environmental rather than biological control on the incorporation of Mn into the shells. In particular, the striking feature of late spring/early summertime Mn/Cashell maxima is synchronous with the occurrence of reducing conditions beneath the sediment-water interface (SWI). The latter results in substantial increases of biologically available Mn2+ in the sediment pore water and organic particles, the element being rapidly taken up from these sources by the mussels with subsequent incorporation of Mn into their shells. Therefore, Mn/Ca-shell can potentially serve as a high-resolution proxy of the mobility of Mn at the SWI. As demonstrated by the present study, documenting and understanding geochemical properties of bivalve shells can help to retrospectively monitor eutrophication-induced environmental change in aquatic ecosystems.

In the ZHZ, NaP1 zeolite was covered with hydrous zirconia, which existed as an amorphous phase. Experimental results in pond water indicated that ZHZ could efficiently remove soluble reactive phosphorus. The 28-day sediment incubation experiments showed that capping sediment with ZHZ resulted in a more efficient, rapid and sustained decrease in P concentration when compared with the traditional alum treatment method. Furthermore, ZHZ increased the sediment stability, resulting in. the lowest turbidity, total phosphorus and soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations in overlying water following artificially induced resuspension of sediment. Phosphorus fractionation of sediment showed that the dominant P form transferred from HCl-extractable P to residual P, and the most release-sensitive P (labile P and reductant reactive P) was decreased after ZHZ application. Overall, ZHZ is a highly effective P-immobilization material. ZHZ has high potential as a sediment capping material to control internal P loading in eutrophic water bodies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Chappell, NA; Jones, TD; Tych, W				Chappell, Nick A.; Jones, Timothy D.; Tych, Wlodek			Sampling frequency for water quality variables in streams: Systems analysis to quantify minimum monitoring rates	WATER RESEARCH												Insufficient temporal monitoring of water quality in streams or engineered drains alters the apparent shape of storm chemographs, resulting in shifted model parameterisations and changed interpretations of solute sources that have produced episodes of poor water quality. This so-called 'aliasing' phenomenon is poorly recognised in water research. Using advances in in-situ sensor technology it is now possible to monitor sufficiently frequently to avoid the onset of aliasing. A systems modelling procedure is presented allowing objective identification of sampling rates needed to avoid aliasing within strongly rainfall-driven chemical dynamics. In this study aliasing of storm chemograph shapes was quantified by changes in the time constant parameter (TC) of transfer functions. As a proportion of the original TC, the onset of aliasing varied between watersheds, ranging from 3.9-7.7 to 54-79 %TC (or 110-160 to 300 -600 min). However, a minimum monitoring rate could be identified for all datasets if the modelling results were presented in the form of a new statistic, Delta TC. For the eight H+, DOC and NO3-N datasets examined from a range of watershed settings, an empirically-derived threshold of 1.3(Delta TC) could be used to quantify minimum monitoring rates within sampling protocols to avoid artefacts in subsequent data analysis.

Design of waste stabilization pond systems: A review	WATER RESEARCH												A better design instruction for waste stabilization ponds is needed due to their growing application for wastewater purification, increasingly strict environmental regulations, and the fact that most of previous design manuals are outdated. To critically review model-based designs of typical pond treatment systems, this paper analyzed more than 150 articles, books, and reports from 1956 to 2016. The models developed in these publications ranged from simple rules and equations to more complex first-order and mechanistic models. From a case study on all four approaches, it appeared that rules of thumb is no longer a proper tool for pond designs due to its low design specification and very high output variability and uncertainty. On the other hand, at the beginning phase of design process or in case of low pressure over land and moderate water quality required, regression equations can be useful to form an idea for pond dimensions. More importantly, mechanistic models proved their capacity of generating more precise and comprehensive designs but still need to overcome their lack of calibration and validation, and overparameterization. In another case study, an essential but often overlooked role of uncertainty analysis in pond designs was investigated via a comparison between deterministic and uncertainty based approaches. Unlike applying a safety factor representing all uncertainty sources, probabilistic designs quantify the uncertainty of model outputs by including prior uncertainty of inputs and parameters, which generates more scientifically reliable outcomes for decision makers. Based on these findings, we advise engineers and designers to shift from the conventional approaches to more innovative and economic tools which are suitable for dealing with large variations of natural biological systems.

Effective removal of phosphate from aqueous solution using humic acid coated magnetite nanoparticles	WATER RESEARCH												Effective removal of excess phosphate from water is critical to counteract eutrophication and restore water quality. In this study, low cost, environmentally friendly humic acid coated magnetite nano particles (HA-MNP) were synthesized and applied for the remediation of phosphate from aqueous media. The HA-MNPs, characterized by FTIR, TEM and HAADF-STEM showed the extensive coating of humic acid on the magnetite surface. The magnetic nanoparticles with diameters of 7-12 nm could be easily separated from the reaction mixture by using a simple hand held magnet. Adsorption studies demonstrate the fast and effective separation of phosphate with maximum adsorption capacity of 28.9 mg/g at pH 6.6. The adsorption behavior follows the Freundlich isotherm suggesting the formation of nonuniform multilayers of phosphate on the heterogeneous surface of HA-MNP. The adsorption kinetic fits the pseudo-second order model well with rate constants of 0.206 +/- 0.003, 0.073 +/- 0.002 and 0.061 +/- 0.003 g mg(-1) min(-1) for phosphate (P) concentrations of 2, 5 and 10 mg/L respectively. The removal of phosphate was found higher at acidic and neutral pH compared to basic conditions. The nanoparticles exhibit good selectivity and adsorption efficiency for phosphate in presence of co-existing ions such as Cl-, SO42- and NO3- with some inhibition effect by CO32-. The effect of temperature on the adsorption reveals that the process is endothermic and spontaneous.

This study generated microcosms that mimicked riverbank sediment resuspension into the water of a typical Mediterranean river as a consequence of heavy rainfall. The mobilization and inactivation of six fecal pollution indicators and microbial source tracking markers were evaluated. The T-90 values in the sediments were: 4 days for sorbitol-fermenting Bifidobacterium, 11 days for culturable E. coli, 36 days for bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron strain GA17 and more than 42 days for qPCR-detected E. coli, somatic coliphages and sulfite-reducing clostridia spores. Bacteriophages and bacteria showed different resuspension and sedimentation patterns. The data obtained could be used in predictive models to assess the effects of climate change on surface water quality. Pathogen mobilization into the water column poses a risk for humans, animals and the natural environment, and breaches the One Health approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of a bioanalytical test battery for water quality monitoring: Fingerprinting identified micropollutants and their Contribution to effects in surface water	WATER RESEARCH												Surface waters can contain a diverse range of organic pollutants, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds. While bioassays have been used for water quality monitoring, there is limited knowledge regarding the effects of individual micropollutants and their relationship to the overall mixture effect in water samples. In this study, a battery of in vitro bioassays based on human and fish cell lines and whole organism assays using bacteria, algae, daphnids and fish embryos was assembled for use in water quality monitoring. The selection of bioassays was guided by the principles of adverse outcome pathways in order to cover relevant steps in toxicity pathways known to be triggered by environmental water samples. The effects of 34 water pollutants, which were selected based on hazard quotients, available environmental quality standards and mode of action information, were fingerprinted in the bioassay test battery. There was a relatively good agreement between the experimental results and available literature effect data. The majority of the chemicals were active in the assays indicative of apical effects, while fewer chemicals had a response in the specific reporter gene assays, but these effects were typically triggered at lower concentrations. The single chemical effect data were used to improve published mixture toxicity modeling of water samples from the Danube River. While there was a slight increase in the fraction of the bioanalytical equivalents explained for the Danube River samples, for some endpoints less than 1% of the observed effect could be explained by the studied chemicals. The new mixture models essentially confirmed previous findings from many studies monitoring water quality using both chemical analysis and bioanalytical tools. In short, our results indicate that many more chemicals contribute to the biological effect than those that are typically quantified by chemical monitoring programs or those regulated by environmental quality standards. This study not only demonstrates the utility of fingerprinting single chemicals for an improved understanding of the biological effect of pollutants, but also highlights the need to apply bioassays for water quality monitoring in order to prevent underestimation of the overall biological effect.

An experimental study on the influence of water stagnation and temperature change on water quality in a full-scale domestic drinking water system	WATER RESEARCH												The drinking water quality changes during the transport through distribution systems. Domestic drinking water systems (DDWSs), which include the plumbing between the water meter and consumer's taps, are the most critical points in which water quality may be affected. In distribution networks, the drinking water temperature and water residence time are regarded as indicators of the drinking water quality. This paper describes an experimental research on the influence of stagnation time and temperature change on drinking water quality in a full-scale DDWS. Two sets of stagnation experiments, during winter and summer months, with various stagnation intervals (up to 168 h of stagnation) were carried out. Water and biofilms were sampled at two different taps, a kitchen and a shower tap. Results from this study indicate that temperature and water stagnation affect both chemical and microbial quality in DDWSs, whereas microbial parameters in stagnant water appear to be driven by the temperature of fresh water. Biofilm formed in the shower pipe contained more total and intact cells than the kitchen pipe biofilm. Alphaproteobacteria were found to dominate in the shower biofilm (78% of all Proteobacteria), while in the kitchen tap biofilm Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were evenly distributed.

Modelling the transport and decay processes of microbial tracers in a macro-tidal estuary	WATER RESEARCH												The Loughor Estuary is a macro-tidal coastal basin, located along the Bristol Channel, in the South West of the U.K. The maximum spring tidal range in the estuary is up to 7.5 m, near Burry Port Harbour. This estuarine region can experience severe coastal flooding during high spring tides, including extreme flooding of the intertidal saltmarshes at Llanrhidian, as well as the lower industrial and residential areas at Llanelli and Gowerton. The water quality of this estuarine basin needs to comply with the designated standards for safe recreational bathing and shellfish harvesting industries. The waterbody however, potentially receives overloading of bacterial inputs that enter the estuarine system from both point and diffuse sources. Therefore, a microbial tracer study was carried out to get a better understanding of the faecal bacteria sources and to enable a hydro-environmental model to be refined and calibrated for both advection and dispersion transport. A two-dimensional hydro-environmental model has been refined and extended to predict the highest water level covering the intertidal floodplains of the Loughor Estuary. The validated hydrodynamic model for both water levels and currents, was included with the injected mass of microbial tracer, i.e. MS2 coliphage from upstream of the estuary, and modelled as a non-conservative tracer over several tidal cycles through the system. The calibration and validation of the transport and decay of microbial tracer was undertaken, by comparing the model results and the measured data at two different sampling locations. The refined model developed as a part of this study, was used to acquire a better understanding of the water quality processes and the potential sources of bacterial pollution in the estuary.

Health risks from exposure to untreated wastewater used for irrigation in the Mezquital Valley, Mexico: A 25-year update	WATER RESEARCH												Wastewater reuse for agriculture is common worldwide; wastewater treatment, however, is rare in many countries, leading to high potential for exposure to harmful pathogens. Mexico City, one of the largest producers of untreated wastewater for agricultural use worldwide, was the site of key epidemiologic studies conducted in the 1990s. We both reviewed the literature on and conducted a cross-sectional study of diarrheal risk and wastewater contamination to provide an updated assessment of health risks and to inform an upcoming update of the 2006 WHO guidelines on wastewater reuse. We surveyed communities in the Mezquital Valley that use wastewater for irrigation and communities that use well water to compare the prevalence of self-reported diarrheal disease in children under five years old. Wastewater, well water, household environmental samples, and stool samples were collected and analyzed. Communities exposed to wastewater had a higher one-week prevalence of diarrhea (10%) compared to unexposed communities (5%). This association remained in an adjusted modified Poisson regression model (PR = 2.31, 95% CI 1.00, 531), but not when limited to households engaged in agriculture. Water quality indicators document differences between irrigation water from the two community groups. These results are in agreement with 25 population studies identified by our review that were conducted since or not included in the 2006 WHO guidelines and show consistent negative impacts of wastewater exposure on health. While overall diarrheal prevalence has declined when compared to studies conducted over 25 years ago in the same region, the association of diarrheal disease and wastewater exposure has remained and possibly increased. With rising urbanization worldwide, attention to these risks and wastewater treatment is becoming increasingly important. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The use of reclaimed municipal wastewater for this purpose was demonstrated by numerous studies and full-scale installations. On the other hand, reuse of industrial effluents in irrigation is uncommon and the knowledge in this field is limited. This work aims at assessing the suitability of agro-industrial effluent reuse for irrigation. In the case study presented, a full-scale tertiary treatment based on membrane ultrafiltration and UV disinfection was tested at an agro-industrial site in Apulia (Italy). The wastewater treatment plant processed the stream produced at a vegetable canning factory, and the treated effluents were used for field scale irrigation tests. The variability of wastewater quality and its effects on treatment process performances and reclaimed water quality were investigated. An economic evaluation of the full scale tertiary treatment was also performed. The results showed that the adopted technologies effectively removed suspended solids and the faecal indicator Escherichia coli below the local standards for reuse in irrigation. Furthermore, the use of treated agro-industrial wastewater had no inhibitory effects on the growth of tomato and broccoli, neither resulted in any faecal contamination of crops. In general, the present study shows that reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation is a suitable practice to close the water cycle in the agro-industrial sector. This is very important in areas where the sustainability of agriculture and transformation activities depends on the water available for irrigation. This practice also avoids the discharge of pollutants into water bodies, reducing the environmental impacts of agro-industrial productions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In storage ecosystems, the natural process of solar light irradiation plays a key role in water quality, altering disinfection byproduct formation potential in later use. This study investigated changes in haloacetamide formation potential (HAcAm FP) during subsequent chloramination when reclaimed water was exposed to solar light irradiation. Significant decreases in HAcAm FP were observed for the solar light irradiated reclaimed water, with reductions of 27%-69% for different haloacetamides. Moreover, transformation of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) to inorganic nitrogen occurred during irradiation. The application of N-15-labeled monochloramine indicated that the nitrogen source of the decreased HAcAms mainly originated from DON, rather than chloramine. Chloramination of the model compound L-asparagine after irradiation demonstrated that the decreased HAcAms could be attributed to the decrease in DON. After solar light irradiation, the brominated HAcAm FP in the presence of bromide was also reduced, while the bromine incorporation factor remained steady. Overall, this study revealed the contribution of natural processes in controlling HAcAm FP during subsequent chloramination, suggesting solar light irradiation is important to water purification during reclaimed water storage.

FO was osmotically driven by seawater used as cooling water. FO-treated wastewater was diluted with seawater and then further processed by RO. Seasonal variation in water flux, fouling behavior and reversibility, and energy consumption in both FO and RO were systematically evaluated during 5 months of pilot operation. The FO water flux, which declined due to the organic fouling induced by the wastewater from the coal-fired power plant, was readily recovered by physical cleaning. The integrated FO-RO dilution process was able to reduce the RO fouling potential through FO treatment of wastewater, significantly decreasing SDI value to 1.5 +/- 0.1. This study also reported energy consumption data, to our knowledge for the first time, at pilot scale operation of FO-RO dilution process, and showed that total energy consumption for desalinating the diluted feed, including wastewater reclamation by FO, was 15% less than that of typical seawater desalination by RO. The results of this FO-RO pilot study demonstrated that sustainable FO-RO operation can be achieved in the treatment of power plant wastewater owing to easy fouling control, low energy consumption, and superior final water quality.																	0376-7388	1873-3123				OCT 15	2017	540						78	87		10.1016/j.memsci.2017.06.036								WOS:000407954300009

Hydraulic backwashing for low-pressure membranes in drinking water treatment: A review	JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE												Conventional drinking water treatment processes have faced several obstacles that are severely affected by water pollution and shortage, which makes it difficult to produce potable water effectively. Low-pressure membrane filtration, which includes ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF), is one of the most promising treatment technologies for improving water quality. Periodic hydraulic backwashing is a necessity for the routine operation of UF/MF membranes, but only sparse data are available regarding the optimization of backwashing procedures, while more attention has been directed toward membrane fouling and cleaning. In the current work, we critically review the backwashing parameters of UF/MF membranes used in municipal water supplies. These parameters include pressure, flux, permeability (or resistance), mass balance, and membrane characterization techniques. The factors affecting backwash performance, which include membrane properties, feed water properties and operating conditions, are discussed in detail. The pretreatments of feed water, such as peroxidation, adsorption, coagulation and filtration influence the performance of UF/MF membranes to varying extents. The impacts of the backwash interval, backwash duration, backwash strength, air-assisted backwashing, chemically enhanced backwashing, and backwash water quality on backwash performance are summarized to provide more comprehensive data, which can improve backwash performance in full-scale drinking water and water reuse treatment plants.

Herein, a superstructural phosphate scavenger, La-MOF-500, composed of La2O2CO3, is rationally designed by derivation from lanthanum metal organic frameworks (La(1,3,5-BTC)(H2O)(6)) by calcination. La-MOF-500 has a hierarchical micro/nano structure of microsphere-nanorod-nanoparticle: urchin-like microsphere is comprised of many nanorods and the individual nanorod was formed by piling up plentiful thin nanoparticles. The hierarchical micro/nano structure provides La-MOF-500 with an intriguing phosphate capture capacity of 173.8 mg P/g and a high utilization of lanthanum active sites, simultaneously, which was a challenge in previous research. Moreover, La-MOF-500 exhibits a good tolerance of foreign species. Even in the water from Songhua River (China), La-MOF-500 can remove phosphate to be less than 10 mu g P/L. This development is expected to be meaningful for practical water purification. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The utility of fingernail clippings as a biomarker for F- exposure and EF was also assessed for the first time in a high-F- region. The study recorded the EF status of 386 individuals (10 to 50 years old), who consume naturally contaminated groundwater with widely varying F- concentration (0.615 mg/L). The mean F- concentrations among residents of communities with primary reliance on groundwater were 5.1 mg/kg (range: 0.534 mg/kg) in fingernails and 8.9 mg/L (range: 0.4434 mg/L) in urine. We show strong positive correlations between F- in drinking water and 12-hour urinary excretion (r = 0.74, p < 0.001, n = 287), fingernail F- content (r = 0.6, p < 0.001, n = 258), and mean individual measures of EF severity as measured using the Thylstrup and Fejerskov (TF) Index (r = 0.42, p < 0.001, n = 316). The data indicate that both fingernail and urine measures are good biomarkers for F- exposure and EF outcomes, the latter being slightly more sensitive. Cases of moderate/severe EF were significantly more common among younger subjects (10 to 15 years old) than older subjects (mostly > 25 years old) (p < 0.001), consistent with their greater exposure to F- during early childhood, which is the only period of life the enamel is at risk of fluorosis. In this younger population, EF may be useful as a biomarker for identifying individuals with other potential health effects that depend on a specific age window of susceptibility. The finding of exceptionally high F(-)concentrations in water, fingernail clippings and urine in this region should motivate further investigations of other potential health consequences such as bone disease and abnormalities in the function of the neurological and endocrine systems.

PPCP residues are frequently detected in drinking water sources, sewage treatment plants (STPs), and water treatment plants (WTPs) due to their universal consumption, low human metabolic capability, and improper disposal. When partially metabolized PPCPs are transferred into STPs, they elicit negative effects on biological treatment processes; therefore, conventional STPs are insufficient when it comes to PPCP removal. Furthermore, the excreted metabolites may become secondary pollutants and can be further modified in receiving water bodies. Several advanced treatment systems, including membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, and advanced oxidation processes, have been used for the effective removal of individual PPCPs. This review covers the occurrence patterns of PPCPs in water environments and the techniques adopted for their treatment in STP/WTP unit processes operating in various countries. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the removal and fate of PPCPs in different treatment facilities as well as the optimum methods for their elimination in STP and WTP systems.

Temporal characterization of flowback and produced water quality from a hydraulically fractured oil and gas well	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study examined water quality, naturally-occurring radioactive materials (NORM), major ions, trace metals, and well flow data for water used and produced from start-up to operation of an oil and gas producing hydraulically- fractured well (horizontal) in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin in northeastern Colorado. Analysis was conducted on the groundwater used to make the fracturing fluid, the fracturing fluid itself, and nine flowback/ produced water samples over 220 days of operation. The chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater produced during operation decreased from 8200 to 2500 mg/L, while the total dissolved solids (TDS) increased in this same period from 14,200 to roughly 19,000mg/L. NORM, trace metals, and major ion levels were generally correlated with TDS, and were lower than other shale basins (e.g. Marcellus and Bakken). Although at lower levels, the salinity and its origin appear to be the result of a similar mechanism to that of other shale basins when comparing Cl/Br, Na/Br, and Mg/Br ratios. Volumes of returned wastewater were low, with only 3% of the volume injected (11 million liters) returning as flowback by day 15 and 30% returning by day 220. Low levels of TDS indicate a potentially treatment-amenable wastewater, but low volumes of flowback could limit onsite reuse in the DJ Basin. These results offer insight into the temporal water quality changes in the days and months following flowback, along with considerations and implications for water reuse in future hydraulic fracturing or for environmental discharge.

Assessment of the SWAT model to simulate a watershed with limited available data in the Pampas region, Argentina	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Argentina has been among the world leaders in the production and export of agricultural products since the 1990s. The Carcarana River Lower Basin (CRLB), a cropland of the Pampas region supplied by extensive rainfall, is located in an area with few streamgauging and other hydrologic/water-quality stations. Therefore, limited hydrologic data are available resulting in limited water-resources assessment. This work explores the application of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to the CRLB in the Santa Fe province of the Pampas region. The analysis of field and remote-sensing data characterizing hydrology, water quality, soil types, land use/land cover, management practices, and crop yield, guarantee a comprehensive SWAT modeling approach. A combined manual and automated calibration and validation process incorporating sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is performed using information concerning interior watershed processes. Eleven N/P fertilizer rates are selected to simulate the impact of N fertilizer on crop yield, plant uptake, as well as runoff and leaching losses. Different indices (partial factor productivity, agronomic efficiency, apparent crop recovery efficiency of applied nutrient, internal utilization efficiency, and physiological efficiency) are considered to assess nitrogen-use efficiency. The overall quality of the fit is satisfactory considering the input data limitations. This work provides, for the first time in Argentina, a reliable tool to simulate yield response to soil quality and water availability capable to meet defined environmental targets to support decision making on planning public policies and private activities on the Pampas region.

Ecosystem structure refers to characteristics such as channel form, water quality or the composition of biological communities, whereas ecosystem functioning refers to processes such as metabolism, organic matter decomposition or secondary production. Structure and functioning respond in contrasting and complementary ways to environmental stressors. Moreover, assessing the response of ecosystem functioning to stressors is critical to understand the effects on the ecosystem services that produce direct benefits to humans. Yet, there is more information on structural than on functional parameters, and despite the many approaches available to measure river ecosystem processes, structural approaches are more widely used, especially in management. One reason for this discrepancy is the lack of synthetic studies analyzing river ecosystem functioning in a way that is useful for both scientists and managers. Here, we present a synthesis of key river ecosystem processes, which provides a description of the main characteristics of each process, including criteria guiding their measurement as well as their respective sensitivity to stressors. We also discuss the current limitations, potential improvements and future steps that the use of functional measures in rivers needs to face. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

Long-term acoustic monitoring of fish calling provides baseline estimates of reproductive time-lines in the May River estuary, southeastern USA	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												In this study, our goal was to perform acoustic monitoring of the May River, South Carolina (USA), for a 9 mo period and estimate reproductive timelines for a community of soniferous fishes. Acoustic recorders were deployed to collect sound samples for 2 min, every 20 min at 4 stations from the source to the mouth from February to November 2013. We detected the acoustic presence of 6 fish species: Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus, black drum Pogonias cromis, silver perch Bairdiella chrysoura, oyster toadfish Opsanus tau, spotted sea trout Cynoscion nebulosus, and red drum Sciaenops ocellatus. Acoustic detection rates and diversity of soniferous fish were higher near the mouth and de creased towards the source, suggesting a selection of deeper water and/or more stable water quality conditions for spawning. We estimated the start and end dates of the spawning season and calculated the total hours of chorusing for silver perch, oyster toadfish, spotted seatrout, and red drum. Each species followed a specific seasonal and daily pattern of calling, and we observed synchrony of these calling patterns among stations. For silver perch, oyster toadfish, black drum, and spotted seatrout, a negative tem perature anomaly correlated with decreased calling intensity, while a positive anomaly increased sound production. For oyster toadfish and spotted seatrout, the lunar phase significantly influenced calling. These data serve as a foundation for future studies that are investigating how climate variability may affect seasonal spawning timelines and year class strength of fish populations using passive acoustic monitoring.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				OCT 13	2017	581						1	19		10.3354/meps12322								WOS:000414582700001

High Dose MicroCT Does Not Contribute Toward Improved MicroPET/CT Image Quantitative Accuracy and Can Limit Longitudinal Scanning of Small Animals	FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS												Obtaining accurate quantitative measurements in preclinical Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) imaging is of paramount importance in biomedical research and helps supporting efficient translation of preclinical results to the clinic. The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to investigate the effects of different CT acquisition protocols on PET/CT image quality and data quantification; and (2) to evaluate the absorbed dose associated with varying CT parameters. Methods: An air/water quality control CT phantom, tissue equivalent material phantom, an in-house 3D printed phantom and an image quality PET/CT phantom were imaged using a Mediso nanoPET/CT scanner. Collected data was analyzed using PMOD software, VivoQuant software and National Electric Manufactures Association (NEMA) software implemented by Mediso. Measured Hounsfield Unit (HU) in collected CT images were compared to the known HU values and image noise was quantified. PET recovery coefficients (RC), uniformity and quantitative bias were also measured. Results: Only less than 2 and 1% of CT acquisition protocols yielded water HU values < -80 and air HU values < -840, respectively. Four out of 11 CT protocols resulted in more than 100 mGy absorbed dose. Different CT protocols did not impact PET uniformity and RC, and resulted in < 4% overall bias relative to expected radioactive concentration. Conclusion: Preclinical CT protocols with increased exposure times can result in high absorbed doses to the small animals. These should be avoided, as they do not contributed toward improved microPET/CT image quantitative accuracy and could limit longitudinal scanning of small animals.																	2296-424X					OCT 13	2017	5								50	10.3389/fphy.2017.00050								WOS:000412887700001

Epilithon and water samples were collected in the basin from 14 sampling sites three times each, two sampling campaigns during the rainy season and one in the dry season. A total of 274 infrageneric taxa in 48 genera were recorded. The taxonomic composition observed was dominated by taxa from the genera Nitzschia, Gomphonema, Pinnularia, Navicula, Sellaphora and Eunotia. About a third of the taxa found could not be identified to the species level. From those unidentified morphodemes, two are described as new species, namely Brachysira altepetlensis and Sellaphora queretana. Furthermore, Eolimna rhombica is transferred to Sellaphora. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed that specific conductivity and pH were the main environmental factors driving the community composition observed. Three groups of samples were identified after the CCA: 1) characterized by acidic waters and low conductivity; 2) with circumneutral waters, low specific conductivity and high temperature and phosphorous concentrations; and 3) characterized by circumneutral waters, high conductivity and low nitrogen concentrations. The indicator value method (IndVal), based on the relative abundance and relative frequency of the most abundant taxa was calculated based on the groups observed in the CCA, identifying the characteristic taxa for each of the three groups.																	1314-2011	1314-2003				OCT 11	2017		88					39	69		10.3897/phytokeys.88.14612								WOS:000414224500002	29118646

The ability of algal organic matter and surface runoff to promote the abundance of pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Long Island Sound, USA	PLOS ONE												Food safety is a major concern in the shellfish industry, as severe illness can result from consuming shellfish that have accumulated waterborne pathogens. Shellfish harvesting areas are typically monitored for indicator bacteria such as fecal coliforms that serve as proxies for enteric pathogens although these indicators have shown little relation to some naturally occurring pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus. To examine the dynamics and ecology of pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of V. parahaemolyticus and address the relevance of indicator bacteria in predicting V. parahaemolyticus concentrations, field surveys and experiments were carried out in western Long Island Sound, NY, USA, a region that has experienced recent outbreaks of shellfish contaminated with V. parahaemolyticus. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains were quantified via PCR detection of marker genes and most probable number techniques. Field survey data showed little correspondence between fecal coliforms and V. parahaemolyticus, but significant correlations between V. parahaemolyticus and an alternative indicator, enterococci, and between V. parahaemolyticus and short-term (48 h) rainfall were observed. Experiments demonstrated that enrichment of seawater with phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter significantly increased the concentration of total V. parahaemolyticus and the presence pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, but higher temperatures did not. Collectively, these study results suggest that fecal coliforms may fail to account for the full suite of important shellfish pathogens but that enterococci could provide a potential alternative or supplement to shellfish sanitation monitoring. Given the ability of algal-derived dissolved organic matter to promote the growth of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus, restricting nutrient inputs into coastal water bodies that promote algal blooms may indirectly decrease the proliferation of V. parahaemolyticus and protect public health.																	1932-6203					OCT 11	2017	12	10							e0185994	10.1371/journal.pone.0185994								WOS:000412754400056	29020074

The mechanism of red tide occurrence has been studied for many years, and a lot of indicators and techniques have been developed. Although these studies have effectively expanded the knowledge of mechanisms of red tide occurrence, the combination effect of water quality factors of different sea areas on red tide occurrence has not received enough attention. In this paper, a water quality factor dissimilarity network model (WDN), which can systematically reflect water quality of different sea areas, is presented. According to this model, a series of WDN networks are constructed with the data collected from monitoring stations of Bohai Sea and North Yellow Sea, and a novel red tide detection approach based on the outlier analysis of node strengths is proposed. Based on the analysis of the results obtained using this approach, the locality, the seasonality and the alternation of red tide occurrences are revealed. The validation from actual red tide events shows that our model and approach perform effectively and contribute to expanding the knowledge of mechanisms of red tide occurrence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, P; Benoit, G				Wang, Peng; Benoit, Gaboury			Modeling the biogeochemical role of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria in phosphorus cycling in a managed eutrophic lake	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Vertical distributions of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), sulfide, chlorophyll, and primary production produced by photosynthetic sulfur bacteria (PSB) were studied in a small stratified, highly productive, and dimictic lake, Linsley Pond, CT, USA. The goal was to understand and model the role of PSB in a lake undergoing trophic transformation as a result of lake management involving reduced phosphorus loading. High levels of sulfide developed in the anoxic hypolimnion, though a decrease was observed compared to earlier years, possibly as a result of lake management under a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) process. A deep chlorophyll maximum was observed, and absorption spectra confirmed that it was the result of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria. The summer chlorophyll maximum occurred at an interface marked by high amounts of sulfide and low, but adequate, levels of light. Primary production by PSB was found at a depth of 7 m in July 2008, and thereafter extended slowly to 9 m until late fall overturn. PSB only contributed a minor portion of total primary production in Linsley Pond that year, but a straightforward biogeochemical phosphorus model reveals that the existence of PSB serves as a significant biological barrier for phosphorus being transported back into the upper mixing zone. A large amount of TDP was trapped in the hypolimnion, and upward transport of TDP from the upper boundary of the hypolimnion to the mixing zone was about 30% of external phosphorus loading from the only tributary during the summer stratification period. By comparison, the amount of TDP assimilated by PSB and settling back to the hypolimnion was comparable to external phosphorus loading to the lake from its tributary. As lake management reduces external P loading and productivity, bottom sulfide is likely to decrease, suppressing PSB activity and having the undesired effect of allowing more TDP to be transported upward to the epilimnion as this biological barrier is suppressed.

Upstream watershed condition predicts rural children's health across 35 developing countries	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Diarrheal disease (DD) due to contaminated water is a major cause of child mortality globally. Forests and wetlands can provide ecosystem services that help maintain water quality. To understand the connections between land cover and childhood DD, we compiled a database of 293,362 children in 35 countries with information on health, socioeconomic factors, climate, and watershed condition. Using hierarchical models, here we find that higher upstream tree cover is associated with lower probability of DD downstream. This effect is significant for rural households but not for urban households, suggesting differing dependence on watershed conditions. In rural areas, the effect of a 30% increase in upstream tree cover is similar to the effect of improved sanitation, but smaller than the effect of improved water source, wealth or education. We conclude that maintaining natural capital within watersheds can be an important public health investment, especially for populations with low levels of built capital.

J	Wang, XP; Zhang, F; Ding, JL				Wang, Xiaoping; Zhang, Fei; Ding, Jianli			Evaluation of water quality based on a machine learning algorithm and water quality index for the Ebinur Lake Watershed, China	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The water quality index (WQI) has been used to identify threats to water quality and to support better water resource management. This study combines a machine learning algorithm, WQI, and remote sensing spectral indices (difference index, DI; ratio index, RI; and normalized difference index, NDI) through fractional derivatives methods and in turn establishes a model for estimating and assessing the WQI. The results show that the calculated WQI values range between 56.61 and 2,886.51. We also explore the relationship between reflectance data and the WQI. The number of bands with correlation coefficients passing a significance test at 0.01 first increases and then decreases with a peak appearing after 1.6 orders. WQI and DI as well as RI and NDI correlation coefficients between optimal band combinations of the peak also appear after 1.6 orders with R-2 values of 0.92, 0.58 and 0.92. Finally, 22 WQI estimation models were established by POS-SVR to compare the predictive effects of these models. The models based on a spectral index of 1.6 were found to perform much better than the others, with an R-2 of 0.92, an RMSE of 58.4, and an RPD of 2.81 and a slope of curve fitting of 0.97.																	2045-2322					OCT 9	2017	7								12858	10.1038/s41598-017-12853-y								WOS:000412655900005	28993639

Effects of changes in nutrient loading and composition on hypoxia dynamics and internal nutrient cycling of a stratified coastal lagoon	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The effects of changes in catchment nutrient loading and composition on the phytoplankton dynamics, development of hypoxia and internal nutrient dynamics in a stratified coastal lagoon system (the Gippsland Lakes) were investigated using a 3-D coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical water quality model. The study showed that primary production was equally sensitive to changed dissolved inorganic and particulate organic nitrogen loads, highlighting the need for a better understanding of particulate organic matter bioavailability. Stratification and sediment carbon enrichment were the main drivers for the hypoxia and subsequent sediment phosphorus release in Lake King. High primary production stimulated by large nitrogen loading brought on by a winter flood contributed almost all the sediment carbon deposition (as opposed to catchment loads), which was ultimately responsible for summer bottom-water hypoxia. Interestingly, internal recycling of phosphorus was more sensitive to changed nitrogen loads than total phosphorus loads, highlighting the potential importance of nitrogen loads exerting a control over systems that become phosphorus limited (such as during summer nitrogen-fixing blooms of cyanobacteria). Therefore, the current study highlighted the need to reduce both total nitrogen and total phosphorus for water quality improvement in estuarine systems.																	1726-4170	1726-4189				OCT 6	2017	14	19					4423	4433		10.5194/bg-14-4423-2017								WOS:000412383600001						
J	Tecklenburg, C; Blume, T				Tecklenburg, Christina; Blume, Theresa			Identifying, characterizing and predicting spatial patterns of lacustrine groundwater discharge	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) can significantly affect lake water balances and lake water quality. However, quantifying LGD and its spatial patterns is challenging because of the large spatial extent of the aquiferlake interface and pronounced spatial variability. This is the first experimental study to specifically study these larger-scale patterns with sufficient spatial resolution to systematically investigate how landscape and local characteristics affect the spatial variability in LGD. We measured vertical temperature profiles around a 0.49 km(2) lake in northeastern Germany with a needle thermistor, which has the advantage of allowing for rapid (manual) measurements and thus, when used in a survey, high spatial coverage and resolution. Groundwater inflow rates were then estimated using the heat transport equation. These near-shore temperature profiles were complemented with sediment temperature measurements with a fibre-optic cable along six transects from shoreline to shoreline and radon measurements of lake water samples to qualitatively identify LGD patterns in the offshore part of the lake. As the hydrogeology of the catchment is sufficiently homogeneous (sandy sediments of a glacial outwash plain; no bedrock control) to avoid patterns being dominated by geological discontinuities, we were able to test the common assumptions that spatial patterns of LGD are mainly controlled by sediment characteristics and the groundwater flow field. We also tested the assumption that topographic gradients can be used as a proxy for gradients of the groundwater flow field. Thanks to the extensive data set, these tests could be carried out in a nested design, considering both small-and large-scale variability in LGD. We found that LGD was concentrated in the near-shore area, but along-shore variability was high, with specific regions of higher rates and higher spatial variability. Median inflow rates were 44 Lm(-2) d(-1) with maximum rates in certain locations going up to 169 Lm(-2) d(-1). Offshore LGD was negligible except for two local hotspots on steep steps in the lake bed topography. Large-scale groundwater inflow patterns were correlated with topography and the groundwater flow field, whereas small-scale patterns correlated with grain size distributions of the lake sediment. These findings confirm results and assumptions of theoretical and modelling studies more systematically than was previously possible with coarser sampling designs. However, we also found that a significant fraction of the variance in LGD could not be explained by these controls alone and that additional processes need to be considered. While regression models using these controls as explanatory variables had limited power to predict LGD rates, the results nevertheless encourage the use of topographic indices and sediment heterogeneity as an aid for targeted campaigns in future studies of groundwater discharge to lakes.

Solid phase phase microextraction and gas chromatography coupled to magnetic sector high resolution mass spectrometry for the ultra-trace determination of contaminants in surface water	JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A					16th Scientific Meeting of the Spanish-Society-of-Chromatography-and-Related-Techniques (SECYTA)	NOV 02-04, 2016	Seville, SPAIN	Spanish Soc Chromatog & Related Tech				With the aim of monitoring water quality according to the regulations established by the European Union it would be necessary to implement analytical methodologies capable of simultaneously determining a broad range of organic pollutants at ultra-trace levels, allowing for increased sample throughput. In addition, the high number of samples to be analyzed requires a particular focus on setting up fully automated analytical methodologies. In view of that, this study is aimed at the development of a complete automated procedure for the ultra-trace determination of certain pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in surface waters. The proposed method is based on an on-line combination of solid phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography coupled to double-focusing magnetic sector high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). SPME as well as GC-HRMS conditions were optimized to achieve maximum extraction efficiency and sensitivity, which was reinforced by using multiple ion detection (MID) as acquisition mode. Using only 19 mL of water and with minimum sample manipulation, the method allowed for the determination of 53 compounds exhibiting good linearity (R-2 >0.99), recoveries between 84 and 118% and relative standard deviation (RSD) values <20% for intra-day and inter-day precision. In addition, the method provides quantification limits (LOQs) between 0.1-50 ng L-1, lower than the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) fixed by Directive 2013/39/EC. Finally, the method was successfully applied to determine target contaminants in Almeria surface water compartments, detecting dioxin-like PCBs, BDEs and some pesticides. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study aims to evaluate the quality of potable water in Baghdad city. Furthermore, this study compares the quality of tap and bottled water. Baghdad city was divided into 4 districts based on the water source, and 40 water samples were collected from each district. Moreover, the most popular bottled water brands were sampled and compared with the tap water samples. The quality of the analyzed potable water samples varied based on the water source. The total dissolved solid (TDS) levels exceed the palatable (> 600 ppm) water levels in some districts. In addition, the concentration of sulfate was relatively high in both tap and bottled water and ranged from 200 to 330 ppm. The bottled water quality was within the acceptable limits set by the World Health Organization, but the TDS levels were relatively high. The hardness, Cl-, Pb2+, and bacteria contents in both tap and bottled water were within the standard limits. Finally, it is important to conduct radiological analyses in the future to investigate the effect of wars on Iraqi water resources.																	1178-6221					OCT 4	2017	10								UNSP 1178622117733441	10.1177/1178622117733441								WOS:000412217300001

However, environmental fate models developed for traditional contaminants are limited in their ability to simulate nanomaterials' environmental behavior by incomplete understanding and representation of the processes governing nanomaterial distribution in the environment and by scarce empirical data quantifying the interaction of nanomaterials with environmental surfaces. In this study, the well-known Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) was updated to incorporate particle collision rate and particle attachment efficiency to simulate multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) fate and transport in surface waters. Heteroaggregation attachment efficiencies (alpha(het)) values derived from sediment attachment studies are used to parametrize WASP for simulation of MWCNTs transport in Brier Creek, a coastal plain river located in central eastern Georgia, and a tributary to the Savannah River. Simulations using a constant MWCNT load of 0.1 kg d(-1) in the uppermost Brier Creek water segment showed that MWCNTs were present predominantly in the Brier Creek water column, while downstream MWCNT surface and deep sediment concentrations exhibited a general increase with time and distance from the source, suggesting that MWCNT releases could have increasing ecological impacts in the benthic region over long time frames.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 3	2017	51	19					11174	11184		10.1021/acs.est.7b01477								WOS:000412716500029	28876918

Exposure to human-associated fecal indicators and self-reported illness among swimmers at recreational beaches: a cohort study	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Background: Fecal indicator bacteria used to assess illness risks in recreational waters (e. g., Escherichia coli, Enterococci) cannot discriminate among pollution sources. To address this limitation, human-associated Bacteroides markers have been proposed, but the risk of illness associated with the presence of these markers in recreational waters is unclear. Our objective was to estimate associations between human-associated Bacteroides markers in water and self-reported illness among swimmers at 6 U. S. beaches spanning 2003-2007. Methods: We used data from a prospectively-enrolled cohort of 12,060 swimmers surveyed about beach activities and water exposure on the day of their beach visit. Ten to twelve days later, participants reported gastroinestinal, diarrheal, and respiratory illnesses experienced since the visit. Daily water samples were analyzed for the presence of human-associated Bacteroides genetic markers: HF183, BsteriF1, BuniF2, HumM2. We used model-based standardization to estimate risk differences (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed whether the presence of Bacteroides markers were modifiers of the association between general Enterococcus and illness among swimmers using interaction contrast. Results: Overall we observed inconsistent associations between the presence of Bacteroides markers and illness. There was a pattern of increased risks of gastrointestinal (RD = 1.9%; 95% CI: 0.1%, 3.7%), diarrheal (RD = 1.3%; 95% CI: -0.2%, 2.7%), and respiratory illnesses (RD = 1.1%; 95% CI: -0.2%, 2.5%) associated with BsteriF1. There was no evidence that Bacteroides markers acted as modifiers of Enterococcus and illness. Patterns were similar when stratified by water matrix. Conclusions: Quantitative measures of fecal pollution using Bacteroides, rather than presence-absence indicators, may be necessary to accurately assess human risk specific to the presence of human fecal pollution.

Demethanization of aqueous anaerobic effluents using a polydimethylsiloxane membrane module: Mass transfer, fouling and energy analysis	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY												The performance, fouling and feasibility of a polydimethylsiloxane hollow fibre membrane module for in situ methane degasification from the effluent of an Expanded Granular Sludge Bed anaerobic reactor has been investigated. Experiments at different operational conditions were carried out (liquid flow, sweep gas flow and vacuum pressure) with maximum removal efficiency (77%) at lowest flow-rate (0.4 L h(-1)), highest vacuum gauge pressure (-800 mbar) and liquid flowing in lumen side. Mass transport analysis denoted a considerably higher methane transfer than that predicted (attributed to liquid over-saturation). An enhancement factor for liquid phase has been proposed to correlate the experimental results. Long-term experiments were also performed in order to determine the possible influence of fouling on the module performance, and it showed that relatively frequent cleaning with water might be carried out to ensure preservation of the membrane efficiency. Characterization of water quality before and after membrane module was carried out to elucidate fouling causes. Energy balance analysis evidenced that energy production exceeded the system energy requirements. A substantial reduction of CO2 equivalent emissions showed the positive environmental impact of this technology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis is based on survey data collected by face-to-face interviews with recreational visitors to 10 waterway sites across Ireland. We model the respondent's choice decision to travel to a specific site for the purposes of beginning their recreational boating activity. Water quality data is from European Union Water Framework Directive monitoring stations. Across recreational sites, which have generally high water quality levels within our sample, we find that boaters favour sites with better water quality; as indicated by biological oxygen demand and phosphates metrics. We also find that for each additional 10 km distance from respondents' homes the probability that a site is visited declines by up to 10%. Preferences for other site attributes, such as boat slipways, parking and toilet facilities, were counter to expectation but reflects the fact that all boat users do not necessarily access or need all facilities provided.																	2405-8440					OCT	2017	3	10							UNSP e00426	10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00426								WOS:000432026800009

Groundwater samples (n=100) were collected from 25 villages of District Mardan of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, Pakistan, and analyzed for anions including F, chloride (Cl-), bromide (Br-), phosphate (PO43-), and sulfate (SO42-) with ion chromatography. The range of the F concentrations in the groundwater samples was 0.05-10.8 mg/L. The measured concentrations were within the permissible limits of National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) of Pakistan for drinking water in 92% of the samples. Groundwater samples of three villages exhibited F concentrations greater than the permissible level of 1.5 mg/L. The F concentration showed a positive correlation with electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), and the concentrations of Br-, PO43-, and SO42-. To safeguard public health, this study suggests the need for further research in the area for possible sources of F contamination and mitigation measures.																	0015-4725	2253-4083				OCT-DEC	2017	5	4					445	454										WOS:000432186300005

The influences of feed pH (3.0-10.0), feed total dissolved solids (TDS) (1182-5319 mg L-1) and feed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (0.54-2.43 mg L-1) on the separating efficiencies of two different NF membranes (Thin-Film Composite (DL) and Polyamide (DK)) were investigated. In addition, long-term operation for 580 h was also conducted by the superior NF membrane to evaluate the performance stability and fouling potential after a number of subsequent cleaning cycles. Within the scope of the test, NF separating performance in terms of salt rejection showed different changing tendencies: V-shaped curve for pH, inverted V-shaped curve for TDS and linear curve for DOC. While in general, specific permeate flux was reduced in different degrees except for DK membrane with feed pH variation. The observed separating performance decline with operating time was mainly due to the scale formation on the NF membrane surface, which was rinsed effectively (FR1 = 97.80% and RR1 = 61.63%; FR2 = 95.40% and RR2 = 49.35%) by chemical cleaning, as certified by FESEM - EDX and AFM images.																	2214-7144					OCT	2017	19						147	155		10.1016/j.jwpe.2017.07.021								WOS:000431411100020

However, this mining has caused impact for an environmental issue. This study aims to analyze river quality in the nickel mining industrial area in Pomalaa. The Total Suspended Solid (TSS) parameter was tested by a gravimetric technique, Fe ions were analyzed by spectrophotometry, and Cr, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, Co, and Pb were performed by Atomics Absorbance Spectroscopy (AAS). Subsequently, the determination of pH was compared to an Indonesia standard parameter (SNI 06-6989.11-2004). It was performing an evaluation towards the Pollutant Index (PI) value were 0 <= PIj <= 1.0 (good condition), 1.0 < PIj <= 5.0 (lightly polluted), and PIj> 10 (heavily polluted). The result shows that the seven rivers located around Pomalaa nickel mining industrial area are still categorized in a good condition for conducting the mining activity, but Huko-huko river has been categorized lightly polluted because of the impact activity of nickel industrial processing. The quality of Kumoro and Puuroda rivers are still in a good condition for mining activity, processing, and as the second class water quality standard. However, the water quality of Baula, Huko-huko, Pesouha, Sopura, and Oko-oko rivers are categorized to be lightly polluted at which functions as facilities and infrastructure of water recreation, freshwater fish farming, livestock, and irrigation. Meanwhile, the water quality of the Kumoro and Puuroda rivers are still in a good condition.

The creation of such marine parks must be accompanied by careful measures to guarantee the coexistence of natural biota and human activities in these systems. The State Marine Park of Laje de Santos (SMPLS) is so close to an industrial pole and urban area that its creation and maintenance is an example for humanity. However, no program has yet been installed for the monitoring of its biotic and abiotic water parameters. Thus, the objective of this study is to provide hydrological and hydrochemical parameters with emphasis on dissolved nutrients to establish a starting point for the monitoring of these waters. The presence of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) in the marine park during the spring and summer sampling periods was evidenced by the observation of low temperatures (<17 degrees C) associated with salinity around 35 at the bottom of the water column, indicating a thermohaline feature. The dissolved oxygen presented high values, with few data below 4 mL L-1 occurring at the bottom of the water column. The pH was always in accordance with marine values (similar to 8). Dissolved silicate and phosphate presented high values associated with inputs from the SACW intrusion, continental runoff and bottom resuspension processes, reaching maximum values of 15.86 and 1.23 mu mol L-1, respectively. Nitrogen compounds were also associated with a natural fertilization process by the presence of the SACW at the bottom of the water column, as evidenced by the high nitrate concentrations (> 7.00 mu mol L-1), while the concentration of N-ammonium (maximum 9.86 mu mol L-1) demonstrated a rapid regeneration of the organic matter, mainly in the euphotic zone. Analysis of the data from summer periods revealed an annual difference, showing January 2014 to be drier than January 2015, which influenced the availability of some nutrients and the standard distribution of hydrochemical parameters in this region. The results of the distribution of hydrochemical parameters in the marine park confirms the preserved conditions of the seawater around the Laje de Santos, demonstrated by the excellent water quality, concluding the need to implant monitoring actions based on these reference data to preserve this important reserve of marine life.																	1679-8759	1982-436X				OCT-DEC	2017	65	4					628	643		10.1590/S1679-87592017136806504								WOS:000426905100008

Study focus: The present study investigated the ability of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique in pointing the environmental effects of discharges from different activities. Major indicator parameters were extracted for water quality analysis of the Shahr Chai River located in Lake Urmia basin, Iran. The water quality parameters were measured monthly in six stream reaches and were affected by discharges from intensive recreational centers and rural and agricultural activities. New hydrological insights: The results showed that the NSFWQI and the WQI(min-p) could not distinguish between highly impacted stream reaches, while the calculated WQImin-c with two parameters including turbidity and fecal coliforms could meaningfully classify the sampling stations. These two parameters were selected based on results from correlation matrix. This study showed that calculation of the WQI(min-c) was an effective and easily applicable assessment method for different effluents' impacts on stream water quality. The PCA technique could justifiably show different landscape effects on river water quality whereby the river downstream was found to experience decreased water quality.																	2214-5818					OCT	2017	13						1	10		10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.07.002								WOS:000426117200001

Geospatial tools effectively estimate nonexceedance probabilities of daily streamflow at ungauged and intermittently gauged locations in Ohio	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The state of Ohio in the United States, a humid, continental climate. Study focus: The estimation of nonexceedance probabilities of daily streamflows as an alternative means of establishing the relative magnitudes of streamflows associated with hydrologic and water-quality observations. New hydrological insights for the region: Several methods for estimating nonexceedance probabilities of daily mean streamflows are explored, including single-index methodologies (nearest-neighboring index) and geospatial tools (kriging and topological kriging). These methods were evaluated by conducting leave-one-out cross-validations based on analyses of nearly 7 years of daily streamflow data from 79 unregulated streamgages in Ohio and neighboring states. The pooled, ordinary kriging model, with a median Nash-Sutcliffe performance of 0.87, was superior to the single-site index methods, though there was some bias in the tails of the probability distribution. Incorporating network structure through topological kriging did not improve performance. The pooled, ordinary kriging model was applied to 118 locations without systematic streamgaging across Ohio where instantaneous streamflow measurements had been made concurrent with water-quality sampling on at least 3 separate days. Spearman rank correlations between estimated nonexceedance probabilities and measured streamflows were high, with a median value of 0.76. In consideration of application, the degree of regulation in a set of sample sites helped to specify the streamgages required to implement kriging approaches successfully.

These results correspond to the research project Economic, social and institutional variables of greater influence over second generation indicators related to the water resource and its management, carried out by the research group Neotic of the School of Engineering, Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Bogota, during 2016. Method: Based on the information provided by car, the water quality index (WQI) established by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies (IDEAM) for Colombia was calculated. Results: The excessive use of agrochemicals in the upper basin of the Bogota River has repercussions on it, since water quality already shows deterioration from this place. Anthropic factors are the main cause of pollution and environmental deterioration due to agroindustrial operations carried out around its waters. Conclusions: Although municipal mayors are aware of the problems of the Bogota River and include mechanisms to address them in their municipal development plans, the results obtained demonstrate the need to formulate new environmental strategies or reformulate existing ones for the care and protection of this resource.																	1900-3102	2357-6014				OCT	2017	13	22					41	57		10.16925/in.v13i21.1725								WOS:000425064000003

Chemical analysis of the soil samples collected from the two farms reflects a good fertility, close to the natural one of this region soils, with well-balanced organic matter, total nitrogen, accessible phosphorus and potassium contents. The nitrates contents concord with the plants nutrition demands and don't present the risk to accumulate in vegetables or to leach into the groundwater. Slightly increased microelements, both total and soluble forms, occur. Soil microbiological properties are favorable for vegetable plants growth. A good biodiversity is noticed. There are differences between soil properties in open field and greenhouses, induced both by the type and degree of mechanical works and materials applied for fertilization and plant protection. Good conditions are generally created for plants mineral nutrition. Mineral nutrition status of the vegetables grown in organic conditions, assessed by the leaves mineral composition, doesn't differ from the one of the vegetables grown in conventional conditions. The vegetables (fresh material) harvested from the two studied farms have good, even high, concentrations of mineral elements important for the yield nutritional quality. The excessive microelements quantities noticed in soil don't transfer in the yield, so the latter quality and nutritional properties are not altered.																	1843-5971	2284-7820				OCT	2017	11	2					173	185		10.1515/pesd-2017-0035								WOS:000424587200015

Here we assess the impact of topographic and socio-economic factors on the climate sensitivity of surface water quality, estimated using an elasticity approach (climate elasticity of water quality (CEWQ)), and identify potential risks of instability in different regions and climatic conditions. Large global datasets were used for 12 main water quality parameters from 43 water quality monitoring stations located at large major rivers. The results demonstrated that precipitation elasticity shows higher sensitivity to topographic and socio-economic determinants as compared to temperature elasticity. In tropical climate class (A), gross domestic product (GDP) played an important role in stabilizing the CEWQ. In temperate climate class (C), GDP played the same role in stability, while the runoff coefficient, slope, and population density fuelled the risk of instability. The results implied that watersheds with lower runoff coefficient, thick population density, over fertilization and manure application face a higher risk of instability. We discuss the socio-economic and topographic factors that cause instability of CEWQ parameters and conclude with some suggestions for watershed managers to bring sustainability in freshwater bodies.																	1748-9326					OCT	2017	12	10							104012	10.1088/1748-9326/aa8a33								WOS:000424304600001

The objective of this study is to evaluate the surface water quality of three estuaries in east coast Peninsular Malaysia. The parameters measured were Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Salinity (SAL), total dissolved solid (TDS), ammonium (NH4-N), turbidity (TUR), total suspended solid (TSS) and coliform. Monthly sampling was performed during the dry season, from June 2016 until September 2016. Data were analysed using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA yielded two PCs where VF1 forms strong factor loadings for pH, NH4-N, SAL, and TDS signifying saltwater intrusion in mangrove area. VF2 designed strong factors of BOD, TUR and Coliform and strong negative loading of DO indicating anthropogenic pollutions in the area. This study output will be a baseline setting for future studies in mangrove estuary marine water quality. Mangrove marine water samples of future monitoring studies in mangrove estuary will benefit by enabling understanding of pollution loading and coastal water quality. It is essential to plan a workable water quality modelling as powerful tool to simulate marine water quality and forecast future consequences to facilitate mangrove biodiversity conservation.																	2289-5981	2289-599X				OCT-DEC	2017	13	4					764	768										WOS:000424049900041

Samples were collected on six separate occasions from seven sampling sites between July 2011 and April 2012. All environmental variables except nitrate nitrogen were found to be significantly different depending on sampling sites (p<0.01) and seasons (p<0.05). The presence of a total of 8,901 benthic macroinvertebrates and 146 taxa was confirmed by examination of the aquatic insects and annelids that were found in the seven sampling sites. Sensitive taxa in the orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera were more abundant at upstream collection points compared to downstream sites. Substrate disturbance from dam construction was the main cause of reduction in the diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates at the upstream sites. Additionally, organic loading caused a reduction in the abundance and taxa richness of the samples collected at the downstream sites. A significant negative correlation (p<0.01) between total suspended solids, biochemical oxygen demand and ammonium nitrogen and the benthic macroinvertebrate communities and biotic indices (BMWPThai and ASPT) indicated the anthropogenic impact existent in upstream and downstream locations of the Mae Klong River. However, the water quality of the Mae Klong River was assessed using ASPT and PBI indices that ranged in level from polluted to clean.																	0125-2526					OCT	2017	44	4					1356	1366										WOS:000423715600016

Although it is rare that these limits are breached, the Maryvale Mill strives to successfully achieve internally set limits for its own developmental goals. Additionally, with expansion of the Mill, wastewater quality has become a major focus over the last 12 months. It is believed that improvements can be made on the settleability of the Mills wastewater biomass, which if successful, could result in significant reductions in alum and polymer usage. The development of a lab scale pilot plant will allow various operational adjustments to be tested before onsite action can commence. The main focus of the pilot plant will be to test if switching to activated sludge conditions can improve the settleability of the biomass since the infrastructure to run in this manner is already available at the Mill.																	1038-6807					OCT-DEC	2017	70	4					358	365										WOS:000419933700011

This paper presents the results of a study on the diversity and seasonal succession of phytoplankton in Seri Serdang Lake and Faculty of Engineering Lake conducted between November 2013 and February 2014. A total of 27 species from four phyla (Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta) and 33 species belonging to Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Euglenophyta and Dinophyta were identified from Seri Serdang Lake and the Faculty of Engineering Lake, respectively. Chlorophyta were most dominant in both lakes. Highest number of species recorded was Monoraphidium sp. in Seri Serdang Lake and Pediastrum tetras in Faculty of Engineering Lake. Seri Serdang Lake had lower phytoplankton density (20 cells ml(-1) to 396 cells ml(-1)) as compared to the Faculty of Engineering Lake (250 cells ml(-1) to 300 cells ml(-1)). Although the distance between the two lakes is short, they do not share the same tributary probably leading to the observed differences in water quality, species diversity and succession pattern.																	0564-3295					OCT	2017	58	3					485	496										WOS:000422760500002

Ever-increasing pollution adversely affected living organisms on the Earth. The present study was focused on analyzing industrial effluents originating from industrial estate Islamabad (the capital city of Pakistan). Dominant tree-species of Islamabad such as Acacia modesta, Grevillea robusta, Bauhinia variegate (L.), Cassia fistula (L.), Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels, Terminalia arjuna (Roxburgh), Pongamia pinnata (L.), and Melia azedarach (L.) were selected to examine the tolerance of these tree-species against industrial effluents. One year old uniform saplings of nine selected species were transplanted into soil filled polythene tubes for the experiment. The collected samples of effluents were analyzed for water quality parameters such as electrical conductivity, pH, total dissolved solids, and heavy metals concentration. The pH of effluent sample was low (acidic) whereas electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids were higher than described FAO standards for irrigation water. Results also indicated higher concentration of heavy metals (Mn, Pb, Cr, Zn, Cd, Ni and Mg) in the industrial effluents. Saplings were irrigated with assorted water treatments and their effects on shoot and leaf growth was observed. Analysis of the data indicated decline in growth of all tree species irrigated with effluent based treatments. However, Acacia modesta, Albizia lebbeck, Melia azedarach, Syzygium cumini, and Terminalia arjuna relatively performed better and showed tolerance against industrial effluents.																	0556-3321	2070-3368				OCT	2017	49	5					1833	1839										WOS:000419148600025

It is based on the use of a forward osmosis operation replacing the trim cooler in the capture process. This cooler controls the absorption liquid inlet temperature to the absorber. In the forward osmosis operation water is transferred from a saline solution to the absorption liquid. It can be recovered in two ways: via the overhead condenser of the desorber or via an intercooling operation by flashing the absorption liquid under vacuum, followed by condensation of the water vapor produced. In both cases the energy requirement for the water production process is considered negligible as it is part of the energy requirement of the capture process. The amount of produced water and its quality is such that it can be used as makeup for flue gas desulphurization and/or cooling tower makeup. Thus, it can provide a resolution for the increase in specific cooling water requirement as a result of a CO2 capture retrofit to an existing coal-fired power station. Monoethanolamine and sodium glycinate solutions were evaluated as absorption liquids in this study. Amino acid salt solutions are preferred because of the high osmotic pressure and low vapor pressure, providing the best option for high water quality.				cousins, ashleigh/F-6822-2012; Thiruvenkatachari, Ramesh/D-5347-2017	Thiruvenkatachari, Ramesh/0000-0001-8366-2816; Feron, Paul/0000-0002-6601-5278												2050-0505					OCT	2017	5	5					244	256		10.1002/ese3.179								WOS:000419452900001

The 50ppm BPA degradation was catalyzed by 1.0U/mL of extracellular crude laccase without addition of types any mediator and was completely removed within 24 hours. Components of beta-hydroxybutyric acid (C4H8O3), pyroglutamic acid (C5H7NO3), hydrocinnamic acid (C9H10O2) and tartaric acid (C4H6O6) were detected as direct oxidative degradation products from the BPA; identified by the GC-MS. The GC-MS didn't detect a formation of any intermediate compound, which was believed to be caused by the high laccase activity in the product interchange; therefore the intermediate compound has appeared in a very short time and was hardly detectable by GC-MS. Correlation between laccase activities with the BPA concentration was studied in the kinetic of BPA as a substrate for laccase. At 1000ppm BPA concentration, the rate of BPA used was recorded as 0.94g.L-1.h(-1) or 940ppm. The ability to degrade 94% of 50ppm BPA has been catalyzed by 27.42 +/- 0.01U/mL laccase in 18 hours. In conclusion, laccase Ps.NR.22 has played a critical role in BPA biodegradation and catalyzed a cross-coupling reaction with four major acid group compounds as the products which has been listed above. This strain is highly potential for industrial application in maintaining water quality and land conservation from BPA contamination.																	2067-533X	2067-8223				OCT-DEC	2017	8	4					685	694										WOS:000419283600013

Among different feed management protocols (T-1: Regular feeding, 4-times a day; T-2: 2-weeks feeding followed by 1-week no feed; T-3- 4-weeks feeding followed by 1-week no feed), overall crop performance was in the similar line in both T-1 and T-2 except significantly (P<0.05) low AFCR and higher FE in T-2. This was probably due to the prevailing optimal salinity (19.1 +/- 1.8 psu), DO (6.1 +/- 0.7 ppm) and water pH (7.54 +/- 0.13). Among T-2 and T-3, there was no significant (P<0.05) variation in overall crop performance except in SGR and MBW. This was probably due to the longer refeeding periods after cyclic food deprivation that successfully triggered full CG response in T-3(CGI, 98-105%) and partial CG in T-2 (89-96%).Shrimp on the cyclic feed restriction may have better used pond resources by increasing the consumption of natural productivity that increased the feed efficiency (71.6-73.5).																	0379-5136	0975-1033				OCT	2017	46	10					2008	2016										WOS:000418784400009						
J	Morckel, V				Morckel, Victoria			Using suitability analysis to select and prioritize naturalization efforts in legacy cities: An example from Flint, Michigan	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												Given the lack of market demand and the abundance of vacant lots in legacy cities, not all vacant lands can be redeveloped or even maintained in a highly manicured state. While many vacant lots are being creatively reused as community gardens and side lots, in areas where residents are few and vacancy is high, the best use for vacant lands may be in a naturalized state such as meadows or forests. The author argues that in legacy cities, the critical question is not whether to naturalize (i.e. to stop mowing lots and allow for succession), but rather how to determine which properties to naturalize, in what order, and how. Using the example of Flint, Michigan, the author proposes suitability analysis as a method for selecting and prioritizing naturalization. Every property in the city of Flint was assigned a naturalization score derived by calculating subscores on nine variables, weighing the subscores by their importance, and summing. The nine variables included were contiguous vacant land, prospective vacancy, public ownership, land use designation, parks adjacency, proximity to industry, waterway buffers, property values, and population change. The naturalization scores can be combined with the results of a prior study to create a vacant land use decision tree pre- and post-demolition. Ultimately, the purpose of the paper is to facilitate property selection for naturalization while encouraging public discourse around what should happen with vacant lots in legacy cities.																	1618-8667					OCT	2017	27						343	351		10.1016/j.ufug.2017.09.006								WOS:000418470600038						
J	Sebesvari, Z; Rodrigues, S; Renaud, F				Sebesvari, Zita; Rodrigues, Sandrina; Renaud, Fabrice			Mainstreaming ecosystem-based climate change adaptation into integrated water resources management in the Mekong region	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Efficient, equitable, and transboundary management of the water resources of the Mekong River Basin (MRB) is challenged by ongoing and accelerating alteration of the river hydrology, land use, water quality, and the uncertainties associated with climate change and its future impacts. Integrated water resources management (IWRM) institutions and mechanisms offer a good entry point for the uptake and implementation of climate change adaptation measures. This review paper provides an overview about IWRM approaches in the MRB and ongoing processes as well as opportunities to mainstream climate change adaptation into existing basin strategies and water management instruments. The review clearly shows that approaches taken by the Mekong River Commission, the Greater Mekong Subregional Economic Cooperation Program, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations with respect to water resources management are largely complementary and synergies could be increased to incorporate climate change adaptation into existing schemes. Ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) has a great potential in the region as its economy is still largely based on the use of natural resources. Despite this acknowledgment, the inclusion of EbA measures as a sustainable land and water management tool for climate change adaptation is still relatively new in the MRB context. We argue that mainstreaming EbA measures in IWRM-guided basin development planning offers no-regret and flexible solutions and opportunities and allows for action despite the considerable uncertainties decision-makers face.

J	Benson, D; Lorenzoni, I				Benson, David; Lorenzoni, Irene			Climate change adaptation, flood risks and policy coherence in integrated water resources management in England	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Integrated water resources management (IWRM) assumes coherence between cognate aspects of water governance at the river basin scale, for example water quality, energy production and agriculture objectives. But critics argue that IWRM is often less 'integrated' in practice, raising concerns over inter-sectoral coherence between implementing institutions. One increasingly significant aspect of IWRM is adaptation to climate change-related risks, including threats from flooding, which are particularly salient in England. Although multiple institutional mechanisms exist for flood risk management (FRM), their coherence remains a critical question for national adaptation. This paper therefore (1) maps the multi-level institutional frameworks determining both IWRM and FRM in England; (2) examines their interaction via various inter-institutional coordinating mechanisms; and (3) assesses the degree of coherence. The analysis suggests that cognate EU strategic objectives for flood risk assessment demonstrate relatively high vertical and horizontal coherence with river basin planning. However, there is less coherence with flood risk requirements for land-use planning and national flood protection objectives. Overall, this complex governance arrangement actually demonstrates de-coherence over time due to ongoing institutional fragmentation. Recommendations for increasing IWRM coherence in England or re-coherence based on greater spatial planning and coordination of water-use and land-use strategies are proposed.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				OCT	2017	17	7					1921	1932		10.1007/s10113-016-0959-6								WOS:000418588400006

REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Lake Baikal is the largest near-surface global freshwater source and of high interest for water quality alterations, as deterioration of water quality is a main global and an increasing issue in the Selenga River Basin. Here, the Selenga River Basin as main contributor to the inflow of Lake Baikal is extremely important. Pressure on ecosystems and water resources increased due to population growth, rapid urbanization and rising industrial activities, particularly in the mining sector. In this study, the large-scale water resources model WaterGAP3 is applied to calculate loadings of conservative substances (total dissolved solids) and non-conservative substances (faecal coliform bacteria and biological oxygen demand) in a spatially explicit way as well as in in-stream concentrations to get an insight into the state of water quality under current and future scenario conditions. The results show a strong increase in loadings in the scenario period and consequently increasing concentration levels. Comparing the sectoral contributions of the loadings, domestic and industrial sectors are by far the main contributors today and expected to be in the future. Furthermore, for all modelled substances and time periods, water quality thresholds are exceeded posing a potential risk to aquatic ecosystems and human health.

This is particularly relevant in light of recent and expected future changes involving both the hydrology and water quality in the Lake Baikal basin causing spatiotemporal changes in water flow, morphology, and transport of sediments and metals in the Selenga River delta and thus impacting on delta barrier functions. The central part of the delta had been characterized by sediment storage, especially along the main channels, causing a continuous lift of the delta surface by about 0.75 cm/year(-1). Theses morphological changes have a significant impact on hydrological conditions, with historical shifts in the bulk discharge from the left to the right parts of the delta which is distinguished by a relatively high density of wetlands. Regions with a high density of wetlands and small channels, in contrast to main channel regions, show a consistent pattern of considerable contaminant filtering and removal (between 77 and 99 % for key metals), during both high-flow and low-flow conditions. The removal is associated with a significant concentration increase (2-3 times) of these substances in the bottom sediment. In consequence, geomorphological processes, which govern the partitioning of flow between different channel systems, may therefore directly govern the barrier function of the delta.

Using a replicated BACIPS (Before-After-Control Impact Paired Series) design, we investigated 24 peatlands, all drained for forestry and subsequently restored, and 19 pristine control boreal peatlands with high temporal and spatial resolution data on hydro climate and pore water quality. In drained conditions, total nitrogen (N-tot), total phosphorus(P-tot), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in pore water were several-fold higher than observed at pristine control sites, highlighting the impacts of long-term drainage on pore water quality. In general, pore water DOC and Ntot decreased after restoration measures but still remained significantly higher than at pristine control sites, indicating long time lags in restoration effects. Different peatland classes and trophic levels (vegetation gradient) responded differently to restoration, primarily due to altered hydrology and varying acidity levels. Sites that were hydrologically overrestored (inundated) showed higher P-tot, N-tot, and DOC than well restored or insufficiently restored sites, indicating the need to optimize natural-like hydrological regimes when restoring peatlands drained for forestry. Rich fens (median pH 6.2-6.6) showed lower pore water P-tot, Ntot, and DOC than intermediate and poor peats (pH 4.0-4.6) both before and after restoration. Nutrients and DOC in pore water increased in the first year postrestoration but decreased thereafter. The most important variables related to pore water quality were trophic level, peatland class, water table level, and soil and air temperature.

Flow and Residence Times of Dynamic River Bank Storage and Sinuosity-Driven Hyporheic Exchange	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hydrologic exchange fluxes (HEFs) vary significantly along river corridors due to spatiotemporal changes in discharge and geomorphology. This variability results in the emergence of biogeochemical hot-spots and hot-moments that ultimately control solute and energy transport and ecosystem services from the local to the watershed scales. In this work, we use a reduced-order model to gain mechanistic understanding of river bank storage and sinuosity-driven hyporheic exchange induced by transient river discharge. This is the first time that a systematic analysis of both processes is presented and serves as an initial step to propose parsimonious, physics-based models for better predictions of water quality at the large watershed scale. The effects of channel sinuosity, alluvial valley slope, hydraulic conductivity, and river stage forcing intensity and duration are encapsulated in dimensionless variables that can be easily estimated or constrained. We find that the importance of perturbations in the hyporheic zone's flux, residence times, and geometry is mainly explained by two-dimensionless variables representing the ratio of the hydraulic time constant of the aquifer and the duration of the event (Gamma(d)) and the importance of the ambient groundwater flow (Delta h*). Our model additionally shows that even systems with small sensitivity, resulting in small changes in the hyporheic zone extent, are characterized by highly variable exchange fluxes and residence times. These findings highlight the importance of including dynamic changes in hyporheic zones for typical HEF models such as the transient storage model.

Influence of flow rate variations on chemistry change of pumped Disi water to Amman/Jordan: a laboratory simulation approach	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												In order to monitor the change in the Disi water chemistry that is pumped from the Disi aquifer to Amman city along the 345 km pipeline, the changes in chemistry and surface precipitation of scale were investigated using simulated plumbing system. The influence of flow rate variation was investigated since Disi water usually pumped using different flow rates along the pipeline. Disi water was pumped through 20.0 m steel pipes at different flow rates (5, 10, 15, 25, and 35 L/min) with circulation time of 5 h for each run. Water quality parameters, for example, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, calcium, magnesium, carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, and total hardness, were determined every hour using standard methods of analysis. The results showed that pipes that transport Disi water suffers from calcium carbonate scale deposition as the water is pumped with different flow rates. It was found that the scale deposition increased by increasing the flow rate and the surface roughness of the metal.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	92						80	89		10.5004/dwt.2017.21442								WOS:000418408700009

This work aims to evaluate the hydrochemical characteristics of an aquifer located between carbonated formations and salt lake (Garaat Ettarf). Hydrochemical, multivariate statistical, and thermodynamics techniques were used to investigate the hydrochemical evolution within the aquifer. A total of 45 groundwater samples were collected from this area during May 2015 and analyzed for various physical and chemical parameters. The results indicate that this water is classified as Ca-HCO3 water types in carbonate outcrops as Ca-SO4 and Cl-Ca type in the Plio-Quaternary filling in the direction of the Sebkha. The hydrochemical study shows that the electrical conductivity of the water ranges from 220 to 6,700 mu S/cm. Chemical tracing had focused on the major elements and some traces to the process responsible for water mineralization acquisition. The intersection of the major elements with the chloride ion showed that the salinity of the water is due to water-rock interaction, cation exchanges and anthropogenic pollution. The principal component analysis reveals three factors that express 61.8% of the total variance in water quality datasets. The first factor is salinization, which shows strong associations between SO42-, Cl-, CE, M, TH, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Na+. The second factor represents the opposition of two poles, freshwater to polluted water, the first is constituted of bicarbonates HCO3- reflecting freshwater that opposes polluted water caused by nitrate. The third factor is determined in its positive part by temperature and in its negative part by pH. It should be noted that aquifers waters are oversaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite and aragonite, but they are rather undersaturated with respect to halite, gypsum and anhydrite.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	92						90	97		10.5004/dwt.2017.21507								WOS:000418408700010

Practicing the sewer mining (SM) approach, the feed of the unit was directly drained from the sewage network. Monitoring of system's performance was performed through a series of lab analyses and online measurements. According to the results, it is concluded that both MBR and RO effluent present very high quality characteristics. The RO effluent's quality in terms of organic content (0.9 mg/L BOD5 and not detectable total suspended solids), ammonium nitrogen (0.25 mg/L), turbidity (0.32 NTU), Escherichia coli (not detectable) and total coliforms (not detectable) could fully meet the water quality requirements for reclaimed water, as dictated by the Greek legislation. Furthermore, the application of SM practice through the implementation of an on-site compact treatment system consisting of a pretreatment unit followed by an MBR and a UV disinfection unit can reliably meet all the national and international criteria set for all types of non-potable wastewater reuse at a rather moderate cost. The addition of an RO unit is fully justified in the case of saline wastewater and/or in cases where strict limit values for heavy metals and micropollutants in the reclaimed water have been set.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						2	11		10.5004/dwt.2017.20804								WOS:000418406400002

Under proper management conditions, significant improvements of the water quality for irrigation can take place as a result of concurrent physical, chemical and biological processes. Here, a multi-seasonal, WSR-based procedure has been proposed and simulated in terms of operational parameters in order to reduce the effects, particularly critical during the irrigation period, of the introduction of fresh effluents on the quality of stored water. Furthermore, an appropriate use of high-rate algal ponds has been suggested as an alternative to the nutrient removal phase in the wastewater treatment plant.

Willow clones used in EWS may significantly affect the performance of EWS; therefore, the clones with high biomass production and resilience to permanent flooding, increased nutrient concentrations, and salinity must be selected. In the presented study, a 27 m(2) pilot EWS was set up in November 2015, enabling the testing of three different willow clones of Salix alba (L.): indigenous white willow 'V 160' (S. alba) and two of its hybrids: 'V 052' (S. alba var. calva x S. alba) and 'V 093' (S. alba x S. alba var. vitellina) x S. alba. The stem height, diameter, and number of shoots per stump were measured weekly in the first year of growth on site, along with the water quality parameters and water levels in the test beds. There were no statistically significant differences in stem height and stem diameter between the three tested clones at the end of the vegetation season; however, the indigenous clone indicated better adaptability to conditions in EWS but somewhat lower biomass production in comparison with the hybrids. For all clones, the willows growing in the EWS outgrew the control willows, showing the positive effects of high water availability and wastewater on willow growth. Investigations in the following vegetation season will further evaluate the water demand and the biomass yield, estimate the efficiency of nutrient transfer from wastewater to wood biomass, and define the differences for the selected clones.

The selection criteria for the examined materials were based on their high efficiency during batch experiments, along with their low toxicity to human health, directly related to the respective regulation limits. Among zero-valent metals tested, only Fe-0 can completely remove Cr(VI), while the leached concentration of Fe and Zn overpasses the corresponding drinking water regulation limits. Iron sulphides can minimize Cr(VI) at sub-ppb level, yet leached Fe(II) concentration is substantially higher than the drinking water regulation limit of 0.2 mg/L. Similarly, SnS can minimize Cr(VI) at sub-ppb level, although leached Sn concentration overpasses the aesthetic limit for drinking water quality. Iron oxy-hydroxide proved effective for Cr(VI) removal at sub-ppb level, preserving simultaneously the water quality. However, its relatively low adsorption capacity (0.1 mg Cr(VI)/g FeOOH) is a significant drawback for full-scale implementation. Among the examined adsorbents only magnetite presented sufficient uptake capacity (4 mg Cr(VI)/g Fe3O4) at the breakthrough concentration of the upcoming regulation limit of 10 mu g/L, without downgrading water quality, and thus qualified for drinking water treatment.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						293	299		10.5004/dwt.2017.20739								WOS:000418406400039

In this study, three household water purifiers that based on different principles were investigated in order to determine whether and under which conditions they can safeguard the microbial safety of drinking water. The water purifiers consisted of the following treatment trains: (i) activated carbon (AC), ultrafiltration (UF) and reverse osmosis, AC and UV irradiation; (ii) AC and UF, and (iii) AC, passive chlorine dosage and AC. They were examined in a two-phase challenge test using bacteria (Escherichia coli) and bacteriophages (MS2) in a laboratory environment. Under normal operation conditions filtering tap water, mean microbial reductions of 4-6 log(10) and 0-3 log(10) for E. coli and MS2 phages, respectively, were observed that therefore partly comply with WHO requirements. Reduction of protozoa (Cryptosporidium oocysts) was estimated based on size exclusion or chlorine exposure to be >= 2 log(10) (membrane-based size exclusion) and < 2 log(10) (chlorine-based disinfection), respectively. To further determine their applicability for filtering water sources with higher pollution load, tap water with increased loads of organic and suspended matter simulating turbid river water (which is beyond the intended use of the systems) was studied. Only the multi-stage treatment was able to remove organics and turbidity to >= 89%. Both tested membrane-based systems suffered from rapid and severe irreversible fouling when challenged with high turbidity whereas the chlorine-based system maintained the production rate, however, at the expenses of a lower physicochemical quality. Hence, none of the tested systems was able to produce water of satisfying physicochemical and microbial quality at sufficient quantities from raw water with turbid river water quality. Therefore, it is suggested introducing mandatory standardized testing protocols and certification of household water purifiers specifying the usage conditions.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						311	319		10.5004/dwt.2017.20802								WOS:000418406400042

This study assessed the discharge of indicator bacteria, total coliform, Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci and Clostridium perfringens, by flow-proportional sampling from 12 full-scale on-site treatment systems featuring biological treatment units (mainly sand filters) and alkaline filter beds for phosphorus treatment (P-filters). Correlations of effluent bacterial concentrations with pH, total and dissolved organic carbon, filter age and hydraulic load were evaluated. The bacterial concentrations in the effluents of the sand filters were considerable. The concentrations for excellent bathing water quality set in the EU bathing water directive, 200 and 500 colony forming units (cfu)/100 mL for intestinal enterococci and E. coli, respectively, were exceeded in three (intestinal enterococci) and one (E. coli) of the eight investigated sand filters. In one of the sand filters, effluent E. coli concentrations were high although no obvious malfunction of the filter was observed. In the effluent from the other investigated biological treatment units (a trickling fibre filter, two units with attached growth treatment and one aerated activated sludge technique), bacterial concentrations were very high (75,000 cfu/100 mL of Clostridium perfringens and 85,000 cfu per 100 mL of total coliform), possibly because of a shorter retention time of the wastewater in these facilities, missing aeration and little time between start-up and measurements. Three and four of the nine investigated P-filters exceeded excellent bathing water quality in coastal waters as stipulated by the EU bathing water directive in respect of E. coli and intestinal enterococci, respectively.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						365	373		10.5004/dwt.2017.21416								WOS:000418406400047

Consideration of phytoplankton composition and water quality of Anamur (Dragon) Creek, Turkey	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT					13th IWA Specialized Conference on Small Water and Wastewater Systems (SWWS) together with the 5th IWA Specialized Conference on Resources-Oriented Sanitation (ROS)	SEP 14-17, 2016	Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sanitary Engn Lab, Athens, GREECE	IWA, Hellen Water Assoc	Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sanitary Engn Lab			In this study, water pollution of Anamur Creek, one of the water resources of Mersin (Turkey), was determined. For this purpose, phytoplankton composition and some physicochemical parameters in the surface water of Anamur Creek were investigated. Samples were collected at five sampling sites in the course of the stream in April and June 2010. Fifteen taxa were identified belonging to Bacillariophyta (11), Cryptophyta (1), Euglenozoa (1) and Miozoa (2) divisions. In terms of chlorophyll-a concentrations (4.04-26.23 mg/m(3)) the stream shows eutrophic characteristics. Anamur Creek is used for agriculture, fish farms and river sports. Nowadays, water has been started to be supplied from the Anamur Creek to the Gecitkoy Dam, located in Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, with the project which began in 2011 and completed in 2015. For this reason, designation of the usage areas and amounts of this creek's water again has an important role on its trophic status. It is required that Anamur Creek should be taken under protection for improving its water quality by relevant authorities. Artificial neural network analysis succeeds to envisage the significance importance of input data sets used to investigate and monitor the water quality in the designated study area. April data set showed that pH followed by temperature was exercised to descend the neural network classification parameters. Dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a concentration came in second in the significance order, while conductivity ranked the last. June data set showed that temperature was ranked the most important variable followed by the pH. Correspondingly to April data set, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a concentration came in second in the significance order but with opposite importance due to temperature variation. Therefore, detailed studies on phytoplankton including physicochemical parameters have to be carried out for controlling the water quality in Anamur Creek.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				OCT	2017	91						386	394		10.5004/dwt.2017.20844								WOS:000418406400049

This study was based on a genotoxic evaluation of buccal cells using the Comet assay technique. Levels of DNA damage in the consumers group were significantly higher than those of the control group. However, occupational exposure to genotoxicants showed to be the critical factor rather than water consumption. Taking into account the professions of well-and/or tap-water consumers, agricultural workers exposed directly (those who fumigated) or indirectly (those not involved in fumigating) to agrochemicals showed greater genetic damage than controls. This difference persisted even when age, and whether the person smoked or consumed alcoholic drinks were considered. These factors were not associated with the level of genetic damage observed. Chemical analyses of organochlorine pesticides and heavy metals were carried out to evaluate the water quality of wells, faucets, and surface water of canals consumed by the population and/or used for irrigation. High concentrations of alpha and beta endosulfan were detected in water of surface canals. Although our inventory of agrochemicals employed in the region showed the use of products considered carcinogenic and/or mutagenic, they were not detected by the analytical techniques used. Heavy metals (arsenic, mercury, and lead) were detected in water of some wells used for irrigation and human consumption.

Strategic Evaluation Tool for Surface Water Quality Management Remedies in Drinking Water Catchments	WATER												Drinking water catchments (DWC) are under pressure from point and nonpoint source pollution due to the growing human activities. This worldwide challenge is causing number of adverse effects, such as degradation in water quality, ecosystem health, and other economic and social pressures. Different evaluation tools have been developed to achieve sustainable and healthy drinking water catchments. However, a holistic and strategic framework is still required to adequately consider the uncertainty associated with feasible management remedies of surface water quality in drinking water catchments. A strategic framework was developed to adequately consider the uncertainty associated with management remedies for surface water quality in drinking water catchments. A Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (FMCDA) approach was embedded into a strategic decision support framework to evaluate and rank water quality remediation options within a typical fixed budget constraint faced by bulk water providers. The evaluation framework consists of four core aspects; namely, water quality, environmental, economic and social, and number of associated quantitative and qualitative criteria and sub-criteria. Final remediation strategy ranking was achieved through the application of the Euclidean Distance by the In-center of Centroids (EDIC).

Consumption of water for irrigation, together with the discharge of agricultural non-point source pollution, is seriously affecting the water quality of Poyang Lake. This study assesses the application of integrated ecological restoration technology for agricultural non-point source pollution in the Ganfu Plain Area, which is an important agricultural production base in the Poyang Lake basin. The results indicated that the water-fertilizer comprehensive regulation mode for double-cropping rice provided water savings of 10.4% and increased rice yield by 6.5% per hectare. Furthermore, it reduced drainage water pollution by 20.4%, and emissions of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) from rice paddy surfaces by 18.6%, 11.1%, 15.4%, and 16.0%, respectively. The eco-channel-pond wetland system effectively reduced TN and TP pollutant levels in rice paddy drainage water; the eco-channel reduced TN and TP by 9.3% and 14.0%, respectively; and the pond wetland system showed reductions of 8.6% and 22.9%, respectively. The three lines of defense purification technology, including rice field source control, eco-channel interception, and pond wetland purification, removed 29.9% of TN and 44.3% of TP.																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							745	10.3390/w9100745								WOS:000414707500022

Simulating Climate Change Induced Thermal Stress in Coldwater Fish Habitat Using SWAT Model	WATER												Climate studies have suggested that inland stream temperatures and average streamflows will increase over the next century in New England, thereby putting aquatic species sustained by coldwater habitats at risk. This study uses the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate historical streamflow and stream temperatures within three forested, baseflow-driven watersheds in Rhode Island, USA followed by simulations of future climate scenarios for comparison. Low greenhouse gas emission scenarios are based on the 2007 International Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) B1 scenario and the high emissions are based on the SRES A1fi scenario. The output data are analyzed to identify daily occurrences where brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) are exposed to stressful events, defined herein as any day where Q25 or Q75 flows occur simultaneously with stream temperatures exceeding 21 degrees C. Results indicate that under both high- and low-emission greenhouse gas scenarios, coldwater fish species such as brook trout will be increasingly exposed to stressful events. The percent chance of stressful event occurrence increased by an average of 6.5% under low-emission scenarios and by 14.2% under high-emission scenarios relative to the historical simulations.																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							732	10.3390/w9100732								WOS:000414707500009						
J	Cuceloglu, G; Abbaspour, KC; Ozturk, I				Cuceloglu, Gokhan; Abbaspour, Karim C.; Ozturk, Izzet			Assessing the Water-Resources Potential of Istanbul by Using a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) Hydrological Model	WATER												Uncertainties due to climate change and population growth have created a critical situation for many megacities. Investigating spatio-temporal variability of water resources is, therefore, a critical initial step for water-resource management. This paper is a first study on the evaluation of water-budget components of water resources in Istanbul using a high-resolution hydrological model. In this work, the water resources of Istanbul and surrounding watersheds were modeled using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which is a continuous-time, semi-distributed, process-based model. The SWAT-CUP program was used for calibration/validation of the model with uncertainty analysis using the SUFI-2 algorithm over the period 1977-2013 at 25 gauge stations. The results reveal that the annual blue-water potential of Istanbul is 3.5 billion m(3), whereas the green-water flow and storage are 2.9 billion m(3) and 0.7 billion m(3), respectively. Watersheds located on the Asian side of the Istanbul megacity yield more blue-water resources compared to the European side, and constitute 75% of the total potential water resources. The model highlights the water potential of the city under current circumstances and gives an insight into its spatial distribution over the region. This study provides a strong basis for forthcoming studies concerning better water-resources management practices, climate change and water-quality studies, as well as other socio-economic scenario analyses in the region.
