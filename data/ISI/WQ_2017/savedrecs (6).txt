Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) production and stable isotope dynamics in clear-water recirculating aquaculture systems versus biofloc systems	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												Closed recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) offer advantages over traditional culture methods including enhanced biosecurity, the possibility of indoor, inland culture of marine species year-round and potential marketing opportunities for fresh, never-frozen seafood. Questions still remain regarding what type of aquaculture system may be best suited for the closed-system culture of marine shrimp. In this study, shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were grown in clear-water RAS and in biofloc-based systems. Comparisons were made between the system types with respect to water quality, shrimp production and stable isotope dynamics used to determine the biofloc contribution to shrimp nutrition. Ammonia and nitrite concentrations were higher, and shrimp survival was lower in the biofloc systems. Although stable isotope levels indicated that biofloc material may have contributed 28% of the carbon and 59% of the nitrogen in shrimp tissues, this did not correspond with improved shrimp production. Overall, the water column microbial communities in biofloc systems may be more difficult to manage than clear-water RAS which have external filters to control water quality. Biofloc does seem to offer some nutritional contributions, but exactly how to take advantage of that and ensure improved production remains unclear.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				AUG	2017	48	8					4390	4398		10.1111/are.13262								WOS:000404982300037

Four treatments were tested. One treatment with no supplementation of the microbial products served as control. In the other three treatments, the microbial products were added at the intervals of 10days respectively. During the experiment, grass carp and gibel carp were fed with a commercial formulated feed daily. Bacterial count and bacterial composition in water column of the tanks were monitored at the intervals of 3days, and bacterial composition in sediment was determined at the end of the experiment. Bacterial composition in water column varied with progress of the experiment. Some bacteria from Novozymes Pond Plus and Effective Microorganisms could colonize in the tanks but did not dominate in bacterial community. This study reveals that the competition between the exogenous bacteria and native bacteria might be a factor determining the efficacy of the microbial products in improving water quality.

This article studied the concentrating methods (centrifugation and settlement) on primary productivity of the microalgae Cylindrotheca fusiformis. The effects of free settled C.fusiformis, centrifuged C.fusiformis and macroalgae Sargassum polycystum on growth of the sea cucumber, farming water and sediment quality under two light intensities (1500lx and 500lx) were studied by a six-week rearing experiment. The results showed that the primary productivity of free settled C.fusiformis was 3-4 times higher than that of those centrifuged, indicating centrifugation inhibited the photosynthesis process. In the rearing experiment, feed, light intensities and their interactions significantly affected the specific growth rate (SGR) of the animals (P<0.01). The animals reared in higher light intensity also had higher SGR, but only those fed free settled C.fusiformis reached a significant level (P<0.05). The group also had the highest SGR (P<0.05), suggesting that the photosynthesis ability of C.fusiformis directly contributed to the growth of the animals. During the experiment, the soluble inorganic nitrogen, reactive phosphorus in farming water, total nitrogen and total organic carbon in the sediment gradually increased in all treatments. The S.polycystum group had slightly higher level of nutrients in water and sediment at the end of the experiment for its high organic content. These results provide evidence that the harvesting methods of C.fusiformis directly affect its vitality, which consequentially alter the feeding and environmental effect, especially under higher light densities.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				AUG	2017	48	8					4503	4511		10.1111/are.13275								WOS:000404982300048

Biofloc developed in indoor fibreglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) tanks (1000L) was used as dietary supplement in P.monodon (2.90 +/- 0.10g) reared in 1000-L FRP tanks. Graded level of dried biofloc was included in shrimp basal diets, 0% (control, B0), 4% (B4), 8% (B8) and 12% (B12). The level of metabolic enzymes like malate dehydrogenase (MDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was not significantly different with control up to 8% dietary supplementation. A higher level of total haemocyte count (THC) was noticed in B8 (22.16 +/- 2.17x10(6) cells mL(-1)) and B4 (21.11 +/- 0.56x10(6) cells mL(-1)) compared with control, C (14.61 +/- 2.74x10(6) cells mL(-1)). Biofloc-supplemented groups recorded significantly higher (P<0.05) serum SOD and catalase activity (P<0.01) in comparison with control. The groups fed with 4% dietary biofloc supplement recorded highest relative percentage survival (RPS), 45% after challenge with Vibrio harveyi followed by 36% and 27% RPS in B8 and B12 groups. Based on these results, it can be concluded that supplementation of biofloc even at 4% level in the feed improves immune responses and metabolic activities in black tiger shrimp juveniles.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				AUG	2017	48	8					4512	4523		10.1111/are.13276								WOS:000404982300049						
J	Chen, WY; Liekens, I; Broekx, S				Chen, Wendy Y.; Liekens, Inge; Broekx, Steven			Identifying Societal Preferences for River Restoration in a Densely Populated Urban Environment: Evidence from a Discrete Choice Experiment in Central Brussels	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												One of the major challenges facing river restoration in densely populated urban areas has been the disparity between the expectations of policy-makers and societal preferences. This study aimed to elicit public preferences and elucidate underlying sources of preference heterogeneity, using the Zenne River in central Brussels, Belgium, as a case study. A discrete choice experiment was administered to a representative sample of the Brussels population. Five attributes were specified, including water quality, ecological status, hydromorphological features of channels, recreational opportunities, and monetary cost. Our econometric analysis based on mixed logit models revealed that overall public would like to have a more natural river (open and naturalized channel, good water quality, and with rich species diversity), while achieving good water quality was the most preferred attribute. Respondents categorized as male, non-Belgian citizen, or not being a member of an environmental organization constituted an inclination to prefer the status quo. Belgian citizens showed a pronounced preference for good biodiversity, and being a member of an environmental organization could moderate the strong preference for good water quality. This study provided insights into the relative attractiveness of key attributes pertaining to river restoration, in general, and served as a useful input to the ongoing discussion concerning the future plan for the Zenne River in Brussels, specifically. Possible implications also exist for other urban river restorations in the rest of Europe, where the Water Framework Directive has become a major impetus for the expansion of freshwater ecosystem restoration from rural and peri-urban areas to densely populated urban areas. Particularly, the cultural heterogeneity of societal preferences should be tested and accounted for to compare the welfare impacts of river restoration and to facilitate benefit transfer, within and between river basins, in the Water Framework Directive implementation.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				AUG	2017	60	2					263	279		10.1007/s00267-017-0885-5								WOS:000404922800008	28477238

Satellite Remote Sensing for Coastal Management: A Review of Successful Applications	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Management of coastal and marine natural resources presents a number of challenges as a growing global population and a changing climate require us to find better strategies to conserve the resources on which our health, economy, and overall well-being depend. To evaluate the status and trends in changing coastal resources over larger areas, managers in government agencies and private stakeholders around the world have increasingly turned to remote sensing technologies. A surge in collaborative and innovative efforts between resource managers, academic researchers, and industry partners is becoming increasingly vital to keep pace with evolving changes of our natural resources. Synoptic capabilities of remote sensing techniques allow assessments that are impossible to do with traditional methods. Sixty years of remote sensing research have paved the way for resource management applications, but uncertainties regarding the use of this technology have hampered its use in management fields. Here we review examples of remote sensing applications in the sectors of coral reefs, wetlands, water quality, public health, and fisheries and aquaculture that have successfully contributed to management and decision-making goals.

Environmental Impact of Offshore Gas Activities on the Benthic Environment: A Case Study	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Multidisciplinary monitoring of the impact of offshore gas platforms on northern and central Adriatic marine ecosystems has been conducted since 1998. Beginning in 2006, 4-5 year investigations spanning the period before, during, and after rig installation have explored the effects of its construction and presence on macrozoobenthic communities, sediment, water quality, pollutant bioaccumulation, and fish assemblages. In this study, sediment samples collected at increasing distance from an offshore gas platform before, during and after its construction were subjected to chemical analysis and assessment of benthic communities. Ecological indices were calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the area. Ecotoxicological analysis of sediment was performed to establish whether pollutants are transferred to biota. The study applied a before-after control-impact design to assess the effects of rig construction and presence and provide reference data on the possible impacts of any further expansion of the gas extraction industry in the already heavily exploited Adriatic Sea. Only some of the metals investigated (barium, chromium, cadmium, and zinc) showed a different spatial and/or temporal distribution that may be platform-related. In the early phases, the sediment concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were below the detection limit at all sites; they then became detectable, but without significant spatial differences. The present findings suggest that the environmental effects of offshore gas platforms may be difficult to quantify, interpret, and generalize, because they are influenced by numerous, often local, abiotic, and biotic variables in different and unpredictable ways.

Direct and indirect effects of predatory young-of-year fishes in a dryland river food web	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Young-of-year (YOY) fishes are sometimes numerically dominant vertebrate consumers in many large river systems, but their effects as predators are not as well understood as those of adult fishes. We predicted that YOY fishes influence community composition and abundance of invertebrate prey. Predation effects could be especially important in recruitment-driven dryland river systems, where YOY fishes seasonally comprise a large portion of overall fish biomass. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to quantify effects of YOY fishes on trophic dynamics and interactions with environmental factors in a dryland river food web. We manipulated presence of YOY fishes (an assemblage of cypriniform species) and supplemental allochthonous carbon (LEAF treatments) in 24 mesocosms, and measured invertebrate abundance and diversity over 6weeks. Experimental conditions mimicked a seasonal river drying regime that occurs during YOY fish growth. Seasonal drying in the Rio Grande frequently results in isolated pools with altered habitat complexity and riparian connectivity. Fishes exerted direct top-down control of invertebrate assemblage composition through differential prey selection, and indirect control mediated by non-lethal responses of invertebrates to predatory fishes. We observed enhanced water clarity in LEAF treatments associated with greater prey selectivity in fishes, presumably through enhanced visual feeding. Stable isotope analysis (C and N) was used to measure indirect impacts of YOY fishes on invertebrate prey items. YOY fishes caused a significant decrease in isotopic niche breadth among invertebrate taxa, suggesting that fish predators limit foraging opportunities for these consumers. However, allochthonous carbon sources were predominant in invertebrate diets in all LEAF treatments, suggesting consumer access to more biologically available autochthonous production is limited by factors other than fish predation. Although the roles of abiotic drivers and adult fishes in determining food web structure have received more attention, our results indicate that YOY fishes exert biologically relevant top-down control of invertebrate assemblage composition and trophic complexity in dryland river ecosystems against a backdrop of substantial changes in carbon availability and abiotic conditions (e.g. water quality and habitat volume) over the growing season.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2017	62	8					1410	1421		10.1111/fwb.12954								WOS:000405074600009						
J	de Castro, DMP; Doledec, S; Callisto, M				de Castro, Diego M. P.; Doledec, Sylvain; Callisto, Marcos			Landscape variables influence taxonomic and trait composition of insect assemblages in Neotropical savanna streams	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Stream invertebrate assemblages are structured by environmental factors acting at multiple spatial scales. Identifying the spatial scale that most influences the species-environment relationships is a major goal of community ecology. We evaluated the importance of catchment and site scales and associated environmental variables in shaping Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) assemblages in Neotropical savanna headwater streams. Sampling sites were associated with 20 catchment-scale variables that depicted land cover and land use as well as natural geophysical variables such as altitude and climate. Site-scale habitat was characterised by 55 variables that described habitat hydromorphology, substrate, flow, canopy, in-stream cover and water quality. EPT traits were assessed using 28 categories of 7 biological traits, which represented the best available current knowledge for EPT in Neotropical savanna streams. We analysed the relationships between the catchment- and site-scale habitat variables and the taxonomic and trait composition of insect assemblages using 1,760 samples collected in 160 stream sites. Catchment- and site-scale variables both explained significant variation in EPT taxon and trait composition. Substrate, habitat hydromorphology and land use most influenced variation in taxonomic composition, whereas trait composition was mainly affected by land use. Catchment geographic position explained less assemblage variation. To our knowledge, this study is the first assessment of the impact of catchment- and site-scale variables on the trait and taxon composition of stream insect assemblages in Neotropical savanna streams. It highlights the need for better regional biological knowledge of invertebrates to generate more general trait-based approaches in freshwater ecosystem conservation.

In this study, fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were used to estimate five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (TN), pH, total phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH3+-N), turbidity (NTU), and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in inland freshwater streams. The study area was located in Ebinur Lake Watershed, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. Our results showed that the four fluorescence components were successfully extrapolated by the PARAFAC factor analysis modeling from the fluorescence EEM data including microbial humic-like (C1), terrestrial humic-like organic substances (C2, C4), and protein-like organic substances (C3). The four PARAFAC components were selected as the water quality monitoring index of river water samples. Three-dimensional fluorescence index analysis showed that terrigenous organic pollution was the main organic pollution type in the watershed. This indicates that the watershed is subject to human disturbance, given the large variation of organic pollution in the water body. There was a significant correlation between the three-dimensional fluorescence index, the fluorescence components, and surface water quality index. In addition, the application of three-dimensional fluorescence index and fluorescence component to establish water quality index produced a model fitting coefficient greater than 0.5, which demonstrated that the accuracy of the model was in line with monitoring requirements in practice. This implies that the use of three-dimensional fluorescence index and three-dimensional fluorescence component to monitor Ebinur Lake Watershed water quality has a great potential.

Pairing paleolimnological inference models with mechanistic water column models enhances assessment of lake water quality	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Reconciliation of paleolimnology inference models with hindcasts from mechanistic water column models aided the reconstruction of past relationships for total phosphorus/dissolved oxygen and acid neutralizing capacity/pH in highly polluted lake ecosystems in New York State. Pre-disturbance Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY, was shown to have experienced seasonal hypolimnetic anoxia even under oligotrophic (< 10 ug l(-1)) phosphorus levels. In the Adirondack Mountains of New York State the paired modeling confirmed that, while many lakes have the potential to eventually recover from acidification by atmospheric deposition, approximately 30% likely experienced naturally acidic conditions (pH < 6) prior to increases in industrial emissions. Comparison between the model results illuminated areas of individual model inadequacy, improved understanding of lake ecology, and increased confidence in the ability of predictive water column models to accurately develop restoration scenarios representing improved conditions. The work presented here is the first such comparison modeling for total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and acid neutralizing capacity. The technique remains to be more widely applied geographically and extended to less heavily stressed lake systems. Because a fossil inference and mechanistic hindcast should independently lead to similar results, comparison modeling is a potentially powerful tool for examining past interactions between ecosystem structure and ecosystem functioning.

Changes in the size partitioning of metals in storm runoff following wildfires: Implications for the transport of bioactive trace metals	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Mountainous areas affected by natural wildfires and highly urbanized settings both have been identified as sources of pollutants to receiving waters. In this study, the partitioning of metals between the colloidal (0.02-0.2 mu m) and soluble (<0.02 mu m) phases in storm-runoff was evaluated in three different environments: (i) a catchment affected by the 2012 Williams Fire (2-13 September 2012) in the San Gabriel Mountains, (ii) a neighboring control catchment in the San Gabriels, and (iii) three rivers draining the Los Angeles County area. Results from each region were compared to each other in order to gain information about potential sources of soluble (i.e., bioavailable) elements that are delivered to receiving waters. Results show that in runoff from recently burned areas, 58% and 24% of the total dissolved (<0.2 mu m) Pb and Fe, respectively, was present in the soluble pool. In contrast, runoff from urban and natural unburned areas carried less than 17% and 8% of the total dissolved Pb and Fe, respectively, in the soluble pool. These results suggest that storm runoff from burned landscapes has the previously unrecognized potential to supply a greater proportion of trace elements in bioactive soluble form, compared to runoff from urban or unburned areas, potentially increasing the impact of wildfire-delivered metals on receiving waters.

Limitations on the role of the hyporheic zone in chromium natural attenuation in a contaminated urban stream	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The urban hyporheic zone may offer natural attenuation potential for contaminants. This potential is contaminant-specific and may be spatially and temporally variable. The aim of this study was the assessment of the natural attenuation potential of the hyporheic zone of an urban stream receiving hexavalent chromium (Cr)-rich effluents from the historical land disposal of chromite ore processing residue (COPR) in Glasgow, Scotland. The evidence based approach involved the use of a network of multilevel piezometers for best capturing potential anoxic field conditions and fine-scale spatial gradients in solute concentrations of surface water and porewater. In-situ porewater sampling was integrated with sediment sampling and reach-scale monitoring of stream water quality. The results show a sharp decrease of total dissolved (filtered <0.45 gm) Cr concentrations at the surface water sediment boundary in all profiles, from Cr mean values of 1100 mu g l(-1) in surface water to 5 mu g l(-1) in porewater. Chromium speciation analysis indicates that no Cr(VI) was detectable in the neutral pH, moderately reducing porewater, while it was the dominant species in surface water. Evidence of historical COPR detrital grains contributed to the total Cr concentrations (size fraction <150 mu m) up to 8800 mg kg(-1) in the streambed sediment. The abundance in the porewater of Fe (mean value = 1700 mu g l(-1)), mainly as Fe(II), a natural electron donor for Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III), indicates a high natural attenuation potential of the hyporheic zone for downwelling dissolved Cr, through Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) and the formation of Cr(III) solids of low solubility. Authigenic Cr-rich rims on particles also documented active Cr precipitation from solution in the fine sediments. Large short-term changes of stream stage and stream water composition were not reflected in the hyporheic conservative (chloride) and reactive solute composition. This result indicates only limited surface water infiltration and suggests that small advective exchange might limit the effectiveness of the hyporheic zone for enhancing Cr surface water quality at the reach-scale. This is supported by further evidence from preliminary surface water quality synoptic sampling which shows only moderate to low downstream decrease in surface water Cr concentrations. The surface water investigation needs to be supported by combined water quality-flow monitoring and to be extended to a wider range of temporal and spatial scales to corroborate the reach-scale findings.

Stream hydrology and geochemistry along a rural to urban land use gradient	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												High frequency monitoring of water quality and stable isotopes quantify large hydrological and geochemical differences across a rural to urban land use gradient that includes three watersheds and two of their subbasins. Following precipitation events, floods on a rural stream feature hydrographs with low peak discharges and long lag times, high baseflow contributions, and small geochemical variations. In contrast, the flows of an urban stream and its tributary respond in a flashy manner, with average lag times decreasing by at least 55% compared to the rural stream. We also observed that baseflow contributions during floods decreased by an average of 40% in the urban streams. Importantly, we find that reduced baseflow as a function of increasing impervious surface area is not a linear trend among the streams, and suburban streams are less impacted than would be predicted by impervious surface area alone. The urban streams also exhibit large variations in water quality parameters during flooding events, often with five times the variability of the rural end-member. These differences are observed among all physical and geochemical characteristics that were monitored, including flow magnitude, stable isotope ratios, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, turbidity, specific conductivity, concentrations of Cr and nutrients, and bacterial loads. The great variability of urban streams following storms is paralleled by their larger diurnal and seasonal oscillations. Collectively, the extreme variations in the physical and geochemical character of urban streams have negative consequences to environmental quality and aquatic life. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on the chemistry of a small urban pond	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Mirror Lake, one of the scenic locations on The Ohio State University's campus, experiences an intense bioturbation event as part of an annual tradition revolving around the rivalry football game against the University of Michigan. This tradition involves thousands of students jumping into the lake over one night in the week leading up to the football game. Water samples were collected from several locations in the lake before, during, and after the Mirror Lake Jump to determine the impact of this event on lake water chemistry. There were significant and systematic increases in the concentrations of Na+, K+, Cl-, total nitrogen, ammonia, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) associated with the jump, especially in the eastern side of the lake where most of the students entered. Over the 3-h period from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. on the eastern side of the lake, Na+, K+, and CI- concentrations increased by about 2-4 ppm, 1.5-3 ppm, and 4-6 ppm, respectively. The total nitrogen concentration increased about five to six fold, from 450-500 ppb to 2300-2800 ppb over the height of the event on the eastern side of the lake. Similar increases were observed for DOC, increasing from 3.6 to 18 ppm. This DOC increase was coincident with a 5 parts per thousand shift in delta C-13, from a mean of around -28 parts per thousand in the early hours of the evening to a maximum of -23 parts per thousand, implying a large influx of isotopically heavy carbon into the lake. Ammonia concentrations varied substantially from year to year, but always showed a systematic increase in concentration during the event. Smaller changes in major ion and nutrient concentrations were observed in the middle and western side of the lake, where fewer students entered the lake. The changes in concentration and the timing and spatial distribution of these changes are primarily attributed to anthropogenic input from jumpers in the form of bodily fluids (e.g., evaporated sweat, sebum and urine). Over a single night, these anthropogenic event inputs represent roughly 10% of the annual nitrogen budget of the lake, emphasizing the direct impact humans can have on urban water bodies on short time scales.

Arsenic concentrations (mu g/L) were ranged from 12 to 448.5 and which exceeded the WHO recommended limit (10 mu g/L) in all cases. The calculated average daily dose (3.3 x 10(-0.4) to 1.2 x 10(-0.2) mg/kg day) and hazard quotient (1.1-40) reflected the potential health risk to local population due to tube well water consumption as drinking purpose. Sodium percent (Na%), sodium absorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, Kelly's index and magnesium absorption ratio were also determined to assess the suitability of tube well water for irrigation purpose. The resulting piper plot revealed the Na-Ca-HCO3 type water chemistry of the area and generally alkaline environment. The spatial distribution of arsenic in the tube well waters pinpoints the significant contribution of anthropogenic activities to arsenic pollution. Nevertheless, different statistical tools, including principal component analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and correlation matrices, revealed the contribution of both natural and anthropogenic activities and alkaline type of aquifers toward the high level of arsenic contamination.

J	Tanaka, MO; dos Santos, BG				Tanaka, Marcel Okamoto; dos Santos, Bianca Goncalves			Influence of discharge patterns on temporal variation of macroinvertebrate communities in forested and deforested streams in a tropical agricultural landscape	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Deforestation of riparian forests can directly influence stream macroinvertebrate communities, through changes in resource availability, habitat quality, and hydrological alterations. Here we evaluated whether mean discharge and discharge coefficient of variation (CV), estimated over a 15-month study, influenced forested and deforested stream macroinvertebrate communities. Higher diversity and mean discharge were recorded in deforested streams, and community composition was strongly related to mean discharge. Streams formed a gradient of both mean discharges and discharge CV, which both influenced patterns of diversity. Discharge CV negatively influenced diversity in a nonlinear model, whereas both mean discharge and discharge CV influenced differentiation of macroinvertebrate communities among five sampling occasions. Similarity among sampling times within each stream estimated by the Morisita-Horn index decreased with increasing mean discharge, whereas response to CV was quadratic, with higher similarity at intermediate values and lower similarity at more extreme values. These results suggest that stability of stream macroinvertebrate communities display different responses to mean discharge and discharge CV, and that hydrological alterations can interact with land use changes to determine community dynamics at local scales.

J	Benham, CF				Benham, Claudia F.			Aligning public participation with local environmental knowledge in complex marine social-ecological systems	MARINE POLICY												The incorporation of local and traditional knowledges into environmental governance regimes is increasingly recognised as a critical component of effective and equitable conservation efforts. However, there remain significant barriers to integration of community-based knowledge within mainstream environmental governance. This paper explores community-based knowledge in the context of Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA), a widely-used governance tool designed to predict and manage the impacts of development. Drawing on a social survey and interviews, the paper documents local community knowledge of environmental changes associated with dredging and the construction of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plants in a large industrial harbour located in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, and compares this knowledge with public consultation opportunities offered throughout the project lifecycle, including during assessment and after project approval. The findings highlight a misalignment between community knowledge of environmental change, which is acquired largely after impacts become apparent, and the public participation opportunities afforded through EIA, which generally occur before construction or dredging is undertaken.																	0308-597X	1872-9460				AUG	2017	82						16	24		10.1016/j.marpol.2017.04.003								WOS:000404490500003

The results showed that the removal rates for chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) reached 14.56%-30.49%, 38.21%-67.96%, and 24.22%-41.14% respectively, in the TEC treatment, and 51.22%-57.90%, 64.61%-81.95%, and 40.29%-53.45% respectively, in the IMAEC treatment, suggesting that the IMAEC revetment treatment showed higher water purification performance than the TEC revetment treatment. The results of SUVA254, a250/a365 and a253/a203 indicated that the IMAEC treatment showed relatively high removal efficiencies of refractory aromatic compounds. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis indicated that the removal rates for three fluorescent components (humic-like Components 1 and 2, and protein-like Component 3) reached 27.94%, 9.69% and 27.86 respectively, in the TEC treatment, and 51.35%, 30.10%, and 52.97% respectively, in the IMAEC treatment. 2D-COS mapping suggested that protein-like materials were more susceptible than humic-like substances, to the addition of metal ions. Protein-like materials can preferentially interact with metal ions, resulting in the effective removal of DOM-metal complexes, and can further influence the migration and transformation of metal ions.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wading birds have declined across Europe as the intensification of lowland agriculture has resulted in the loss and degradation of wetland areas. Lowland aggregate extraction sites that incorporate areas of fine, waste sediments deposited in silt lagoons have the potential to be restored for wader conservation. We set out to determine the potential value of silt lagoons to wading birds by comparing the water quality, sediment profiles, aquatic invertebrate abundance and diversity (prey availability) and wader site use at five sites representing various stages of active aggregate extraction and restoration for conservation purposes. Wader counts were conducted monthly over a twelve month period using replicated scan samples, and the invertebrate communities studied during the breeding and autumn migration season (June-September). Water quality variables were similar between sites, but sediments from active quarries were dominated by moderately sorted fine sands in comparison to the coarser sediment profiles of restored areas. June and September there was no significant difference in invertebrate diversity between sites, however richness was significantly lower on quarry sites and total abundance a factor of ten higher at restored sites than on silt lagoons, with the dominant taxa similar across all sites. Waders used all sites; albeit at lower abundance and richness on silt lagoons and two species were recorded breeding on active silting sites. We conclude that the fine, uniform sediments of modern silt lagoons limited invertebrate diversity and abundance, diminishing the value of silt lagoons to waders. Simple low-cost intervention measures increasing substrate heterogeneity and creating temporary ponds could increase invertebrate richness and abundance, and enhance the conservation potential of these sites.

Water quality before and after watershed-scale implementation of stormwater wet ponds in the coastal plain	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wet ponds have been used extensively for stormwater control throughout the US, including coastal areas. Despite the widespread application of these water control structures, few studies have investigated how watershed-scale implementation of wet ponds affects downstream water quality or how the pollutant removal efficacy of wet ponds changes over time in a coastal setting. This study utilizes a seven year data set of nutrient, total suspended solid, and chlorophyll-a concentration data collected during baseflow and stormflow from two coastal headwater streams draining a developed (28% impervious) and an undeveloped (1.2% impervious) watershed. The seven year record encompasses before, during, and after a large construction project and concurrent implementation of wet ponds in the developed watershed that drain 97% of the watershed area. Additional nutrient, total suspended solid, and chlorophyll-a concentration data were collected from within a wet pond in the developed watershed during baseflow over a single spring and summer. A comparison of stream water quality before and after the construction project and wet pond implementation in the developed watershed showed that mean chlorophyll-a, nitrate-nitrite (NOx-), organic nitrogen, and total suspended solid concentrations significantly increased, the mean orthophosphate (PO43-) concentration significantly decreased, and the mean ammonium (NH4+) concentration did not change. Over a three year time period after construction and pond implementation, developed stream chlorophyll-a, ammonium, and organic nitrogen concentrations decreased, and nitrate-nitrite, orthophosphate, and total suspended solid concentrations increased compared to the reference stream during the same period, indicating changes in pollutant removal capacity. A comparison of baseflow and stormflow samples during the Post period and samples from a wet pond in the developed watershed indicated that ponds were functioning as sources of chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids to the stream and sinks for nitrate-nitrite. Overall, watershed-scale implementation of wet ponds in the developed watershed failed to mitigate many negative water quality impacts caused by increased development. This study suggests that centralized stormwater management may not be optimal for maintaining water quality in coastal environments, and that pond retrofits combined with frequent excavation could improve pollutant removal by wet ponds. Further research on the effects of nutrient cycling in coastal wet ponds and wet pond maintenance is needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Etheridge, JR; Burchell, MR; Birgand, F				Etheridge, J. Randall; Burchell, Michael R., II; Birgand, Francois			Can created tidal marshes reduce nitrate export to downstream estuaries?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed marshes have the potential to serve as a buffer between anthropogenic sources of nitrogen and nutrient sensitive estuaries. Yet, there is little information available on the reduction of nitrogen loads that created tidal marshes might provide. A 5.6 ha brackish marsh was constructed between row crop agricultural production and an estuary in North Carolina. Nitrate-N fluxes in and out of the marsh were monitored multiple times per hour for over a year to capture tidal and storm dynamics. Out of the five storms when most of the fluxes occurred, nitrate was retained in four (up to 42%), and released in the fifth, such that over the monitoring period the marsh retained 9% (40 kg) of the nitrate that entered. Nutrient addition tracer studies confirmed the potential nitrate retention (up to 45%) of the marsh. The residence time of water in the constructed brackish marsh was identified as the primary factor limiting nitrate retention through an examination of the factors that were related to percent nitrate retention. A retention model based on a mass transfer coefficient was applied during the storm events and tracer studies to further evaluate the marsh N retention capacity. The model adequately simulated the nitrate retention with calibrated mass transfer coefficients (0.1-0.56 m day(-1)) that fell within the range of those reported in literature for other systems. These results indicate that constructed tidal marshes can serve as substantial nitrate sinks and can be an integral part of overall plans to reduce the nutrient export to estuaries.

Effectiveness of water diversion and erosion control structures on skid trails following timber harvesting	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Sediment in forested watersheds is produced primarily from highly disturbed areas such as skid trails. Forestry best management practices (BMPs) have been developed to minimize erosion and water quality problems, but the efficacies of various BMP options such as water bars are not well documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different distances (slope lengths) between water diversion structures (water bars) on runoff volume and soil loss on different skid trail gradients on two soils with different textures. The treatments were located in an Iranian temperate forest and included combinations of three levels of trail gradient (<10%, 10-20% and >20%), four different distances between water bars (25, 50, 75, and 100 m), and two soil textures (clay loam and silt loam). Results showed that runoff volume increased curvilinearly and soil loss linearly with distances between water bars regardless of the soil texture and trail gradient. The greater distances on trail gradients >20% resulted in the highest amounts of runoff and soil loss; shorter distances on trail gradients <10% resulted in the lowest runoff and soil loss amount for the two tested soil textures. On the clay loam soil, 50 and 75 m were the most effective distances between water bars for trail gradients >20 and <20%, respectively. On the silt loam soil, 25 m and 50 m were the most effective distances between water bars for trail gradients >20 and <20%, respectively. The results of our study confirm that slope angle is a primary factor in controlling surface runoff and soil loss on skid trails and that soil texture becomes increasingly important as slope gradients become steeper. Therefore, reducing skid trail slope during construction skid trails is recommended to decrease surface runoff and soil loss in forest operations. Further, BMPs should consider soil texture in addition to slope gradient when recommending spacing between water bars. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The role of algae and cyanobacteria in the production and release of odorants in water	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												This review covers literatures pertaining to algal and cyanobacterial odor problems that have been published over the last five decades. Proper evaluation of algal and cyanobacterial odors may help establish removal strategies for hazardous metabolites while enhancing the recyclability of water. A bloom of microalgae is a sign of an anthropogenic disturbance in aquatic systems and can lead to diverse changes in ecosystems along with increased production of odorants. In general, because algal and cyanobacterial odors vary in chemistry and intensity according to blooining pattern, it is necessary to learn more about the related factors and processes (e.g., changes due to differences in taxa). This necessitates systematic and transdisciplinary approaches that require the cooperation of chemists, biologists, engineers, and policy makers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Concentrations of 22 target PFASs and general water quality parameters were determined monthly for a year in filtered water samples from five tributaries and three sampling stations of an urban water body. Of the 22 target PFASs, 17 PFASs were detected with a frequency >93% including PFCAs: C4-C12 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates, C4, C6, C8, and C10 perfluoroalkane sulfonates, perfluorooctane sulfonamides and perfluorooctane sulfonamide substances (FOSAMs), C10 perfluoroalkyl phosphonic acid (C10 PFPA), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA) and C8/C8 perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acid (C8/C8-PFPIA). The most abundant PFASs in water were PFBS (1.4-55 ng/L), PFBA (1.0-23 ng/L), PFOS (1.5-24 ng/L) and PFOA (2.0-21 ng/L). In the tributaries, PFNA concentrations ranged from 1.2 to 87.1 ng/L except in the May 2013 samples of two tributaries, which reached 520 and 260 ng/L. Total PFAS concentrations in the sediment samples ranged from 1.6 to 15 ng/g d.w. with EtFOSAA, PFDoA, PFOS and PFDA being the dominant species. Based on water and sediment data, two types of sources were inferred: one-time or intermittent point sources and continuous non-point sources. FOSAMs and PFOS released continually from non-point sources, C8/C8 PFPIA, PFDoA and PFUnA was released from point sources. The highly water soluble short-chain PFASs including PFBA, PFPeA and PFBS remained predominantly in the water column. The factors governing solution phase concentrations appear to be compound hydrophobicity and sorption to suspended particles. Correlation of the dissolved phase concentrations with precipitation data suggested stormwater was a significant source of PFBA, PFBS, PFUnA and PFDoA. Negative correlations with precipitation indicated sources feeding FOSAA and FOSA directly into the tributaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Metal toxicity affects predatory stream invertebrates less than other functional feeding groups	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Ecosystem effects of heavy metals need to be identified for a retrospective risk assessment, and potential impacts need to be predicted for a prospective risk assessment. In this study, we established a strong correlation between the toxic pressure of dissolved metals and invertebrate species. We compiled available data from a wide geographical range of Australian streams that were contaminated with heavy metals [mainly copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)] and the corresponding invertebrate communities. Heavy metal toxicity is positively related to the proportion of predators within the invertebrate community, represented by the predator(ratio), with an effect threshold range of 2.6 mu g/L - 26 a for Cu and 62 mu g/L - 617 mu g/L for Zn. These effect concentrations are in the ranges of the concentrations identified in model ecosystems and other field investigations and are just above the existing guideline limits. Heavy metals also affects the taxa richness negatively. Other community measures, such as the evenness, number of EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) taxa, SPEcies At Risk (SPEAR)(pesticides) or SPEAR(salinity) were relatively poorly correlated with heavy metal toxicity in the streams. Therefore, we suggest applying the predator(ratio) within the community as a starting point for an indicator of the dissolved metal toxicity, the SPEAR(metals). (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Work, K; Codner, K; Gibbs, M				Work, Kirsten; Codner, Keneil; Gibbs, Melissa			How could discharge management affect Florida spring fish assemblage structure?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Freshwater bodies are increasingly affected by reductions in water quantity and quality and by invasions of exotic species. To protect water quantity and maintain the ecological integrity of many water bodies in central Florida, a program of adopting Minimum Flows and Levels (MFLs) has begun for both lentic and lotic waters. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there were relationships between discharge and stage, water quality, and biological parameters for Volusia Blue Spring, a first magnitude spring (discharge > 380,000 m(3) day(-1) or 100 mgd) for which an MFL program was adopted in 2006. Over the course of fourteen years, we assessed fish density and diversity weekly, monthly, or seasonally with seine and snorkel counts. We evaluated annual changes in the assemblages for relationships with water quantity and quality. Low discharge and dissolved oxygen combined with high stage and conductivity produced a fish population with a lower density and diversity in 2014 than in previous years. Densities of fish taxonomic/functional groups also were low in 2014 and measures of water quantity were significant predictors of fish assemblage structure. As a result of the strong relationships between variation in discharge and an array of chemical and biological characteristics of the spring, we conclude that maintaining the historical discharge rate is important for preserving the ecological integrity of Volusia Blue Spring.

The impact of influent water quality including chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium and orthophosphate concentrations on the reactor performance was evaluated. The results showed the system was very effective at removing both COD (>88%) and NH4+-N (>96%) despite varying influent concentrations of COD, NH4+-N, and total PO43-P. In contrast, it was found that the removal of P was sensitive to influent NFIt-N and PO43-P concentrations. The maximum POlc-P removal of 79% was achieved with the lowest influent NH4+-N and PO43-P concentration. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays showed a high abundance and diversity of phosphate accumulating organisms (PAO), nitrifiers and denitriflers. The MiSeq microbial community structure analysis showed that the Proteobacteria (especially beta-Proteobacteria, and gamma-Proteobacteria) were the dominant in all reactors. Further analysis of the bacteria indicated the presence of diverse PAO genera including Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis, Tetrasphaera, and Rhodocyclus, and the denitrifying PAO (DPAO) genus Dechloromonas. Interestingly, no glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) were detected in any of the reactors, suggesting the advantage of proposed process in term of PAO selection for enhanced P removal compared with conventional main-stream processes.

To improve the water quality, the restoration of lake by three methods: aeration, phosphorus inactivation using small doses of iron sulphate and magnesium chloride (FeSO4 and MgCl2) and biomanipulation was initiated at the end of 2011. The aim of the present study was to determine whether sustainable restoration has a significant impact on phytoplankton, especially cyanobacterial blooms in a shallow, urban, degraded lake. Therefore, phytoplankton and the physico-chemical parameters of water at the summer thermal stratification and autumn water mixing before (2011) and during restoration (2012-2014) was studied. Samples were collected at the deepest place of the lake in depth profile, every 1 m. Phytoplankton samples were preserved with Lugol's solution. The phytoplankton was counted using a Sedgewick-Rafter chamber with a volume of 0.46 ml. Measurements of water temperature were made in the field with a YSI multiparameter meter, transparency using a Secchi disk. Concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll a were analysed in the laboratory according to Polish standards. As a result of restoration the water quality of the lake has improved. Cyanobacteria had almost disappeared during the first year of restoration, however, a short bloom was observed (dominated by Pseudanabeana limnetica) in the second year. The main reason for this reappearance was a higher water temperature stimulating cyanobacteria growth, but an increased supply of phosphorus from the bottom sediments also contributed. A decrease in the temperature in the third year of restoration limited the growth of cyanobacteria again. Although the decrease in the phosphorus concentration as a result of restoration proved to be sufficient for average climatic conditions, it is highly likely to be more intense in the case of increased water temperature caused by global warming.

In the drinking water production chain, in addition to the vulnerability of source waters, the distribution networks are prone to contamination. In this study, a pilot-scale drinking-water distribution network with an on-line monitoring system was utilized for detecting bacterial intrusion. During the experimental Escherichia coli intrusions, the contaminant was measured by applying a set of on-line sensors for electric conductivity (EC), pH, temperature (T), turbidity,UV-absorbance at 254 nm (UVAS SC) and with a device for particle counting. Monitored parameters were compared with the measured E. coli counts using the integral calculations of the detected peaks. EC measurement gave the strongest signal compared with the measured baseline during the E. coli intrusion. Integral calculations showed that the peaks in the EC, pH, T, turbidity and UVAS SC data were detected corresponding to the time predicted. However, the pH and temperature peaks detected were barely above the measured baseline and could easily be mixed with the background noise. The results indicate that on-line monitoring can be utilized for the rapid detection of microbial contaminants in the drinking water distribution system although the peak interpretation has to be performed carefully to avoid being mixed up with normal variations in the measurement data.

Smart Water Network Modeling for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Urbanization can significantly increase the load on aging, inefficient and already strained sewer infrastructure, resulting in catastrophic pipe failure, unwanted spillage, property damage, and serious threat to public health. Urbanization can also dramatically alter the natural water cycle, resulting in diminished water quality, increased frequency and severity of flooding, channel erosion and destruction of aquatic habitat. Recent advances in smart water network (SWN) modeling technology have played a crucial and growing role in addressing these challenges. SWN technology has equipped practicing engineers with a comprehensive set of analytical decision making tools designed to help them preserve structural integrity, manage and reduce the risks of sewer overflow and urban runoff, improve resiliency and keep their urban drainage networks operating well into the future. These advances propel routine conveyance system analysis from basic planning and design to two-dimensional surface/ subsurface flow modeling, real-time operation and control, analytical risk-based asset integrity and condition assessment, and optimal selection and placement of green infrastructure based on cost and effectiveness. SWN is providing critically needed support to federal, state, and local agencies and watershed practitioners - not only in optimizing their integrated water management and adaptation strategies, but in ensuring sustainable drainage, addressing environmental quality restoration and protection needs in urban and developing areas, and improving communities' resiliency. It is also within the grasp of utilities of all sizes, but they need to seize the opportunity.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				AUG	2017	31	10					3177	3188		10.1007/s11269-017-1699-1								WOS:000403791300018						
J	Tayfur, G				Tayfur, Gokmen			Modern Optimization Methods in Water Resources Planning, Engineering and Management	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Mathematical (analytical, numerical and optimization) models are employed in many disciplines including the water resources planning, engineering and management. These models can vary from a simple black-box model to a sophisticated distributed physics-based model. Recently, development and employment of modern optimization methods (MOMs) have become popular in the area of mathematical modeling. This paper overviews the MOMs based on the evolutionary search which were developed over mostly the last 30 years. These methods have wide application in practice from finance to engineering and this paper focuses mostly on the applications in the area of water resources planning, engineering and management. Although there are numerous optimization algorithms, the paper outlines the ones that have been widely employed especially in the last three decades; such as the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony (AC), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm (PS), Harmony Search (HS), Genetic Programming (GP), and Gene Expression Programming (GEP). The paper briefly introduces theoretical background of each algorithm and its applications and discusses the merits and, if any, shortcomings. The wide spectrum of applications include, but not limited to, flood control and mitigation, reservoir operation, irrigation, flood routing, river training, flow velocity, rainfall-runoff processes, sediment transport, groundwater management, water quality, hydropower, dispersion, and aquifers.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				AUG	2017	31	10					3205	3233		10.1007/s11269-017-1694-6								WOS:000403791300020

It is reported toxic to aquatic organisms, and frequently occurs at relatively high concentrations. Currently, ATZ has been proved to affect reproduction of aquatic species at much lower levels. So it is controversial to perform ecological risk assessment using predicted no-effect concentrations (PENCs) derived from traditional endpoints, which fail to provide adequate protection to aquatic organisms. In this study, PNECs of ATZ were derived based on six endpoints of survival, growth, behavior, biochemistry, genetics and reproduction. The PNEC derived from reproductive lesion was 0.044 mu g ATZ L-1, which was obviously lower than that derived from other endpoints. In addition, a tiered ecological risk assessment was conducted in the Taizi River based on six PNECs derived from six categories of toxicity endpoints. Results of these two methods of ecological risk assessment were consistent with each other, and the risk level of ATZ to aquatic organisms reached highest as taking reproductive fitness into account. The joint probability indicated that severe ecological risk rooting in reproduction might exist 93.9% and 99.9% of surface water in the Taizi River, while 5% threshold (HC5) and 1% threshold (HC1) were set up to protect aquatic organisms, respectively. We hope the present work could provide valuable information to manage and control ATZ pollution.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				AUG	2017	142						464	470		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.04.006								WOS:000403384300056	28458230					
J	Kim, SE; Seo, IW; Choi, SY				Kim, Sung Eun; Seo, Il Won; Choi, Soo Yeon			Assessment of water quality variation of a monitoring network using exploratory factor analysis and empirical orthogonal function	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												This study suggests a systematic assessment method that jointly uses the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and empirical orthogonal function (EOF-patterns) of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to assess the water quality variation of the monitoring network of Nakdong River, Korea, in which 28 stations measuring 15 water quality parameters are located. The EFA results showed the monitoring stations to be distinguished by two main factors. The representative stations of which the variance was almost explained by the specific factor were selected. We applied PCA to the monitoring data of representative stations, and then analyzed the EOF-patterns that indicate the characteristics of water-quality variation for each factor. With the interpretation of main factors and EOF-patterns causing dominant water quality variations, the monitoring network of Nakdong River could be spatially and seasonally evaluated according to the contribution of each factor.

While previous efforts have shown the advantage of using the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands instead of near-infrared (NIR) bands for atmospheric correction, such an approach could only be applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite (MODISA). This is because MODIS data from the Terra satellite (MODIST) contain more noise and other sensor artifacts, thus this sensor has been generally regarded by the ocean color research community as not being able to provide science quality data. Here, we address this technical challenge through noise reduction and regional vicarious calibration adjustment, and demonstrate preliminary success using turbid Taihu Lake as an example. The noise in the three SWIR bands was evaluated first, and then reduced through a noise reduction method. The SWIR bands were adjusted over open-ocean waters using the well-calibrated NIR ocean bands (1-km resolution) and radiative transfer, which were then used to adjust the land bands (250-m and 500-m resolution) in the visible and NIR over turbid waters where concurrent field-measured reflectance spectra are available. Of all three combinations of SWIR bands, the combination of 1240 and 1640-nm bands was found to perform the best, showing significantly improved retrieval accuracy for Taihu Lake, leading to recovery of low-quality MODIST data to higher-quality data comparable to MODISA, and thus doubling valid data coverage. Testing of this approach on another highly turbid lake (Chaohu Lake, China) showed similar results. While the general application of this approach to turbid lakes still needs to be tested as local tuning of the calibration coefficients may be required, these results suggest that MODIST may be used as effectively as MODISA for monitoring Taihu Lake water quality.

Through the integration of remotely sensed data and FVC estimation models, FVC can be routinely and periodically monitored using remote sensing images over large areas. However, due to frequent cloud contamination and trade-offs in satellite sensor design, the FVC estimates from remote sensing data are not continuous, either spatially or temporally, and cannot simultaneously depict details in spatio-temporal variation. Taking the seasonally inundated Zoige alpine wetland in China as a case area, the objective of this paper is to develop a practical and effective approach to quantifying the explicit vegetation FVC details with both high spatial and temporal resolution. In this approach, 30-m multi-spectral images from the Chinese HJ-1A/B (HuanJing (HJ), which means environment in Chinese) satellite constellation with a 2-day revisit time were first composited at 16-day intervals to improve spatio-temporal continuity. Then, a new adaptive endmember selection linear spectral mixture model (ASLSMM) was proposed to improve the accuracy of FVC estimation by considering the endmember dynamics for each pixel. FVC time series were finally estimated by applying the ASLSMM to the cloudless HJ composites. The performance of the model and the spatio-temporal representational capability of the FVC estimation results were comprehensively evaluated using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) reference images and ground measurements from an integrated, multi-scale remote sensing experiment. A traditional LSMM with fixed endmembers and the Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) model were also used for model performance comparison. The results showed that the R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from the proposed model and the UAV reference were 0.7315 and 0.1016 (unitless) respectively, which was better than the results from the linear spectral mixture model with a fixed number of endmembers, with R-2 of 0.5924 and RMSE of 0.3821. The R-2 and RMSE values between the FVC estimated from MESMA and the UAV reference were 0.6327 and 0.1578, which was comparable with the ASLSMM. The accuracy evaluation usingmulti-temporal in situ measurements indicated the consistently high performance of the ASLSMM. This study highlights the feasibility of using HJ satellite constellation images to generate the temporally dense and fine spatial resolution FVC estimations for wetland and wetland-like heterogeneous landscape monitoring. The proposed approach can be viewed as a reference for generating FVC datasets from the on-going HJ constellation and similar constellation missions such as Sentinel-2A/B. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, to develop a rapid, sensitive and selective strategy for detection of anionic surfactants is of great importance. Herein, we rationally designed and synthesized a novel fluorescent dye TPIM-ClO4 with excellent characters based on aggregation-induced emission (AlE). TPIM-ClO4 exhibited many incomparable characteristics including large Stokes shifts (225 nm), long wavelength emission (650 nm), excellent water solubility and stability. It was demonstrated to be excellent probe for detection of sodium dodecyl sulfate with fast responding (40 s), good selectivity and extremely low detection limit 48 nM (13.07 a), which ascribe to the formation of tightly packed nanoaggregates in situ based on synergistic electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. TPIM-ClO4 was further successfully used to the detection of sodium dodecyl sulfate in real water samples with satisfactory results. Furthermore, probe TPIM-ClO4 was also successfully applied for specific fluorescent imaging of Gram-positive bacteria without washing steps. This study may provide new strategy in designing AIE-based fluorescent probe for environmental monitoring and microbial analysis application. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As niche innovation, new ways of monitoring face systemic barriers. The present article examines how barriers to change manifest in discursive practices with differing normative attachments and implications. A frame analysis revealed two competing frames: (1) the dominant 'norm water' frame in which thresholds of chemical compounds are used to set policy targets; and (2) the contesting 'living water' frame, which entails innovative continuous monitoring tools that take into account the ecological effects of chemical compounds. We introduce the concept of interactive reflectivity, as a discursive tool, to collaboratively visualize, scrutinize and overcome discursive barriers to innovations. The stakeholder dialogue shows how systemic barriers are uttered discursively in niches or other forms of responsible research and innovation and may hinder change even at the niche-level.

In particular, inadequate sanitation resulting in high contamination of surface water with pathogens of fecal origin is a serious issue in developing countries such as Lao P.D.R. Despite the health implications of the consumption of contaminated surface water, the environmental fate and transport of pathogens of fecal origin and their indicators (Fecal Indicator Bacteria or FIB) are still poorly known in tropical areas. In this study, we used measurements of flow rates, suspended sediments and of the FIB Escherichia coli (E. coli) in a 60-ha catchment in Northern Laos to explore the ability of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate watershed-scale FIB fate and transport. We assessed the influences of 3 in-stream processes, namely bacteria deposition and resuspension, bacterial regrowth, and hyporheic exchange (i.e. transient storage) on predicted FIB numbers. We showed that the SWAT model in its original version does not correctly simulate small E. coli numbers during the dry season. We showed that model's performance could be improved when considering the release of E. coli together with sediment resuspension. We demonstrated that the hyporheic exchange of bacteria across the Sediment-Water Interface (SWI) should be considered when simulating FIB concentration not only during wet weather, but also during the dry season, or baseflow period. In contrast, the implementation of the regrowth process did not improve the model during the dry season without inducing an overestimation during the wet season. This work thus underlines the importance of taking into account in-stream processes, such as deposition and resuspension, regrowth and hyporheic exchange, when using SWAT to simulate FIB dynamics in surface waters.

Currently used methods within EU allow at least a 2.2 day period for obtaining the analytical results, making outdated the information forwarded to the public. Obtained results and beach assessment are influenced by the temporal and spatial characteristics of sample collection, and numerous environmental parameters, as well as by differences of official water standards. This paper examines the temporal variation of microbiological parameters during the day, as well as the influence of the sampling hour, on decision processes in the management of the beach. Apart from the fecal indicators stipulated by the EU Bathing Water Directive (E. coli and enterococci), additional fecal (C. perfringens) and non-fecal (S. aureus and P. aeriginosa) parameters were analyzed. Moreover, the effects of applying different evaluation criteria (national, EU and U.S. EPA) to beach ranking were studied, and the most common reasons for exceeding water-quality standards were investigated. In order to upgrade routine monitoring, a predictive statistical model was developed. The highest concentrations of fecal indicators were recorded early in the morning (6 AM) due to the lack of solar radiation during the night period. When compared to enterococci, E. coli criteria appears to be more stringent for the detection of fecal pollution. In comparison to EU and U.S. EPA criteria, Croatian national evaluation criteria provide stricter public health standards. Solar radiation and precipitation were the predominant environmental parameters affecting beach water quality, and these parameters were included in the predictive model setup. Predictive models revealed great potential for the monitoring of recreational water bodies, and with further development can become a useful tool for the improvement of public health protection.

A novel concept in ground water quality management: Towards function specific screening values	WATER RESEARCH												This paper is meant to initiate and feed the discussion on a more sophisticated procedure for the derivation and use of groundwater screening values (GSVs). To this purpose, the possibilities and tools for the derivation of function specific GSVs, i.e., GSVs that depend on the actual contact of humans and ecosystems with groundwater and groundwater-related mediums, are elaborated in this study. Application of GSVs geared to the specific use and function of specific groundwater volumes could result in a more effective and cost-efficient groundwater quality management, without compromising the protection of human health and the ecosystem. Therefore, a procedure to derive function specific GSVs was developed. For illustrative purposes, risk limits have been derived for human health and ecological protection targets, for arsenic, benzene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and vinylchloride. Agriculture and Nature reserves (combined), Residential and Industrial land uses have been considered and two different groundwater management purposes, i.e., curative and sustainable groundwater management. For each of the four contaminants, this results in a series of risks limits for each function and land use combination. It is shown that for all four contaminants higher groundwater screening values are considered appropriate for less sensitive combinations of function and land use. In the process towards (policy) implementation of these function specific GSV, it is recommended to evaluate the selection of protection targets; the scientific basis of the risk assessment procedures applied and the methodology to assess the time factor for groundwater quality assessment, given the fact that groundwater is a dynamic medium. Moreover, protection levels must be harmonized with national or regional groundwater quality standards and correspond with the requirements of the Groundwater Daughter Directive of the European Union Water Framework Directive. Groundwater plumes that are judged as 'no need for remediation' are not compatible with the Water Framework Directive requirement to take actions to prevent or limit inputs of contaminants, even when no receptor is present. However, the European Commission formulated a series of exemptions, to avoid that the "prevent" requirement would imply an onerous and sometimes unfeasible task. The function specific GSVs derived in this study could be used to identify the groundwater volumes that do not result in an unacceptable risk. 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial identification of critical nutrient loads of large shallow lakes: Implications for Lake Taihu (China)	WATER RESEARCH												Ongoing eutrophication frequently causes toxic phytoplankton blooms. This induces huge worldwide challenges for drinking water quality, food security and public health. Of crucial importance in avoiding and reducing blooms is to determine the maximum nutrient load ecosystems can absorb, while remaining in a good ecological state. These so called critical nutrient loads for lakes depend on the shape of the load-response curve. Due to spatial variation within lakes, load-response curves and therefore critical nutrient loads could vary throughout the lake. In this study we determine spatial patterns in critical nutrient loads for Lake Taihu (China) with a novel modelling approach called Spatial Ecosystem Bifurcation Analysis (SEBA). SEBA evaluates the impact of the lake's total external nutrient load on the local lake dynamics, resulting in a map of critical nutrient loads for different locations throughout the lake. Our analysis shows that the largest part of Lake Taihu follows a nonlinear load-response curve without hysteresis. The corresponding critical nutrient loads vary within the lake and depend on management goals, i.e. the maximum allowable chlorophyll concentration. According to our model, total nutrient loads need to be more than halved to reach chlorophyll-a concentrations of 30-40 mu g L-1 in most sections of the lake. To prevent phytoplankton blooms with 20 mu g L-1 chlorophyll-a throughout Lake Taihu, both phosphorus and nitrogen loads need a nearly 90% reduction. We conclude that our approach is of great value to determine critical nutrient loads of lake ecosystems such as Taihu and likely of spatially heterogeneous ecosystems in general.

The concentrations of dissolved organic matter and ammonia decreased downstream the reservoir, while the specific UV absorbance (SUVA: the ratio of UV254 to dissolved organic carbon), increased [from 0.67 L/(mg*m) upstream to 3.58 L/(mg*m) downstream]. The raw water quality played an important role in the formation of DBPs. During chlorination, haloacetic acids (HAAs) were the major DBPs formed in most of the water samples, followed by trihalotnethanes (THMs). CHCl3 and CHCl2Br were the major THM species, while trichloroacetic acid (TCAA) and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA) were the major HAA species. Chloramination, on the other hand, generally resulted in lower concentrations of THMs (CHCl3), HAM (TCAA and DCAA), and haloacetonitriles (HANs). All the species of DBPs formed had positive correlations with the SUVA values, and HANs had the highest one (R-2 = 0.8). The correlation coefficients between the analogous DBP yields and the SUVA values in chlorinated samples were close to those in chloraminated samples. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We also set up a numerical model to resolve hydrodynamics and fate of water quality variables in the system. Results show that most of nutrients loading are trapped in the lake and higher concentrations of nutrients and organic matters (OM) are present only inside of the artificial sea dike. There exist episodial discharges at the dam, which coincide mostly with rainfall events during summer monsoon periods. During this discharge event, lower salinity and higher suspended solids, nutrients, and OM are observed in surface layer of the estuarine section. Hydrodynamic model results show that circulation in the estuarine section is governed by freshwater discharge from the lake, resulting in an enhanced two-layer estuarine circulation being dominated, during and after the freshwater is discharged. Such two-layer estuarine circulation combined with higher concentration of nutrients in the surface layer results in that outfluxes of nutrients in the surface layer dominate over the influxes in the bottom layer during summer high precipitation periods. Meanwhile, numerical dye experiment results show that the discharged water with elevated nutrients levels have a short residence time (similar to 5-10 days) in the estuarine section. Due to this fast flushing rate, excessive nutrient loadings are not used to produce biological matters in the estuarine section.

The formation of reactive Fe and Al oxyhydroxides during the neutralization of AD at river confluences is a natural attenuation process. Although it is known that organic matter (OM) can affect the aggregation of Fe and Al oxyhydroxides and the sorption of As onto their surfaces, the role of OM during the neutralization of AD at river confluences has not been studied. Field and experimental approaches were used to understand this role, using the Azufre River (pH 2) - Caracarani River (pH 8.6) confluence (northern Chile) as model system. Field measurements of organic carbon revealed a 10-15% loss of OM downstream the confluence, which was attributed to associations with Fe and Al oxyhydroxides that settle in the river bed. Laboratory mixtures of AD water with synthetic Caracarani waters under varying conditions of pH, concentration and type of OM revealed that OM promoted the aggregation of Fe oxyhydroxides without reducing As sorption, enhancing the removal of As at slightly acidic conditions (pH similar to 4.5). At acidic conditions (pH 3), aggregation of OM - metal complexes at high OM concentrations could become the main removal mechanism. One type of OM promoted bimodal particle size distributions with larger mean sizes, possibly increasing the settling velocity of aggregates. This work contributes to a better understanding of the role of OM in AD affected basins, showing that the presence of OM during processes of neutralization of AD can enhance the removal of toxic elements.

Observed Po-210 levels were: 1) 0.56-3.75 mBq/L in the dissolved phase (<0.45 mu m) in the seawater column and local rivers, 2) 0.35-3.11 mBq/L (400-2300 Bq/kg, dry weight, dw) in suspended particulate matter (SPM, 0.45-20 mu m) in the seawater column and local rivers, 3) 40 (Isonzo River) -158 Bq/kg (in a surface sediment cores collected in a NS transect in the gulf and sectioned to the depth of 20 cm) and 4) 239 (autumn) - 415 to 1800 (spring) Bq/kg (dw) in meso(zoo)plankton (>200 mu m). In seawater and tributaries, up to 80% (mean 49%) of total 210Po was found in particulate form. In sediments, slightly higher levels were encountered in the Isonzo prodelta and in the central (depocenter) part of the gulf. K-D (L/kg) calculated between seawater and SPM, and seawater and sediment amounted to about 5 x 10(6) and 6 x 10(4), respectively. Lower autumn Po-210 levels can be a consequence of biological dilution by higher mesozooplankton biomass in the autumn compared to spring. Plankton fractionation revealed in general the highest levels in the >200 mu m mesoplankton fraction (239-1800 Bq/kg) followed by 50-200 mu m (388-996 Bq/kg) and 20-50 mu m (318-810 Bq/kg) microplankton fractions. Obtained data show higher Po-210 levels in all matrices analyzed in the Gulf of Trieste compared to other Adriatic (central Adriatic) and western Mediterranean areas. The Po-210/Pb-210 ratios in water, plankton and sediments were mostly below or around 1, while this ratio was much higher at higher trophic levels (up to about 50), reflecting a preferential bioaccumulation of Po-210 over Pb-210. Po-210 accumulation between seawater and SPM and seawater and mesozooplankton amounted to 3.7 x 10(4) and 1.1 x 10(4), respectively, similar to other Adriatic areas. Comparison of the relative importance of pelagic and benthic bioaccumulation pathways, excluding the filter feeder bivalves, suggests greater accumulation in pelagic-feeding species.

Wetting is typically determined by examining the permeate water quality. In this work, we apply an electrically conductive membrane to direct contact membrane distillation combined with an electrochemical system. The membrane was fabricated by heat pressing a carbon cloth with electrospun PVDF-HFP mat. The membrane acts not only as a barrier to reject salt with 99.6% rejection, but also as an electrode where in the current through the system is used to detect wetting which allows Na+ and Cl- ions to complete the cell. It was found that the membrane has an LEP of 36 psi and mean pore size of 0.2 mu m. A continuous voltage of + 1V was applied during the direct contact membrane distillation process, and a sharp increase in current was observed at the point where wetting was induced.

Moreover, an increasing number of SAs has been detected in natural water and urban water supply systems in recent years because they cannot be completely removed through conventional water treatment processes. Therefore, sulfamethazine (SMZ) in urban water systems was selected as a target to be investigated. The reaction kinetics of sulfamethazine chlorination were studied in a pilot-scale water distribution system (WDS) under the influence of different factors, including pH, temperature, flow rate and pipe materials, to determine the optimal factors for removing SMZ and to provide a reference for water quality in urban drinking water systems. According to the experimental results, the kinetics models of SMZ chlorination fitted a second-order reaction in pure water. The degradation of SMZ was not only affected by the water quality conditions but also the operating temperatures, flow rates and pipe materials. The rate constants of SMZ chlorination under different temperatures were related to the Arrhenius equation. Different flow rates had little effect on SMZ degradation. In different pipes, the degradation rates of SMZ followed the order stainless steel pipe > polyethylene pipe (PE) > ductile iron pipe. Moreover, eight reaction intermediates during SMZ degradation were observed and identified, and a degradation pathway was proposed. The concentrations of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) during the degradation of SMZ in WDS were also determined. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bu, LJ; Bi, C; Shi, Z; Zhou, SQ				Bu, Lingjun; Bi, Chen; Shi, Zhou; Zhou, Shiqing			Significant enhancement on ferrous/persulfate oxidation with epigallocatechin-3-gallate: Simultaneous chelating and reducing	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												A kind of green tea extract, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was introduced into Fe2+ activated persulfate (Fe2+/PS) system to enhance the degradation efficiency of atrazine. The involvement of EGCG improved atrazine degradation significantly in the pH range of 2.0-7.0, which could be interpreted by the strong reducing and chelating ability of EGCG. EGCG showed a better performance than hydroxylamine and ascorbic acid in modified Fe2+/PS systems, as the presence of EGCG could not only accelerate the transformation of Fe3+ to Fe2+, but prevent the formation of iron precipitation. Batch experiments were conducted and atrazine degradation depended upon the dosage of EGCG, persulfate, Fe2+, and other water quality parameters including initial pH, co-existing anions and natural organic matters. Radical quenching test and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis were also performed and results showed that two kinds of radicals (sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radical) were verified to exist and play a significant role on atrazine degradation in the Fe2+/EGCG/PS system. Moreover, possible intermediates of atrazine were identified by HPLC/MS/MS and degradation pathWays of atrazine and EGCG were proposed. This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding on the potential application of EGCG to enhance degradation of refractory organics in water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that Mn2+ adsorbs on the MnM sediment, and under aerobic conditions, rapid Mn(II) oxidation takes place. The MnM exhibited superior Mn(II) adsorption capacity compared to other commercially available manganese oxide catalysts. A filter loaded with anthracite-supported MnM was developed and used as a highly efficient, reagentless catalyst for the continuous oxidative removal of dissolved Mn. A 10-13m3<bold>h</bold>-1 pilot plant was constructed for Mn removal from Mn-rich effluent by atmospheric oxygen oxidation. The system operated continuously for more than two years with minimal maintenance, without oxidative regeneration. No ripening period was required, and the fixed bed exhibits exceptionally high catalytic efficiency. The proposed filter is superior to synthetic supported manganese oxide reactors because it does not require periodic regeneration by strong oxidizers; it is superior to filtration units for manganese removal because it does not require ripening time. A possible explanation for the superior catalytic activity based on the delicate, two-dimensional structure of MnM is presented.

The methodology stems from recent trends in hydrologic transport that acknowledge the dynamic nature of streamflow age and explores the use of water age fractions as an alternative to the mean age. The approach uses a travel time-based transport model to compute the fractions of streamflow that are younger than some thresholds (e.g., younger than a few weeks) and compares them to observed solute concentration patterns. The method is here validated with data from the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest during spring 2008, where we show that the presence of water younger than roughly 2 weeks, tracked using a hydrologic transport model and deuterium measurements, mimics the variation in dissolved silicon concentrations. Our approach suggests that an age-discharge relationship can be coupled to classic concentration-discharge relationship, to identify the links between transport timescales and solute concentration. Our results highlight that the younger streamflow components can be crucial for determining water quality variations and for characterizing the dominant hydrologic transport dynamics.

Major agricultural changes required to mitigate phosphorus losses under climate change	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Phosphorus losses from land to water will be impacted by climate change and land management for food production, with detrimental impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Here we use a unique combination of methods to evaluate the impact of projected climate change on future phosphorus transfers, and to assess what scale of agricultural change would be needed to mitigate these transfers. We combine novel high-frequency phosphorus flux data from three representative catchments across the UK, a new high-spatial resolution climate model, uncertainty estimates from an ensemble of future climate simulations, two phosphorus transfer models of contrasting complexity and a simplified representation of the potential intensification of agriculture based on expert elicitation from land managers. We show that the effect of climate change on average winter phosphorus loads (predicted increase up to 30% by 2050s) will be limited only by large-scale agricultural changes (e.g., 20-80% reduction in phosphorus inputs).

Release of phosphorus from crop residue and cover crops over the non-growing season in a cool temperate region	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												In northern climates, crop residue and cover crops are potential sources of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) to runoff; yet, there are few field studies to quantify this. The objectives of this study were (1) to quantify changes in water extractable phosphorus (WEP) concentrations in the residues of Triticum aestivum L. (winter wheat), Trifolium pretense L (red clover) and Avena sativa L. (oat) cover crops and surface soil in two agricultural fields (ILD and LON) over the non-growing season (NGS); and (2) to determine if changes in WEP in vegetation residue or soil were reflected in loads of DRP or total P (TP) in surface runoff and/or tile drain effluent. Concentrations of WEP in cover crops were larger than those in wheat residue and soil. Water extractable P concentrations in vegetation increased with plant decomposition and decreased following runoff events indicating that the plant WEP was mobilized in runoff. Differences in WEP concentrations were not observed with topography, with the exception of the period following snowmelt when low-lying areas prone to surface inundation were depleted relative to upland locations. Although WEP appeared to have been mobilized from vegetation and soil pools, loads of DRP (0.165-0.245 kg ha(-1)) and TP (0.295 kg ha(-1)-0.360 kg ha(-1)) leaving the fields were small in comparison to P pools in cover crops (7.70 kg ha(-1) oat, 1.70 kg ha(-1) red clover), wheat residues (0.03-0.06 kg ha(-1)) and soils (1.39-5.87 kg ha(-1)), suggesting that much of the P released from vegetation was retained within the field. This study provides insight into the timing and magnitude of P release from vegetation throughout the non-growing season in regions with cool temperate climates, and provides an improved understanding of the contribution of cover crops to winter P losses.

J	Mallants, D; Simunek, J; Torkzaban, S				Mallants, Dirk; Simunek, Jirka; Torkzaban, Saeed			Determining water quality requirements of coal seam gas produced water for sustainable irrigation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Coal seam gas production in Australia generates large volumes of produced water that is generally high in total dissolved solids and has a high sodium absorption ratio (SAR) which may affect soil structure, hydraulic conductivity, and crop production if used untreated for irrigation. By coupling major ion soil chemistry and unsaturated flow and plant water uptake, this study incorporates effects of salt concentrations on soil hydraulic properties and on root water uptake for soils irrigated with produced water featuring different water qualities. Simulations provided detailed results regarding chemical indicators of soil and plant health, i.e. SAR, EC and sodium concentrations. Results from a base scenario indicated that the use of untreated produced water for irrigation would cause SAR and EC values to significantly exceed the soil quality guide values in Australia and New Zealand (ANZECC). The simulations provided further useful insights in the type of coupled processes that might occur, and what the potential impacts could be on soil hydrology and crop growth. Calculations showed that the use of untreated produced water resulted in a decrease in soil hydraulic conductivity due to clay swelling causing water stagnation, additional plant-water stress and a reduction in plant transpiration. In case the produced water was mixed with surface water in a 1:3 ratio prior to irrigation, the calculated soil SAR values were much lower and generally acceptable for sandy to sandy-loam soil. The use of reverse osmosis treated produced water" yielded an acceptable salinity profile not exceeding guide values for SAR and EC; the plant water stress was limited as there was no additional salinity stress associated with the low level of salts. Results further illustrated that accounting for coupled geochemical, hydrological and plant water uptake processes resulted in more accurate water balance calculations compared to an approach where such interactions were not implemented. Coupling unsaturated flow modelling with major ion chemistry solute transport using HYDRUS provides quantitative evidence to determine suitable water quality requirements for sustainable irrigation using coal seam gas produced water.

Numerical analysis and experimental investigations on immunomagnetic capture and isolation of waterborne pathogens with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in microfluidic channel are performed. A finite-element COMSOL-based model is established to demonstrate the novel method of on-chip capturing pathogens using MNPs together with periodic pulse magnetic field. Simulation results determine the optimum magnetic pole current and switching frequency for magnetic separation. With the magnetic isolation experiment platform built up, as a pathogen example of Escherichia coli O157:H7, the performance of the method is experimentally verified. Both numerical and experimental results are found to agree reasonably well.

HPLC-UV platform for trace analysis of three isomeric mononitrophenols in water with chitin based solid phase extraction	ANALYTICAL METHODS												A method is described for simultaneous determination of trace levels of three isomeric mononitrophenols (MNPs) in environmental water samples using chitin (cheap, effective, biocompatible, green and safe) based solid phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection. Various parameters were investigated and optimized for extraction and enrichment of three MNPs, and chitinMNP adsorption was investigated using SEM, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy. Validation tests of spiked water samples showed good linearities for all three MNPs (R-2-0.9990-0.9999) over a wide concentration range of 0.001-1 mu g mL(-1). Limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were measured at ng mL(-1) levels: 0.13 ng mL(-1) and 0.39 ng mL(-1) for 2-NP, 0.09 ng mL(-1) and 0.27 ng mL(-1) for 3-NP and 0.19 ng mL(-1) and 0.57 ng mL(-)1 for 4-NP. Inter-and intra-day precision tests showed variations of 1.67-1.80%, 1.06-1.56%, and 1.14-1.62% for 2-NP, 3-NP, and 4-NP, respectively. Average recoveries were in the range of 56.70-97.51%, with relative standard deviations below 15%. The developed method was then applied to analyze 8 real environmental water samples. Moreover, 4-NP was the most frequently detected MNP at concentration levels of 0.749-0.947 mg mL(-1), followed by 2NP. Furthermore, 3-NP was not detected in any studied real sample. The validated method is simple and economical, with adequate sensitivity for trace levels of three isomeric MNPs. This method could be adopted by water quality analysis laboratories and allows an easy expansion to other related nitrophenols (NP) in water matrices' analysis.																	1759-9660	1759-9679				JUL 28	2017	9	28					4143	4150		10.1039/c7ay01000a								WOS:000411465100004

Eutrophication will increase during the 21st century as a result of precipitation changes	SCIENCE												Eutrophication, or excessive nutrient enrichment, threatens water resources across the globe. We show that climate change-induced precipitation changes alone will substantially increase (19 +/- 14%) riverine total nitrogen loading within the continental United States by the end of the century for the "business-as-usual" scenario. The impacts, driven by projected increases in both total and extreme precipitation, will be especially strong for the Northeast and the corn belt of the United States. Offsetting this increase would require a 33 +/- 24% reduction in nitrogen inputs, representing a massive management challenge. Globally, changes in precipitation are especially likely to also exacerbate eutrophication in India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is therefore imperative that water quality management strategies account for the impact of projected future changes in precipitation on nitrogen loading.																	0036-8075	1095-9203				JUL 28	2017	357	6349					405	408		10.1126/science.aan2409								WOS:000406362300046	28751610

A Vision for Incorporating Environmental Effects into Nitrogen Management Decision Support Tools for US Maize Production	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Meeting crop nitrogen (N) demand while minimizing N losses to the environment has proven difficult despite significant field research and modeling efforts. To improve N management, several real-time N management tools have been developed with a primary focus on enhancing crop production. However, no coordinated effort exists to simultaneously address sustainability concerns related to N losses at field- and regional-scales. In this perspective, we highlight the opportunity for incorporating environmental effects into N management decision support tools for United States maize production systems by integrating publicly available crop models with grower-entered management information and gridded soil and climate data in a geospatial framework specifically designed to quantify environmental and crop production tradeoffs. To facilitate advances in this area, we assess the capability of existing crop models to provide in-season N recommendations while estimating N leaching and nitrous oxide emissions, discuss several considerations for initial framework development, and highlight important challenges related to improving the accuracy of crop model predictions. Such a framework would benefit the development of regional sustainable intensification strategies by enabling the identification of N loss hotspots which could be used to implement spatially explicit mitigation efforts in relation to current environmental quality goals and real-time weather conditions. Nevertheless, we argue that this long-term vision can only be realized by leveraging a variety of existing research efforts to overcome challenges related to improving model structure, accessing field data to enhance model performance, and addressing the numerous social difficulties in delivery and adoption of such tool by stakeholders.																	1664-462X					JUL 28	2017	8								1270	10.3389/fpls.2017.01270								WOS:000406626500001	28804490					
J	Monteiro, S; Santos, R				Monteiro, Silvia; Santos, Ricardo			Nanofluidic digital PCR for the quantification of Norovirus for water quality assessment	PLOS ONE												Sensitive detection of water- and foodborne enteric viruses is extremely relevant, especially due to the low concentrations in which they are found. Accurate and sensitive detection of Norovirus, the primary responsible for water-and foodborne outbreaks, is of particular importance. Quantification of Norovirus is commonly performed by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). In recent years a new platform was developed, digital PCR, that quantifies without the need for a standard curve thus decreasing the errors associated with its utilization. The platform developed by LifeTechnologies, QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR is amongst the least studied digital platform and although it allows the direct detection of DNA targets it requires a two-step RT-PCR for the detection of RNA targets. In this work we developed a new protocol able to detect Norovirus using a one-step digital PCR reaction (RT-dPCR). The performance of the newly developed one-step digital PCR was compared to RT-qPCR for the detection of Norovirus genogroup I and genogroup II. The sensitivity of RT-dPCR was identical to that of RT-qPCR, and the quantitative data determined by both methods were not significantly different for most samples. This one-step absolute quantification approach is a useful tool to minimize the time spent currently using this particular platform to amplify viral RNA and to standardize quantification of enteric viruses in food and environmental samples. This study proved the usefulness of the newly developed RT-dPCR protocol for a sensitive and accurate detection of low-copy targets.																	1932-6203					JUL 27	2017	12	7							e0179985	10.1371/journal.pone.0179985								WOS:000406575700007	28749991

Higher counts were observed in treatment 4, followed by treatments 3, 2 and 1 showing significant differences with higher counts in the surface waters. The species diversity indices were more in the third and fourth treatments with higher diversity at the surface levels. The dominance of Bacillariophyceae in the surface waters was distinct (45.9-60.6%) attributing to the higher nutrient availability on mineralization of the easily decomposable substrate. Water quality parameters in all the four treatments were in the normal ranges. The representations of both Bacillariophyceae and Chlorophyceae were similar in the subsurface waters (36.6-50.8% and 28.2-36.4%). There was increase in the percentage composition of protozoans in the surface waters in the slurryapplied ponds (0.6-3.3%). Variations in rotifers were moderate, the respective representation ranges being 0.9-3.4%, 2.2-5.3% in the two levels and cladocerans in subsurface waters were higher with means of 10.7, 4.3, 4.9 and 4.7. Copepods were the dominant group in the animal assemblages at the surface level with the means of 3.0%, 2.3%, 4.0% and 5.0%. The variations in the different groups presented a vertical distribution pattern in the colonization of the periphytic communities.																	0990-7440	1765-2952				JUL 27	2017	30								25	10.1051/alr/2017026								WOS:000406774700001

Accordingly, the levels of N-NH3, Cl-, N-NO3-, SO42-, Mg, and Ca in water were not exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guideline values for humans and the levels of N-NO3-, SO42-, and Ca were also far below the Canadian Ministers of Health (CMH) guideline values for livestock. The levels of Al, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Mo were above the WHO guideline values, while majority of the trace metals were not exceeding the maximum permissible value for livestock except for Ni and Co. Among the trace metals found in the soil, Mn and Pb were found to be higher compared to the recommended value (40mg/kg) by the Ethiopian guideline. The drinking water quality index (DWQI) was calculated to be 67.6 based on 21 important quality parameters.																	2331-2009					JUL 27	2017	3								1354800	10.1080/23312009.2017.1354800								WOS:000406470500001

Thyroid function of steatitis-affected Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus from a sub-tropical African reservoir	DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS												Thyroid function and nutritional indicators were measured in obese, steatitis-affected Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus from Loskop Reservoir (LR), South Africa. Plasma thyroid hormones (especially T3) and thyroid follicle histomorphology revealed high levels of activity in every aspect of the thyroid cascade measured in fish from LR compared to a reference population of steatitis-free fish. Concurrent measurements of nutritional state including plasma lipids, liver lipid content and hepatocyte size showed that fish from LR had significant energy stores indicative of abundant nutritional intake. There were distinct sex and seasonal differences, with the highest plasma lipids and T3 levels observed in steatitis-affected females during spring and summer. Positive correlations were observed between plasma lipids (especially cholesterol) and T3 concentrations in fish from both populations, indicating a link between lipid metabolism and thyroid function. There was no direct evidence of thyroid disruption, but this cannot be ruled out until further research determines the factors that underlie the homeostatic shift leading to elevated plasma and liver lipids and T3 levels in steatitis-affected tilapia.

Thus, the water quality of the second and subsequent reservoirs usually changes. Based on a zero-dimensional model, this work describes the mass balances of 23 limnological variables in a system of 6 cascade reservoirs located in a well-preserved hydrographic basin (within the Brazilian Tropical Atlantic Forest). Ecosystem services are also mentioned to stress the importance of this system to improve the water quality of the Juquia-Guacu River. Samples were taken from the reservoirsi inputs, in the lacustrine region, and in the Juquia-Guacu River downstream of each reservoir. According to the zero-dimensional model (continuous stirred tank reactor), it can be concluded that: i) the retention intensities of the,elements varied within each reservoir itself and among the reservoirs. These differences occur because chemical and biotic processes concerning retentions are different, and the specific physical conditions (e.g. water velocity, flow, stratification) related to the retentions of each element are different; ii) not all reservoirs presented high assimilation coefficients for all variables, the six reservoirs were very efficient in terms of retaining the elements; iii) the system reduced the amounts of 87% of the variables; iv) for variables related to erosion and runoff the cascade of reservoirs was not able to decrease the values; v) the The high percentage of retention of the limnological variables enables us to evaluate the importance of these reservoirs to reduce eutrophication (nitrogen and phosphorus compounds), turbidity, TS, color, coliforms (total and fecal) from the Juquia-Guacu River.

J	Whitworth, KW; Marshall, AK; Symanski, E				Whitworth, Kristina W.; Marshall, Amanda K.; Symanski, Elaine			Maternal residential proximity to unconventional gas development and perinatal outcomes among a diverse urban population in Texas	PLOS ONE												Objective To assess associations between unconventional natural gas development (UGD) and perinatal outcomes. Methods We conducted a retrospective birth cohort study among 158,894 women with a birth or fetal death from November 30, 2010-November 29, 2012 in the Barnett Shale, in North Texas. We constructed three UGD-activity metrics by calculating the inverse distance-weighted sum of active wells within three separate geographic buffers surrounding the maternal residence: <=(1/2), 2, or 10-miles. We excluded women if the nearest well to her residence was >20 miles. Metrics were categorized by tertiles among women with >= 1 well within the respective buffer; women with zero wells <= 10 miles (the largest buffer) served as a common referent group. We used logistic or linear regression with generalized estimating equations to assess associations between UGD-activity and preterm birth, small-for-gestational age (SGA), fetal death, or birthweight. Adjusted models of fetal death and birthweight included: maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, smoking, adequacy of prenatal care, previous poor pregnancy outcome, and infant sex. Preterm birth models included all of the above except parity; SGA models included all of the above except previous poor pregnancy outcome. Results We found increased adjusted odds of preterm birth associated with UGD-activity in the highest tertiles of the (1/2)-(odds ratio (OR) = 1.14; 95% confidence interval 1.03, 1.25), 2-(1.14; 1.07, 1.22), and 10-mile (1.15; 1.08, 1.22) metrics. Increased adjusted odds of fetal death were found in the second tertile of the 2- mile metric (1.56; 1.16, 2.11) and the highest tertile of the 10- mile metric (1.34; 1.04-1.72). We found little indication of an association with SGA or term birthweight. Conclusions Our results are suggestive of an association between maternal residential proximity to UGD-activity and preterm birth and fetal death. Quantifying chemical and non-chemical stressors among residents near UGD should be prioritized.					whitworth, kristina/0000-0003-2334-6066												1932-6203					JUL 21	2017	12	7							e0180966	10.1371/journal.pone.0180966								WOS:000406643100018	28732016

Integration of energy audits in the Life Cycle Assessment methodology to improve the environmental performance assessment of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												In Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), water is continuously treated and recirculated as opposed to being discharged untreated into the environment as in other type of fish production systems; the design and production parameters will determine the overall energy consumption. This energy-intensive nature hampers their sustainability and cost-effectiveness. This paper proposes a combination of two methods (i.e. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with energy audits) to: improve environmental performance of RAS, identify energy consumption and thus, its environmental and monetary effects in order to seek cost reduction. The proposed methodology was proved with a case study focused in a pilot-scale RAS unit used in codfish (Gadus morhua) production, located in the Basque coastal area (northern Spain). Feed and juvenile production transportation, oxygen transportation and energy consumed during the whole experiment were considered as inputs for the assessment. Energy consumption was measured both continuously by an energy meter embedded in the RAE unit as well as with a portable energy analyzer to measure each of the energy-consuming devices independently. Although the system required an average of 29.40 kWh/kg fish for successful system operation, the energy consumption varied by season presenting maximum and minimum periods of 40.57 and 18.43 kWh/kg fish, respectively. Main consumers included the heat pump, followed by the main and secondary pumps, respectively. Energy audit's results show the success in identifying the devices that consumed the largest amount of energy, and recorded data served to feed the Life Cycle Inventory and perform a more complete and precise LCA. Fossil fuel based on-farm electricity for the on-growing of fish was shown to be the most environmentally unfriendly input; it was the major impact producer in the assessed impact categories. It showed a temporal variability depending on the water temperature, which resulted to be the main factor linked to the energy use. This aided performing a precise assessment including system-specific scenarios. The combination of LCA and on-farm energy audit represents a useful tool to secure a more complete assessment with a periodic assessment to design a less energy intensive, profitable and sustainable system; likewise, it increases the speed and transparency of governance and decision-making, taking into account the time-based fluctuation of the energy consumption throughout the production cycle.

DGM was measured together with other mercury species (RHg - reactive Hg, THg - total Hg, MeHg - monomethyl Hg and DMeHg - dimethylmercury), and with water quality parameters in coastal and open sea deep water profiles. DGM represents a considerable portion of THg (on average 20%) in Mediterranean waters. Spatial and seasonal variations of measured DGM concentrations were observed in different identified water masses. DGM was the highest in the northern Adriatic, the most polluted part of the Mediterranean Sea as a consequence of Hg mining in Idrija and heavy industry in northern Italy, and near the Gulf of Lion. Generally, average DGM concentration was higher in the West and East Mediterranean Deep Waters (WMDW and EMDW) and Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) than in overlaying Modified Atlantic Water (MAW); however, it was the highest in N Adriatic Surface waters (NAdSW) and consequently in outflowing Adriatic Deep Waters (AdDW). In deep water profiles the portion of DGM typically increased at depths with oxygen minimum and then towards the bottom, especially in areas with strong tectonic activity (Alboran Sea, Strait of Sicily, Tyrrhenian Sea), indicating its bacterial and/or geotectonic origin. During oceanographic cruises in 2011 and 2015 in the Tyrrhenian Sea, novel methods for continuous DGM determination in surface waters (Wangberg and Gardfeldt, 2011, Begu et al., 2016) were applied and compared to the standard method, and showed good agreement.

Warming effects on the urban hydrology in cold climate regions	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												While approximately 338 million people in the Northern hemisphere live in regions that are regularly snow covered in winter, there is little hydro-climatologic knowledge in the cities impacted by snow. Using observations and modelling we have evaluated the energy and water exchanges of four cities that are exposed to wintertime snow. We show that the presence of snow critically changes the impact that city design has on the local-scale hydrology and climate. After snow melt, the cities return to being strongly controlled by the proportion of built and vegetated surfaces. However in winter, the presence of snow masks the influence of the built and vegetated fractions. We show how inter-year variability of wintertime temperature can modify this effect of snow. With increasing temperatures, these cities could be pushed towards very different partitioning between runoff and evapotranspiration. We derive the dependency of wintertime runoff on this warming effect in combination with the effect of urban densification.

Data suggested FIB exceedances could be traced to gulls based on gull marker prevalence and correlations with FIB concentrations in seawater, sand, and eelgrass. In contrast, human marker concentrations and a tracer dye test did not indicate prevalent human sources. Exponential decay of gull marker in sand amended with live Catellicoccus marimammalium suggested that measured marker reflected fecal inputs versus growth outside the host. Improved water quality was coincident with a 2013 bird exclusion structure, consistent with NSE. However, load allocation needed for TMDL reconsideration was hampered by variable ratios of FIB, MST markers, and pathogens measured in seawater and in gull, cat, and raccoon feces Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment is a suggested path forward because such models can incorporate distributions from a combination of FIB sources and communicate criteria in terns of human health risk.

Wind and rainfall regulation of the diffuse attenuation coefficient in large, shallow lakes from long-term MODIS observations using a semianalytical model	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Knowledge of the variation and regulation of the diffuse attenuation coefficient is important for management of lake water quality and ecological environments. Data were collected seven times (378 samples) from 2006 to 2011 in Lake Taihu to improve the existing semianalytical model of diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) by measuring in situ K-d(490) and remote sensing reflectance (Rrs). This semianalytical model was applied to determine the long-term variation of K-d(490) and its driving factors from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Our semianalytical model of K-d(490) improves the retrieval accuracy of K-d(490) from 29.60% to 22.58% (root-mean-square percentage error) and 24.28 +/- 18.54% (mean value +/- standard deviation) to 19.29 +/- 14.34% (mean absolute relative error). The K-d (490) from maps produced from MODIS images clearly present the temporal and spatial variations of K-d(490). This indicates the suitability of using the improved semianalytical model and MODIS to observe K-d(490) in turbid shallow inland waters. Long-term MODIS observation of K-d(490) shows distinct seasonal and spatial variations. Temporally, the highest and the lowest K-d(490) were found in winter and in summer, respectively. Spatially, high K-d(490) values were primarily distributed in the southwestern and northwestern Lake Taihu, and relatively low K-d(490) values were distributed in Meiliang Bay and Gonghu Bay (the eastern part of the lake and East Bay were excluded in this study due to invalid retrieval results of K-d(490)). Many covarying points were found between K-d(490) and maximum wind speed from long-term observations, suggesting that wind-induced sediment resuspension is the principal driver of high K-d(490). Correlation was also observed between K-d(490) and heavy rainfall events, suggesting the regulating effect of heavy rainfall.				huang, changchun/R-5236-2016	huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663												2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 16	2017	122	13					6748	6763		10.1002/2017JD026955								WOS:000407900300004

Life and death of a sewage treatment plant recorded in a coral skeleton delta N-15 record	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We investigated the potential of coral skeleton delta N-15 (CS-delta N-15) records for tracking anthropogenic-N sources in coral reef ecosystems. We produced a 56 yr-long CS-delta N-15 record (1958-2014) from a reef flat in Guam that has been exposed to varying 1) levels of sewage treatment 2) population density, and 3) land use. Increasing population density (from < 30 to 300 ind.km(-2)) and land use changes in the watershed resulted in a similar to 1 parts per thousand enrichment of the CS-delta N-15 record until a sewage treatment plant (STP) started operation in 1975. Then, CS-delta N-15 stabilized, despite continued population density and land use changes. Based on population and other considerations, a continued increase in the sewage footprint might have been expected over this time. The stability of CS-delta N-15, either contradicts this expectation, or indicates that the impacts on the outer reef at the coring site were buffered by the mixing of reef water with the open ocean.

The oil spills are recovered from various water areas of Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah (East Malaysia). The study approach used six sigma methodologies that effectively serve as the problem solving in oil classification extracted from the complex mixtures of oil spilled dataset. The analysis of six sigma link with the quality engineering improved the organizational performance to achieve its objectivity of the environmental forensics. The study reveals that oil spills are discriminated into four groups' viz. diesel, hydrocarbon fuel oil (HFO), mixture oil lubricant and fuel oil (MOLFO) and waste oil (WO) according to the similarity of the intrinsic chemical properties. Through the validation, it confirmed that four discriminant component, diesel, hydrocarbon fuel oil (HFO), mixture oil lubricant and fuel oil (MOLFO) and waste oil (WO) dominate the oil types with a total variance of 99.51% with ANOVA giving F-stat > F-critical at 95% confidence level and a Chi Square goodness test of 74.87. Results obtained from this study reveals that by employing six-sigma approach in a data-driven problem such as in the case of oil spill classification, good decision making can be expedited.

However, in Europe, only the microbiological parameters are to be accomplished. Recent research has focused on chemical indicators that can determine human fecal contaminants in water. Therefore, the suitability of caffeine as a chemical marker of seawater pollution in the north Portuguese coastal area in the Atlantic Ocean during the bathing season was assessed in this study. The quality of water from the coasts of five cities was monitored. 101 seawater samples were collected from 14 beaches, and their water quality was classified as sufficient, good, and excellent. Caffeine was detected in all samples in concentration range of 18 to 525 ng/L. The highest average concentration of caffeine was found in seawater samples collected in July from beaches classified as having sufficient water quality, which were located in cities with high population density and high tourist affluence.

Effects of environmental and water quality parameters on the functioning of copepod assemblages in tropical estuaries	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												We examined changes in the functioning of copepod assemblages with increasing pollution in estuaries, using sampling standardization of the salinity range to enable comparisons. Copepod assemblages were analyzed in four southeast Brazilian estuaries with different water quality levels and hydrodynamic characteristics over two years. We obtained mesozooplankton samples together with environmental and water quality parameters in the estuaries, every two months under predetermined salinities ranging from 15 to 25. The values of parameters, except species size, associated with the functioning of the copepod assemblages (biomass, productivity, and turnover rate) did not differ among estuaries. However, in the more polluted estuaries, the biomass and productivity of copepod assemblages of mesozooplankton were negatively correlated with concentration of pollution indicator parameters. Conversely, in the less polluted estuaries some degree of enrichment still seems to increase the system biomass and productivity, as these parameters were inversely related to indicators of improved water quality. The pollution level of estuaries distorted the relationship between temperature and the efficiency of converting energy to organic matter. In the less polluted estuaries, the relationship between turnover rate and temperature was over 70%, while in the most polluted estuaries, this relationship was only approximately 50%. Our results demonstrated that the functioning of assemblages in the estuaries was affected differently by increasing pollution depending on the water quality level of the system. Thus, investigating the functioning of assemblages can be a useful tool for the analysis of estuarine conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Confounded by forgotten legacies: Effectively managing watersheds in the contemporary age of unknown unknowns	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Contemporary watershed management practices can reflect oversimplifications of relationships between anthropogenic pressures and resource degradation. Remediation and restoration efforts often focus on recent land use practices as the primary driver of hydrologic regime changes. We present a case study that serves as an example to the scientific and watershed management communities of the lasting influences of historic land use practices and natural physical processes on a stream in the central United States listed as impaired by the federal government. Abnormal spatiotemporal streamflow relationships, determined by means of an experimental watershed study, alerted the authors to possible sink/source behavior in the upper-watershed. Subsequent research uncovered archival evidence of coal mining, which may provide at least partial explanation. Additional investigation identified hydrologic processes associated with natural landscape evolution, noted by early-20th-century researchers, which are considered in the context of the current water quality and flow regime. Despite best-intended management practices, regulatory agencies, scientists, and local decision makers have not accounted for such practices and processes, instead relying on recent development as the proximate cause of designated impairment. We present argumentation that historic land use (coal mining) and landscape processes comprise cumulative yet unconsidered legacy effects that contribute systemically to the observed hydrologic regime of the watershed. Results hold important implications for contemporary watershed management, and support rethinking the case-by-case appropriateness of federal and state water impairment listings, and the achievability of restoration efforts in many developing watersheds.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				JUL 15	2017	31	15					2802	2808		10.1002/hyp.11223								WOS:000405522600011

Legal ecotones: A comparative analysis of riparian policy protection in the Oregon Coast Range, USA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Waterways of the USA are protected under the public trust doctrine, placing responsibility on the state to safeguard public resources for the benefit of current and future generations. This responsibility has led to the development of management standards for lands adjacent to streams. In the state of Oregon, policy protection for riparian areas varies by ownership (e.g., federal, state, or private), land use (e.g., forest, agriculture, rural residential, or urban) and stream attributes, creating varying standards for riparian land-management practices along the stream corridor. Here, we compare state and federal riparian land management standards in four major policies that apply to private and public lands in the Oregon Coast Range. We use a standard template to categorize elements of policy protection: (1) the regulatory approach, (2) policy goals, (3) stream attributes, and (4) management standards. All four policies have similar goals for achieving water-quality standards, but differ in their regulatory approach. Plans for agricultural lands rely on outcome-based standards to treat pollution, in contrast with the prescriptive policy approaches for federal, state, and private forest lands, which set specific standards with the intent of preventing pollution. Policies also differ regarding the stream attributes considered when specifying management standards. Across all policies, 25 categories of unique standards are identified. Buffer widths vary from 0 to similar to 152 m, with no buffer requirements for streams in agricultural areas or small, non-fish-bearing, seasonal streams on private forest land; narrow buffer requirements for small, non fish-bearing perennial streams on private forest land (3 m); and the widest buffer requirements for fish-bearing streams on federal land (two site-potential tree-heights, up to an estimated 152 m). Results provide insight into how ecosystem concerns are addressed by variable policy approaches in multi ownership landscapes, an important consideration to recovery-planning efforts for threatened species.

In Quebec, rural residents played an important role in the setting of stricter environmental regulations. Unlike most stated choice experiments about the valuation of improvements in water quality, this study explicitly accounts for risk in the design and analysis of choice experiments. Risk in phosphorus and coliform reductions is introduced through a three-point uniform distribution in the choice sets. The results show greater support for constant absolute risk aversion preferences than for constant relative risk aversion. Rural residents value coliform and phosphorus reductions and the more educated ones are particularly willing to see the government tax farmers and taxpayers to secure such reductions. As the science improves and risk in water quality outcomes decrease and as the political weight of non-farm rural residents increase, it should be easier for governments to replace voluntary cost-share programs by polluter-payer programs.

A Structural Equation Modeling approach to water quality perceptions	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Researches on water quality perceptions have used various techniques and models to explain relationships between specific variables. Surprisingly, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) has received little attention in water quality perceptions studies, and reporting has been inconsistent among existing studies. One objective of this article is to provide readers with a methodological example for conducting and reporting SEM. Another objective is to build a model that explains the different relationships among the diverse factors highlighted by previous studies on water quality perceptions. Our study focuses on the factors influencing people's perceptions of water quality in the Appalachian region. As such, researchers have conducted a survey in a mid-sized city in northcentral West Virginia to assess residents' perceptions of water quality for drinking and recreational purposes. Specifically, we aimed to understand the relationships between perceived water quality, health risk perceptions, organoleptic perceptions, environmental concern, area satisfaction and perceptions of surface water quality. Our model provided a good fit that explained about 50% of the variance in health risk perceptions and 43% of the variance in organoleptic perceptions. Environmental concern, area satisfaction and perceived surface water quality are important factors in explaining these variances. Perceived water quality was dismissed in our analysis due to multicollinearity. Our study demonstrates that risk communication needs to be better addressed by local decision-makers and water managers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Denitrification potential in the subsurface environment in the Manawatu River catchment, New Zealand: Indications from oxidation-reduction conditions, hydrogeological factors, and implications for nutrient management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A sound understanding of the effects of hydrogeological factors on loss, transport and transformation of farm nutrients is essential for predicting their impacts on ecosystem health of receiving waters. We assessed the potential of groundwater to attenuate nitrate through denitrification, and the distribution of this potential across the Tararua Groundwater Management Zone (GWMZ) in the Manawatu River catchment, New Zealand. We combined a number of methods in an unprecedented manner to confirm findings and obtain supporting evidence for the features that determine the subsurface denitrification characteristics. Our results showed that the denitrification characteristics of groundwater varied considerably in the Tararua GWMZ. The southern part of the Tararua GWMZ contained mainly oxic groundwater with low potential to denitrify, whereas the middle and northern parts of the Tararua GWMZ contained reduced groundwater with high denitrification potential. The hydrogeological features that influence denitrification potential in groundwater were identified as soil texture and drainage class, and the aquifer material or rock type. Low dissolved oxygen levels and nitrate concentrations were found in groundwater where the combinations of soil and rock types had poor drainage characteristics as opposed to higher concentrations in groundwater under well -drained soils and rocks (e.g. gravels). Intensive pastoral farming over well -drained soils and rocks showed high nitrate concentration in groundwater. This spatial variability in denitrification potential of groundwater offers a targeted management of nutrients runoff and leaching from pastoral lands to reduce their impacts on receiving surface waters.

Dissolved oxygen, stream temperature, and fish habitat response to environmental water purchases	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Environmental water purchases are increasingly used for ecological protection. In Nevada's Walker Basin (western USA), environmental water purchases augment streamflow in the Walker River and increase lake elevation of terminal Walker Lake. However, water quality impairments like elevated stream temperatures and low dissolved oxygen concentrations also limit ecosystems and species, including federally-threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout. In this paper, we prioritize water volumes and locations that most enhance water quality for riverine habitat from potential environmental water rights purchases. We monitored and modeled streamflows, stream temperatures, and dissolved oxygen concentrations using River Modeling System, an hourly, physically-based hydrodynamic and water quality model. Modeled environmental water purchases ranged from average daily increases of 0.11-1.41 cubic meters per second (m(3)/s) during 2014 and 2015, two critically dry years. Results suggest that water purchases consistently cooled maximum daily stream temperatures and warmed nightly minimum temperatures. This prevented extremely low dissolved oxygen concentrations below 5.0 mg/L, but increased the duration of moderate conditions between 5.5 and 6.0 mg/L. Small water purchases less than approximately 0.71 m(3)/s per day had little benefit for Walker River habitat. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were affected by upstream environmental conditions, where suitable upstream water quality improved downstream conditions and vice versa. Overall, this study showed that critically dry water years degrade environmental water quality and habitat, but environmental water purchases of at least 0.71 m(3)/s were promising for river restoration.

Plans to meet water needs are faced by uprising challenges to improve water quality and to ensure the sustainability of hydro-projects. Environmental isotopes coupled to water physicochemical characteristics were investigated over a biennial cycle to assess both geomorphological and environmental impacts on the water quality of a reservoir situated in an intensively used agricultural watershed under a Mediterranean semi-arid climate. The particularity of the semi-arid climate and the diverse topography generate a continental and orographic rain effect on the isotopic composition of precipitation and the water recharged sources. The studied reservoir responds quickly to land-use activities and climatic changes as reflected by temporal and spatial variations of water chemistry and isotopic composition. Increasing changes in precipitation rate and dry periods significantly modified the water isotopic composition in the reservoir. During the first year, hydrogen (delta D) and oxygen (delta O-18) isotopes are depleted by 6 and 2%(0) between dry and wet season, respectively. While a shift of -2%(0) for delta D and -1%(0) for delta O-18 was detected during the second annual cycle. Environmental isotopic compositions demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of groundwater inflow to the central (Cz) and dam (Dz) zones of the Qaraaoun reservoir. The Cz and Dz can be considered as open water bodies subjected to dilution by groundwater inflow, which induces vertical mixing and reverse isotopic stratification of the water column. In the contrary, the river mouth zone acts as a closed system without groundwater intrusion, where heavy water accumulates and may act as a sink for contaminants during dry season. Groundwater influx acts as a dilution factor that renews the hypolimnion, and minimizes the perturbations induced by both internal biogeochemical reactions and external hydrological variations. Attention should be devoted to the hydrogeological location of planned reservoirs, which should take into account the vicinity of shallow water table to insure good water quality and water sustainability.

Evaluating the impact of ambient benzene vapor concentrations on product water from Condensation Water From Air technology	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Globally, drinking water resources are diminishing in both quantity and quality. This situation has renewed interest in Condensation Water From Air (CWFA) technology, which utilizes water vapor in the air to produce water for both potable and non-potable purposes. However, there are currently insufficient data available to determine the relationship between air contaminants and the rate at which they are transferred from the air into CWFA untreated product water. This study implemented a novel experimental method utilizing an environmental test chamber to evaluate how air quality and temperature affects CWFA untreated product water quality in order to collect data that will inform the type of water treatment required to protect human health. This study found that temperature and benzene air concentration affected the untreated product water from a CWFA system. Benzene vapor concentrations representing a polluted outdoor environment resulted in benzene product water concentrations between 15% and 23% of the USEPA drinking water limit of 5 mu g/l. In contrast, product water benzene concentrations representing an indoor industrial environment were between 1.4 and 2.4 times higher than the drinking water limit. Lower condenser coil temperatures were correlated with an increased concentration of benzene in the product water. Environmental health professionals and engineers can integrate the results of this assessment to predict benzene concentrations in the product water and take appropriate health protective measures.

J	Nazeer, M; Wong, MS; Nichol, JE				Nazeer, Majid; Wong, Man Sing; Nichol, Janet Elizabeth			A new approach for the estimation of phytoplankton cell counts associated with algal blooms	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study proposes a method for estimating phytoplankton cell counts associated with an algal bloom, using satellite images coincident with in situ and meteorological parameters. Satellite images from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Operational Land Imager (OLD and Hj-1 A/B Charge Couple Device (CCD) sensors were integrated with the meteorological observations to provide an estimate of phytoplankton cell counts. All images were atmospherically corrected using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) atmospheric correction method with a possible error of 1.2%, 2.6%, 1.4% and 23% for blue (450-520 nm), green (520-600 nm), red (630-690 nm) and near infrared (NIR 760-900 nm) wavelengths, respectively. Results showed that the developed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model yields a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.95 with the in situ validation data with Sum of Squared Error (SSE) of 034 cell/ml, Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 0.154 cells/ml and a bias of -504.87. The integration of the meteorological parameters with remote sensing observations provided a promising estimation of the algal scum as compared to previous studies. The applicability of the ANN model was tested over Hong Kong as well as over Lake Kasumigaura, Japan and Lake Okeechobee, Florida USA, where algal blooms were also reported. Further, a 40-year (1975-2014) red tide occurrence map was developed and revealed that the eastern and southern waters of Hong Kong are more vulnerable to red tides. Over the 40 years, 66% of red tide incidents were associated with the Dinoflagellates group, while the remainder were associated with the Diatom group (14%) and several other minor groups (20%). The developed technology can be applied to other similar environments in an efficient and cost saving manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Goovaerts, P				Goovaerts, Pierre			Monitoring the aftermath of Flint drinking water contamination crisis: Another case of sampling bias?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The delay in reporting high levels of lead in Flint drinking water, following the city's switch to the Flint River as its water supply, was partially caused by the biased selection of sampling sites away from the lead pipe network. Since Flint returned to its pre-crisis source of drinking water, the State has been monitoring water lead levels (WLL) at selected "sentinel" sites. In a first phase that lasted two months, 739 residences were sampled, most of them bi-weekly, to determine the general health of the distribution system and to track temporal changes in lead levels. During the same period, water samples were also collected through a voluntary program whereby concerned citizens received free testing kits and conducted sampling on their own. State officials relied on the former data to demonstrate the steady improvement in water quality. A recent analysis of data collected by voluntary sampling revealed, however, an opposite trend with lead levels increasing over time. This paper looks at potential sampling bias to explain such differences. Although houses with higher WLL were more likely to be sampled repeatedly, voluntary sampling turned out to reproduce fairly well the main characteristics (i.e. presence of lead service lines (LSL), construction year) of Flint housing stock. State-controlled sampling was less representative; e.g., sentinel sites with LSL were mostly built between 1935 and 1950 in lower poverty areas, which might hamper our ability to disentangle the effects of LSL and premise plumbing (lead fixtures and pipes present within old houses) on WLL. Also, there was no sentinel site with LSL in two of the most impoverished wards, including where the percentage of children with elevated blood lead levels tripled following the switch in water supply. Correcting for sampling bias narrowed the gap between sampling programs, yet overall temporal trends are still opposite. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Quantification of catchment response under future changes is particularly crucial for better water resources management. This study assessed the combined effects of future climate and land use changes on water yield, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads of the Mediterranean Onkaparinga catchment in South Australia by means of the eco-hydrological model SWAT. Six different global climate models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and a hypothetical land use change were used for future simulations. The climate models suggested a high degree of uncertainty, varying seasonally, in both flow and nutrient loads: however, a decreasing trend was observed. Average monthly TN and TP load decreased up to -55% and -56% respectively and were found to be dependent on flow magnitude. The annual and seasonal water yield and nutrient loads may only slightly be affected by envisaged land uses, but significantly altered by intermediate and high emission scenarios, predominantly during the spring season. The combined scenarios indicated the possibility of declining flow in future but nutrient enrichment in summer months, originating mainly from the land use scenario, that may elevate the risk of algal blooms in downstream drinking water reservoir. Hence, careful planning of future water resources in a Mediterranean catchment requires the assessment of combined effects of multiple climate models and land use scenarios on both water quantity and quality.

Data and observations were made by trained citizen scientists and professional researchers. Our study shows that all monitored water bodies, with the exception of Qiandeng Lake and Fengjiang River, had elevated NO(3) over bar -N concentrations, which ranged from 0.10 to 6.83 mg/L and peaked in late winter and early spring and reached a minimum in summer and mid-autumn. Po43-P concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 025 mg/L and peaked during the winter, late-summer and late autumn. Turbidity values were highest at sites with agricultural activities, with maximums in the late winter and autumn, and the highest frequency (16% and 25%) of algae presence occurred in the spring and autumn. To better understand the characteristics and drivers of the algae occurrences, measurements of phytoplankton composition and physicochemical characteristics were conducted in three key seasons in the agricultural process, fallow, sowing and rainy season in 2016. Our focused study found that the occurrence of Bacillariophyta, Euglenophyta, Xanthophyta, Cryptophyta, Chrysophyta were positively correlated with dissolved oxygen and phosphorus concentrations, while Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta had positive correlations with turbidity, oxygen demand and nitrogen concentrations. Bacillariophyceae counted for the highest proportion of phytoplankton during the fallow season, comprising up to 60 +% of the phytoplankton among the sites. During the rainy season, Chlorophyceae species were the majority, comprising up to 90 +% of phytoplankton among the sampled sites. Our results pointed to the complexity of nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics in water bodies under multiple pressures, and to the value of using citizen scientists to determine contextual information to benefit more focused studies.

Therefore, a study on the occurrence patterns and spatiotemporal variability of 105 PPCPs in an Alpine river basin located in the Trentino-Alto Adige region (North-Eastern Italy) has been conducted. We observed that the total concentration of analyzed PPCPs was generally higher in all sampling sites during winter than in the summer. The analysis of tourist data revealed that during both sampling campaigns the number of tourists was lower in the downstream sites in comparison with the upstream area of the basin (Val di Sole). Particularly, sampling sites located near important tourist resorts have shown the highest abundance of the PPCPs during winter, being analgesics/anti-inflammatories, antihypertensives and antibiotics the most abundant pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs). Diclofenac showed the highest concentration amongst PhACs, reaching concentrations up to 675 ng L-' in the sampling site situated downstream of the Tonale wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Antihypertensives were found at concentrations >300 ng L-1, while antibiotics were quantified up to 196 ng L-1, respectively. Amongst personal care products (PCPs), the most abundant compound was octyl-dimethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (ODPABA) with concentrations reaching up to 748 ng L-1 in the sampling site situated within the Rotaliana district In general, concentrations and detection frequencies were higher in water than in the sediment samples. The most frequently detected PhACs in sediments from both sampling campaigns were antibiotics, while amongst PCPs in sediments, octocrylene (OC) showed the highest concentration in both sampling campaigns. As a result, this study highlights the potential impact of tourism on the water quality of the Alpine aquatic ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dynamic response of land use and river nutrient concentration to long-term climatic changes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The combined indirect and direct impacts of land use change and climate change on river water quality were assessed. A land use allocation model was used to evaluate the response of the catchment land use to long-term climatic changes. Its results were used to drive a water quality model and assess the impact of climatic alterations on freshwater nitrate and phosphorus concentrations. Climatic projections were employed to estimate the likelihood of such response. The River Thames catchment (UK) was used as a case-study. If land use is considered as static parameter, according to the model results, climate change alone should reduce the average nitrate concentration, although just by a small amount, by the 2050s in the Lower Thames, due to reduced runoff (and lower export of nitrate from agricultural soils) and increased instream denitrification, and should increase the average phosphorus concentration by 12% by the 2050s in the Lower Thames, due to a reduction of the effluent dilution capacity of the river flow. However, the results of this study also show that these long-term climatic alterations are likely to lead to a reduction in the arable land in the Thames, replaced by improved grassland, due to a decrease in agriculture profitability in the UK. Taking into account the dynamic co-evolution of land use with climate, the average nitrate concentration is expected to be decreased by around 6% by the 2050s in both the upper and the lower Thames, following the model results, and the average phosphorus concentration increased by 13% in the upper Thames and 5% in the lower Thames.

A discussion about public health, lead and Legionella pneumophila in drinking water supplies in the United States	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lead (Pb) in public drinking water supplies has garnered much attention since the outset of the Flint water crisis. Pb is a known hazard in multiple environmental matrices, exposure from which results in long-term deleterious health effects in humans. This discussion paper aims to provide a succinct account of environmental Pb exposures with a focus on water Pb levels (WLLs) in the United States. It is understood that there is a strong correlation between WLLs and blood Pb levels (BLLs), and the associated health effects. However, within the Flint water crisis, more than water chemistry and Pb exposure occurred. A cascade of regulatory and bureaucratic failures culminated in the Flint water crisis. This paper will discuss pertinent regulations and responses including their limitations after an overview of the public health effects from Pb exposure as well as discussion on our limitations on monitoring and mitigating Pb in tap water. As the Flint water crisis also included increased Legionnares' disease, caused by Legionella pneumophila, this paper will discuss factors influencing L. pneumophila growth. This will highlight the systemic nature of changes to water chemistry and public health impacts. As we critically analyze these important aspects of water research, we offer discussions to stimulate future water quality research from a new and systemic perspective to inform and guide public health decision-making.

The hybrid SBS was constructed with two barriers, a geochemical (filtration beds with limestone, coal and sawdust) and a biological barrier (wetlands with Glyceria, Acorus, Typha, Phragmites), operating in parallel. Significant differences were found between inflow and outflow from the SBS with regard to wastewater contaminant concentrations, the efficiency of removal being 16% (max. 93%) for Total Phosphorus (TP), 25% (max. 93%) for Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP), 15% (max. 97%) for Total Nitrogen (TN), 17% (max. 98%) for NO3-N, and 21% for PCB equivalency (PCB EQ). In the case of PCB EQ concentration, the highest efficiency of 43% was obtained using beds with macrophytes. The SBS removed a significant load of TP (0.415 kg), TN (3.136 kg), and PCB EQ (0.223 g) per square meter per year. The use of low-cost hybrid SBSs as a post-treatment step for wastewater treatment was found to be an effective ecohydrological biotechnology that may be used for reducing point source pollution and improving water quality.																	2045-2322					JUL 14	2017	7								5477	10.1038/s41598-017-05555-y								WOS:000405464200114	28710428

Effects of sediment smothering on the sponge holobiont with implications for dredging management	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												One of the ways dredging can affect benthic habitats is through high levels of sediment deposition, which has the potential to smother sessile organisms such as sponges. In order to provide pressure-response values to sedimentation and tease apart the different cause-effect pathways of high turbidity, 5 sponge species, including heterotrophic and phototrophic nutritional modes, were exposed for up to 30 d to multiple sediment deposition events, each of which resulted in an initial covering of 80-100% of the surface of the sponges in a layer similar to 0.5 mm thick. The response of the sponges was examined using a suite of different response variables including growth, respiration, lipid content, community composition of the microbial symbionts, and maximum quantum yield and chlorophyll content of the phototrophic symbionts. Different species showed different mechanisms of sediment rejection and different patterns of sediment clearance. All species survived the treatments, were able to tolerate high levels of partial covering of their surfaces, and for most species the treatment did not alter the health of the sponge holobiont. Results from this study will guide interpretation of experiments examining the combined effects of all three dredging-related pressures, and aid the development of water quality thresholds for impact prediction purposes.

Tropical estuaries are poorly studied compared to temperate systems and little is known about the microbial community-level response to nutrients. We aimed to examine the spatial and temporal patterns of the bacterial community and its association with abiotic factors. Since Darwin Harbour is macrotidal with strong seasonal patterns and mixing, we sought to determine if a human impact signal was discernible in the microbiota despite the strong hydrodynamic forces. Adopting a single impact-double reference design, we investigated the bacterial community using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene from water and sediment from reference creeks and creeks affected by effluent and urban runoff. Samples were collected over two years during neap and spring tides, in the dry and wet seasons. Temporal drivers, namely seasons and tides had the strongest relationship to the water microbiota, reflecting the macrotidal nature of the estuary and its location in the wet-dry tropics. The neap-tide water microbiota provided the clearest spatial resolution while the sediment microbiota reflected current and past water conditions. Differences in patterns of the microbiota between different parts of the harbor reflected the harbor's complex hydrodynamics and bathymetry. Despite these variations, a microbial signature was discernible relating to specific effluent sources and urban runoff, and the composite of nutrient levels accounted for the major part of the explained variation in the microbiota followed by salinity. Our results confirm an overall good water quality but they also reflect the extent of some hypereutrophic areas. Our results show that the microbiota is a sensitive indicator to assess ecosystem health even in this dynamic and complex ecosystem.																	1664-302X					JUL 13	2017	8								1313	10.3389/fmicb.2017.01313								WOS:000406155500002	28751882

GRAPLEr: A distributed collaborative environment for lake ecosystem modeling that integrates overlay networks, high-throughput computing, and WEB services	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE					29th Workshop of the Pacific Rim Applications and Grid Middleware Assembly (PRAGMA) / International Clouds for Data Science Workshop	OCT, 2015	Univ Indonesia, Depok, INDONESIA		Univ Indonesia			The GLEON Research And PRAGMA Lake Expedition-GRAPLE-is a collaborative effort between computer science and lake ecology researchers. It aims to improve our understanding and predictive capacity of the threats to the water quality of our freshwater resources, including climate change. This paper presents GRAPLEr, a distributed computing system used to address the modeling needs of GRAPLE researchers. GRAPLEr integrates and applies overlay virtual network, high-throughput computing, and WEB service technologies in a novel way. First, its user-level IP-over-P2P overlay network allows compute and storage resources distributed across independently administered institutions ( including private and public clouds) to be aggregated into a common virtual network, despite the presence of firewalls and network address translators. Second, resources aggregated by the IP-over-P2P virtual network run unmodified high-throughput-computing middleware to enable large numbers of model simulations to be executed concurrently across the distributed computing resources. Third, a WEB service interface allows end users to submit job requests to the system using client libraries that integrate with the R statistical computing environment. The paper presents the GRAPLEr architecture, describes its implementation and reports on its performance for batches of general lake model simulations across 3 cloud infrastructures ( University of Florida, CloudLab, and Microsoft Azure).																	1532-0626	1532-0634				JUL 10	2017	29	13			SI				e4139	10.1002/cpe.4139								WOS:000402836500012

Impact of domestic and industrial effluent discharge on the tank ecosystem in Pallipattu block, Tamil Nadu, India	CURRENT SCIENCE												The impact of untreated effluent from dye industries and domestic sewage that are discharged into the irrigation tank in Pandravedu village in South India was assessed through physico-chemical analysis of water samples and focus group discussion with the community. Thirty-six samples were collected from the study area across three seasons and analysed in the laboratory. The irrigation water quality indices computed indicated that the levels of sodium, salinity and hardness exceeded the permissible limits of irrigation standards. Consequently, rice yield had reduced by 40% in the region, thereby affecting the livelihood of the farmers. The colour of fishes in the tank also changed and their consumption contributed to health-related issues in the village.																	0011-3891					JUL 10	2017	113	1					94	102		10.18520/cs/v113/i01/94-102								WOS:000405623700029						
J	Nicol, S; Chades, I				Nicol, Sam; Chades, Iadine			A preliminary approach to quantifying the overall environmental risks posed by development projects during environmental impact assessment	PLOS ONE												Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is used globally to manage the impacts of development projects on the environment, so there is an imperative to demonstrate that it can effectively identify risky projects. However, despite the widespread use of quantitative predictive risk models in areas such as toxicology, ecosystem modelling and water quality, the use of predictive risk tools to assess the overall expected environmental impacts of major construction and development proposals is comparatively rare. A risk-based approach has many potential advantages, including improved prediction and attribution of cause and effect; sensitivity analysis; continual learning; and optimal resource allocation. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using a Bayesian belief network (BBN) to quantify the likelihood and consequence of non-compliance of new projects based on the occurrence probabilities of a set of expert-defined features. The BBN incorporates expert knowledge and continually improves its predictions based on new data as it is collected. We use simulation to explore the trade-off between the number of data points and the prediction accuracy of the BBN, and find that the BBN could predict risk with 90% accuracy using approximately 1000 data points. Although a further pilot test with real project data is required, our results suggest that a BBN is a promising method to monitor overall risks posed by development within an existing EIA process given a modest investment in data collection.

Tracing the causes of poor water quality back to land-use change is necessary to target catchment management for coastal zone management. However, existing models for tracing the sources of pollution require extensive data-sets which are not available for many of the world's coral reef regions that may have severe water quality issues. Here we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model that uses freely available satellite data to infer the connection between land-uses in catchments and water clarity in coastal oceans. We apply the model to estimate the influence of land-use change on water clarity in Fiji. We tested the model's predictions against underwater surveys, finding that predictions of poor water quality are consistent with observations of high siltation and low coverage of sediment-sensitive coral genera. The model thus provides a means to link land-use change to declines in coastal water quality.

J	Zhang, XL; Huang, M				Zhang, Xiaole; Huang, Meng			Ensemble-based release estimation for accidental river pollution with known source position	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Dispersion model is an important tool for decision makers to accurately assess risks and effectively plan countermeasures during river pollution accidents, but their applications suffer from significant modeling uncertainties, primarily due to the scarce information of the source. A fully sequential inverse estimation method is proposed to reconstruct the temporal release for accidental river pollution. The method is based on a one-dimensional advection-dispersion model in conjunction with the augmented ensemble Kalman filter method. Detailed analysis of the ensemble background error covariance (BEC) matrix is conducted to elucidate the "flow-dependent" mechanism, which enables the inversion method to simultaneously take into account the uncertainties in the hydrological parameters (mean flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient). The method is evaluated with six field tracer experiments with various mean flow velocities, ranging from 0.085 to 0.889 m s(-1), and also compared with the commonly used Tikhonov regularization inverse estimation method to demonstrate its performance improvement. The results indicate that it successfully reconstructs the temporal release and reduces the relative errors of the total release estimation by about 12.4% on average compared with the Tikhonov method, since the errors caused by the uncertainties in mean flow velocity and longitudinal dispersion coefficient are effectively alleviated.

J	Gerba, CP; Betancourt, WQ				Gerba, Charles P.; Betancourt, Walter Q.			Viral Aggregation: Impact on Virus Behavior in the Environment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Aggregates of viruses can have a significant impact on quantification' and behavior of viruses in the environment. Viral aggregates may be formed in numerous ways. Viruses may form crystallike structures and aggregates in the host cell during replication or may form due to changes in environmental conditions after virus particles are released from the host cells. Aggregates tend to form mear the isoelectric point of the virus, under the influence of certain salts and salt concentrations in solutiOn, cationic polymers, and suspended organic matter. The given conditions under which aggregates form in the environment are highly dependent on the type of virus, type of salts in solution (cation, anion, monovalent, divalent) and pH. However, virus typo greatly influences the conditions when aggregation/disaggregation will occur, making predictions difficult under any given set of water quality conditions. Most studies have shown that viral aggregates increase the survival of viruses in the environment and resistance to disinfectants, especially with more reactive disinfectants. The presence of viral aggregates may also result in overestimation of removal by filtration processes. Virus aggregation-disaggregation is a complex process and predicting the behavior of any individual virus is difficult under a given set of environmental circumstances without actual experiniental data.

Electrochemical Detection of Ultratrace (Picomolar) Levels of Hg2+ Using a Silver Nanoparticle-Modified Glassy Carbon Electrode	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Ultratrace levels of Hg2+ have been quantified by undertaking linear sweep voltammetry with a silver nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon electrode (AgNP-GCE) in aqueous solutions containing Hg2+. This is achieved by monitoring the change in the silver stripping peak with Hg2+ concentration resulting from the galvanic displacement of silver by mercury: Ag(np) + 1/2Hg(2+)(aq) -> Ag+(aq) + 1/2Hg(l). This facile and reproducible detection method exhibits an excellent linear dynamic range of 100.0 pM to 10.0 nM Hg2+ concentration with R-2 = 0.982. The limit of detection (LoD) based on 3 sigma is 28 pM Hg2+, while the lowest detectable level for quantification purposes is 100.0 pM. This method is appropriate for routine environmental monitoring and drinking water quality assessment since the guideline value set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for inorganic mercury in drinking water is 0.002 mg L-1 (10 nM).

This study aimed to identify the structure of plankton (diversity), to analyze the similarity and depletion potential due to cultivation practice. Research was done through sampling method in two different localitions of coastal waters, i.e., Pemalang (practicing in isolated pond dike) and in Brebes with no permanent dike condition. Data collection was done through sampling using plankton net taken at six stations. Data analysis used were species diversity index (H') and the evenness index (e) as well as Sorensen Index (SI). Data were also to be analyzed in term of feasibility aspects of cultivation using Saprobic index. Results showed that the planktonic structure of these two locations expressed with H' index is different, where in Pemalang it is about 1.91-1.46 range, whereas in Brebes it is about 2.0-2.39 range. These two ranges of H' indices values were categorized into low stabilities of the pond community. This situation was affected by cultivation practices, especially by the associated intensive system. The intensive cultivation has been successfully adopted in Pemalang by applying geo-membrane and chlorine for water treatment processes. The dominant species of the two locations aforementioned were Lyngbia sp and Surirella sp. Thallasiothrix sp was dominance only in Pemalang and it was replaced by Melosira sp in Brebes. Saprobic index showed that its value was 0.8-1.8 range, a moderate high category (beta-Mesosaprobic/oligosaprobic) up to aOligo/Beta mesosaprobic. In term of nutrient enrichment of the water, such water quality was classified as polluted waters in particularly as light to moderate polluted water due to organic and inorganic components.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				JUL	2017	23	7					6402	6405		10.1166/asl.2017.9636								WOS:000431480900083

Bangkong River is one of the rivers located in Minapolitan area of Menayu Village, Muntilan District. Bangkong River is the main source of water for aquaculture activities. Community structure of Macrobenthos is used to determinate water quality in Bangkong River. The research was conducted on April and June 2016 at four location, representing upstream, middle, downstream parts of the river, and fish pond. The result found 33 species consisting of 16 families and 7 classes. The most prevalent family at the four sampling sites is Thiaridae (Class: Gastropoda). Thiaridaeis one of family of macrobenthos that easily adapt to environmental conditions. Species that dominates on all four sampling sites were Melanoidestuberculata. The Values of Diversity index (H') ranged from 1,77 to 2.19. The similarity index value type (J') ranged from 0.92 to 0.97. Dominance index value (C) ranges from 0,90 to 0.98. The abiotic parameters of water quality in the Bangkong River in four sampling locations is considerably in normal range based on Indonesian goverment regulation number 82 year 2001 about water quality for aquaculture. The average carbon content ranging from 1.42 to 8.21% and the nitrogen content ranged from 0.15 to 0.65%. Based on the data obtained in four sediment sampling locations were is dominated by fine sand with fine sand highest value of 71% in the sampling location 1. In addition to fine sand, sediment composition also consists of coarse sand with a highest score of 31% in the locations 2.

Rehabilitation by hard structure in mangrove areas is usually done by using break water or groin. Used tire can be used as material because it is cheap and easy to applied, but unfortunately still contradictory in pollution potential. The objective of this study was to analyze the environmental quality of coastal area of Tapak mangrove based on the Zn distribution and biomagnification levels in the environment. The study was conducted in the mangrove area of Tapak which already build a break water from used tire in July 2016. The study was observational with the sampling taken from 4 stations and 7 objects, namely in water column, mud substrate, algae, fish, shrimp, oyster and mangrove root. Data analysis was performed by descriptive and statistical analysis to measure the content of Zn in these objects. Besides, it also carried out measurements of physico-chemical factors, i.e., temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity and pH. The results showed that the smallest Zn content was found in water column with values between 0.002 to 0.004 mg/lt. This is still lower than the national sea water quality standard of 0.1 mg/l. The greatest value was found in mud substrate of front estuary which reached 167,992 mg/kg. Biomagnification in biota of all objects, including the consumption (fish, shrimp and seaweed) were high over than 1000. The highest bioaccumulation occurred in mangrove plant followed by seaweed; whereas the smallest value was found in oysters. It is advisable to reduce the Zn content in the environment by using a soft rehabilitate mainly mangrove plants. It is also recommended to measure number of mangrove stand of mangrove which is appropriate to reduce such impact in pond water.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				JUL	2017	23	7					6472	6475		10.1166/asl.2017.9657								WOS:000431480900103

Eutrophication is the enrichment of aquatic ecosystem with nitrogen and phosphorous which induces uncontrolled aquatic plants, particularly water hyacinth (Euchornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms. As a result about 70% of Rawapening Lake was covered by water hyacinth. This research was conducted in order to evaluate the activities that had been done and to study the growth of water hyacinth with mesocosm in Rawapening Lake. As the smallest lake with huge typical problems of many others Indonesian lakes, the management of water hyacinth had decided as the first super priority program for Save Indonesian Lake, in Indonesia called Gerakan Penyelamatan Danau (Germadan) Rawapening. This was related to its functions for hydroelectricity power, agriculture, fisheries, source for drinking water, social and religious life, and tourism. Every years, there were activities to reduce water hyacinth in Rawapening, but its population still high even higher by times. When harvesting water hyacinth, one thing that do not under consideration is the growth rate of water hyacinth. Therefore, the program of reducing water hyacinth seems unsuccessful. The plastic mesocoms 1x1 m(2) was developed in 2 sites in Rawapening Lake, each site with 5 replication plots. Based on this research, within 6 days, the number of leaf was doubling. 1 plant of water hyacinth was covered 1 m(2) within 22 days. This growth rate have to be put into account when develop plan for harvesting water hyacinth.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				JUL	2017	23	7					6495	6497		10.1166/asl.2017.9664								WOS:000431480900110						
J	Kaur, S; Diwakar, SK; Das, AK				Kaur, Surinder; Diwakar, Sumant Kumar; Das, Ashok Kumar			Long term rainfall trend over meteorological sub divisions and districts of India	MAUSAM												In this paper the long term trend of annual and seasonal rainfall over different districts, Meteorological (Met.) sub-divisions and whole India have been studied using the long term rainfall data for the period from 1901 to 2013. The changes in amount and pattern of rainfall have a significant impact on agriculture, water resources management and overall economy of the country. Mann-Kendall test is applied to check the significance of the trend. Linear Regression and Theil-Sen's non parametric test has been applied to estimate the trend. The study is carried out for 632 districts and 34 sub divisions of India by utilizing the gridded rainfall data (0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees) over the main land except Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands. Many authors have studied that extreme events are increasing but there is no trend in Pan India's rainfall. It is observed from the annual rainfall analysis 10% of the number of districts are showing significant increasing trend and 13% significant decreasing (mainly in Uttar Pradesh) trend whereas irrespective of high and low rainfall regions, 10% area of the country is showing significant increasing trend and 8% of the area of the country showing significant decreasing trend in annual rainfall. In Meteorological Sub divisions, east & west UP are showing significant negative trend and some of the coastal sub divisions are showing positive trend. It is also observed that the country's rainfall is not showing any trend.																	0252-9416					JUL	2017	68	3					439	450										WOS:000430761600004

M.; Singh, Sharda			Extreme snowfall event analysis and its impacts on agriculture and horticultural crops in western Himalaya, India	MAUSAM												Glaciers and snow are the important features of hydrological cycle and affect volume, variability and water quality in areas where these occur. Snow supplies more than half of water used for irrigation in Himachal Pradesh and other northern states of India and is an important contributor to hydropower and irrigation reservoirs. The fact that snow acts as water storage over the winter and provides soil moisture recharge in the spring is of particular importance to agriculture productivity in mountainous regions. The study on snowfall estimation during 2004-05 in Himachal Pradesh was carried out using remote sensing techniques and ground truth data to estimate total snowfall and assess the impact of snow fall on water availability and crop productivity. The snowfall estimates using remote sensing techniques for two periods by using two sets of imageries before snow fall (October, 2004) and after snowfall (May 2005). This indicated an increase of 28.7 per cent in snow cover compared to pre snowfall period. The ground data from 22 sites also indicated an increase of more than 50 per cent higher amount of snowfall during 2004-05 compared to last two decades. The area under different crops during rabi 2004 was found to be increased by 8.57 per cent, whereas, subsequent kharif season registered 1.85 per cent reduction in cropped area. The increase also reflected in higher productivity during rabi season 2004 and kharif 2005. The productivity of total food grains increased by more than 19.0 per cent during 2004-05 compared to 2003-04. The apple and other fruits registered 12.1 and 59.8 per cent higher productivity, respectively in 2004-05 compared to 2002-03 and 2003-04. The impact of extreme snow fall was more pronounced in short duration vegetables crops. The total vegetables arrivals in the market increased by 48.33 per cent during 2004-05 compared to last three year arrivals. This indicated that there was a positive and significant effect of heavy snowfall on agricultural as well as horticultural crop productivity in the mountains and downstream of Himachal Pradesh.																	0252-9416					JUL	2017	68	3					543	550										WOS:000430761600014

Knowledge about the quality of surface or groundwater used to irrigate crops in that region is low. This paper aims to contribute to the knowledge of the quality of groundwater for agricultural use through the characterization of the spatial variability. Assuming a random spatial distribution of 45 samples which were collected in situ were determined: acidity and alkalinity (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), cations and anions and trace elements; in addition to the agricultural index: Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC), Soluble Sodium Percentage (SSP), Sodium Percentage (% Na), Kelly Ratio (KR), Magnesium Adsorption Ratio (MAR), Permeability Index (PI), Effective Salinity (ES), Salinity Potential (SP) and Osmotic Potential (OP). In general, SSP, % Na, KR, PI are low, there is only one anomalous point (9) with high values at W of the study area. Similarly, PS, ES, Cl, Na and SAR are low except point 16 and conversely, RSC and pH are high, except at this point located in the center of the study area. The results allow us to infer that the water in that aquifer presents no problems or sodicity toxic ions. In 27 sites sampled values above 250 mu mhos/cm were found at 25 degrees C, classified as medium to high risk of salinity, unsuitable for agricultural use. Analysis of the combined effect of the presence of sodium (SAR) and salinity (EC or TDS) shows that 27 of analyzing sites have restricted water medium at very high for use in irrigation.

J	Mohamed, EAH				Mohamed, Eman A. H.			Biophysical remediation of vanadium by Shewanella sp E1	INDIAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Removal of vanadium toxic levels from industrial wastewater is an urgent demand before releasing to the environment. In this study, Shewanella sp. strain E1, an isolate of industrial wastewater body, Riyadh city, KSA, was subjected to molecular identification using partial sequencing of the 16S rDNA and gyrB genes. This bacterium is resistant to vanadium pentoxide up to 15 mg/l and more. The Plackett-Burman statistical design was used for near optimum vanadium biophysical removal conditions and this target was achieved giving that the positive levels of vanadium concentration (a significant factor), pH and cell weight, and the negative levels of solution volume (a significant factor), rotation rate, contact time, and temperature. Protein electrophoresis of active cells in the preSence of 15 mg/l vanadium pentoxide showed at least 16 different intracellular proteins. The study suggest that Shewanella sp. E1 can be used for vanadium removal from industrial wastewater to increase its water quality before release to the environment.																	0972-5849	0975-0967				JUL	2017	16	3					380	386										WOS:000425580800015

The evaluation was per-formed in the Split Desktop 2.0 software based on the photographic documentation of three different muck piles obtained from the last phase of sublevel caving. Moreover calculation of the Hazen index which may be applied in Russia as an additional tool to evaluate blasting works was included. According to performed analysis it can be observe that the average grain diameters were in the optimum range. Furthermore the Hazen index shows that all analyzed muck piles should be evaluated as various grain size. This could be explained by the type of exploitation system which was used during ore extraction.

This exploratory study aimed to establish the composition and species richness of diatoms in relation to physicochemical parameters as base element for monitoring the Pirro urban micro-watershed river in Heredia, Costa Rica. Materials were collected in the upper, middle, and lower river during dry, rainy, and transitional seasons. Dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, temperature, and composition diatomaceous were evaluated by scraping an area of 20 cm x 20 cm rocks. 18 diatom species with low abundance such as Navicula seminulum, N. minimum and N. cryptotenella were observed. These are indicatives of moderate conditions of pollution; others kinds, such as Nitzschia, display tolerant species to contaminants. The greatest diversity of species of diatoms occurred in the rainy season, and significant differences between sampling season and species richness were observed. In conclusion, Pirro river has poor sanitary conditions based on the presence of many different species, and the low channel of the river is the most affected by pollution. However, it is necessary to boost the information on this subject.																	1011-0275	2215-3470				JUL-DEC	2017	31	2					99	109		10.15359/ru.31-2.7								WOS:000424141400007

Functional feeding groups of aquatic insects in Andean streams affected by agriculture and mining	CALDASIA												Aquatic insects are ecological indicators of human disturbance and currently there is the tendency to use the functional approach as a potential tool to evaluate water quality. Insects can change the food acquisition mode and the type according to environmental conditions. This study aims to evaluate the influence of the agricultural and mining impacts upon the diversity and dominance of aquatic insect feeding functional groups and trophic guilds found upstream in the Chinchina River (Caldas, Colombia). Two localities were selected, one with mining and one with agriculture activities, in each locality we evaluated a reference and an impacted creek. A total of 8239 individuals were collected using a Surber net; these are grouped into eight orders, 36 families and 71 morphospecies ((C) over capn = 100%). The intestinal content of the specimens whom belong to the nine most abundant genera of aquatic insects was analyzed and classified as: shredders, collectors, predators, scrapers, and filterers. No changes were noted regards to the diet between impacted and reference areas, possibly due to resource availability. Agricultural activity presented the strongest negative effect on the diversity of the group. This result may be linked to the complete loss of riparian vegetation due the immediate proximity of the crops to the studied streams, and to the use of agrochemicals.

WATER SCARCITY IN EGYPT: CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES	IIOAB JOURNAL												Water quality is now a major concern for all countries around the world, it depends on the location of the source and the state environmental protection in a given area. Therefore, the quality and the nature of water may be determined by physical and chemical characters. So, water resources are the critical factor affecting production, services, and sustainable development in Egypt. Egypt is facing four major constraints with respect to its water resources: (I) A fixed water supply and rocketing population growth. (II) Difficulties in the country's relationship with the Nile Basin states. (III) Independence of South Sudan declared in July 2011. (IV) Climate change and its hidden future. These four factors pose a number of questions related to the availability of water and the amount of supply that will be allocated for different consumptive and non-consumptive activities and development programs. Egypt also faces the dilemma of pollution of water resources by industrial wastewater, agricultural drainage water and municipal wastewater which may cause many risks to the health of citizens and threaten the safety of the water situation in Egypt.																	0976-3104					JUL-SEP	2017	8	4					40	47										WOS:000423923100006

The aim of this is to encourage farmers to change some of their practices, particularly those which lead to high levels of diffuse pollution. By participating in the development of a "Grenelle" water abstraction action plan in SW France, we were able to develop an innovative computerized management and decision support tool. This system organizes and structures information obtained from local stakeholder networks. Using a number of spatial data warehouses, it processes decision-related data at different levels of granularity, and at different spatial scales, and then presents those data using SOLAP (Spatial Online Analytical Processing) tools. Spatialised indicators (action areas, pesticide types, direct costs, etc.) are defined in close consultation with stakeholders in the field. The long-term vision for these action plans, as well as the developing needs of the different stakeholders, will allow the system to develop into a broader agri-environmental observatory storing data from the entire life cycle of successive action plans and contributing to better informed governance.																	1260-5875	2116-7060				JUL-SEP	2017	27	3					399	422		10.3166/rig.2017.00032								WOS:000423910300006

Lake Karla was one of the most important wetlands of Greece with many benefits not only to biodiversity preservation, to water balance of the watershed, but also to local economy in terms of fisheries. Its drainage, in 1962, created a lot of environmental problems and led to the local economy shrinking. After its refilling, the newly reestablished water body is considered a vital aquatic ecosystem since it is listed in the network of Natura 2000. The monitoring results, the pressures and their causes that affected the restoration effort are presented. The assessment of the water quality is achieved by evaluating the results of the monitoring and fieldwork programs that Management Body of Eco-development Area of Lake Karla has performed during the last four years funded by the European Union. The results indicate strong eutrophication along with threats to biodiversity. The delay of implementation of Lake Karla reconstruction project, the decline from the proposed Environmental Terms and the lack of environmental policy are the most important causes of pressures.

However, variables related to it are not routinely surveyed in most of the water quality monitoring programs. Our approach included studying the diversity of these organisms, in a large tropical reservoir in a Brazilian Amazonian reserve. The research was carried out in the rainy and dry season when measurements were performed every three hours and at five different depths. A total of 40 water samples were collected to analyze temporal variations of abiotic and biotic factors. Physico-chemical parameters were analyzed to characterize the ecosystem and relationships between these variables and phytoplankton functional groups were statistically tested. The data were examined using analysis of variance and canonical correspondence analysis. We identified 9 functional groups in both seasons. The functional group M, which represents organisms with developed adaptations to high insolation and stable environments, had a higher relative percentage of contribution to the total biomass in the rainy season. Group P, which tends to be present in the more eutrophic lakes and is tolerant to carbon deficiency, had a higher relative percentage of contribution to the total biomass in the dry season. This study indicated that the fluctuations of the water level reflected in seasonal changes of phytoplankton biomass and environmental variables. Additionally, this experiment permitted to advise on sampling strategies for monitoring phytoplankton in lakes and reservoirs.

This study compiled DBP and related water quality parameter data for 395 public drinking water systems serving populations greater than 100,000 across 44 US states from 1980 to early 2015. Assessing DBP occurrence data from two years before (2010-2012) and after (2012-2014) Stage 2 DBPR implementation shows improved capture of higher DBP exposure locations within water distribution systems due to the initial distribution system evaluation. After Stage 2 DBPR implementation, TTHM and HAA5 concentrations have mean values of 30.5 mu g/L and 19.6 mu g/L and 95th percentile values of 71.2 mu g/L and 46.5 mu g/L, respectively. Comparing this data set with the 1997-1998 Information Collection Rule data set suggests a 20 mu g/L reduction in average TTHM occurrence for the highest 5% of systems nationally from 1997-1998 to 2010-2014.																	2164-4535					JUL	2017	109	7					17	30		10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.0082								WOS:000422939400011

Forest restoration can increase the Rio Doce watershed resilience	PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Rio Doce watershed has centuries of land degradation and it was the main victim of the worst environmental disaster in Brazil's history. This process of deforestation and soil erosion could be significantly mitigated if compliance to the new Brazilian Native Vegetation Protection Law (NVPL) would be ensured. Here, we show how the percentage of forest kept in areas of permanent preservation (APP) required by the NVPL drives the overall resilience and resistance of the entire Rio Doce watershed and how it contributes to the national restoration commitments. We used water quality as a proxy for watershed resilience and resistance and we found that compliance to NVPL would require restoration of about 716 thousand hectares of riverine forest across the watershed. We found that increased forested areas improved watershed resistance and resilience during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Our estimates suggest that the implementation of the NVPL could improve water quality, in addition to removing 14 Gt CO(2)yr(-1) ha(-1) from the atmosphere. At this scale, the forest restoration effort would represent 6% of Brazil's restoration commitment. Financial feasibility of such a restoration enterprise is also achievable; at the highest possible estimate, it would compromise about 59% of the total fund proposed by the mining companies responsible for the accident. Given the low socioeconomic indicators of this basin, intervention should be designed so as to improve local livelihoods and, therefore, contribute to local adaptation and sustainable development.

Photocatalytic degradation of the ortho and meta-Nitroaniline in a cylindrical reactor - parabolic compound	ENTRE CIENCIA E INGENIERIA												Catalytic photodegradation with solar radiation is one of the most economical and highly useful technologies in advanced oxidation processes for the treatment of contaminants in water. The technique uses semiconductors that take advantage of a percentage of the wavelength emitted by the sun for the generation of species pair hollow-electron, that initiate the conversion of the molecules to be degraded. In the present research the photodegradation of the ortho and meta-Nitroaniline systems is studied in a solar reactor fitted with a compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) built at microscale, using TiO2 as a catalyst in suspension. The optimum conditions were determined in terms of solution flow rate, species derived from the acid and type of oxidizing agent. The results reveal a higher percentage of degradation with the use of hydrogen peroxide regardless of the flow rate for both compounds and an acceptable water quality under biological analysis on species guppies (Poecilia reticulata).																	1909-8367					JUL-DEC	2017		22					95	100										WOS:000417995400012

The photocatalytic degradation of two typical azo dyes used in the textile industry (Acid Brown 83 and Direct Blue 1) was studied using the catalysts titanium dioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO) supported on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS) substrates. For these dyes, degradation reactions using different initial pH values and supported catalysts were carried out. Adsorption isotherms were obtained and analyzed. No significant statistical differences were found between the use of PET and PS as substrates on degradation rate constants for both dyes. For Acid Brown 83 the highest rate constant was obtained at pH 2.5 using TiO2. For Direct Blue 1, the rate constant showed a significant difference only between the treatment at pH 2.5 using TiO2 and the treatment al pH 11.0 using ZnO. The adsorption of both dyes was higher on TiO2 than on ZnO.

The system was able to provide 2.65 litre of distilled water per day for about 320 days per annum. The economic evaluation of the distillation unit revealed that high value of IRR (62.88 per cent) and low value of payback period (1.9 Years) make the unit very cost efficient. The economic attributes of the system revealed its economic viability. The system is useful for getting distilled water which can be used in batteries, laboratories. It can also be used for drinking by mixing with saline water in places where water quality is saline.																	2277-5412	2322-0430				JUL-SEP	2017	13	3					569	575		10.5958/2322-0430.2017.00218.9								WOS:000417319900021

Spatial and temporal ground water responses to seasonal rainfall replenishment in an alluvial aquifer	BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												Groundwater is an enormously vital water resource available on earth. Due to over exploitation of groundwater, especially in dry regions and in the water scares areas, has led to irretrievable consequences due to deterioration of water quality. The groundwater resources, which are found in shallow depth often have poor in water quality and in most cases the ground water are severely over-exploited. Therefore, the study has been planned to identify the spatial & temporal variation of aquifer responses of the study area to the natural recharge as well as Ground water level trend in last 15 years. This study is conducted in Tawa command area, which lies in Hoshangabad District of Madhya Pradesh. Also facing problem of water logging and shortage in the region. The study identifi ed the spatial behavior of ground water level in pre-monsoon and post monsoon. Insight of the current study, the spatial and temporal graphical analysis for the observation sites of the unconfi ned aquifer indicated that there is a good hydraulic connection of groundwater level with the rainfall.																	0974-6455					JUL-SEP	2017	10	3					431	437		10.21786/bbrc/10.3/16								WOS:000417347600016

Prior to the growing environmental awareness, flow rate and regime are critical components of water supply, water quality, and the ecological integrity of river systems. Environmental flow may be described as the required stream flow quantity to support the ecological activity in a river system. While environmental flow assessment provides protection and use balance over the water resources and it also reduces the natural and artificial effects that caused of deterioration of the natural condition of the rivers. There are only a few environmental flow assessment studies in Turkey. In this paper, daily flow data has been used to determine the flow regimes in order to have some idea about the environmental flow. For this purpose, common methods such as original Tennant method, modified Tennant method, wetted perimeter method, 7Q10 and Q95 have been examined. Daily flow data has been obtained from three gauging stations located in Great Menderes Basin. The first one (07-30) is unregulated, the second is regulated (07-04) and the third one is indirectly regulated (07-71) gauging stations. As a result of this study, particular methods have more reliability and might be more appropriate for each case. The modified Tennant method could be selected as the most practical method for the measured data of flow rates in unregulated gauging station. Q95 method can be used for the other two stations.																	2224-4980					JUL	2017	7	3					499	510										WOS:000417183100011

The data collected over a four-year research period included quality parameters of water taken from the water distribution system in the period between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2014. In the analysis the supply zones of four municipal water treatment plants in Krakow were considered. The selection of 29 water sampling points within the supply area allowed comparing water quality with respect to operational and technological aspects. Factor analysis enabled 4 components explaining correlations between tap water quality variables to be distinguished. It follows from the research performed that the obtained factors applied to 77% of overall water variability. The highest share was assigned to factor 1 that explained 32% of the chemical composition of water under consideration and was correlated with calcium, conductance, nitrates (V), magnesium and to a moderate extent with Sigma THM (with negative sign).																	2299-8993					JUL	2017	18	4					110	117		10.12911/22998993/74288								WOS:000416834200014

The backwash water samples were taken from the circuits located in two indoor facilities with a different purpose of the basins. Moreover, the samples were characterized by varying quality, as described by selected physicochemical parameters (such as turbidity and ultraviolet absorbance UV254). Commercial membranes were used for the tests. The transport-separation properties of the membranes were determined based on the volumetric flux of the permeate. In addition, backwash water samples before and after the membrane process were subjected to toxicological assessment using the Microtox (R) screening test. The performed processes contributed to a significant reduction in turbidity and the value of UV254 ultraviolet absorbance, both in the ultrafiltration and nanofiltration processes. Whereas, significant differences in transport properties were noted within individual processes. A great influence of backwash water quality, including physicochemical parameters, on the course and results of the membrane filtration processes was demonstrated. In all of the nanofiltration cycles carried out, the removal of the toxic properties of the backwash water with respect to bacteria in the Microtox (R) test was found. Nevertheless, samples with high values of resultant physicochemical parameters after the ultrafiltration process were still characterized by high toxicity. Pressure membrane processes show high effectiveness in the removal of contaminants from backwash water. However, it is necessary to introduce supporting processes aimed at reducing membrane pore blocking by deposits and organic compounds, and in the case of ultrafiltration, assuring the safety of the purified stream in terms of the toxicological effect.																	2299-8993					JUL	2017	18	4					130	136		10.12911/22998993/74282								WOS:000416834200017

Samples of bottom sediments were collected on the basis of regular measurement grid of 46 points located in the area of the water reservoir Poraj. The collected samples were analyzed in terms of content of following elements, which values are in range: total phosphorus (TP) 0.06 - 5.06 g/kg, total nitrogen (TN) 0.17 - 9.66 g/kg, organic matter (OM) 0.49 - 28.41% of solid content, aluminum (Al) 2.44 - 145.15 g/kg and iron (Fe) 0.28 - 16.50 g/kg. By using of GIS system, spatial distribution of obtained results of laboratory analyzes were interpolated (Inverse Distance Weighted method was used). On basis of spatial distribution it was noted that in northern part of water reservoir bottom sediments have greater values of TP, TN and OM than in southern part. The study also included calculation of correlation between: OM and TN (n = 46, R-2 = 0.9335), TN and Fe (n = 46, R-2 = 0.8782), TN and Al (n = 46, R-2 = 0.8629), OM and Fe (n = 46, R-2 = 0.8243), OM and Al (n = 46, R-2 = 0.7981), TP and Fe (n = 46, R-2 = 0.7456), TP and Al (n = 46, R-2 = 0.6209). The presented pilot studies show that the potential content of phosphorus, nitrogen and organic matter in the sediments of the water reservoir Poraj can reach a significant level. The need to plan and carry out further research allowing the evaluation of the properties of the analyzed elements and examining their potential impact on water quality in the tested water reservoir was stated.																	2299-8993					JUL	2017	18	4					178	184		10.12911/22998993/74277								WOS:000416834200023

The oxidation reaction was carried out in the presence of sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide and ozone with/without UV radiation. EHMC degradation and the analysis of products were performed using gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometry detector. The most effective method of EHMC degradation turned out to be ozonation with participation of UV radiation. In this system, degradation proceeded most quickly and generated a small amount of by-products (2-propyl-1-pentanol; 4-metoxybenzaldehyde and Z-EHMC). Under the influence of sodium hypochlorite, numerous chloroorganic products were formed, which can cause secondary contamination of water. Application of appropriate oxidation processes can contribute to degradation of micropollutants and thus to improvement of water quality.																	2299-8993					JUL	2017	18	4					204	210		10.12911/22998993/74273								WOS:000416834200027

WITHOUT WATER, I CANNOT LIVE: GENDER AND THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF LA ANTIGUA, VERACRUZ	AGRICULTURA SOCIEDAD Y DESARROLLO												This article considers the following question: Is decentralization the framework of governance most adequate to guarantee women's human right to water? The study was carried out throughout 2015 in La Antigua, Veracruz, municipality where the drinking water network is managed by a para-municipal organization since 2008. The data were collected using a mixed methodological design that included a survey, interviews and workshops. The place of residence, location of the household, socioeconomic status, and marital status are factors that obstruct the benefit of the human right to water by women. All the women share their exclusion from the decision making process and the need to purchase bottled water for human consumption. It is concluded that the financial fragility and the lack of citizen participation make decentralization an inadequate framework to guarantee the human right to water.																	1870-5472					JUL-SEP	2017	14	3					405	425										WOS:000416771900005

Physicochemical Properties of Manzala Lake, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												PHYSICOCHEMICAL parameters such as temperature, total dissolved solid (TDS), pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), permanganate index (PI), chloride and nutrient salts were measured in water samples, collected from 12 sites of Manzala Lake during winter and summer, 2015. A lot of fluctuations were observed in these parameters affected by the poor connection of water body of the lake and the diversity of the incoming flows. The pH values of water were alkaline throughout the lake and closely correlated with widely varied salinity and DO values. BOD increases in the south eastern-located sites affected mostly by Bahr El Baqur drain effluents especially during winter during the scheduled water block. PI was highly influenced by the agricultural and domestic waste effluents. Nutrients salts ranged between 5.47-249, 2.61-15.1, 0.64-24.5, and 3.47-22.9 mu mol L-1 for ammonia, nitrite, nitrate and phosphate, respectively. N/P ratios (2.28-12.8) in the present study indicated that nitrogen is the limiting factor for phytoplankton fluorination except for some sites in the south eastern region. The levels of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found affected by the seawater inflows during winter. It can be concluded from obtained data that the south eastern region showed worst water quality parameters.

The research was done in the stream La Central that is responsible for supplying the inhabitants of water for human consumption of several towns in the province of Cartago, Costa Rica. First, water quality was evaluated through a water quality index (ICA) in the spring water and several points of the nearby river, for a period of three months of the rainy season. In addition, the ecological vulnerability was assessed in the study area analyzing different ecological indicators. Interviews were also made to assess agricultural practices in the area. Finally, some recommendations leading to reduce the risk of contamination of the creek and also improve the water quality caused by the environmental effect. ICA values showed an increasing deterioration of water quality of the spring water, led by increases in nitrate content, probably associated with runoff phenomena caused by major rainfalls. Although in all cases, the value is less than 50 mg/L which is allowed in our legislation for drinking water, pollution may be higher in the months of higher rainfalls. The other sampling points showed the presence of fecal coliforms, probably caused by livestock in the highlands. The assessment of ecological vulnerability was High or Very High vulnerabilities in particular ecological indicators. It was recommended to carry out monitoring of water quality during the months of highest rainfalls and implementing management and environmental culture programs with farmers and ranchers in the area, along with good agricultural practices.																	0379-3982	2215-3241				JUL-SEP	2017	30	3					47	58		10.18845/tm.v30i3.3272								WOS:000416543900005

We argue that piped water and bottled water cannot be easily compared in the Indonesian context. Drinking from tap water has never been accepted as the norm as piped water has no guarantee of purity and safety. The substantial marketing efforts of the bottled water industry highlight the appeal of bottled water in regard to, not only good water quality and physical health, but also taste, convenience, mental health, and social and environmental values. Despite many negative social and environmental issues associated with bottled water, this enigmatic commodity is becoming 'the' drinking water in Indonesia and is inseparable from modern life.

Epilithic algae and water samples were taken from four stations (one in the channel, others in the lake), between June 2012-May 2013 seasonally. Totally 51 taxa were observed belonging to the groups Bacillariophyta (37), Chlorophyta (8), Charophyta (4) and Cyanobacteria (2), respectively. The stations were clustered into main two groups based on UPGMA. The highest similarity value was determined between third and fourth station (94%). Saprobic Index (SI) was applied in order to determine biological water quality. Physicochemical parameters have been evaluated according to the Klee's method and Regulation on the Management of Surface Water Quality in Turkish (RMSWQ). According to the Klee's method, water quality was found unpolluted in Kovada Lake, and its channel while it was found as polluted based on RMSWQ. Biological water quality values indicated Lake Kovada as poorly polluted, but its channel as polluted. According to CCA, 84.6% of the variance was described by the first four axes of the relations of species and environmental variables (r=0.963), and pH, conductivity and Cl- were found to be the most influential variables on distribution of dominant taxa.																	1303-2712					JUL	2017	17	4					701	711		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_4_06								WOS:000403575500006

Concentrations of dissolved metals were relatively low and comparable to, or slightly above those found in coastal Adriatic region. Compared to higher variability of dissolved metal concentrations due to the discrete sampling, smoother temporal distribution was recorded for DGT-labile metals. The percentages of DGT-labile metal concentrations, which reflect their affinity to organic matter, varied among metals with the following order: Cu < Zn approximate to Co < Ni < Cd approximate to Pb. DGT-labile metal concentrations predicted by speciation modeling were in a good agreement with the measured ones for Zn, Cd and Ni, while they are underestimated for Pb and Cu, and overestimated for Co. In-situ DGT technique is recommended for the assessment of the water quality status in marine environment.																	0011-1643	1334-417X				JUL	2017	90	2			SI		177	185		10.5562/cca3163								WOS:000416047000010

Biomass yield, oil productivity and fatty acid profile of Chlorella lobophora cultivated in diverse eutrophic wastewaters	BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY												Experimental trial of biomass yield, oil productivity and fatty acid profile of Chlorella lobophora in natural eutrophic wastewaters from three different sources was carried out using Bold's Basal Medium as the control. Eutrophication of water is a serious environment issue in agricultural as well as in many industrial zones in the world. But algal biomass production remains the most cost-effective and sustainable means to deal with eutrophic wastewater. Algal culture is the potential method of combining wastewater treatment, nutrient removal, resource recovery and simultaneous yield of biomass and bio-oils. Algal biomass has nutraceutical and biofuel applications. The major objective of the present experimentation was to test the suitability of different eutrophic wastewaters towards understanding the optimum requirements of microalgae for best biomass and oil yield. Influence of variations in nutrient composition of the wastewaters on chemical profile of the oil are also analyzed. Different water quality parameters were found significantly correlated to biomass characteristics of the alga. Oil productivity as well as chemical profile of the oil also exhibited interrelationships to water quality parameters. The oil of algal biomass taken from all kinds of wastewater sources is found suitable for biodiesel through transesterification. Overall, the method stands as model for preliminary screening of algae for economic utilization of wastewaters towards attaining high biomass yield with desired oil quality, especially for biodiesel production.																	1878-8181					JUL	2017	11						338	344		10.1016/j.bcab.2017.08.006								WOS:000414500200045

It is considered as a hypertrophic environment that receives daily high loads of domestic sewage without treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of phytoplankton community and its relationship with environmental parameters. Bi-monthly sampling campaigns were carried out at six fixed sites between 2012 and 2013. Physical-chemical and biological parameters were collected (chlorophyll a, phytoplankton composition and abundance) to perform the statistical correlations. The results indicate that phytoplankton community is mostly represented by diatoms, with Skeletonema costatum being the dominant species responsible for bloom in April and June of 2012. The dominance of this species is related to the high silicate concentrations, pH and turbidity. Other blooms events as well as the Euglena gracilis and Chlamydomonas sp. were recorded in February 2013, when the total phosphorus concentrations were high and the dissolved oxygen concentrations were higher. Dinoflagellates, cyanobacteria and diatom Thallassiosira sp. were widely distributed in the dry period and highly correlated with salinity, water transparency and nutrients. Hence, the distribution of phytoplankton community is more defined seasonally, rather than spatially.																	1679-8759	1982-436X				JUL-SEP	2017	65	3					356	372		10.1590/S1679-87592017134406503								WOS:000414698600003

Samples were taken before (BD) and; 1 day (1 PD) 5 days (5 PD), 10 days (10 PD), 20 days (20 PD) and 30 days (30 PD) after the effluents discharge. Some water quality parameters were affected by the effluents discharge; however, these changes were restricted to a distance of 20 m from the effluent discharge channel for a period of 5 days. The microbial community was dominated by chlorophyceae, followed by diatoms, cyanobacteria and ciliates. There was an increase in the abundance of different groups on the 1 PD sampling compared to BD. The zooplankton abundance was low in practically all sites, except for 30 PD sampling. The meso-zooplanktonic organisms were represented by copepods, mostly Acartia tonsa. Despite some effects on water quality and phytoplankton and protozooplankton abundance until 5 PD sampling, these alterations dissipated in a short period of time. We conclude that the environment quickly assimilated the effluents discharge, and the water quality parameters remained within the limits stipulated by standard guidelines.

Time, funding and supporting infrastructure are significant hurdles. This study addresses the latter in describing a mobile platform designed for hosting community co-created exhibitions. It assesses its functionality in two case studies where installations of the platform were hosted by major public museums in New Zealand. Both exhibitions had marine themes, but the co-creation partners varied from a science education centre and their citizen science collaborators, to an informal group of adults and students engaged in water quality monitoring. Reflective evaluation of the co-creative process using the platform revealed one of its major benefits to be its professional aesthetic, which allowed work to be presented to a high standard of display, and empowered co-creators to feel confident in the quality of their work. Further success arose from its physical constraints; a practical scope for exhibitions was demarcated by certain structural limitations and offered relief from what was initially experienced by novice co-creators as an intimidating amount of freedom within undefined space. Successful elements combined to facilitate key criteria for co-creation including early and continuous empowerment and co-ownership between co-creating parties.																	0011-3069	2151-6952				JUL	2017	60	3					335	349		10.1111/cura.12194								WOS:000412840800006

All samples were tested for 12 water quality parameters and summary statistics were calculated to compare the water quality parameters with WHO permissible limits. Initially, correlation matrix was constructed to evaluate the most significant parameters and later on used principal component analysis (PCA) to select those parameters causing maximum variation. Dendrogram based on cluster analysis conveyed same sort of information as delivered by PCA. First, factor of PCA contributed 41.6% of total variation. Six water quality parameters such as sulfate, calcium, total dissolved solids, sodium, chloride, and magnesium were found to be most alarming because all of these have factor loadings greater than 75%. Cross-variogram based on cokriging showed spatial dependence as well as positive pairwise spatial correlation among all parameters. The prediction maps highlighted the most dangerous and health hazard areas; therefore, may be very helpful for water management agencies to target those high-risk areas. It was found that the area with east latitude 31.0 degrees-31.4 degrees and north longitude 72.8 degrees-73.2 degrees is most alarming zone.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2017	84						93	101		10.5004/dwt.2017.20911								WOS:000412880600010						
J	Tang, VT; Singh, RP; Fu, DF				Van Tai Tang; Singh, Rajendra Prasad; Fu, Dafang			Transformation impact of vertical revetment on the river water quality and its mechanism	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The vertical hard revetment can cause the disturbance in river flow with the results of destroyed features, degraded biodiversity, decreasing self-purification ability and deteriorated water quality. The current work is focused on the application of prefabricated porous concrete template covered on widespread vertical hard revetment for improving water purification, increasing biodiversity and decreased negative impact of hard concrete revetment to river quality. Six kinds of porous concrete with different void ratio, aggregate size and water cement ratio were prepared to investigate the compressive strength and water purification properties. A river simulator device was used to determine the water purification capacity of the porous concrete in flowing condition. Water quality purification mechanism of porous concrete was discussed thoroughly by the analysis of microbial community diversity. Results show that the compressive strength and water purification ability of porous concrete were higher when the void ratio, size of the aggregate material and water cement ratio were 30%, 10-20 mm and 0.3, respectively. Under the flow velocity of V = 0.03 m/s and hydraulic retention time of 6 d, the removal rates of M-2 biofilm for chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were 59.21%, 74.07%, 54.25%, 55.47% and 62.90%, respectively. Findings reveal that prefabricated porous concrete was efficient for river water purification. Porous concrete templates can be attached to a large number of microorganisms.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2017	84						111	122		10.5004/dwt.2017.21094								WOS:000412880600012

Sewage flow control using an inflow controller with an electrical conductivity sensor in the outfall	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an inflow controller equipped with an electrical conductivity (EC) sensor on sewage flow during rainfall events. To investigate the relationship between the water quality characteristics and EC of sewage in the field, the EC sensor was used for real-time monitoring. The correlation coefficient (R-2) of CODmn vs. EC was more than 0.97. A reliable hourly maximum flow was calculated using the real-time monitoring data and a water level sensor. The capacity of regulating devices was evaluated during rainfall events by comparing the predicted flow with flow measured by field survey. When the gate was closed at an EC of less than 300 mu s/cm, the flow control rate of overflow for the total discharge was about 44% and 75% during the short-term rainfall (once a day) and long-term rainfall events (over 3 d), respectively, and the COD load control rate was about 16% and 61%, respectively. The flow control rate changed according to the EC control setting: the higher the EC control setting, the more the flow control rate increased. The flow control rate was about 40% an EC of 250 mu s/cm. However, it showed that there was some difference below the EC. The results indicated that controlling sewage inflow based on EC increased the removal efficiency of sewage treatment plants during rainfall events by reducing hydraulic load.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2017	84						135	141		10.5004/dwt.2017.21228								WOS:000412880600014						
J	Shafique, M; Kim, R				Shafique, Muhammad; Kim, Reeho			Green stormwater infrastructure with low impact development concept: a review of current research	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Green storm water infrastructure (GSI) or low impact development (LID) is an alternative land development approach for managing storm water close to the source that has been recommended instead of the traditional storm water design. The main purpose of LID is to reduce the impact of development on water-related problems through the use of GSI practices such as bioretention, green roofs, grass swales, and permeable pavements that infiltrate, evaporate, or harvest and use stormwater on the site where it falls. In recent years, more research has been carried out on GSI practices and the use of these practices has shown magnificent benefits in stormwater management. LID techniques have been successfully used to manage stormwater runoff, improve water quality, and protect environmental and hydrological aspects of the developed areas. Bioretention cells have been effectively used in retaining large volumes of runoff and capturing pollutants on site. Pervious pavements have been extremely effective and efficient at infiltrating stormwater on site and storing large quantities of rainwater. Sand ditches are a new water harvesting technique that is being used to significantly reduce runoff, soil loss and sediment loss and to increase infiltration. This paper highlights evidence in the literature regarding the beneficial uses of LID practices and encourages adopting these practices for environmental friendly construction and sustainable development in the world. In the end, some of recommendations for the implementation of LID practices to achieve multiple benefits are given.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUL	2017	83						16	29		10.5004/dwt.2017.20981								WOS:000412878800003						
J	Gibson, JM; Pieper, KJ				Gibson, Jacqueline MacDonald; Pieper, Kelsey J.			Strategies to Improve Private-Well Water Quality: A North Carolina Perspective	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the 44.5 million U.S. residents drawing their drinking water from private wells face higher risks of waterborne contaminant exposure than those served by regulated community water supplies. Among U.S. states, North Carolina (N.C.) has the second-largest population relying on private wells, making it a useful microcosm to study challenges to maintaining private-well water quality. OBJECTIVES: This paper summarizes recommendations from a two-day summit to identify options to improve drinking-water quality for N.C. residents served by private wells. METHODS: The Research Triangle Environmental Health Collaborative invited 111 participants with knowledge of private-well water challenges to attend the Summit. Participants worked in small groups that focused on specific aspects and reconvened in plenary sessions to formulate consensus recommendations. DISCUSSION: Summit participants highlighted four main barriers to ensuring safe water for residents currently relying on private wells: (1) a database of private well locations is unavailable; (2) racial disparities have perpetuated reliance on private wells in some urbanized areas; (3) many private well users lack information or resources to monitor and maintain their wells; and (4) private-well support programs are fragmented and lack sufficient resources. The Summit produced 10 consensus recommendations for ways to overcome these barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The Summit recommendations, if undertaken, could improve the health of North Carolinians facing elevated risks of exposure to waterborne contaminants because of their reliance on inadequately monitored and maintained private wells. Because many of the challenges in N.C. are common nationwide, these recommendations could serve as models for other states.																	0091-6765	1552-9924				JUL	2017	125	7							UNSP 076001	10.1289/EHP890								WOS:000413791300007

However, integrating participant feedback into current science, research, and decision-making processes is challenging. This paper presents a novel approach that marries a rigorous Delphi method, borrowed from policy and organizational sciences, with contemporary "crowdsourcing" to address the complex problems of water pollution exacerbated by climate change in the Lake Champlain Basin. In an online Delphi forum that occurred over a six-week period during the Spring of 2014, fifty-three participants proposed and commented on adaptive solutions to address water quality in the context of climate change. In a follow up Multi-Stakeholder workshop, thirty-eight stakeholders participated in refining and synthesizing the results from the forum. To inform modeling and policy dialogue, the resulting list of interventions was analyzed by time horizon, domain, type of adaptation action, and priority level. The interventions suggested by stakeholders within the crowdsourcing forum have contributed to the current policy dialogue in Vermont including legislation to address phosphorus loading to Lake Champlain. This stakeholder approach strengthens traditional modeling scenario development to include solutions and priorities that have been collectively refined and vetted.																	0959-3780	1872-9495				JUL	2017	45						111	123		10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2017.05.005								WOS:000411912800010

Inspired by their jumping capability, we present the design of a novel, miniature, water surface jumping robot in this paper. Jumping from water surface is more challenging than jumping from ground due to the liquid water surface. We address this problem by using carbon fiber strip to store energy, two wings to flap the water surface, a hollow body to initially support the robot, and an intermittent gear train to charge and release energy. With such a design, the final robot weighs around 12.5 g and has a maximum size of 10 cm. Experimental results show that the robot can jump up to 9.5 cm in height, which is close to the predicted results from a dynamic model developed by us to capture the hydrodynamic behaviors of the robot during the whole jumping process. The research presented in this paper offers a new design of tiny robots for mimicking the water-jumping capability of aquatic insects. The robot, if equipped with sensors, can be employed for aquatic environmental monitoring of water quality.

Initially, previous contact was made with the community to present the project and its objectives. For determining what water points we should collect from, a survey was made about the types of water sources used by residents for consumption. After the collection, samples were sent to the laboratory of Microbiology of the State University of Mato Grosso, Barra do Bugres campus, where they were determined by the fast-Colilert method. Contamination detected in analyzed samples, throughout the period, caused considerable concern, filth index predominated in almost 100% of the samples. Factors such as lack of basic sanitation, which can be evidenced by the inappropriate destination of solid waste and the absence of water treatment for consumption, directly influenced the results obtained. In the end of the project, the responsible team prepared a report of the results obtained by the research, which was presented to Baixio and Morro Redondo communities' residents, along with information on accessible practices for reduction of microbiological contamination of water. We observed that contamination of hydric resources, due to lack of basic sanitation and lack of water treatment for consumption, evidences risks to collective health of these communities. Therefore, the implementation of public policies by the competent local authorities becomes a matter of paramount importance to reverse this framework. Joint interdisciplinary actions in areas of water resources management, basic sanitation, housing, and health are necessary actions to improve the quality of life of this 'quilombola' community.																	0104-1290					JUL-SEP	2017	26	3					822	828		10.1590/S0104-12902017166542								WOS:000413756700019

AMD is typically treated by neutralization with lime (Ca(OH)(2)) or calcium carbonate (CaCO3). This process can remove many toxic elements from the AMD in a simple way, but the amount of neutralizer used is often decided based on experience because the removal mechanism of each element has not been quantified. Seasonal variation in the quality and quantity of AMD is considerable, and for many mines their AMD needs to be treated semi-permanently. Thus, more efficient and stable treatment is required in order to reduce chemical input and sludge generation. With a view to construction of a more efficient AMD treatment method and process, this study aims to develop a simulator that can represent water quality. To this end, a quantitative model that can represent changes in pH and the concentration of each element was constructed using a chemical equilibrium calculation that incorporates surface complexation by ferrihydrite and aluminum hydroxide, which have the potential to remove many kinds of toxic elements. For the surface complexation model of each hydroxide, the double layer model was used. By comparing the calculated results with experimental results obtained from neutralization of two kinds of actual AMD, it was confirmed that the quantitative model constructed in this study could successfully represent the changes in pH and residual concentration of each element.

Correlation between Physics-Chemical Water Parameters and Existing brotia testudinaria in Wangi River Bujeng village Beji district Pasuruan regency	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												Rivers are part of a freshwater ecosystem possessing an important role for living organism residing within. The main problem of water resources is the decrease of water quality. This leads to habitat destruction and disruption of organisms that depend on water resources. One of the living organisms living in the riverbeds is gastropods. This study was conducted from November to December 2016. T Brotia testudinaria samples were taken using a 1 x 1 m transect. Research result exhibited an average abundance of B. testudinaria which amounted to 259.14 ind / m2. Parameters affecting the existence of B. testudinaria include temperature, DO, COD, BOD, pH, nitrate, and phosphate. Based on the previous research, it can be concluded that the value of physics-chemical parameters in Wangi River is in good condition which is in accordance with PP RI. 28/2001 on Water Quality Management and Water Pollution Control. The lowest physics-chemical parameter values are generally located at Station 1 and the highest is in Station 7. This is due to parameter contents accumulation in Station 7 which is the last station downstream which caused high content of BOD, COD, nitrate, and phosphate values. Physical-chemical parameters influencing abundance value of Brotia testudinaria include temperature, DO, COD, BOD, pH, nitrate and phosphate.																	0975-8585					JUL-AUG	2017	8	4					867	+										WOS:000410676300122

Hydrogeochemical analysis and evaluation of surface water quality of Pratapgarh district, Uttar Pradesh, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The hydrogeochemical study of surface water in Pratapgarh district has been carried out to assess the major ion chemistry and water quality for drinking and domestic purposes. For this purpose, twenty-five surface water samples were collected from river, ponds and canals and analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, hardness, major cations (Ca2+, Mg (2+), Na+ and K+), major anions (HCO3-, F-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-) and dissolved silica concentration. The analytical results show mildly acidic to alkaline nature of surface water resources of Pratapgarh district. HCO3- and Cl- are the dominant anions, while cation chemistry is dominated by Na+ and Ca2+. The statistical analysis and data plotted on the Piper diagram reveals that the surface water chemistry is mainly controlled by rock weathering with secondary contributions from agriculture and anthropogenic sources. Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3-, Ca2+-Mg (2+)-Cl and Na+-HCO3--Cl -are the dominant hydrogeochemical facies in the surface water of the area. For quality assessment, values of analysed parameters were compared with Indian and WHO water quality standards, which shows that the concentrations of TDS, F -, NO3-, Na+, Mg2+ and total hardness are exceeding the desirable limits in some water samples. Water Quality Index (WQI) is one of the most effective tools to communicate information on the quality of any water body. The computed WQI values of Pratapgarh district surface water range from 28 to 198 with an average value of 82, and more than half of the study area is under excellent to good category.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1609	1623		10.1007/s13201-015-0313-z								WOS:000411095500004

Microbiological assessment of drinking water emphasizes estimation of the hygienic quality of the water sold with reference to community health significance. This study was conducted to evaluate the quality of drinking water sold by roadside vendors in east, west, north and south zones of capital of India. A total number of 36 samples (nine from each zone) were collected as per national guidelines and studied for microbiological assessment. All the drinking water samples were collected in gamma-sterilized bottles and were kept in an ice pack to prevent any significant change in the microbial flora of the samples during the transportation. The water samples were transported to the laboratory in vertical position maintaining the temperature 1-4 degrees C with ice pack enveloped conditions. Samples were analyzed for total MPN coliform per 100 ml and for the presence and absence of common human pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All the samples were found to be contaminated with coliform organisms in the range of 14 to[ 1600 per 100 ml of sample. Out of 36 water samples, the occurrence of E. coli was 61 %, Salmonella 25 % S. aureus 14 % and P. aeruginosa 53 % as 22, 9, 5 and 19 samples were found contaminated, respectively. The numbers of coliform bacteria and presence of some common pathogenic bacteria suggested that the quality of drinking water sold by roadside vendors is not within the Indian standard and WHO guidelines laid down for drinking water quality. Hence, there is a vital need to study the root cause in terms of hygiene, sanitation of vendors and source of contamination to prevent waterborne diseases.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1635	1644		10.1007/s13201-015-0315-x								WOS:000411095500006

The analytical results exhibited abundance of major cations and anions in Na+ > Ca2+ >Mg2+> K+ and Cl- > HCO3- >SO42- sequence. Stiff diagram showed dug well sample have high Na-Cl and moderate Mg-SO4 content as compared to tube well samples. Majority of dug well samples appeared as Na-Cl type on Piper diagram while tube well samples are mixed type. Gibbs diagram reflected evaporation as a dominant phenomenon in dug well; however, tube well samples are declined toward rock dominance. Process of ion exchange was witnessed from Na+ versus Cl -and Ca2+ Mg2+ versus HCO3- + SO42- plots. Principal component analysis also discriminates dug well and tube well water by means of positive and negative loading based on physical and chemical composition of the groundwater. Studied and computed parameters like pH, EC, TDS, TH, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, sodium adsorption ratio, magnesium adsorption ratio, potential salinity, residual sodium carbonate, Na%, Kelly's ratio, and permeability index were compared with WHO to evaluate studied water for drinking and agricultural purposes. Except Na+ and K+, all chemical constrains are within the allowed limits, set by WHO for drinking water. Similarly, most of the groundwater is moderately suitable for irrigation uses, with few exceptions.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1645	1655		10.1007/s13201-015-0316-9								WOS:000411095500007

The results are compared using multiple linear regression (MLR). Recorded data are available at a gauging site in Antakya, Turkey, for the period from 1984 to 2008. Comparing the modeled values by ANNs with the experimental data indicates that neural network model with seven neurons in hidden layer provides accurate results (R-2 = 0.968, RMSE = 46.927 mu S/cm, MAE = 32.462 mu S/cm and MRSE = 0.0029 for the training data and R-2 = 0.965, RMSE = 50.810 mu S/cm, MAE = 37.495 mu S/cm and MRSE = 0.0024 for the testing data). The Garson method of the connection weights of the network was used to study the relative % contribution of each of the input variables. It was found that the sum of calcium and magnesium concentration and temperature had the most effect on the predicted EC. The results indicate that two proposed models were able to approximate the EC parameter reasonably well; however, the ANN was found to perform better than the MLR model.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1761	1772		10.1007/s13201-015-0349-0								WOS:000411095500016						
J	Wassie, TA; Melese, AW				Wassie, Tilahun Adugna; Melese, Ayalew Wondie			Impact of physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton compositions and abundances in Selameko Manmade Reservoir, Debre Tabor, South Gondar, Ethiopia	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Impact of physicochemical parameters on phytoplankton compositions and abundances in Selameko Reservoir, Debre Tabor, South Gondar from August 2009 to May 2010 was assessed. Water quality parameters, such as temperature, water transparency, water depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, total dissolved solids, phosphate, nitrate, and silicate were measured in situ from two sites (littoral and open water zone) of the reservoir. Phytoplankton compositions and abundances were analyzed in Tana fisheries and other aquatic organisms' research center. ANOVA result of the physicochemical parameters included chlorophyll-a showed the presence of significance difference among seasons and between sites (P < 0.05). A total of seven families, 36 genera from three groups (Diatom, Blue green algae and Green algae) of phytoplankton were identified during the study period. From all groups, diatoms were the most abundant at both sites and Blue green algae were the least abundant. ANOVA of all phytoplankton showed highly significant difference among seasons and between sites (P < 0.05). ANOVA of all phytoplankton showed highly significant difference among seasons and between sites (P < 0.05). Based on the stepwise regression, a total number of phytoplanktons had positive correlation with some of the physicochemical parameters (R2 = 0.99, P < 0.001, N = 16). The study concluded that some of physicochemical parameters (NO3-N and PO4-P) indicated the presence of reservoir water pollution. This is supported by the presence of pollution-resistant phytoplankton species such as Melosira and Microcystis. The reservoir water was eutrophic (productive) throughout the year. To avoid such pollution, basin and reservoir management are recommended.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1791	1798		10.1007/s13201-015-0352-5								WOS:000411095500019						
J	Zhang, SP; Xin, XK				Zhang, Shou-ping; Xin, Xiao-kang			Pollutant source identification model for water pollution incidents in small straight rivers based on genetic algorithm	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Identification of pollutant sources for river pollution incidents is an important and difficult task in the emergency rescue, and an intelligent optimization method can effectively compensate for the weakness of traditional methods. An intelligent model for pollutant source identification has been established using the basic genetic algorithm (BGA) as an optimization search tool and applying an analytic solution formula of one-dimensional unsteady water quality equation to construct the objective function. Experimental tests show that the identification model is effective and efficient: the model can accurately figure out the pollutant amounts or positions no matter single pollution source or multiple sources. Especially when the population size of BGA is set as 10, the computing results are sound agree with analytic results for a single source amount and position identification, the relative errors are no more than 5 %. For cases of multi-point sources and multi-variable, there are some errors in computing results for the reasons that there exist many possible combinations of the pollution sources. But, with the help of previous experience to narrow the search scope, the relative errors of the identification results are less than 5 %, which proves the established source identification model can be used to direct emergency responses.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					1955	1963		10.1007/s13201-015-0374-z								WOS:000411095500034

Then evaluate the impact of these changes in the concentration of enteroviruses (EVs) in waters. The sewage samples were collected at nine sampling points along the channel, which flows, into a tropical lagoon in Yopougon. Physical-chemical parameters (5-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Suspended Particulate Matter, Total Phosphorus, Orthophosphate, Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen and Nitrate) as well as the concentration of EV in these waters were determined. The average numbers of EV isolated from the outlet of the channel were 9.06 x 10(4) PFU 100 ml(-1). Consequently, EV was present in 55.55 and 33.33 % of the samples in the 2 brackish lagoon collection sites. The effect of rainfall on viral load at the both sewage and brackish lagoon environments is significant correlate (two-way ANOVA, P < 0.05). Furthermore, in lagoon environment, nutrients (Orthophosphate, Total Phosphorus), 5-day Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand and Suspended Particulate Matter were significant correlated with EVs loads (P < 0.05 by Pearson test). The overall results highlight the problem of sewage discharge into the lagoon and correlation between viral loads and water quality parameters in sewage and lagoon.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUL	2017	7	4					2075	2087		10.1007/s13201-061-0388-1								WOS:000411095500045						
J	De, P; Majumder, M				De, Paulami; Majumder, Mrinmoy			Monitoring water input quality: early screening and system support through the application of an adapted multiple criteria decision making method	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The WHO estimates that, on average, dehydration caused by water borne illnesses claims up to 1.5 million lives a year, with a disproportionate number of casualties located in developing nations. In order to mitigate risks to public health, previous studies have helped to gain extensive insights and create management techniques to ensure that water quality standards are maintained. The present study will investigate a relatively neglected field, which is the need for the prioritization of monitoring the quality of a water treatment plant's inflow, which may vary significantly in quantity and quality throughout the day. The technique proposed for this investigation is a novel application of the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) method, adapted particularly for the purposes of decision making for optimal scenarios, called the multi variable temporal decision making method for the selection of optimal solutions (MVTDMSOS). By cascading self-selecting neural network algorithms, which are implicit in such systems, this method is designed to eliminate human bias and aims to identify the priority parameters based on optimal, rather than normal, scenarios. The introduction of polynomial neural networks ensures adaptability and alacrity of the modeling framework. Test results encourage further application of the proposed technique.

Assessing the degree of water belonging to a set class of quality	JOURNAL OF WATER CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY												The article has investigated the function of water belonging to the set class of quality by established indicators of the composition and properties. It has been shown that the employment of the mathematical apparatus of the tolerance measuring control allows using Taguchi and Harrington functions to assess the degree of the sought-for belonging both within the boundaries of the allowable interval and outside it, thereby increasing the informational content of control and monitoring. A special attention is given to problems of assessing the function of belonging in classification of waters having indefiniteness zones between classes. The proposed methods are used in treatment of real statistical data characterizing water quality. Algorithms of treatment are methodological recommendations facilitating the employment of the developed approach for solving practical problems assessing the composition and properties of water with the aim of water use.																	1063-455X	1934-936X				JUL	2017	39	4					191	196		10.3103/S1063455X17040026								WOS:000409940000002

Temporal and spatial variability in macroinvertebrate community structure in relation to environmental variables in Gbako River, Niger State, Nigeria	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Temporal and spatial variability in macroinvertebrate community structure in relation to environmental variables in Gbako River, Niger State, Nigeria was evaluated monthly for a period of six months using modified kick sampling techniques. Four study stations were selected along the river course (upper reaches of less human impacts through mid-reaches with relative high human impacts to lower reaches of less human impacts), designated as stations 1, 2, 3, and 4. High concentrations of dissolved oxygen, lower nutrient and BOD levels were recorded in stations 1 and 4 while lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen, higher nutrient, conductivity levels, and BOD levels were recorded in stations 2 and 3. There was an abundance of the pollution sensitive taxa such as Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Coleopteran (Gyrinus spp., Dytiscus spp.) and Anisoptera (Gomphus sp., Lestinogomphus, Cordulex spp.) in all the stations, especially the upper and lower reaches, whereas on the other hand, some pollution tolerant species like the Crustaceas, Dipterans, Mollusca (Neritina rubricate, Potadoma sp.) were merely restricted to the middle reaches (stations 2 and 3). Of the total number of individual benthic invertebrates recorded during the entire study, 53% was recorded in the dry season while the remaining 47% was recorded in the wet season. However, this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05) when the student t-test (t(stat/cal) = 0.388), t(crit) = 2.447) for the densities and abundances of macroinvertebrates recorded during the two sampling seasons was applied. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) separated the less impacted from the more impacted sites and also showed that the invertebrate fauna was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with environmental factors of Gbako River. The CCA identified conductivity, depth, flow velocity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, and phosphates as important variables structuring the macroinvertebrate assemblages. The higher number of benthic invertebrates recorded in the dry season could be attributed to the unstable nature of the substrates through inputs and influx of storm water during the rainy season months.																	0564-3295					JUL	2017	58	2					229	240										WOS:000409434700002

Measuring Flow Rate in Crystalline Bedrock Wells Using the Dissolved Oxygen Alteration Method	GROUNDWATER												Determination of vertical flow rates in a fractured bedrock well can aid in planning and implementing hydraulic tests, water quality sampling, and improving interpretations of water quality data. Although flowmeters are highly accurate in flow rate measurement, the high cost and logistics may be limiting. In this study the dissolved oxygen alteration method (DOAM) is expanded upon as a low-cost alternative to determine vertical flow rates in crystalline bedrock wells. The method entails altering the dissolved oxygen content in the wellbore through bubbler aeration, and monitoring the vertical advective movement of the dissolved oxygen over time. Measurements were taken for upward and downward flows, and under ambient and pumping conditions. Vertical flow rates from 0.06 to 2.30 Lpm were measured. To validate the method, flow rates determined with the DOAM were compared to pump discharge rates and found to be in agreement within 2.5%.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				JUL-AUG	2017	55	4					588	592		10.1111/gwat.12512								WOS:000408992800014	28329412

Ehsan			Stakeholder engagement in multi-objective optimization of water quality monitoring network, case study: Karkheh Dam reservoir	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Reservoir water quality is important for water quality management downstream. A hierarchical approach is developed to present the monitoring locations within a format that satisfies the objectives of social stakeholders for making final decisions. First, a CE-QUAL-W2 model is applied to simulate water quality variables in the reservoir for a long time using a set of historic data. Second, transinformation entropy theory is used to quantify mutual information among a set of monitoring stations for each water quality variable. Then, a non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm-based model is developed for multi-objective optimization of the water quality monitoring network. Finally, a social choice method is applied to the identified non-dominated solutions to achieve a strategy that is compromised among stakeholders. The variations of the water quality variables at different depths and different seasons are investigated. The proposed approach is illustrated for Karkheh Reservoir in Iran. The number of optimized monitoring stations is the same for all seasons (three out of 22 potential stations) using different social choice methods. The results show the appropriate performance of the proposed methodology for optimization of reservoir water quality monitoring stations.																	1606-9749					JUL	2017	17	4					966	974		10.2166/ws.2016.196								WOS:000408713700007

Land cover models to predict non-point nutrient inputs for selected biomes in South Africa	WATER SA												WQSAM is a practical water quality model for use in guiding southern African water quality management. However, the estimation of non-point nutrient inputs within WQSAM is uncertain, as it is achieved through a combination of calibration and expert knowledge. Non-point source loads can be correlated to particular land cover types. Although observed water quality data through which non-point source loads can be estimated are scarce, land cover databases exist covering the entire area of South Africa. To reduce the uncertainty associated with estimating non-point source loads, this study describes a formal model to link the nutrient signatures of incremental flow to land cover. Study catchments incorporating the fynbos, grassland, savanna and thicket biomes were identified. Instream nutrients of 25 sites were modelled using WQSAM and calibrated against observed data. Multiple regression was used to investigate the relationships between the calibrated nutrient signatures of incremental flow from WQSAM and land cover within study sites. The regression models reflected greater non-point loads from cultivation- and urban-related land cover categories. The nutrient signatures of incremental flow obtained through the multiple regressions were consistent with those obtained through calibration of the WQSAM model at higher signature values, whereas discrepancies were evident at lower values. It is argued that this formal modelling approach for linking land cover to nutrient signatures of incremental flow can be implemented for situations where it is known that there are strong non-point inputs of nutrients into a river reach. The statistical model presented in the current study could potentially be applied as an alternative to the water quality model as a relatively simple method to estimate non-point source loads of nutrients from tributary catchments in South Africa.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				JUL	2017	43	3					499	508		10.4314/wsa.v43i3.15								WOS:000408430900015

SEASONAL PROGRESSION OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS IN A TEMPORARY WETLAND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Seasonal wetlands are important habitats for biodiversity of both invertebrate and vertebrate fauna. Many aquatic species have life history traits adapted to colonizing and developing in temporary aquatic habitats, and these traits influence the annual succession of the macroinvertebrate community. The chronology of taxon appearance and the variation in relative abundances during the hydroperiod are important for understanding population dynamics, trophic interactions, and responses to drought. This study investigated the successional changes in macroinvertebrate abundances in a seasonal wetland in northern California. Water quality parameters were measured regularly, including dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, surface area, and specific conductance during the wet season (January-July) in 2007-2009. Macroinvertebrates were collected with net sweeps (mesh > 500 mu m), and the presence of life stages of amphibians were visually observed from March to June each year. As the hydroperiod progressed, wetland surface area decreased, while water temperature and specific conductance increased. Macroinvertebrate abundance increased with the progression of the hydroperiod, and the richness of macroinvertebrate predator taxa tripled from 2 families in March to 6 families in June. The earliest part of the hydroperiod in the wetland was dominated by Cyzicus clam shrimp and Linderiella occidentalis fairy shrimp. Limnephilus caddisfly larvae were few in number but were found exclusively in the early season. Sequential changes of dominant invertebrate taxa and relative abundances of macroinvertebrates were evident, particularly among several macroinvertebrate predators. Among these predators, the early-season community was dominated by larval dytiscid beetles, while later-season communities demonstrated increased predator richness (e.g., Notonecta backswimmers) and were dominated by Lestes damselflies. Larvae of the vertebrate predator Taricha torosa, which may act as a top predator, were present during the later stages of the hydroperiod. The phenology of individual aquatic taxa and their specific life history strategies may impact the sensitivity of macroinvertebrate populations to increased annual variation in hydroperiod that may result from climate changes in this region.																	1527-0904	1944-8341				JUL	2017	77	2					176	188		10.3398/064.077.0205								WOS:000408018500004

The most probable number of E. coli in the water was quantified for supply site, effluent and at each stage of treatment (sedimentation and use of each type of aquatic macrophyte). We conclude that E. coli contamination in water supply and in fishpond can reach the environment through the effluent. The proposed treatment system was efficient in removing E. coli from the water, and when the system was stabilized the average removal efficiency of E. coli was 95%. The tank containing E. crassipes showed the highest removal average, even though it exhibited an efficiency reduction after 60 days of experiment. The average removal of the tanks containing C. demersum and T. domingensis was hampered due to the presence of E. coli in soil used as substrate. However, after the decrease of substrate contamination effect, these two plants were essential for the maintenance of water quality of the treated effluent, indicating the benefits of aquatic macrophytes diversity in treatment systems. The effluent quality was maintained even when some system steps presented a decrease of removal efficiency.

Reginaldo creek bay in Maceio, Alagoas, has great spatial variation in the patterns of basic sanitation providing and, thus, great variation in environmental health indicators which impact in the incidence of waterborne diseases. This study aims to correlate the occurrence and incidence of waterborne diseases with the Environmental Health Index (ISA). The ISA index used is based on the occurrence, magnitude and extent of flooding and on the quality and scope of the provision of water supply, sanitation services and solid waste collection. Results indicate a relationship between ISA and the incidence of specific diseases (related to a particular ISA component), but they also show that results are substantially affected by spatial resolution of data and the methodology for obtaining primary indicators. It was also observed that the method to obtain and classify spatial data is crucial to identify the relations between each sanitation component and the incidence of a specific disease, as well as their spatial extent. Within the area studied, most diagnosis are attributed to dengue, hepatitis and leptospirosis, especially dengue over the others. Results were mapped in the studied area by census tract.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					699	709		10.1590/S1413-41522017146971								WOS:000408263500011

This region has the potential to contaminate water resources as a result of urbanization, deforestation and the application of fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural activities. The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of irrigation on surface water quality in the region, using secondary monitoring. Nine monitoring stations were selected in the region, which represent the diferente uses and occupation of land. The cluster analysis and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by multiple comparisons, were used to comparatively evaluate the sampling stations and to identify which parameters showed different behavior among these stations. Although it was not possible to observe a pattern of contamination due to the location of the stations, it was found that the stations located along the Sao Francisco river showed no significant differences, although the use and occupation of land were different. The temporal trend of the constituents was verified by applying the test of the hypothesis of stationarity Spearmant, which found that most of the data analyzed were not stationary, with a tendency of increase or decrease over the analysis period. After the application of these statistical tests, it was concluded that, in general, the implementation of irrigated perimeters caused low impact in water quality in the region, in the period studied, considering the parameters analyzed in this study.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					711	721		10.1590/S1413-41522017136784								WOS:000408263500013

Thirty six samples of surface water were collected from three oyster cultivation areas, totalizing 12 collections. The concentrations of total and thermotolerant coliforms were determined using the multiple tube test Most Probable Number (MPN.100 mL(-1)). The environmental variables assessed in the water samples were: pH, temperature, salinity, turbidity, rainfall and tidal. Total coliforms and thermotolerant coliforms MPN values ranged from <1.8 to 1,600 MPN.100 mL(-1) and from <1.8 to 350 MPN.100 mL(-1), respectively. The oyster cultivation areas presented good microbiological quality of surface water. The influence of environmental factors on microbial density was obtained as a positive correlation with rainfall and negative correlation with temperature and turbidity. Considering the data from this study, there was an increase of the population of coliforms in the rainy season and spring tide. Thus, it is necessary to carry out microbiological and environmental monitoring of water intended for aquaculture because it promotes safe and sustainable production of oyster, since the quality parameters can suffer weather influences and seasonal variations.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					723	729		10.1590/S1413-41522016153707								WOS:000408263500012

This study aimed to assess the impact of the sewage treatment plant Piraja (STP-Piraja) effluent discharge on the quality of the Parnaiba river. Field sampling and laboratory analyzes were carried out for a period of 12 months in the treatment system for stabilization ponds and monitoring points upstream and downstream of effluent inputs. The efficiency of the sewage treatment showed typical values for system stabilization ponds, and met the quality requirements for effluent discharge. The dilution capacity of the Parnaiba river was compatible to the polluting loads of effluent from the STP-Piraja. The Water Quality Index (WQI) ranged from good to regular in the studied area; and diffuse pollution proved to be the main threat in the river water quality. Escherichia coli values exceeded the limits of the quality requirements in almost all the monitoring period, even upstream of the effluent discharge point.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					761	772		10.1590/S1413-41522017148242								WOS:000408263500016

Assessing the Effects of Climate Change on Water Quantity and Quality in an Urban Watershed Using a Calibrated Stormwater Model	WATER												Assessing climate change (CC) impacts on urban watersheds is difficult due to differences in model spatial and temporal scales, making prediction of hydrologic restoration a challenge. A methodology was developed using an autocalibration tool to calibrate a previously developed Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) of Difficult Run in Fairfax, Virginia. Calibration was assisted by use of multi-objective optimization. Results showed a good agreement between simulated and observed data. Simulations of CC for the 2041-2068 period were developed using dynamically downscaled North American Regional CC Assessment Program models. Washoff loads were used to simulate water quality, and a method was developed to estimate treatment performed in stormwater control measures (SCMs) to assess water quality impacts from CC. CC simulations indicated that annual runoff volume would increase by 6.5%, while total suspended solids, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus would increase by 7.6%, 7.1%, and 8.1%, respectively. The simulations also indicated that within season variability would increase by a larger percentage. Treatment practices (e.g., bioswale) that were intended to mitigate the negative effects of urban development will need to deal with additional runoff volumes and nutrient loads from CC to achieve the required water quality goals.

Stress and Welfare of African Catfish (Clarias gariepinus Burchell, 1822) in a Coupled Aquaponic System	WATER												African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) were investigated for physiological stress parameters to assess the influence of different cultivation techniques on fish welfare. The fish were reared in two conceptually identical recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) constructed in a greenhouse. One system was combined with a floating raft hydroponic unit to culture cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) only using the process water. The second system remained without the plant cultivation unit and functioned as the control. Water quality was monitored regularly by measuring dissolved nutrients and physical water parameters. During 87 days, a total of 71 fish from each system (n = 142) were studied, with a final sampling of all fish (n = 107) at the end of the experiment. Blood from the caudal vein was analyzed for the stress hormone cortisol and the glucose concentration. In addition, fish were investigated for external injuries on their skin, fins and barbels. The results demonstrate that the system design had no influence on fish mortalities and growth rates. Furthermore, cortisol and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two systems. However, the number of external injuries was significantly lower in the aquaponics, providing evidence that co-cultivation of fish and plants might offer benefits to the welfare of the fish.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							504	10.3390/w9070504								WOS:000406681700055						
J	Beggel, S; Hinzmann, M; Machado, J; Geist, J				Beggel, Sebastian; Hinzmann, Mariana; Machado, Jorge; Geist, Juergen			Combined Impact of Acute Exposure to Ammonia and Temperature Stress on the Freshwater Mussel Unio pictorum	WATER												Nitrogen compounds, particularly ammonia, and temperature are suspected major stressors for aquatic organisms, but little is known about their impact on globally declining freshwater mussels (Unionoida). In this study, we tested the combined effects of ammonia and temperature stress on painter's mussel (Unio pictorum) survival, filtration behavior, hemocyte abundance, hemocyte mortality and glycogen energy status, at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 9.0 mg.L-1 total ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) in 96 h acute exposures at two temperatures, 17 degrees C and 25 degrees C and a pH of 8.8. The results indicate a low sensitivity of U. pictorum to elevated ammonia concentrations after short-term exposure, although effects on cell morphology were evident and delayed mortality occurred at the highest test concentration. Most pronounced effects were observed for sublethal physiological endpoints due to elevated temperature, but no synergistic effects with ammonia were evident. Temperature increase resulted in significant effects on tissue glycogen, hyalinocyte mortality and clearance rates. Hemocyte mortalities showed a linear dependency on initial mussel activity as measured by their clearance rate. Since the main stressors tested in this study, ammonia and temperature, are predicted to increase in most freshwater ecosystems, their impact on other freshwater mussel species including different life-stages should be comprehensively assessed.

Alan; Donald, Wesley; Zech, Wesley; Perez, Michael			Performance Evaluations of Three Silt Fence Practices Using a Full-Scale Testing Apparatus	WATER												Erosion and sediment controls on construction sites minimize environmental impacts from sediment-laden stormwater runoff. Silt fence, a widely specified perimeter control practice on construction projects used to retain sediment on-site, has limited performance-based testing data. Silt fence failures and resultant sediment losses are often the result of structural failure. To better understand silt fence performance, researchers at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Testing Facility (AU-ESCTF) have evaluated three silt fence options to determine possible shortcomings using standardized full-scale testing methods. These methods subject silt fence practices to simulated, in-field conditions typically experienced on-site without the variability of field testing or the limited application of small-scale testing. Three different silt fence practices were tested to evaluate performance, which included: (1) Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) Trenched Silt Fence, (2) ALDOT Sliced Silt Fence, and (3) Alabama Soil and Water Conservation Committee (AL-SWCC) Trenched Silt Fence. This study indicates that the structural performance of a silt fence perimeter control is the most important performance factor in retaining sediment. The sediment retention performance of these silt fence practices was 82.7%, 66.9% and 90.5%, respectively. When exposed to large impoundment conditions, both ALDOT Trench and Sliced Silt Fence practices failed structurally, while the AL-SWCC Trenched Silt Fence did not experience structural failure.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							502	10.3390/w9070502								WOS:000406681700053

In this study, spatial variations in water chemistry were investigated in 57 samples collected from three subtropical peatlands (central China). Generally, water pH and major cation concentrations of these samples approached the characteristics of poor fens along the bog-rich fen gradient. Four distinct groups were identified by cluster analysis and principal component analysis. High concentrations of trace elements in Group I were probably linked to airborne dust pollutants from a nearby road under construction. Low pH values and low major cation concentrations in Group II may be attributed to the great cation exchange capacity of Sphagnum. In contrast, samples in Group III, mainly collected from sites suffering from Sphagnum harvest, showed high pH levels and major cation concentrations. Relatively low concentrations of trace elements (except boron) in Group IV can be regarded as reference conditions for restoration efforts in these peatlands. Taken together, spatial variations in the water chemistry of the three peatlands were closely linked to natural processes (e.g., cation exchange of Sphagnum) and anthropogenic pressures (e.g., Sphagnum harvest). Overall, the mean health risk values of the six trace elements were low, indicating good water quality in these peatlands. This study provided baseline water chemistry information for the sustainable management of these subtropical peatlands, as well as other similar ecosystems.

J	Chow, MF; Huang, JC; Shiah, FK				Chow, Ming Fai; Huang, Jr-Chuan; Shiah, Fuh-Kwo			Phosphorus Dynamics along River Continuum during Typhoon Storm Events	WATER												Information on riverine phosphorus (P) dynamics during typhoon storm events remains scarce in subtropical regions. Thus, this study investigates the spatial and temporal dynamics of riverine phosphorus in a headwater catchment during three typhoon events. Continuous sampling (3 h intervals) of stormwater samples and discharge data were conducted at five locations, which represent the upstream, transitional zone, and downstream areas of the main inflow river. The results revealed that the average event mean concentrations (EMCs) for total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and particulate phosphorus (PP) in the upstream catchment of Fei-Tsui reservoir were 15.66 mu g/L and 11.94 mu g/L, respectively. There was at least a 1.3-fold increase in flow-weighted concentrations of TDP and PP from the upper to lower reaches of the main stream. PP and TDP were transported either in clockwise or anticlockwise directions, depending on storm intensity and source. The transport of TDP was primarily regulated by the subsurface flow during the storm event. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) contributes more than 50% of the TDP load in moderate storms, while extreme storms supply a greater dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) load into the stream. TDP accounted for approximately 50% of TP load during typhoon storms. Mobilization of all P forms was observed from upstream to downstream of the river, except for DOP. A decrease of DOP load on passing downstream may reflect the change in phosphorus form along the river continuum. Peak discharge and antecedent dry days are correlated positively with P fluxes, indicating that river bank erosion and re-suspension of within-channel sediment are the dominant pathways of P during typhoon storm periods.

J	Ciosek, AL; Luk, GK				Ciosek, Amanda L.; Luk, Grace K.			Kinetic Modelling of the Removal of Multiple Heavy Metallic Ions from Mine Waste by Natural Zeolite Sorption	WATER												This study investigates the sorption of heavy metallic ions (HMIs), specifically lead (Pb2+), copper (Cu2+), iron (Fe3+), nickel (Ni2+) and zinc (Zn2+), by natural zeolite (clinoptilolite). These HMIs are combined in single-, dual-, triple-, and multi-component systems. The batch mode experiments consist of a total initial concentration of 10 meq/L normality for all systems, acidified to a pH of 2 by concentrated nitric (HNO3) acid. A zeolite dosage of 4 g per 100 mL of synthetic nitrate salt aqueous solution is applied, for a contact period of 5 to 180 min. Existing kinetic models on HMIs sorption are limited for multi-component system combinations. Therefore, this study conducts kinetic analysis by both reaction and diffusion models, to quantify the sorption process. The study concludes that the process correlates best with the pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic model. In the multi-component system combining all five HMIs, the initial sorption rate and theoretical equilibrium capacity are determined as 0.0033 meq/g.min and 0.1159 meq/g, respectively. This provides significant insight into the mechanisms associated with the sorption process, as well as contributing to the assessment of natural zeolite as a sorbent material in its application in industrial wastewater treatment.

Under the Clean Water Act (2006), thirty-six regional Conservation Authorities were mandated to develop watershed-based SWP plans under 19 Source Protection Regions. Most First Nations in Ontario are outside of these Source Protection Regions and reserve lands are under Federal jurisdiction. This paper explores how First Nations in Ontario are attempting to address SWP to improve drinking water quality in their communities even though these communities are not part of the Ontario SWP framework. The case studies highlight the gap between the regulatory requirements of the Federal and Provincial governments and the challenges for First Nations in Ontario from lack of funding to implement solutions to address the threats identified in SWP planning. This analysis of different approaches taken by Ontario First Nations shows that the Ontario framework for SWP planning is not an option for the majority of First Nations communities, and does not adequately address threats originating on reserve lands. First Nations attempting to address on-reserve threats to drinking water are using a variety of resources and approaches to develop community SWP plans. However, a common theme of all the cases surveyed is a lack of funding to support implementing solutions for the threats identified by the SWP planning process. Federal government initiatives to address the chronic problem of boil water advisories within Indigenous communities do not recognize SWP planning as a cost-effective tool for improving drinking water quality.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							550	10.3390/w9070550								WOS:000406681700101						
J	Ding, XW; Zhang, JJ; Jiang, GH; Zhang, SH				Ding, Xiaowen; Zhang, Jianjie; Jiang, Guihong; Zhang, Shanghong			Early Warning and Forecasting System of Water Quality Safety for Drinking Water Source Areas in Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China	WATER												Nowadays, the effects of water pollution accidents on water quality safety and regional residents' living have attracted worldwide attention. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose an early warning and forecasting model and develop a visual system of water quality safety for drinking water source areas in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area under accident conditions. Based on an Instantaneous Point Source Two-dimensional Water Quality Model and the security requirements of water quality, an early warning and forecasting model was presented, and then the system was advanced by a MATLAB platform. In addition, a hypothetical case was also carried out for the Fenghuangshan drinking water source area. Within 0.040 h to 0.096 h after the accident, the water quality could meet the standard, and the warning level was primary and intermediate, sequentially. From 0.096 h to 11.960 h after the accident, the pollutant concentration exceeded the standard, under which conditions advanced warning started. Then the intermediate and primary warnings restarted in sequence until the pollutant concentration decreased to the background value. Therefore, the proposed model could accurately predict the spatial-temporal change trend of pollutant concentration, and the developed system could efficiently realize early warnings and the forecasting of water quality safety.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							465	10.3390/w9070465								WOS:000406681700016

Methods: The study used hierarchical satellite-, helicopter-, and drone-acquired thermal imagery of coastal plumes ranging from 3 to 300 m, near Naples, Italy, and captured temporally-and spatially-overlapping in situ samples to correlate thermal and water quality parameters in each plume and the seawater. Results: In situ sampling determined that between-plume salinity varied by 37%, chlorophyll-a varied by 356%, dissolved oxygen varied by 81%, and turbidity varied by 232%. The radiometric temperature, T-rad, for the plume area of interest had a correlation of 0.81 with salinity, 0.74 with chlorophyll-a, 0.98 with dissolved oxygen, and -0.61 with turbidity. Conclusion: This study established hierarchical use of remote and proximal thermal imagery can provide monitoring of complex coastal areas.

One urban river which suffers DO depression under low flow conditions and requires systematic research for effective mitigation strategies is the Nanfei River (Hefei, China). We investigated its longitudinal profiles of DO and other related water constituents with high spatial resolution monitoring at low flow. A mechanistic DO model for the reach was customized and calibrated with the data obtained. We found that the daily average DO levels within the 11 km study reach shifted from supersaturation(11.5 mg L-1) upstream of the Wangtang Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) to serious depletion (3.6 mg L-1) downstream. Process analysis indicated that DO production via strong algal photosynthesis overwhelmed the DO consumptions upstream from the WWTP. In contrast, DO sources could not compensate for DO consumptions, wherein carbonaceous deoxygenation was the largest consumer of the DO (approximately 70%) downstream the WWTP. Rather than directly contributing labile organics, the WWTP effluent affected the DO balance by shifting the metabolism from upstream autotrophy to downstream heterotrophy. Finally, mitigation strategies for DO depression in rivers in rapidly-urbanizing regions were suggested accordingly.

Viral diversity was detected using omics-based approaches. Log reduction values (LRV) of Adenoviruses (AdV) and Enteroviruses (EV) were enumerated using digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) and assessed for infectivity using fluorescence-based infection assays. MBR treatment was successful in reducing viral diversity. Plant viruses remained abundant in the treated effluent. Human enteric viruses were present in lower abundance than plant viruses, and were reduced by MBR at varying LRV. AdV copy numbers were reduced by 3.7-log. Infectious AdV was not detected in the effluent. EV copy numbers were reduced by 1.7-log post MBR and infectious EV decreased by an average of 2.0-log. Infectious EV was detected in the chlorinated effluent, occasionally in concentrations that approximate to its 50% infectious dose. Overall, results indicated that a MBR-based wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effectively reduces viral diversity, viral load, and infectious capacity by up to 4-logs. These findings suggest potential concerns associated with plant and human enteric viruses for reuse events in this country. Local guidelines for assessment of treated water quality should take into consideration both infectious viral concentration and LRV.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							534	10.3390/w9070534								WOS:000406681700085

During this service life, external factors, such as changes in the effluent standards or the loading of the WWTP may change, requiring WWTP performance to be optimized. WWTP modelling is widely accepted as a means to assess and optimize WWTP performance. One of the challenges for WWTP modelling remains the prediction of water quality at the inlet of a WWTP. Recent applications of water quality sensors have resulted in long time series of WWTP influent quality, containing valuable information on the response of influent quality to e.g., storm events. This allows the development of empirical models to predict influent quality. This paper proposes a new approach for water quality modelling, which uses the measured hydraulic dynamics of the WWTP influent to derive the influent water quality. The model can also be based on simulated influent hydraulics as input. Possible applications of the model are filling gaps in time series used as input for WWTP models or to assess the impact of measures such as real time control (RTC) on the performance of wastewater systems.

Additionally, accurate statistics are not reported without regular water quality tests, so safety measures alone are insufficient to improve water quality. In this situation, the Korean government is responsible for verifying the quality of groundwater and identifying the cause of groundwater contamination in areas with no municipal water supply. The National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER) under the Ministry of Environment of Korea, conducted the 'Safe Groundwater Supply Project (SGSP)' between 2012 and 2016 to secure groundwater quality stability in areas without the benefit of municipal water. This survey identified groundwater quality using a detailed water quality survey and gave recommendations for supplying safe groundwater and providing future improvements and countermeasures in cases of groundwater pollution. This paper presents the SGSP and consists of water quality analysis, the exploration and exploitation of drinking water facilities, the selection of a pilot project area among high-pollution areas, and improvement measures for water quality in the pilot project area.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							508	10.3390/w9070508								WOS:000406681700059

WATER												In South Korea, the Soyang Lake is an important source of drinking water to the metropolitan areas including Seoul. However, water quality problems in the Soyang Lake have still remained due to chemical contaminations attributed to conventional farming practices in the upstream areas. Based on a downstream consumer survey using a contingent valuation method, this study estimated the expected willingness to pays (WTPs) for water quality improvement through the conversion to environmentally friendly farming (EFF). The results showed that the estimated annual mean WTP is KRW 36,115 per household. The aggregated WTPs of downstream respondents in the Soyang Lake are sufficient to compensate for the income losses of upstream EFF farmers in highland farming areas. In addition, we found that the downstream citizens who recognize the label for EFF products and who intend to purchase EFF products in the future have a significant impact on WTPs for water quality improvement.

J	Li, X; Sha, J; Wang, ZL				Li, Xue; Sha, Jian; Wang, Zhong-Liang			Chlorophyll-A Prediction of Lakes with Different Water Quality Patterns in China Based on Hybrid Neural Networks	WATER												One of the most important water quality problems affecting lakes and reservoirs is eutrophication, which is caused by multiple physical and chemical factors. As a representative index of eutrophication, the concentration of chlorophyll-a has always been a key indicator monitored by environmental managers. The most influential factors on chlorophyll-a may be dependent on the different water quality patterns in lakes. In this study, data collected from 27 lakes in different provinces of China during 2009-2011 were analyzed. The self-organizing map (SOM) was first applied on the datasets and the lakes were classified into four clusters according to 24 water quality parameters. Comparison amongst the clusters revealed that Cluster I was the least polluted and at the lowest trophic level, while Cluster IV was the most polluted and at the highest trophic level. The genetic algorithm optimized back-propagation neural network (GA-BPNN) was applied to each lake cluster to select the most influential input variables for chlorophyll-a. The results of the four clusters showed that the performance of GA-BPNN was satisfied with nearly half of the input variables selected from the predictor pool. The selected factors varied for the lakes in different clusters, which indicates that the control for eutrophication should be separate for lakes in different provinces of one country.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							524	10.3390/w9070524								WOS:000406681700075

Nutrient Leaching When Soil Is Part of Plant Growth Media	WATER												Soils can serve as sorbents for phosphorus (P), negating the need for artificial sorbents. The purpose of this study was to compare soils with different properties for their effect on nutrient levels in effluent. Four soils were mixed with sand and packed into columns 0.5 m long, with or without compost on the surface. Infiltration and effluent concentrations were measured before and after growing plants [Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.) and bluegrama grasses (Bouteloua gracilis H.B.K.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)]. The growth media with compost at the surface had higher nutrient levels than the media without the compost, but the final effluent nitrate concentrations post-harvest were significantly lower for columns with the compost blanket (59 vs. 86 mg L-1). All of the nitrate concentrations were high (many >100 mg L-1) due to mineralization and nitrogen fixation. The final effluent P concentrations before planting were significantly higher in the soil with the most sand (0.71 mg L-1), and after harvest in the mixture that contained the high soil P levels (0.58 mg L-1). Some soils (high in aluminum or calcium) were adequate sorbents for P without additions of other sorbents, but soils often generated too much nitrate in effluent.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							501	10.3390/w9070501								WOS:000406681700052

Membrane treatment of the OIZ wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents should be explored for new treatment options. In this study, three different UF membranes with variable molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) values (4, 10, and 250 kDa) were used to treat the effluent of an OIZ WWTP at laboratory scale. Six different nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were used for the effluent of UF membranes to evaluate the difference in the membrane filtration performance and the water quality. Effluent electrical conductivity (EC) values of NF membranes were 1.77 +/- 0.17, 3.73 +/- 0.27, and 4.20 +/- 0.23 ms/cm for NF (NF90, NF270, and TM610) membranes, respectively while they were 0.83 +/- 0.47, 1.17 +/- 0.47, and 1.13 +/- 0.57 ms/cm for RO (XLE, AD90, and BW30) membranes, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) images showed severe biofouling in UF 4 kDa and UF 10 kDa membranes whereas UF 250 kDa membrane showed larger metal precipitates and little bacterial fouling. The results indicated that OIZ WWTP effluent could be reused as irrigation water according to Turkish regulations with UF 250 kDa and RO-XLE membranes, effectively.

We compared two approaches to simulate the effects of transient storage (TS) on the transport of conservative and reactive tracers. The first approach considered TS as composed of metabolically active and metabolically inactive compartments, while the second model approach accounted for the surface transient storage (STS) and hyporheic transient storage (HTS). Experimental data were collected at a perennial first-order creek in Maryland, MD, USA, by injecting the conservative tracer bromide (Br) and the reactive (Raz) tracer and sampling water at two weir stations. The STS-HTS approach led to a more accurate simulation of Br transport and tails of the Raz and its product Rezorufin (Rru) breakthrough curves. Sediments support large microbial communities, and the STS-HTS model in creeks provides additional parameters to characterize the habitats of microbial water-quality indicator organisms.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							485	10.3390/w9070485								WOS:000406681700036

This issue may be addressed through the use of best management practices (BMPs) and target limits for pathogenic indicator species. Bioretention is a commonly used low impact development strategy that addresses this growing pollution problem at the source. Bioretention removal efficiencies have been well studied when considering nutrients and heavy metals, but field-scale treatment data are limited for microbial indicators. The primary objective of this study was to quantify microbial removal by installed bioretention cells with fly-ash amended soils. Three bioretention cells in Grove, Oklahoma were monitored over one and a half years and the removal microbial efficiency was quantified. Overall, removal rates for E. coli, enterococci, and coliphage were highly variable, with mean and standard deviations for removals for each site respectively: E. coli 87%, 35%, and 43%; enterococci 97%, 95%, and 80%; and coliphage 38%, 75%, and 32%. The site with negative removal efficiency appears to have some groundwater intrusion during storm events. Based on this relatively limited data set, these fly-ash amended bioretention cells performed 49% better than those with a sand-only filter media layer currently reported in the literature. Based on this initial field study, it appears that fly-ash amended bioretention cells may be a viable option for enhanced microbial removal from stormwater runoff.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							526	10.3390/w9070526								WOS:000406681700077

Therefore, it is essential to understand the spatio-temporal variation and the controlling factors of water quality. Samples of Yongding River water were collected seasonally, and 24 water quality parameters were analyzed in 2015. All waters were alkaline, and nitrate-nitrogen was the main form of nitrogen, while phosphorus was mostly below detection level. The water quality parameters varied in time and space. Cluster analysis showed a distinct difference between winter and the other seasons and between the natural river section and the section with reclaimed water. Based on the analysis of Gibbs plots, principal component analysis, and ionic relationships, the water chemistry was controlled by dissolution of rocks in natural river section, the quality of replenished water, the effects of dilution, and the reaction of aqueous chemistry in the reclaimed water section. The positive oxidation environment in most of the river water was conducive to the formation of nitrate-nitrogen by nitrification, and not conducive to denitrification.																	2073-4441					JUL	2017	9	7							453	10.3390/w9070453								WOS:000406681700004

However, the effects of this conversion can be scale-dependent. In this context, our aim was to identify the influence of different land uses at different spatial scales (catchment, drainage network and local) on instream features in agricultural streams. We defined six classes of land use: native forest, reforestation, herbaceous and shrubs, pasture, sugarcane and other categories. We obtained 22 variables related to instream, riparian area, stream morphology and water physicochemical characteristics in 86 stream reaches. To identify and isolate the effect of different land uses at different spatial scales on instream features, we performed a partial redundancy analysis (p-RDA). Different land uses and scales influenced instream features and defined two stream groups: (i) homogeneous streams with a higher proportion of sand substrate and instream grasses that were associated with the proportion of herbaceous vegetation at the local scale and with pasture at all scales and (ii) heterogeneous streams with a higher physical habitat integrity associated with the proportion of forest and sugarcane at the local and catchment scales. Land use at the catchment scale affected the physicochemical water properties and stream morphology, whereas stream physical habitat (i.e., substrate, instream cover, marginal vegetation and stream physical habitat condition) was mainly influenced by land use at the local scale (i.e., 150 m radius). Pure catchment, drainage network and local land uses explained 9%, 7% and 4%, respectively, of the total variation of instream features. Thus, to be most effective, stream conservation and restoration efforts should not be limited to only one scale.																	0075-9511	1873-5851				JUL	2017	65						14	21		10.1016/j.limno.2017.06.001								WOS:000408287200004

We found that the community indices correspond to very good ecological conditions in five natural streams of that region.

Modeling of the river ecological status with macrophytes using artificial neural networks	LIMNOLOGICA												Biomonitoring methods based on macrophytes have been used mandatorily in the assessment of freshwaters since the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). The Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR) was developed in Poland for the monitoring of running waters under the WFD requirements. This index shows the degree of river degradation under the influence of water pollutants, especially nutrients. The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between the MIR and various hydrochemical parameters using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Physico-chemical parameters of water (monthly results for the whole year), which were derived from 147 lowland river survey sites, all located in Poland, were applied to model the MIR values. Water quality variables were determined over three timeframes: the annual average; the average for the vegetation period; and the average for the summer period. Quality of the networks was assessed using coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and root mean square error (RMSE). The best modeling quality was obtained for yearly average values of water quality parameters. The quality statistics were: R-2 = 0.722, NSE = 0.721 and RMSE = 0.056 (training dataset); R-2 = 0.555, NSE = 0.533 and RMSE = 0.101 (validation dataset); R-2 = 0.650. NSE = 0.600 and RMSE = 0.089 (testing dataset). This indicates that macrophytes reflect the whole year impact of pollution, whereas summer.

The investigation was based on in-depth empirical field work including a survey with 635 heads of smallholder farmers' households via interview using semi-structured questionnaires. Further, water abstraction was estimated from three districts that border with the lake. Respondents believe that Lake Ziway provides a number of individual and collective benefits for local communities, private companies and public institution. They stated, however, that the lake is under pressure from the floriculture industry and other investment projects, high population growth and subsequent expansion of settlements and irrigation farms, high applications of agrochemicals, soil erosion, uncontrolled water abstraction, and deforestation in the watershed. The respondents further believe that these activities are degrading the lake water quality, shrinking its water volume and decreasing its fish population. After examining government's efforts to address these activities, the majority of respondents believe that the government role in the whole watershed is weak. This study contributes to better understand the local socio-ecological coherences and the problems Lake Ziway and its watershed are facing. It also provides information regarding long-term sustainable land and water use planning strategies for the lake and management of its watershed, which could also be applied to other lakes in Ethiopia, and beyond.																	0075-9511	1873-5851				JUL	2017	65						61	75		10.1016/j.limno.2017.07.005								WOS:000408287200010

These require intensive cultures of pastures and forages, with the consequent impacts on water quality in downstream rivers and reservoirs. Monthly temporal variation of nutrients and water quality were assessed along one year at basin scale (basin area < 3500 ha). Several indicators of farming intensity (number of dairy cows and beef cows, percentage of area devoted to crops) and management practices (effluent treatment, fertilizer application) were related to the export of nutrients and sediments from the basins and with the water quality of receiving streams using partial least square regression analysis (PLS). According to PLS analysis, the most relevant variables to explain water quality degradation and high export coefficients of nutrients and sediments, were the percentage of basin area dedicated to crop activities and the density of dairy cows without effluent treatment. Beef and dairy cows had an important local impact on stream water without animal access restrictions. We also propose some hypotheses regarding the transport pathways of sediments and nutrients to streams. Our results demonstrate the urgent need to implement best management practices at the farm scale within each basin, focusing on: adequate phosphorus fertilization, implementation of a complete dairy effluent treatment system and animal restriction to fluvial channels.																	0075-9511	1873-5851				JUL	2017	65						76	84		10.1016/j.limno.2017.06.002								WOS:000408287200011

Microcystin-LR (MCLR) was used as a reference microcystin variant. Inside the immunocolumn, free microcystins and microcystin-horseradish peroxidase (tracer) were sequentially captured by the immobilized antibodies, and the detection was performed electrochemically using Super AquaBlue ELISA substrate 2,2-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). The ABTS(.+) generated by enzymatic oxidation of ABTS was electrochemically determined at a carbon working electrode by applying a reduction potential set at 0.4 V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The peak current intensity was inversely proportional to the amount of analyte bound to the immunocolumn. The amperometric flow-ELISA system, which was automatically controlled through the CapSenze(TM) (Lund, Sweden) computer software, enabled determination of MCLR as low as 0.01 mu g/L. The assay time was very short (20 min for one assay cycle). In addition, the electrochemical signals were not significantly affected by possible interferences which could be present in the real samples. Along with the simplicity of automation, this makes the developed method a promising tool for use in water quality assessment.

Despite significant uncertainty in most flow data, the flow series for these applications are often communicated and used without uncertainty information. In this commentary, we argue that proper analysis of uncertainty in river flow data can reduce costs and promote robust conclusions in water management applications. We substantiate our argument by providing case studies from Norway and New Zealand where streamflow uncertainty analysis has uncovered economic costs in the hydropower industry, improved public acceptance of a controversial water management policy, and tested the accuracy of water quality trends. We discuss the need for practical uncertainty assessment tools that generate multiple flow series realizations rather than simple error bounds. Although examples of such tools are in development, considerable barriers for uncertainty analysis and communication still exist for practitioners, and future research must aim to provide easier access and usability of uncertainty estimates. We conclude that flow uncertainty analysis is critical for good water management decisions. Plain Language Summary In this commentary, we show how analyzing uncertainty in river flow data can reduce costs and promote robust conclusions in water management applications.

Therefore, monitoring of agricultural water use and hydrologic connections between crop lands and Bay tributaries has received increasing attention. Remote sensing retrievals of actual evapotranspiration (ET) can provide valuable information in support of these hydrologic modeling efforts, spatially and temporally describing consumptive water use by crops and natural vegetation and quantifying response to expansion of irrigated area occurring with Bay watershed. In this study, a multisensor satellite data fusion methodology, combined with a multiscale ET retrieval algorithm, was applied over the Choptank River watershed located within the Lower Chesapeake Bay region on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, USA to produce daily 30 m resolution ET maps. ET estimates directly retrieved on Landsat satellite overpass dates have high accuracy with relative error (RE) of 9%, as evaluated using flux tower measurements. The fused daily ET time series have reasonable errors of 18% at the daily time step - an improvement from 27% errors using standard Landsat-only interpolation techniques. Annual water consumption by different land cover types was assessed, showing reasonable distributions of water use with cover class. Seasonal patterns in modeled crop transpiration and soil evaporation for dominant crop types were analyzed, and agree well with crop phenology at field scale. Additionally, effects of irrigation occurring during a period of rainfall shortage were captured by the fusion program. These results suggest that the ET fusion system will have utility for water management at field and regional scales over the Eastern Shore. Further efforts are underway to integrate these detailed water use data sets into watershed-scale hydrologic models to improve assessments of water quality and inform best management practices to reduce nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay.

Are our dynamic water quality models too complex? A comparison of a new parsimonious phosphorus model, SimplyP, and INCA-P	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Catchment-scale water quality models are increasingly popular tools for exploring the potential effects of land management, land use change and climate change on water quality. However, the dynamic, catchment-scale nutrient models in common usage are complex, with many uncertain parameters requiring calibration, limiting their usability and robustness. A key question is whether this complexity is justified. To explore this, we developed a parsimonious phosphorus model, SimplyP, incorporating a rainfall-runoff model and a biogeochemical model able to simulate daily streamflow, suspended sediment, and particulate and dissolved phosphorus dynamics. The model's complexity was compared to one popular nutrient model, INCA-P, and the performance of the two models was compared in a small rural catchment in northeast Scotland. For three land use classes, less than six SimplyP parameters must be determined through calibration, the rest may be based on measurements, while INCA-P has around 40 unmeasurable parameters. Despite substantially simpler process-representation, SimplyP performed comparably to INCA-P in both calibration and validation and produced similar long-term projections in response to changes in land management. Results support the hypothesis that INCA-P is overly complex for the study catchment. We hope our findings will help prompt wider model comparison exercises, as well as debate among the water quality modeling community as to whether today's models are fit for purpose. Simpler models such as SimplyP have the potential to be useful management and research tools, building blocks for future model development (prototype code is freely available), or benchmarks against which more complex models could be evaluated. Plain Language Summary Catchment models may be useful tools for managing water quality, for example for exploring how water quality may change in the future under different land management, land use or climate. However, models are only useful if they capture the right processes, otherwise there is a risk of management decisions being based on unreliable information. There is now a growing awareness that many catchment water quality models used today are too complex. This makes it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to set models up, and reduces the reliability of their predictions. We have therefore developed a new, simple model to predict phosphorus concentrations in rivers, one of the biggest causes of troublesome algal blooms in fresh waters. The simple model was compared with one of the standard models in common use and was found to perform as well, despite being substantially simpler to set up and use. This supports the idea that current water quality models are too complex, and that modelers need to put more effort into assessing whether they are using appropriate tools.

Predicting organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations in runoff from peat extraction sites using partial least squares regression	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Organic matter and nutrient export from drained peatlands is affected by complex hydrological and biogeochemical interactions. Here partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to relate various soil and catchment characteristics to variations in chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in runoff. Peat core samples and water quality data were collected from 15 peat extraction sites in Finland. PLSR models constructed by cross-validation and variable selection routines predicted 92, 88, and 95% of the variation in mean COD, TN, and TP concentration in runoff, respectively. The results showed that variations in COD were mainly related to net production (temperature and water-extractable dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), hydrology (topographical relief), and solubility of dissolved organic matter (peat sulfur (S) and calcium (Ca) concentrations). Negative correlations for peat S and runoff COD indicated that acidity from oxidation of organic S stored in peat may be an important mechanism suppressing organic matter leaching. Moreover, runoff COD was associated with peat aluminum (Al), P, and sodium (Na) concentrations. Hydrological controls on TN and COD were similar (i.e., related to topography), whereas degree of humification, bulk density, and water-extractable COD and Al provided additional explanations for TN concentration. Variations in runoff TP concentration were attributed to erosion of particulate P, as indicated by a positive correlation with suspended sediment concentration (SSC), and factors associated with metal-humic complexation and P adsorption (peat Al, water-extractable P, and water-extractable iron (Fe)).

Complex networks of functional connectivity in a wetland reconnected to its floodplain	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Disturbances such as fire or flood, in addition to changing the local magnitude of ecological, hydrological, or biogeochemical processes, can also change their functional connectivity-how those processes interact in space. Complex networks offer promise for quantifying functional connectivity in watersheds. The approach resolves connections between nodes in space based on statistical similarities in perturbation signals (derived from solute time series) and is sensitive to a wider range of timescales than traditional mass-balance modeling. We use this approach to test hypotheses about how fire and flood impact ecological and biogeochemical dynamics in a wetland (Everglades, FL, USA) that was reconnected to its floodplain. Reintroduction of flow pulses after decades of separation by levees fundamentally reconfigured functional connectivity networks. The most pronounced expansion was that of the calcium network, which reflects periphyton dynamics and may represent an indirect influence of elevated nutrients, despite the comparatively smaller observed expansion of phosphorus networks. With respect to several solutes, periphyton acted as a "biotic filter,'' shifting perturbations in water-quality signals to different timescales through slow but persistent transformations of the biotic community. The complex-networks approach also revealed portions of the landscape that operate in fundamentally different regimes with respect to dissolved oxygen, separated by a threshold in flow velocity of 1.2 cm/s, and suggested that complete removal of canals may be needed to restore connectivity with respect to biogeochemical processes. Fire reconfigured functional connectivity networks in a manner that reflected localized burn severity, but had a larger effect on the magnitude of solute concentrations. Plain Language Summary A big part of the plan to restore the Everglades involves the removal of levees and canals that are currently serving as barriers to flow. However, doing so at a large scale prompts some concerns and questions: (1) Will phosphorus, a limiting nutrient that has the capability to vastly change vegetation communities, be mobilized and transported to downstream ecosystems? And (2) Do the barriers to flow need to be completely removed (an expensive proposition), or will partial removal suffice? To address these uncertainties, a team of scientists and engineers conducted a multi-year experiment involving controlled flow releases into a 2 km x 2 km part of the wetland that was formerly isolated from flow. In this paper the authors use a new functional connectivity network approach to visualize how those flow releases change the way constituents in the flood waters move through the downstream ecosystem. They found that flow reconnection causes a shift in how calcium is processed by microorganisms near the flow inlet, which likely reflects a transition to species that thrive under slight phosphorus enrichment. They also found that only across portions of the landscape where barriers to flow have been completely removed does the landscape regain functional connectivity.

In their European range, the crab Potamon fluviatile and the white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes complex do not usually share the same stream section or pond even if they live in sympatry, suggesting a strong segregation of the two species. The coexistence was hypothesized during the Pleistocene era, but without evidence of recent contact between them. The co-occurrence of these two species (i.e., occupying a common area) is reported in a stream of the Central Italy, being the first case in Italy and in Europe. To assess this co-occurrence, in 2015 we investigated three transects (only crabs, only crayfish and both species), collecting biotic and abiotic data. The three transects were similar for canopy cover, substrate composition and density of potential shelters (but not for the abiotic parameters), and characterized by a good water quality and abundance of preys, being suitable for the two species. No agonistic behavioural patterns have been observed, leading to hypothesize that co-occurrence may be favoured by the slightly smaller size of crayfish and crabs in the shared area than the size of animals in the other transects or by the different microhabitats chosen by crayfish and crabs when sharing the same stream section. Other possible explanations are discussed here, but further studies are necessary to better understand the co-occurrence of these two native crustaceans. Moreover, urgent measures are demanded to guarantee the survival of these protected species hampered by several threats.

Mean concentrations of toxic metals in groundwater decreased in the order of Cr > Zn > Cu > Cd > Ni > Pb > Hg > As. Concentration of Cr6+ in groundwater was detected to further study chromium contamination. Cr6+ and Cd in groundwater were recommended as the priority pollutants because they were generally 1399-fold and 12-foldgreater than permissible limits, respectively. Owing to the fact that a waterproof curtain (WPC) in the brownfield is about to pass the warranty period, a steady two-dimensional water quality model and health risk assessment were applied to simulate and evaluate adverse effects of Cr6+ and Cd on the water quality of Xiangjiang River and the drinking-water intake of Wangcheng Waterworks. The results indicated that when groundwater in the brownfield leaked with valid curtain prevention, the water quality in Xiangjiang River and drinking-water intake downstream were temporarily unaffected. However, if there was no curtain prevention, groundwater leakage would have adverse impact on water quality of Xiangjiang River. Under the requirements of Class III surface water quality, the pollution belt for Cr6+ was 7500 m and 200 m for Cd. The non-carcinogenic risk of toxic metals in Xiangjiang River exceeded the threshold in a limited area, but did not threaten Wangcheng Waterworks.

To combat this issue, the country needs to establish water quality targets, monitoring systems, and intelligent watershed management. This study explores a new watershed management method. Water quality is first assessed using a single factor index method. Then, changes in total nitrogen/total phosphorus (TN/TP) are analyzed to determine the limiting factor. Next, the study compares the eutrophication status of two water function districts, using a comprehensive nutritional state index method and geographic information system (GIS) visualization. Finally, nutrient sources are qualitatively analyzed. Two functional water areas in Tianjin, China were selected and analyzed: Qilihai National Wetland Nature Reserve and Yuqiao Reservoir. The reservoir is a drinking water source. Results indicate that total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) pollution are the main factors driving eutrophication in the Qilihai Wetland and Yuqiao Reservoir. Phosphorus was the limiting factor in the Yuqiao Reservoir; nitrogen was the limiting factor in the Qilihai Wetland. Pollution in Qilihai Wetland is more serious than in Yuqiao Reservoir. The study found that external sources are the main source of pollution. These two functional water areas are vital for Tianjin; as such, the study proposes targeted management measures.																	1660-4601					JUL	2017	14	7							695	10.3390/ijerph14070695								WOS:000407370700027

The Limpopo Non-Metropolitan Drinking Water Supplier Response to a Diagnostic Tool for Technical Compliance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Water services providers should supply water that is fit for human consumption, taking into account multi-barrier approaches and technical aspects such as design aspects, operation monitoring, final water quality compliance monitoring, plant monitoring practices, maintenance, and risk management practices. Against this background, this study focused on applying the diagnostic tool for technical compliance as well as assessing the compliance of water treatment plants with management norms. Six plants in the Vhembe District Municipality were selected; the Vondo, Malamulele, Mutshedzi, and Mutale plants (conventional), and the Dzingahe and Tshedza package plants. During the first assessment, four (Malamulele, Mutshedzi, Mutale and Dzingahe) plants scored between 44% and 49% and achieved Class 3 certification, revealing serious challenges requiring immediate intervention. Two water plants (Vondo and Tshedza, scoring 53% and 63%, respectively) were in the Class 2 category, revealing serious challenges requiring attention and improvement. During the second assessment, all plants scored between 63% and 87% (Class 2 category). The greatest improvement (30%) was noted for the Dzingahe and Tshedza plants, followed by the Malamulele plant, while the Mutale, Vondo, and Mutshedzi plants improved their scores by 20%, 17% and 14%, respectively. After corrective actions and re-measurement, no plant complied. It is recommended that Water Services Providers (WSPs) regularly apply the diagnostic tools and water safety plans as developed in order to comply with applicable standards.																	1660-4601					JUL	2017	14	7							810	10.3390/ijerph14070810								WOS:000407370700142

Compared with groundwater, surface water is generally used more widely and has characteristics that make ammonium removal more difficult. In this study, MeOx was used to remove ammonium from surface water. It indicated that the average ammonium removal efficiency of MeOx was greater than 90%, even though the water quality changed dramatically and the water temperature was reduced to about 6-8 degrees C. Then, through inactivating microorganisms, it showed that the removal capability of MeOx included both biological (accounted for about 41.05%) and chemical catalytic oxidation and chemical catalytic oxidation (accounted for about 58.95%). The investigation of the characterizations suggested that MeOx was formed by abiotic ways and the main elements on the surface of MeOx were distributed homogenously. The analysis of the catalytic oxidation process indicated that ammonia nitrogen may interact with MeOx as both ammonia molecules and ammonium ions and the active species of O-2 were possibly O-center dot and O-2(-).																	1660-4601					JUL	2017	14	7							807	10.3390/ijerph14070807								WOS:000407370700139

However, when applied to soil, such residue may cause environmental impacts. This study aimed to analyze the chemical characteristics of the soil, corn, and leachate after successive swine wastewater applications associated with mineral fertilization. The experiment was developed in drainage lysimeters under field conditions. Wastewater doses applied were 0, 100, 200, and 300 m(3) ha(-1) with and without mineral fertilization. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and Tukey's test. After nine years of application, a special attention should be taken regarding water quality from a dose of 200 m(3) ha(-1) since some elements may leach into the soil. In addition, a synchronism between residue application and crop requirements needs to be taken into account. Doses of 200 and 300 m(3) ha(-1) are considered as satisfactory to meet corn nutritional requirements. Moreover, an increase in fertility characteristics was observed, but a caution regarding Cu and Zn contents should be taken since these elements produce a cumulative effect in the soil.

However, most current (empirical) erodibility indices are based on only a few soil properties. A feasible soil characterization of interrill erosion (IE) prediction at large scale should be based on simple, quick and inexpensive tests to perform. The objective of this work was to identify and assess those soil properties that best reflect soil vulnerability to IE. Twenty-three agricultural soil samples located in Spain and Italy were studied. Forty-nine different physical and chemical soil properties that presumably underpin IE were defined. Experiments were carried out in the field (in microplots using simulated rainfall) and in the lab. The most relevant variables were detected using multivariate analysis. Six key variables were finally identified: RUSLE K factor, a granulometric/organic matter content index, exchangeable sodium percentage, shear strength, penetration resistance and permeability of soil seal. The latter is proposed as a useful technique to evaluate soil susceptibility to crusting even when the crust is not present at the time of the field survey. The selected variables represented a wide range of soil properties, and they could also be successfully applied to different soils with different characteristics than those evaluated in our experiments.

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL TRENDS OF RECENT DISSOLVED PHOSPHORUS CONCENTRATIONS IN LAKE TANA AND ITS FOUR MAIN TRIBUTARIES	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Rapid population growth and agricultural intensification have been directly associated with land degradation and with visible deterioration in water quality in the Ethiopian lakes. Assessing the extent and origin of pollution is cumbersome because of the lack of measurements for water quality parameters. This paper reports on the dissolved phosphorus (DP) concentrations in Lake Tana and its tributaries during 3 years from 2010 to 2012 and the four rainy months in 2014. Concentrations in the headwaters, at the gaging station, at the river mouth, near shore (littoral), and in the open lake (pelagic) were measured for the four major rivers. DP concentration in the rivers was on the average 0.32 mg l(-1), and DP in the lake was much lower with an average concentration of 0.10 mg l(-1). Temporally, DP concentrations were greater in the rainy phase of the monsoon than in the dry phase from November through March. Moreover, an upward trend in DP concentrations is coinciding with the area expansion of water hyacinths in the lake. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This paper focuses on a new permeability-improvement technology, liquid carbon dioxide phase change fracturing technology. This technology can be classified as physical blasting by using the phase energy of liquid carbon dioxide in the drilling underground coal mine. According to the results of field tests, by applying the liquid carbon dioxide phase change fracturing technology, the radius of the damaged area in the coal body around the drilling reached 5 m. Also, compared with the original coal body, the permeability of the damaged area increased approximately six times. In addition, based on the permeability of the damaged area, the influence of the liquid carbon dioxide phase change fracturing technology on the gas drainage radius was analyzed by numerical calculation. It can be observed from the numerical results that the effect of gas drainage was improved greatly by the liquid carbon dioxide phase change fracturing operation. Research results of this paper can contribute to safe and efficient mining of coal mines.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JUL	2017	10	14							314	10.1007/s12517-017-3103-0								WOS:000407428400009

Hydrogeochemical assessment of surface and groundwater resources of Korba coalfield, Central India: environmental implications	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The present study assesses the impact of coal mining on surface and groundwater resources of Korba Coalfield, Central India. Accordingly, water samples collected from various sources are analyzed for major ions, trace elements, and other mine effluent parameters. Results show that the groundwater samples are slightly acidic, whereas river water and mine water samples are mildly alkaline. Elevated concentrations of Ca2+, Na+, HCO3-, and SO42- alongside the molar ratios (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/(SO4 (2-)+ HCO3-) < 1 and Na+/Cl- > 1 suggest that silicate weathering (water-rock interaction) coupled with ion exchange are dominant solute acquisition processes controlling the chemistry of groundwater in the study area. The overall hydrogeochemistry of the area is dominated by two major hydrogeochemical facies (i. e., Ca-Cl-SO4 and Ca-HCO3). Analysis of groundwater and river water quality index (GRWQI) elucidates that majority (82%) of samples are of "excellent" to "good" category, and the remaining 12% are of "poor" quality. Similarly, the effluent water quality index (EWQI) indicates that 6 out of 8 samples belong to excellent quality. Concentration of trace element constituents such as As, Zn, Cu, Cr, and Cd is found to be well within the stipulated limits for potable use, except for Fe, Mn, and Pb. Suitability of water samples for irrigation purpose, established using standard tools like Wilcox and USSL diagrams, reveal "excellent to permissible" category for majority of the samples. The present study also substantiates the effectiveness of the measures implemented for the treatment of mine effluent water.

Although in situ measurements have provided century-long datasets in different regions, the seasonal and interannual variations as well as the long-term changes of ocean transparency at the global scale are still poorly understood. In the present study, based on the semi-analytic algorithm, the time series of the monthly global ocean transparency over Sept. 1997 to Nov. 2010 were retrieved from the satellite data observed by the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS). The seasonal and interannual variations of global ocean transparency were identified from the SeaWiFS-derived water transparency. Large seasonal variation amplitude occurred at the front zones between subtropical gyres and high latitude oceans. Moreover, ocean transparency increased in the Northern Hemisphere, while it decreased in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in the Southern Ocean from Sept. 1997 to Nov. 2010. The global mean ocean transparency decreased rapidly with a rate of 0.85 m yr(-1) (p=0.001) between 1997 and 1999, followed by a small increase with a rate of 0.04 m yr(-1) (p=0.05) over 2000-2010, which might be linked to changes of sea surface temperature with rapid decrease over 1998-1999 and slight increase over 2000-2010. These changes of water transparency may alter the available light for phytoplankton photosynthesis, and influence the thermal evolution of the upper ocean.

Microcystin Prevalence throughout Lentic Waterbodies in Coastal Southern California	TOXINS												Toxin producing cyanobacterial blooms have increased globally in recent decades in both frequency and intensity. Despite the recognition of this growing risk, the extent and magnitude of cyanobacterial blooms and cyanotoxin prevalence is poorly characterized in the heavily populated region of southern California. Recent assessments of lentic waterbodies (depressional wetlands, lakes, reservoirs and coastal lagoons) determined the prevalence of microcystins and, in some cases, additional cyanotoxins. Microcystins were present in all waterbody types surveyed although toxin concentrations were generally low across most habitats, as only a small number of sites exceeded California's recreational health thresholds for acute toxicity. Results from passive samplers (Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT)) indicated microcystins were prevalent throughout lentic waterbodies and that traditional discrete samples underestimated the presence of microcystins. Multiple cyanotoxins were detected simultaneously in some systems, indicating multiple stressors, the risk of which is uncertain since health thresholds are based on exposures to single toxins. Anatoxin-a was detected for the first time from lakes in southern California. The persistence of detectable microcystins across years and seasons indicates a low-level, chronic risk through both direct and indirect exposure. The influence of toxic cyanobacterial blooms is a more complex stressor than presently recognized and should be included in water quality monitoring programs.

Fragmentation-free land allocation (FF-LA) aims to improve returns on ecosystem services by determining both space partitioning of a study area and choice of land-use/land-cover management practice (LMP) for each partition under a budget constraint. In the context of large-scale industrialized food production, fragmentation (e.g., tiny LMP patches) discourages the use of modern farm equipment (e.g., 10- to 20-m-wide combine harvesters) and must be avoided in the allocation. FF-LA is a computationally challenging NP-hard problem. We introduce three frameworks for land allocation planning, namely collaborative geodesign, spatial optimization and a hybrid model of the two, to help stakeholders resolve the dilemma between increasing food production capacity and improving water quality. A detailed case study is carried out at the Seven Mile Creek watershed in the midwestern US. The results show the challenges of generating near-optimal solutions through collaborative geodesign, and the potential benefits of spatial optimization in assisting the decision-making process.																	2220-9964					JUL	2017	6	7							226	10.3390/ijgi6070226								WOS:000407506900043

The transition from riparian to upland forest plant communities on headwater streams in the southern Sierra Nevada, California, United States	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												Fixed-width buffer zones on rivers and streams are designed to protect the diverse riparian community and its important function in the ecosystem. However, recent data suggest that riparian areas of some western forests have become more fire prone because of restrictions on fuel reduction treatments within buffer zones. Surprisingly little is known about where and how the plant community transitions from riparian to upland vegetation, but understanding that transition would inform the restoration of riparian forest structure and function and its associated management applications (e.g., prescribed fire or mechanical thinning) that may be necessary to achieve restoration. Using data collected from the Kings River Experimental Watersheds, we assessed the transition in plant structure and composition from riparian near-stream areas to upland locations, in mixed-conifer and red fir forests on headwater streams of the southern Sierra Nevada, CA. Our data strongly support the conclusion that the riparian zone, as evidenced by the riparian plant community, extends beyond 10 m from the stream on these narrow, first-and second-order streams. The herbaceous community at 10 m from the stream was distinct from the upland community and had greater similarity to locations closer to the stream in mixed-conifer forest. Species richness was three to four times greater in riparian areas compared with upland areas, and there was little overlap of the more-abundant herbaceous species. In addition, riparian forests were generally denser, with smaller trees in mixed-conifer forest, but had similar stand structure to upland forests in red fir forest. Differences between mixed-conifer and red fir forests may reflect different departures from the historical fire regime in these two community types. Compared with riparian areas of wetter climates, riparian areas of dry climates, such as the Sierra Nevada, may harbor even greater species diversity relative to nearby upland areas, indicating that buffer zones of restricted management may be justified in these forests if the goal is the preservation of biodiversity. However, perhaps more important, these findings, along with recent literature, highlight the need to identify site-specific goals when undertaking restoration of riparian forests in the western USA: herbaceous biodiversity, fuels reduction, historic tree composition and structure, and/or water quality.																	1095-5674	1940-0616				JUL	2017	144	3					280	295		10.3159/TORREY-D-15-00073.1								WOS:000406723200004

Comparing volatile organic compound emissions during equalization in wastewater treatment between the flux-chamber and mass-transfer methods	PROCESS SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												The emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during equalization in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) is a particular source of concern. In this study, VOC emissions during equalization in three industrial WWTPs were analyzed by two different approaches. The flux-chamber method is a standard method used in many countries including Taiwan, as the theory behind the mass-transfer method is well-established. The objective was to investigate whether different outcomes were generated between two estimation methods and to determine potential overestimation of VOC, chemical oxygen demand (COD), or total organic carbon (TOC) removals in the WWTPs due to VOC emission during equalization. In the results, the estimated VOC fluxes during equalization were similar between two approaches. Recognizable amounts of VOCs were emitted during equalization (up to 28.2%, 13.6%, and 7.6% in three WWTPs). Their impacts on the COD (e.g., less than 0.1% in three WWTPs) or TOC removals (e.g., less than 11.4% in three WWTPs) were rather limited. Through the correlation analysis, the estimated VOC emission flux was not dependent upon individual but on co-influence of the compound's physicochemical characteristics, water quality, and operation during equalization. Although two approaches generated similar outcomes, the results by the flux-chamber method seemed to be more relevant to the operation during equalization, while the water quality were more important to the results by the mass-transfer method. Both methods were effective to quantify VOC emission during wastewater equalization, as the flux-chamber method is possibly a preferable option given their applicability and economic comparison.

Timely detection of the presence of the cysts of this parasite in drinking water is important to prevent the spread of the disease, especially in resource-limited settings. Here we provide extended experimental testing and evaluation of the performance and repeatability of a field-portable and cost-effective microscopy platform for automated detection and counting of Giardia cysts in water samples, including tap water, non-potable water, and pond water. This compact platform is based on our previous work, and is composed of a smartphone-based fluorescence microscope, a disposable sample processing cassette, and a custom-developed smartphone application. Our mobile phone microscope has a large field of view of similar to 0.8 cm(2) and weighs only similar to 180 g, excluding the phone. A custom-developed smartphone application provides a user-friendly graphical interface, guiding the users to capture a fluorescence image of the sample filter membrane and analyze it automatically at our servers using an image processing algorithm and training data, consisting of > 30,000 images of cysts and > 100,000 images of other fluorescent particles that are captured, including, e.g. dust. The total time that it takes from sample preparation to automated cyst counting is less than an hour for each 10 ml of water sample that is tested. We compared the sensitivity and the specificity of our platform using multiple supervised classification models, including support vector machines and nearest neighbors, and demonstrated that a bootstrap aggregating (i.e. bagging) approach using raw image file format provides the best performance for automated detection of Giardia cysts. We evaluated the performance of this machine learning enabled pathogen detection device with water samples taken from different sources (e.g. tap water, non-potable water, pond water) and achieved a limit of detection of 12 cysts per 10 ml, an average cyst capture efficiency of similar to 79%, and an accuracy of similar to 95%. Providing rapid detection and quantification of waterborne pathogens without the need for a microbiology expert, this field-portable imaging and sensing platform running on a smartphone could be very useful for water quality monitoring in resource-limited settings.

In order to improve existing networks management and control, network sectorization is gaining importance. It is based on network division into isolated zones, delimited by boundary valves, which are hydraulically monitored. Given the diversity of criteria for sectors' design, a methodology for sectorized networks assessment is proposed for selecting the most efficient sector's configuration in terms of every alternative's service vulnerability and involved costs. Vulnerability is assessed through a multi-objective function based on three of the main service related goals to achieve with a sectorization project: service continuity, water quality and appropriate pressure range. This way, performance indicators for quantifying these goals are proposed, normalized and weighted to be combined according to the reference of studied network. In order to assess sectors efficiency every alternative costs, including sector's establishment and instrumentation cost, energetic, operational and maintenance costs, are considered for solutions' comparison. Such process is carried out through a Pareto analysis. Vulnerability analysis allows the identification of sectors for prioritizing investments in existing networks while the efficiency analysis allows the selection of the best options from different alternatives, also for new sectors' design. The methodology has been applied to 494 sectors of Canal de Isabel II distribution network in Madrid (Spain).																	0187-8336	2007-2422				JUL-AUG	2017	8	4					57	77		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-04-04								WOS:000407063700004

The mathematical model of optimization aims at minimizing the area occupied by the lagoon system, and has as restrictions the water quality in the effluent: biochemical oxygen demand and the number of fecal coliforms; In addition, the dispersion (greater than or equal to 0.05) is restricted, in order to favor the dispersed flow in the facultative lagoon and the ripening lagoon. The changing variables in the optimization model are the following: retention time and number of screens, both facultative and maturation lagoons, and the long wide ratio for the anaerobic lagoon.

Various physico-chemical parameters along with chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton, total viable and coliform bacteria were analysed for the harbour water throughout the year. Seasonal changes responsible for temporal variations were observed during monsoon, pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. Noticeable spatial variation was found due to port's ongoing activities mainly at Iron ore handling berth, South Quay, East Quay, ADB-Coal berth, General cargo berth and Fertiliser berth. From the cluster and correlation analysis, greater inter dependency are found among the variables like phytoplankton, chlorophyll-a, PO4, NO3, NH3, TSS, Cr, DO, BOD and pH.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUL	2017	46	7					1274	1286										WOS:000406894700006

Amino acid profile and growth performance of dwarf snakehead, Channa gachua (Hamilton 1822) fish as influenced by the alternative protein blends	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												There was increased growth performance (p<0.05) of juveniles in response to poultry waste diet (PWD). Lowest FCR was recorded in PWD as compared to other diets (p<0.05) with highest FCR in anchovy fish diet (AFD). The AA composition of four treatment diets and muscle tissue of C. gachua fed on these diets was determined. AA concentration in whole-body protein was affected by dietary treatment and fish fed PWD showed comparatively higher concentrations of all essential amino acids (EAAs). In all four diets, the most abundant AA was glutamic acid (7.39 +/- 0.7, 9 +/- 0.8, 7.84 +/- 0.7 and 8.1 +/- 0.6) and leucine was the most abundant EAA (2.42 +/- 0.1, 2.74 +/- 0.2, 2.64 +/- 0.1 and 2.67 +/- 0.2). Significant differences (p < 0.05) existed between the contents of EAA and non-EAA in all the fish samples. In fish muscle protein, arginine, histidine, glycine, alanine, glutamic acid, cysteine, threonine, valine, leucine, and methionine concentrations were significantly higher in PWD.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUL	2017	46	7					1358	1364										WOS:000406894700015

Thampi Sam			Haematological parameters as predictive indicators of stress induced mortality in Pacific White Shrimp Penaeus vannamei (Boone, 1931) broodstock during transboundary shipment	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												The influence of stress due to different transit durations during transboundary shipment of Penaeus vannamei broodstock from the supplier source located at Florida, USA to the port of entry Chennai, India was evaluated in terms of haematological parameters, such as total protein, glucose and haemocyte count. The parameters studied were correlated with the percentage of transit mortality, recorded under different transit durations and with the water quality parameters in the shipment bags. Refractive index (RI) of haemolymph samples of brooders subjected to transit durations were monitored with the objective to use RI as a suitable proxy for haemolymph protein. A linear relation was observed between the RI and total protein content (r(2) = 0.7874). Among the parameters determined, total haemocyte count (THC) was significantly reduced (P<0.05) in broodstock subjected to longer transit duration, which had increased mean total ammonia level and decreased mean dissolved oxygen concentration coupled with low pH levels. The levels of total protein and glucose significantly high with increase in transit durations. Data obtained subjected to Tukey posthoc test indicated all determined haematological parameters were statistically significant (P<0.05) between control and each test groups.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUL	2017	46	7					1440	1446										WOS:000406894700027

Samplings of shellfishes were done using estuarine set bag net along with sampling of water quality parameters in winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon from 2013 to 2014. All of the multivariate analyses were performed using PRIMER V6. A total of 18 species of fish belonging to 12 families were identified of which most dominant species was found Exopalaemon styliferus (31.19%) followed by Parapenaeopsis sculpptilis (13.53%), Charybdis natator (12.85%), Macrobrachium mirabile (12.76%), as the major dominant species. Analysis of similarity showed significant differences among seasons. Cluster analysis formed three groups and appearances, 53% similarity while post-monsoon displayed separate. The canonical correspondence analysis indicates temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen as the three most important environmental parameters shaping the species diversity structure.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				JUL	2017	46	7					1486	1492										WOS:000406894700033

Effect of cassava waste on bioremediation of nitrogenous metabolites and shrimp growth	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: Locally available cheap carbon sources, cassava waste and cassava starch, were tested for their efficiency in decreasing the nitrogenous metabolites, resulting due to accumulation of uneaten feed and excreta at the pond bottom during intensive shrimp aquaculture. Methodology: Yard experiment was carried out in 5001 Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) tanks fora period of 105 days with four treatments viz., cassava waste, cassava starch, cassava waste+cassava starch and control, replicated thrice and statistically randomized with Tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon (1.71 g). The following water quality parameters - pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N); microbial parameters in water and sediment - total heterotrophic bacteria count (THBC) and total vibrio count (TVC); proximate composition, fibre fractionation, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur content in cassava waste and cassava starch were analyzed. The growth of shrimp was also studied. Results: Shrimp growth was significantly high (p <= 0.05) in cassava waste (11.12 g) treatment followed by cassava starch (10.4 g), cassava waste + cassava starch (9.8 g) and control (8.02 g) at the end of the experiment. Cassava waste, cassava starch and combination of both significantly decreased the concentration of metabolites and had high heterotrophic bacterial population and low total vibrio count compared to control. Interpretation: It was concluded that addition of cassava waste had positive effect on bioremediation of nitrogenous metabolites, enhancing the growth of shrimp.																	0254-8704					JUL	2017	38	4					611	616		10.22438/jeb/38/4/MS-158								WOS:000404828800011

This study, using in-situ spectral and CSPM measurements as well as Sentinel 2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) images, aimed to develop CSPM retrieval models and further to estimate the CSPM values of Poyang Lake, China. Sixty-eight in-situ hyperspectral measurements and relative spectral response function were applied to simulate Sentinel 2 MIS spectra. Thirty-four samples were used to calibrate and the left samples were used to validate CSPM retrieval models, respectively. The developed models were then applied to two Sentinel 2 MSI images captured in wet and dry seasons, and the derived CSPM values were compared with those derived from MODIS B1 (lambda = 645 nm). Results showed that the Sentinel 2 MSI B4-B8b models achieved acceptable to high fitting accuracies, which explained 81-93% of the variation of CSPM. The validation results also showed the reliability of these six models, and the estimated CSPM explained 77-93% of the variation of measured CSPM with the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 36.87% to 21.54%. Among those, a model based on B7 (lambda = 783 nm) appeared to be the most accurate one. The Sentinel 2 MSI-derived CSPM values were generally consistent in spatial distribution and magnitude with those derived from MODIS. The CSPM derived from Sentinel 2 MSI B7 showed the highest consistency with MODIS on 15 August 2016, while the Sentinel 2 MSI B4 (lambda = 665 nm) produced the highest consistency with MODIS on 2 April 2017. Overall, this study demonstrated the applicability of Sentinel 2 MSI for CSPM retrieval in Poyang Lake, and the Sentinel 2 MSI B4 and B7 are recommended for low and high loadings of SPM, respectively.

Each year, the various species of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients were measured. The average contents of nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen in the four lakes are 0.195-0.0 mg/L, 0.038-0.143 mg/L, 0.004-0.168 mg/L, 0.006-0.740 mg/L, and 0.050-0.547 mg/L, respectively. The total phosphorus contents in Eling Lake, Longbao Lake and Sea Star were higher than Class I water quality standards, and the total nitrogen contents in Eling Lake, Sea Star and Zhaling Lake were higher than Class I water quality standards as well. The concentration contour maps of the nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, total phosphorus and total nitrogen showed that the indicators of the four lakes in the east, the west, and the center of the lake did not have the same trend. From 2012 to 2015, each of the measured nutrients showed a rising trend year by year. The four lakes are polluted by both endogenous and exogenous pollution, and it is necessary to limit the exogenous pollution and protect the alpine lakes immediately.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUL	2017	76	2					396	412		10.2166/wst.2017.091								WOS:000406789800015	28726705

A bench-scale experiment was conducted and several water quality parameters including turbidity, ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), total organic carbon and tetracycline concentration were evaluated, taking coagulation membrane filtration and magnetic flocculation membrane filtration processes as reference treatments. The experimental results showed that at the optimum doses of 20 mg.L-1 ferric chloride (FeCl3), 4 mg.L-1 magnetite (Fe3O4) and 6 mg.L-1 reclaimed magnetic flocs in RMFMF processes, removal efficiencies of above evaluated parameters ranged from 55.8% to 92.9%, which performed best. Simultaneously, the largest average particle size of 484.71 mu m and the highest fractal dimension of 1.37 of flocs were achieved, which did not only present the best coagulation effect helpful in enhancing the performance of removing multiple contaminants, but also lead to the generation of loose and porous cake layers favouring reduced permeate flux decline and membrane fouling.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUL	2017	76	2					490	500		10.2166/wst.2017.218								WOS:000406789800024	28726714

This study developed and applied an auto-imaging FlowCAM-based method for online observation and quantification of TEP in freshwater. Samples from reservoirs in Taiwan with a wide range of water quality were directly used to develop this methodology. Factors that potentially affect the measurement were tested. The results showed that characteristics of the particles measured instantaneously after staining samples with Alcian blue differed significantly from those measured at steady states, as a result of particle aggregation. Compared to traditional microscopic methods, this proposed method provides a simple, rapid, and less labor-intensive analysis with particle morphological conservation and a large number of particle attributes. By overcoming the limitations from the former, this technique would offer routine monitoring of these transparent particles from various freshwater sources and feed water in membrane filtration, hence facilitating the use of TEP as a critical parameter for biofouling investigation in water treatment. Application of the method for Taiwan reservoirs showed a wide variety of morphological forms of TEP and its abundance, up to 25,000 ppm.

The water samples were collected from first aquifer (AQ(1)), second aquifer (AQ(2)), and third aquifer (AQ(3)) at three depths, 50-60, 100-120, and 200-250 m, respectively. The results of aquifer water of three depths were interpreted by using different multivariate statistical techniques. Validation of desired method was checked by spiking standard addition method in studied aquifer water samples. The content of Hg in aquifer water samples was measured by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometer (CV-AAS). These determined values illustrate that the levels of Hg were higher than WHO recommended values for drinking water. All physicochemical parameters were higher than WHO permissible limits for drinking water except pH and SO42- in aquifer water. The positive correlation of Hg with other metals in aquifer water samples of AQ(1), AQ(2), and AQ(3) of Thar coalfield except HCO3- was observed which might be caused by geochemical minerals. The interpretation of determined values by the cluster technique point out the variations within the water quality parameter as well as sampling location of studied field. The aquifer water AQ(2) was more contaminated with Hg as compared to AQ(1) and AQ(3); it may be due to leaching of Hg from coal zone. The concentration of Hg in aquifer water obtained from different depths was found in the following decreasing order: AQ(2) < AQ(1) < AQ(3).																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	21					17731	17740		10.1007/s11356-017-9291-z								WOS:000406479200040	28601999

Research on the sources and flux loads of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) has great significance for the control and management of the eutrophication issues facing Lake Taihu. We used hydrologic and water quality surveys of the surrounding rivers, precipitation investigations, and an experimental simulation of suspended sediment to analyze the sources of TN and TP to Lake Taihu and to estimate the flux loads of TN and TP. Our results indicate that (1) surrounding rivers, atmospheric deposition, and sediment suspension were the three main sources of TN and TP, with annual flux loads of 29.6 thousand t and 2.8 thousand t, respectively; (2) for the flux load of TN, influxes from surrounding rivers accounted for 61.1%, while atmospheric deposition contributed 23.5%, with both of these sources varying seasonally. Total nitrogen released from sediments contributed 15.4% of the TN load of Lake Taihu; (3) for TP flux load, surrounding rivers accounted for 42.8% and also showed seasonal variation. Atmospheric deposition and sediment release accounted for 17.9 and 39.3% with no significant seasonal variation. This article quantitatively analyzed the sources and loads of TN and TP and provided a basis for pollution control in Lake Taihu.

Wind-induced flow velocity effects on nutrient suspension were investigated at a long narrow bay of large shallow Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China. Wind-induced reverse/compensation flow and consistent flow field probabilities at vertical column of the water were measured. The probabilities between the wind field and the flow velocities provided a strong correlation at the surface (80.6%) and the bottom (65.1%) layers of water profile. Vertical flow velocity profile analysis provided the evidence of delay response time to wind field at the bottom layer of lake water. Strong wind field generated by the west (W) and west-north-west (WNW) winds produced displaced water movements in opposite directions to the prevailing flow field. An exponential correlation was observed between the current velocities of the surface and the bottom layers while considering wind speed as a control factor. A linear model was developed to correlate the wind field-induced flow velocity impacts on nutrient concentration at the surface and bottom layers. Results showed that dominant wind directions (ENE, E, and ESE) had a maximum nutrient resuspension contribution (nutrient resuspension potential) of 34.7 and 43.6% at the surface and the bottom profile layers, respectively. Total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) average concentrations were 6.38, 1.5, and 0.03 mg/L during our field experiment at Eastern Bay of Lake Taihu. Overall, wind-induced low-to-moderate hydrodynamic disturbances contributed more in nutrient resuspension at Eastern Bay of Lake Taihu. The present study can be used to understand the linkage between wind-induced flow velocities and nutrient concentrations for shallow lakes (with uniform morphology and deep margins) water quality management and to develop further models.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	21					17900	17911		10.1007/s11356-017-9374-x								WOS:000406479200057	28616742

Estuarine retention and production of striped bass larvae: a mark-recapture experiment	ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Mark-recapture experiments were conducted in the tidal Nanticoke River (Chesapeake Bay) to determine how the salt front retains striped bass larvae and controls nursery production. During two spring spawning seasons, 25.1 million hatchery-produced, first-feeding larvae (5-12 days post-hatch) were released with chemically marked otoliths at selected locations and times. Surveys tracked the spatial and demographic fates of released and naturally spawned larvae. Released larvae dispersed rapidly within the freshwater tidal portion of the estuary and were retained above the salt front. Their distributions overlapped with natural larvae. Growth and mortality rates did not differ with respect to release location, but did vary with day of release, influenced by storm events and seasonal changes in temperature. In 1993, a group released during a storm event did not yield any recaptured larvae. Zooplankton concentrations in both years were likely sufficient for successful larval feeding. In spring 1993, a season of relatively high freshwater flow, nursery volume was 2.1-fold larger and juvenile production from larval releases was fourfold higher than in 1992. We propose that increased nursery volume reduces variance in water quality, enhances retention of larvae within the nursery, thus increasing production of larval striped bass.																	1054-3139	1095-9289				JUL-AUG	2017	74	6					1735	1748		10.1093/icesjms/fsw245								WOS:000406598500024

The production of bioenergy crops in specific landscape positions within a grain-crop field can serve the dual purpose of producing cellulosic biomass (nutrient recovery) while also providing regulating ecosystem services to improve water quality (nutrient reduction). The effectiveness of such a landscape design was evaluated by the strategic placement of a 0.8-ha short-rotation shrub willow (Salix miyabeana Seemen) bioenergy buffer along marginal soils in a 6.5-ha corn (Zea mays L.) field in a 6-yr field study in central Illinois. The impact of willow integration on water quality (soil water, shallow groundwater leaching, and crop nutrient uptake) and quantity (soil moisture and transpiration) was monitored in comparison with corn in the willow's first cycle of growth. Willows significantly reduced nitrate leachate in shallow subsurface water by 88% while maintaining adequate nutrient and water usage. Results suggest that willows offer an efficient nutrient-reduction strategy and may provide additional ecosystem services and benefits, including enhanced soil health. However, low values for calculated willow biomass will need to be readdressed in the future as harvest data become available to understand contributing factors that affected productivity beyond nutrient availability.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JUL-AUG	2017	46	4					811	818		10.2134/jeq2017.02.0082								WOS:000406860800013	28783783

In particular, there is a risk to the microbial quality of water, as high quantities of suspended sediment and fecal bacteria can enter into water systems. The feces of farmed red deer (Cervus elaphus, n = 206) from Canterbury and Southland, New Zealand, were analyzed with regard to the presence of Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, enterococci, and Yersinia spp. Enterococci and E. coli were isolated from all samples, with mean concentrations of 4.5 x 105 (95% CI 3.5 x 10(3), 5.6 10(7)) and 1.3 x 10(8) (95% CI 1.1 x 10(6), 1.5 x 10(10)) per gram of dry feces, respectively. Campylobacter spp. were isolated from 27 fecal samples, giving an overall prevalence of 13.1%. Campylobacter isolation rates were variable within and between regions (Canterbury 7.95% [95% CI 2-14%], Southland 16.95% [95% CI 10-24%]). Five out of 42 composite samples were positive for Yersinia enterocolitica, and one sample for Y. pseudotuberculosis. The overall prevalence ranges on a per-animal basis were therefore 2.43 to 11.17% and 0.49 to 2.91%, respectively. This study is the first to quantify the concentration of Campylobacter spp. present in healthy deer farmed in New Zealand. Deer feces are a potential source of human campylobacteriosis, with all genotypes isolated also previously observed among human cases. The fecal outputs from deer should be regarded as potentially pathogenic to humans and therefore be appropriately managed.

Application of Polyacrylamide (PAM) through Lay-Flat Polyethylene Tubing: Effects on Infiltration, Erosion, N and P Transport, and Corn Yield	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Polyacrylamides (PAMs), when applied as a soil amendment, purportedly improve soil infiltration, decrease erosion, and reduce offsite agrochemical transport. The effect of PAM on infiltration, erosion, agrochemical transport, and crop yield when applied in furrow to mid-southern US production systems has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to assess PAM effects on infiltration, erosion, corn (Zea mays L.) grain yield, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) transport when applied at 10 mg L-1 through lay-flat polyethylene tubing. A 2-yr field study was conducted at the Mississippi State Delta Research and Extension Center in Stoneville, MS, on a Dundee silt loam and a Forestdale silty clay loam. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications of each treatment: irrigated plus no PAM (control) and irrigated plus PAM at 10 mg L-1. Each irrigation event delivered 102 mm of water at 18.9 L m(-1) per furrow, and runoff was captured in a holding tank on the lower end of each plot. Pooled over year and soil texture, PAM increased infiltration and corn grain yield by 6% (P <= 0.0398).

Results indicate that PAM improves infiltration and corn grain yield on silt loam and silty clay loam textured soils; however, further research is required before PAM can be recommended as a best management practice for mitigating erosion and offsite agrochemical transport in mid-southern production systems.

Robustness of the models and compliance of their sensitivity with current quality limits are investigated. The following indicators are studied: total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is used to find linear correlations between absorbances and indicators of interest. Artificial samples are made by simulating a sludge leak on the wastewater treatment plant and added to the original dataset, then divided into calibration and prediction datasets. The models are built on the calibration set, and then tested on the prediction set. The best models are developed with: PLSR for COD (R-pred(2) = 0.80), TSS (R-pred(2) = 0.86) and turbidity (R-pred(2) = 0.96), and with a simple linear regression from absorbance at 208 nm (R-pred(2) = 0.95) for nitrate concentration. The input of artificial data significantly enhances the robustness of the models. The sensitivity of the UV/Vis spectrometry monitoring system developed is compatible with quality requirements of reclaimed water production processes.

A Bayesian Approach to Integrated Ecological and Human Health Risk Assessment for the South River, Virginia Mercury-Contaminated Site	RISK ANALYSIS												We conducted a regional-scale integrated ecological and human health risk assessment by applying the relative risk model with Bayesian networks (BN-RRM) to a case study of the South River, Virginia mercury-contaminated site. Risk to four ecological services of the South River (human health, water quality, recreation, and the recreational fishery) was evaluated using a multiple stressor-multiple endpoint approach. These four ecological services were selected as endpoints based on stakeholder feedback and prioritized management goals for the river. The BN-RRM approach allowed for the calculation of relative risk to 14 biotic, human health, recreation, and water quality endpoints from chemical and ecological stressors in five risk regions of the South River. Results indicated that water quality and the recreational fishery were the ecological services at highest risk in the South River. Human health risk for users of the South River was low relative to the risk to other endpoints. Risk to recreation in the South River was moderate with little spatial variability among the five risk regions. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis identified stressors and other parameters that influence risk for each endpoint in each risk region. This research demonstrates a probabilistic approach to integrated ecological and human health risk assessment that considers the effects of chemical and ecological stressors across the landscape.																	0272-4332	1539-6924				JUL	2017	37	7					1341	1357		10.1111/risa.12691								WOS:000406419500011	28121045					
J	Hao, Z; Gao, Y; Yang, TT				Hao, Zhuo; Gao, Yang; Yang, Tiantian			Seasonal variation of DOM and associated stoichiometry for freshwater ecosystem in the subtropical watershed: Indicating the optimal C: N: P ratio	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are three of the most important elements for estimating ecosystem biogenic elements status and algal growth. Therefore, the C:N:P ecological stoichiometry serves as an important reference to guide water quality management and helps elucidate the aquatic ecosystems mechanism. This study firstly provides the information on the seasonal changes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP)) under base-flow and rainfall-runoff scenarios, and then analyzes the optimal variation of C, N and P stoichiometry for freshwater ecosystem. Comparing the element contents under the two different scenarios, the results show that rainfall and runoff volumes are the major causes of the C: N: P ratios changes. We find out that the value of DOC is significantly higher than the value of DON and DOP. In addition, the DOC is the one of the major causes for trapping DOM, which accounts for 95% of the total DOM in freshwater ecosystem. And the change of DOP is the smallest as it compares to the changes of DOC and DON. It is discovered that the DOC: DON: DOP molar ratios in the watershed have an exponential distribution. The optimal DOC: DON: DOP ratio is 170-985:17-34:1 for the freshwater ecosystem. Moreover, the results suggest that the DTN: DTP (dissolved total nitrogen: dissolved organic phosphorus) ratio that equals to 10-64:1 will be the most beneficial for Xiangxi River basin in freshwater ecosystem. This result also indicates that the element of phytoplankton, which plays an important role in determining the trophic structures and community, is limited in the freshwater ecosystems.

J	Zahedi, S; Azarnivand, A; Chitsaz, N				Zahedi, Sina; Azarnivand, Ali; Chitsaz, Nastaran			Groundwater quality classification derivation using Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making techniques	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The paper introduces a novel framework of evaluating and validating the groundwater quality index (GWQI) by employing two Multi-Criteria-Decision-Making models (MCDMs) such as Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Compromise Programming (CP). GWQIs are plagued by discrete values which are attributed to excellent, good, poor, very poor, and unsuitable for drinking purpose classes. Furthermore, the existence of chemical parameters with low weights but high concentration values (or vice versa) reduces equilibrium of evaluations. Based on the literature review, MCDMs have not been applied so far to validate groundwater quality indexes. This simple yet practical structure assists the analysts to investigate robustness of a water quality index. In order to validate the classes, the intervals of classic GWQI were modified to figure out what changes were made to the classes of samples in the ranking table considering quality of 92 wells in the Varamin plain, Iran. After employment of the MCDMs, the results revealed that WQI could rarely evaluate water quality classes accurately. Several wells which were classified as "excellent quality" were belonged to the lower quality class. It also came true for other classes. The results demonstrated that TOPSIS could present a more precise analysis for the classes with a low number of wells. Moreover, increases in value of the sensitivity parameter of CP technique reduced the accuracy of results. Owing to proper application of MCDMs, one can suggest the use and development of MCDM-based water quality assessment models for future researches. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, in cases where measurements are lacking, its estimation is of the essence. In the present study, Morlet wavelet spectrum (periodicity) and multiple regression analyses were conducted on 15 chemical, biological and physical water quality variables sampled at 14 sites along the Hungarian section of the River Tisza and 4 sites from artificial tributary channels for 1993-2005. Results show that annual periodicity was not always to be found in the water quality parameters, at least at certain sampling sites. Periodicity was found to vary over space and time, but in general, an increase was observed in the company of higher trophic states of the river heading downstream. Based on the spatial distribution of the periodic behavior of the water quality parameters (runoff, ions, and nutrients given in so-called periodicity indices), an improved model was constructed which was capable of explaining about half (adjusted R-2 = 0.5) of the phytoplankton variance in the study area.

J	Carre, C; Meybeck, M; Esculier, F				Carre, Catherine; Meybeck, Michel; Esculier, Fabien			The Water Framework Directive's "percentage of surface water bodies at good status": unveiling the hidden side of a "hyperindicator"	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The Water Framework Directive (WFD) has provided the means of standardizing the way surface water bodies are monitored throughout the European Union (EU), using a common evaluation measure, the percentage of surface water bodies at good status, based largely on the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. However, the evaluation of good status is based on the way the WFD is implemented, which differs in each country. In this article, we analyze how the WFD is implemented in France, how the water agencies divide up the water bodies, the areas covered by their monitoring networks, and the modalities of obtaining data to provide the EU with the percentage of water bodies at good status. This analysis reveals that it is this hyperindicator itself that is at stake, obtained by successively aggregating values measured in time and space, from the monitoring station to the River Basin District (RBD), reducing vast amounts of information to a single measure per RBD, while long-term monitoring of the major European rivers and their sedimentary budgets, which show improvements in certain quality aspects, are largely overlooked by the WFD. When drawing up the indicator, the agencies identify certain biases but not others. This raises the question of its use and relevance for manager's and politicians, at both national and European level. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Our goal was to develop a realistic integrated conceptual model to analyze and envisage the consequence of fluctuating environmental parameters on the stress physiology of these fishes and their adaptive responses to thrive in such environment. Fishes were collected monthly throughout the year from 3 different study sites and various anti-oxidant (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) and detoxification enzymes were measured. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol and reproductive hormone 17 beta-estradiol were also measured as indicators of stress accumulation and reproductive status of the selected fish species. The study sites showed variations in physical factors such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature and salinity, which may be related to environmental fluctuation and/or pollution level. Such panel of multiple enzyme and hormone biomarkers in fish might be a useful tool to develop an assessment model. This study demonstrated a sharp indication of variation in the antioxidant enzyme profiles depending on the physical environment but the changes is exclusively site as well as species specific. To justify our assumptions cluster and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis have been done to investigate the ordination of physiological parameters and water quality parameters; if it varies for each species or not. Levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidise (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) showed variations depending on the physical environment but the changes is exclusively site as well as species specific. Finally, the prediction model and NMDS scaling confirmed MDA, GST and GSH as decisive factor to envisage steroid hormone, whereas organic carbon, temperature, ammonia and alkalinity as the major contributor of its prediction.

J	Luo, J; Huai, WX; Gao, M				Luo, Jing; Huai, Wenxin; Gao, Meng			Indicators for environmental dispersion in a two-layer wetland flow with effect of wind	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												For typical two-layer wetland flows where wind occurs frequently, indicators for flow and contaminant dispersion with wind effect are considered in this paper. Based on the general formulation for porous media flows, the velocity distribution of a fully developed flow through a wetland is illustrated, with that for a single-layer wetland flow under wind recovered as a special case. And the contrary wind of high speed might result in the appearance of an inverse-flow layer. For the more complex case of a two-layer wetland flow under wind, the more simplified method of asymptotic analysis is adopted instead of Aris's method of concentration moments to determine the dispersivity in terms of the longitudinal evolution of the depth-averaged concentration. And it is illustrated with the effect of dimensionless parameters. The velocity profile and environmental dispersivity for the two-layer wetland flow in the absence of wind can be included as a limiting case. Both the direction and the strength of the wind can affect the environmental dispersivity considerably under long-term evolution. Analytical solutions for the mean concentration and the region influenced by the contaminant cloud are derived. And for the instantaneous emission of typical contaminant constituents, the related indicators for water quality assessment, such as the critical length and duration of the influenced region are illustrated. The results show that the critical length and duration of the concentration cloud can change considerably because of the wind and vegetation heterogeneity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Diatoms to human uses: linking nitrogen deposition, aquatic eutrophication, and ecosystem services	ECOSPHERE												Nitrogen (N) loading to aquatic ecosystems can lead to eutrophication, changing the ecosystem within a waterbody, including primary productivity, water clarity, and food web dynamics. Nutrient loading often first affects the primary productivity of aquatic systems through shifts in phytoplankton communities. However, ecologically important changes in phytoplankton are often not relatable to the general public-whose behavior would need to change to alter patterns of nutrient loading. Therefore, we use the STressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services Framework to develop 154 chains that link changes in biological indicators of aquatic eutrophication (a shift in phytoplankton community) to final ecosystem services that people use or appreciate. We identify 13 ecological production functions (EPF) within three different ecosystems (alpine lakes, lakes, and estuaries) that connect changes in phytoplankton and algae to ecological endpoints that the general public and policy makers can appreciate. Using the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System, we identify 18 classes of human beneficiaries that potentially will be impacted by a change in one of these endpoints. We further assign strength-of-science scores to each link within the EPFs for the 154 chains according to how well each link is supported by current peer-reviewed literature. By identifying many pathways through which excess N loading in U. S. surface waters can affect ecosystems and ultimately the beneficiaries of ecosystem services, this work intends to draw attention to gaps in empirical ecological literature that constrain understanding of the magnitude of effects that excess N loading can have on human well-being. Results highlight the importance of intersections between the natural and social sciences when managers and policy makers evaluate impacts from ecological stressors. A balance between knowledgeable specialists proved key to applying this approach and will continue to remain important.

PPTA/PVDF/NWF blend membrane was prepared through the immersion precipitation phase inversion method and nonwoven coating technique. The membrane integrated technology including PPTA/PVDF/NWF blend membrane and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane was employed to treat the polyester/viscose spunlace nonwoven process wastewater. During the consecutive running of six months, the effects of membrane integrated technology on the COD, ammonia nitrogen, suspended substance and pH value of water were studied. The results showed that the removal rate of COD, ammonia nitrogen and suspended substance filtered by PPTA/PVDF blend membrane was kept above 90%. The pH value of the permeate water was about 7.1 and the relative water flux of blend membrane remained above 90%. After the deep treatment of RO membrane, the permeate water quality can meet the water circulation requirement of spunlace process.																	2005-8624	2092-7037				JUL	2017	8	4					311	321		10.12989/mwt.2017.8.4.311								WOS:000406176200001

Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) potentially process extra ammonium, so their abundance and diversity are of great ecological significance. This study aimed to reveal variations in communities of AOA and AOB as affected by aquaculture activities. Materials and methods From June to September 2012, water and sediments were sampled monthly in three ponds feeding Mandarin fish in a suburb of Wuhan City, China. Molecular methods based on ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene were used to determine abundance and diversity of AOA and AOB in the sediments. Results and discussion The pond with the highest fish stock had the highest nutrient loadings in terms of different forms of N and carbon (C) in both sediment and water. The abundance and diversity of AOB were significantly higher than those of AOA in the sediment. The AOB abundance showed a significantly positive relationship to concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in interstitial water, and both abundance and diversity of AOA were significantly negative to concentration of ammonium in interstitial water. Furthermore, AOA species affiliated to Nitrososphaera-like and Nitrosophaera Cluster was distinguishable from those observed in other aquaculture environments. Conclusions Nutrients in sediment were enriched by intensive aquaculture activity, among which organic N and C, together with ammonium and SRP, shaped the communities of ammonia oxidizers, with AOB dominating over AOA in terms of abundance and diversity.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				JUL	2017	17	7			SI		1928	1938		10.1007/s11368-017-1651-2								WOS:000405668700011

Interrelationship between the elements was done by correlation matrix and factor analysis which indicates the contribution from industrial and irrigation fields. Spatial interpolation of inverse distance method (IDW) maps of all the elements suggested that discharge of effluents from chemical factory (STERLITE, TAC, SPIC, HEAVY WATER PLANT, NILA SEA FOODS), municipal wastewater, fertilizers were added to the natural sources.

J	Babbar, R; Babbar, S				Babbar, Richa; Babbar, Sakshi			Predicting river water quality index using data mining techniques	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper demonstrates the application of data mining techniques to predict river water quality index. The usefulness of these techniques lies in the automated extraction of novel knowledge from the data to improve decision-making. The popular classification techniques, namely k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, Naive Bayes, artificial neural networks, rule-based and support vector machines were used to develop the predictive environment to classify water quality into understandable terms based on the Overall Index of Pollution. Experimentation was conducted on two types of data sets: synthetic and real. A repeated k-fold cross-validation procedure was followed to design the learning and testing frameworks of the predictive environment. Based on the validation results, it was found that the error rate in defining the true water quality class was 20 and 28%, 11 and 24%, 1 and 38% and 10 and 20% for the k-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, artificial neural network and rule-based classifiers for synthetic and real data sets, respectively. The decision tree and support vector machines classifiers were found to be the best predictive models with 0% error rates during automated extraction of the water quality class. This study reveals that data mining techniques have the potential to quickly predict water quality class, provided data given are a true representation of the domain knowledge.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							504	10.1007/s12665-017-6845-9								WOS:000406241000037						
J	Disli, E				Disli, E.			Hydrochemical characteristics of surface and groundwater and suitability for drinking and agricultural use in the Upper Tigris River Basin, Diyarbakir-Batman, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Investigations were undertaken into the quality of surface water and groundwater bodies within the Upper Tigris Basin in Turkey to determine their suitability for potable and agricultural use. In the study area, the majority of the groundwater and surface water samples belong to the calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type (Ca-Mg-HCO3) or magnesium-calcium-bicarbonate type (Mg-Ca-HCO3). Chemical analysis of all water samples shows that the mean cation concentrations (in mg/L) were in the order Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and that of anions are in the order HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > CO3- for all groundwater and surface water samples. The Mg (2+)/Ca2+ ratio ranges from 0.21 to 1.30 with most of the values greater than 0.5, indicating that weathering of dolomites is dominant in groundwater. The analysis reveals that all of the samples are neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 7.0-8.7). Groundwater and surface water suitability for drinking usage was evaluated according to the World Health Organization and Turkish Standards (TSE-266) and suggests that most of the samples are suitable for drinking. Various determinants such as sodium absorption ratio, percent sodium (Na %), residual sodium carbonate and soluble sodium percentage revealed that most of the samples are suitable for irrigation. According to MH values, all of the well water samples were suitable for irrigation purposes, but 80 and 81.82% of Zillek springs and surface water samples were unsuitable. As per the PI values, the water samples from the study area are classified as Class I and Class II and are considered to be suitable for irrigation.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							500	10.1007/s12665-017-6820-5								WOS:000406241000033

N.; Chaudhury, Shibani			Optimization of the quality of reverse osmosis-treated coal bed water in relation to its effect on soil health	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												During the time of extraction of coal bed methane (CBM) gas, vast quantity of imbedded water is also simultaneously released to the surface. Quality of this water is generally very poor owing to high salt content, and discharge of such water to the land surface frequently results in serious deterioration of the soil health through expansion of salinity and alkalinity problems. Use of reverse osmosis (RO) technology has appeared to be an effective proposition for bringing down the ionic concentrations of coal bed water (CBW) and facilitating their safe release. However, reclaiming the large volume of CBW through RO is expensive and is difficult to be afforded by many CBM producers from developing countries. In this study, we assessed the possibility of releasing an intermediate-quality RO-treated CBW which will not affect the health of the flooded soils and also will involve lesser cost of RO operation. The study showed that the quality of RO-treated CBW below 2 mmho/cm did not affect the incubated soil very adversely with regard to the major soil health attributes. However, exchangeable sodium percentage of the RO water-treated soil exhibited sharp increments when the EC value of the RO water increased to 2.0 mmho/cm resulting in development of high alkalinity. It is, therefore, suggested that while treating CBW with RO technology for discharging the resultant water to adjacent areas, it is not necessary to produce highly purified reclaimed water. Instead of going for high level of reclamation, discharge of a moderate-quality treated water may be an effective proposition for improving the economy of CBW reclamation without affecting the health of the CBW-influenced soils.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							474	10.1007/s12665-017-6809-0								WOS:000406241000007

D.; Chaturvedi, Aaditya			Hydrogeochemistry of coal mine water of North Karanpura coalfields, India: implication for solute acquisition processes, dissolved fluxes and water quality assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Mine water samples collected from different mines of the North Karanpura coalfields were analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), major anions, cations and trace metals to evaluate mine water geochemistry and assess solute acquisition processes, dissolved fluxes and its suitability for domestic, industrial and irrigation uses. Mine water samples are mildly acidic to alkaline in nature. The TDS ranged from 185 to 1343 mg L-1 with an average of 601 mg L-1. Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the dominant cations, while SO42- and HCO3- are the dominant anions. A high concentration of SO42- and a low HCO3(-)/(HCO3- + SO42-) ratio (< 0.50) in the majority of the water samples suggest that either sulphide oxidation or reactions involving both carbonic acid weathering and sulphide oxidation control solute acquisition processes. The mine water is undersaturated with respect to gypsum, halite, anhydrite, fluorite, aluminium hydroxide, alunite, amorphous silica and oversaturated with respect to goethite, ferrihydrite, quartz. About 40% of the mine water samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite, dolomite and jarosite. The water quality assessment shows that the coal mine water is not suitable for direct use for drinking and domestic purposes and needs treatment before such utilization. TDS, TH, F-, SO42-, Fe, Mn, Ni and Al are identified as the major objectionable parameters in these waters for drinking. The coal mine water is of good to suitable category for irrigation use. The mines of North Karanpura coalfield annually discharge 22.35 x 10(6) m(3) of water and 18.50 x 10(3) tonnes of solute loads into nearby waterways.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							489	10.1007/s12665-017-6813-4								WOS:000406241000022

Uncertainty assessment of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network model with implementation of the novel hybrid MLP-FFA method for prediction of biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen: a case study of Langat River	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Accurate prediction of the chemical constituents in major river systems is a necessary task for water quality management, aquatic life well-being and the overall healthcare planning of river systems. In this study, the capability of a newly proposed hybrid forecasting model based on the firefly algorithm (FFA) as a metaheuristic optimizer, integrated with the multilayer perceptron (MLP-FFA), is investigated for the prediction of monthly water quality in Langat River basin, Malaysia. The predictive ability of the MLP-FFA model is assessed against the MLP-based model. To validate the proposed MLP-FFA model, monthly water quality data over a 10-year duration (2001-2010) for two different hydrological stations (1L04 and 1L05) provided by the Irrigation and Drainage Ministry of Malaysia are used to predict the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved oxygen (DO). The input variables are the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphate (PO4), total solids, potassium (K), sodium (Na), chloride (Cl), electrical conductivity (EC), pH and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N). The proposed hybrid model is then evaluated in accordance with statistical metrics such as the correlation coefficient (r), root-mean-square error, % root-mean-square error and Willmott's index of agreement. Analysis of the results shows that MLP-FFA outperforms the equivalent MLP model. Also, in this research, the uncertainty of a MLP neural network model is analyzed in relation to the predictive ability of the MLP model. To assess the uncertainties within the MLP model, the percentage of observed data bracketed by 95 percent predicted uncertainties (95PPU) and the band width of 95 percent confidence intervals (d-factors) are selected. The effect of input variables on BOD and DO prediction is also investigated through sensitivity analysis. The obtained values bracketed by 95PPU show about 77.7%, 72.2% of data for BOD and 72.2%, 91.6% of data for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. The d-factors have a value of 1.648, 2.269 for BOD and 1.892, 3.480 for DO related to the 1L04 and 1L05 stations, respectively. Based on the values in both stations for the 95PPU and d-factor, it is concluded that the neural network model has an acceptably low degree of uncertainty applied for BOD and DO simulations. The findings of this study can have important implications for error assessment in artificial intelligence-based predictive models applied for water resources management and the assessment of the overall health in major river systems.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							503	10.1007/s12665-017-6842-z								WOS:000406241000036

V.; Kaur, Harjeet			An evaluation of irrigation water suitability in the Dwarka river basin through the use of GIS-based modelling	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A GIS-based irrigation water quality (IWQ) assessment of the Dwarka river basin was undertaken using water suitability indicators including determinations of values of: soluble sodium percentage, exchangeable sodium ratio or Kelly ratio, residual sodium carbonate, magnesium adsorption ratios, total hardness, sodium adsorption ratio and permeability indices, electrical conductivity, and fluoride concentrations (F-). Inverse distance weighted algorithms and weighted overlays were used to categorise irrigation water quality into a number of zones. The IWQ zonation analysis revealed that about 10% (42.15 km(2)) of the total area had water quality unsuitable for irrigation thereby potentially exposing a population of 35744 people from 110 villages to health risks, whereas the remaining 91.31% (393 km(2)) of the study area is considered to have suitable irrigation water. The villages of Nawapara, Sehara and Deucha have been particularly affected by poor water quality, potentially exposing 294 (100%), 114 (97%) and 1556 (87.76%) of the total village population, respectively, to health effects. Combined efforts of government agencies and NGOs in educating the local communities regarding artificial groundwater recharge, rainwater harvesting, watershed management can play a crucial role in the long run in minimising the potential impacts of poor water quality in these areas.

Quantifying flow interval-pollutant loading relationships in a rapidly urbanizing mixed-land-use watershed of the Central USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Rapid urbanization and agricultural development have altered flow and pollutant loading regimes resulting in poorly understood pollutant transport regimes and inadequately conceived management practices. Four years of hydrologic and water quality data (i.e., stream flow, suspended sediment, nitrate, nitrite, total ammonium, total inorganic nitrogen, and total phosphorus) were collected using a five-site nested-scale study design in a representative mixed-land-use watershed. Cumulative nested sub-basin drainage areas ranged from 79 to 208 km(2). Daily flow and load duration analyses were used to quantify land use impacts to flow-mediated pollutant loading at multiple flow intervals including high flows (0-10%), moist conditions (10-40%), mid-range flows (40-60%), dry conditions (60-90%), and low flows (90-100%). Pollutant loads ranged across four orders of magnitude for suspended sediments, and three orders of magnitude for nutrient loads during the high flow interval when nearly all of the total pollutant loads were transported (e.g., 99% of suspended sediments, 92% of total inorganic nitrogen, and 95% of total phosphorus loads). Results from stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed significant relationships between land use, flow, and pollutant load at high flows, moist conditions, and mid-range flow intervals (R-2 < 75.7; p < 0.035). No significant relationships (p < 0.05) were detected during dry conditions, or low flow intervals. Results highlight the need for consideration of combined flow and pollutant loading targets appropriate for watersheds modified by current and ongoing land use and point to a need for long-term and broad-scale efforts to develop achievable hydrologic and water quality recommendations especially in rapidly urbanizing mixed-land-use watersheds.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	14							484	10.1007/s12665-017-6819-y								WOS:000406241000017

Magnetized drinking water improves productivity and blood parameters in geese	REVISTA COLOMBIANA DE CIENCIAS PECUARIAS												Background: Quality of drinking water is an issue that imposes limits on animal farming. Improving water quality can be a solution to animal farming and to the enhancement of animal production in areas with limited water supplies. Objective: To evaluate the effect of water quality and magnetized water on productivity and blood parameters of Egyptian geese. Methods: One hundred and eight (108) Egyptian geese were randomly distributed among four water treatments in a 2x2 factorial design that included two types of water (tap water and well water) and exposure or non-exposure to magnetized tap water and magnetized well water. Results: Well water was of poor quality. Geese consuming this water exhibited lower productive and reproductive performance, lower progesterone and estrogen levels, impaired renal and liver functions and lower total antioxidant capacity. Their eggs had lower weight, lower yolk percentage and reduced shell thicknesses. The magnetic treatment improved the quality of both types of water, with a greater effect on well water. Magnetized water increased water consumption and performance of geese, along with improved renal and liver functions, reproductive hormones, and antioxidant status. Magnetized water improved growth performance, dressing percentage of goslings, and the amount of meat produced. Conclusion: Magnetized tap water improved body weight and feed conversion rate, besides renal and hepatic functions. It also increased production, quality and hatchability of eggs, and levels of reproductive hormones (i.e. progesterone and estrogen), and the antioxidant status in blood.

The model is based on organic character (specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA)) of the water samples and a laboratory measure of the microbiological (F-m) decay of chloramine. The applicability of the model for estimation of chloramine residual (and hence chloramine demand) was tested on several waters from different water treatment plants in Australia through statistical test analysis between the experimental and predicted data. Results showed that the model was able to simulate and estimate chloramine demand at various times in real drinking water systems. To elucidate the loss of chloramine over the wide variation of water quality used in this study, the model incorporates both the fast and slow chloramine decay pathways. The significance of estimated fast and slow decay rate constants as the kinetic parameters of the model for three water sources in Australia was discussed. It was found that with the same water source, the kinetic parameters remain the same. This modelling approach has the potential to be used by water treatment operators as a decision support tool in order to manage chloramine disinfection.

Determination of water environment standards based on water quality criteria in China: Limitations and feasibilities	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												There is a need to formulate water environment standards (WESs) from the current water quality criteria (WQC) in China. To this end, we briefly summarize typical mechanisms applied in several countries with longer histories of developing WESs, and three limitations to formulating WESs in China were identified. After analyzing the feasibility factors including economic development, scientific support capability and environmental policies, we realized that China is still not ready for a complete change from its current nation-wide unified WES system to a local-standard-based system. Thus, we proposed a framework for transformation from WQC to WESs in China. The framework consists of three parts, including responsibilities, processes and policies. The responsibilities include research authorization, development of guidelines, and collection of information, at both national and local levels; the processes include four steps and an impact factor system to establish water quality standards; and the policies include seven specific proposals.

The media filtration process, as the last step of the solid liquid separation process, is largely influenced by the characteristics of flocs, which are formed and controlled within the coagulation process. In a laboratory-based study, the impacts of the physical characteristics of flocs formed using aluminum sulfate on the filtration treatment of two comparative water samples were investigated using a photometric dispersion analyzer and a filterability apparatus. In general, the optimum dosage for maximizing filterability was higher than that for minimizing turbidity under neutral pH conditions. For a monomeric aluminum-based coagulant, the charge neutralization mechanism produced better floc characteristics, including floc growth speed and size, than the sweep flocculation mechanism. In addition, the charge neutralization mechanism showed better performance compared to sweep flocculation in terms of DOC removal and floc filterability improvement for both waters, and showed superiority in turbidity removal only when the raw water had high turbidity. For the different mechanisms, the ways that floc characteristics impacted on floc filterability also differed. The low variation in floc size distribution obtained under the charge neutralization mechanism resulted in the flocs being amenable to removal by filtration processes. For the sweep flocculation mechanism, increasing the floc size improved the settling ability of flocs, resulting in higher filter efficiency.

J	Dadi, T; Wendt-Potthoff, K; Koschorreck, M				Dadi, Tallent; Wendt-Potthoff, Katrin; Koschorreck, Matthias			Sediment resuspension effects on dissolved organic carbon fluxes and microbial metabolic potentials in reservoirs	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Sediment resuspension can affect water quality in lakes and reservoirs. We investigated the effect of sediment resuspension on benthic fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), metals (Fe, Mn), and nutrients (N, P) in three drinking water reservoirs using sediment core incubations. Measurement of Fe and Mn fluxes, and of microbial potentials to degrade organic substrates (Biolog EcoPlates T) were employed to understand mechanisms regulating DOC exchange after sediment resuspension. Single sediment resuspension events resulted in DOC fluxes [-104 (into sediment) to 46 (release) mmol m(-2) event(-1)] equal to 9-17 days of diffusive fluxes, making them a relevant process. Shallow reservoir sites were more likely to immobilize DOC after resuspension than deep sites. Sediment resuspension under anoxia always led to increases of DOC and metals in the overlying water. Resuspension did not necessarily mobilize nitrate or phosphorus even under anoxia, while ammonium was released after resuspension. Sediment resuspension increased hypolimnetic microbial potentials to utilize organic substrates in both spring and summer. However microbial cells counts and biomass either remained constant or decreased in summer. Adsorption to Fe minerals seemed to play a role in DOC immobilization as evidenced by a decrease in DOC: Fe molar ratios after resuspension in Fe limited sites and constant ratios in Fe rich sites. The results demonstrate a potential for DOC immobilization mainly by Fe minerals and to some extent by benthic microbes. Therefore, sediment resuspension can be beneficial for water quality in low nutrient, iron rich systems.

Effort-based predictors of headwater stream conditions: comparing the proximity of land use pressures and instream stressors on macroinvertebrate assemblages	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Environmental agencies are often faced with resource and time constraints in assessing waterbody health. We compared the strengths of varying levels of effort (field measures, laboratory chemistry, land use, and multiple combinations of these) to explain macroinvertebrate assemblage response along a gradient of urban land use intensity among 30 headwater streams in northern West Virginia. Because the spatial arrangement of human disturbance can govern biotic response, land use effects were analyzed at five spatial scales (whole catchment, and 100 m buffer zone at three fixed upstream distances and total stream network upstream of site); instream ecological measures included physical habitat, algal concentrations and water chemistry. Of the five spatial scales, we predicted that riparian land use nearest the site would explain the most variation but that instream measures would be the overall driver of the macroinvertebrate assemblages. Regression analysis evaluated the strength of single and multiple variables in explaining macroinvertebrate multimetric index (MMI) and ordination patterns, and revealed that assemblages were highly responsive to numerous stressors. In contrast to predictions, total upstream network riparian forest cover explained the most variation overall (83%) while specific conductance was the single best instream measure (64%). Stepwise regression models using combinations of field, laboratory, and land use variables all performed reasonably well but we found that a 3-variable model [% forest (catchment), road density, and specific conductance] that minimized colinearity and cost/effort explained 90% of the variation in the MMI. Validation and spatial autocorrelation results suggest that this model could potentially be used to forecast stream condition for prioritizing conservation and remediation efforts in headwaters within the ecoregion, and our general approach would be broadly applicable in other settings.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				JUL	2017	79	3					765	781		10.1007/s00027-017-0534-3								WOS:000405798900025

Demineralization is a critical process, since the quality and the stability of the PVC resins are highly influenced by the water quality used in the process. The main target values for water parameters are the following: conductivity < 10 mu Scm(-1), TOC < 10 mg L-1, and Al < 0.1 mg L-1. To achieve this quality, several reverse osmosis membranes from different materials and suppliers were tested and compared in the demineralization treatment. Polyamide membranes showed higher salt rejection compared to cellulose acetate membranes yielding both types similar flux and permeability. Two-pass reverse osmosis treatment was necessary to reach conductivities lower than 10 mu S cm(-1). On the other hand, a good quality effluent for reuse was obtained by combining RO and ionic exchange resins. Results showed that good quality PVC resins in terms of color, granulometry, porosity, and bulk density were obtained when demineralized water from two-pass reverse osmosis was used as fresh water, proving the feasibility of the effluent reuse in the PVC industry.

In this study, groundwater quality was monitored during December 2014 at 115 sites in the Hutuo River alluvial-pluvial fan region of northern China. Results showed that 21.7% of NO3- and 51.3% of total hardness samples exceeded grade III of the national quality standards for Chinese groundwater. In addition, results of gray relationship analysis (GRA) show that 64.3, 10.4, 21.7, and 3.6% of samples were within the I, II, IV, and V grades of groundwater in the Hutuo River region, respectively. The poor water quality in the study region is due to intense anthropogenic activities as well as aquifer vulnerability to contamination. Results of principal component analysis (PCA) revealed three major factors: (1) domestic wastewater and agricultural runoff pollution (anthropogenic activities), (2) water-rock interactions (natural processes), and (3) industrial wastewater pollution (anthropogenic activities). Using PCA and absolute principal component scores-multivariate linear regression (APCS-MLR), results show that domestic wastewater and agricultural runoff are the main sources of groundwater pollution in the Hutuo River alluvial-pluvial fan area. Thus, the most appropriate methods to prevent groundwater quality degradation are to improve capacities for wastewater treatment and to optimize fertilization strategies.

J	Heddam, S; Kisi, O				Heddam, Salim; Kisi, Ozgur			Extreme learning machines: a new approach for modeling dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration with and without water quality variables as predictors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In this paper, several extreme learning machine (ELM) models, including standard extreme learning machine with sigmoid activation function (S-ELM), extreme learning machine with radial basis activation function (R-ELM), online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM), and optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OP-ELM), are newly applied for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration with and without water quality variables as predictors. Firstly, using data from eight United States Geological Survey (USGS) stations located in different rivers basins, USA, the S-ELM, R-ELM, OS-ELM, and OP-ELM were compared against the measured dissolved oxygen (DO) using four water quality variables, water temperature, specific conductance, turbidity, and pH, as predictors. For each station, we used data measured at an hourly time step for a period of 4 years. The dataset was divided into a training set (70%) and a validation set (30%). We selected several combinations of the water quality variables as inputs for each ELM model and six different scenarios were compared. Secondly, an attempt was made to predict DO concentration without water quality variables. To achieve this goal, we used the year numbers, 2008, 2009, etc., month numbers from (1) to (12), day numbers from (1) to (31) and hour numbers from (00:00) to (24:00) as predictors. Thirdly, the best ELM models were trained using validation dataset and tested with the training dataset. The performances of the four ELM models were evaluated using four statistical indices: the coefficient of correlation (R), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). Results obtained from the eight stations indicated that: (i) the best results were obtained by the S-ELM, R-ELM, OS-ELM, and OP-ELM models having four water quality variables as predictors; (ii) out of eight stations, the OP-ELM performed better than the other three ELM models at seven stations while the R-ELM performed the best at one station. The OS-ELM models performed the worst and provided the lowest accuracy; (iii) for predicting DO without water quality variables, the R-ELM performed the best at seven stations followed by the S-ELM in the second place and the OP-ELM performed the worst with low accuracy; (iv) for the final application where training ELM models with validation dataset and testing with training dataset, the OP-ELM provided the best accuracy using water quality variables and the R-ELM performed the best at all eight stations without water quality variables. Fourthly, and finally, we compared the results obtained from different ELM models with those obtained using multiple linear regression (MLR) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). Results obtained using MLPNN and MLR models reveal that: (i) using water quality variables as predictors, the MLR performed the worst and provided the lowest accuracy in all stations; (ii) MLPNN was ranked in the second place at two stations, in the third place at four stations, and finally, in the fourth place at two stations, (iii) for predicting DO without water quality variables, MLPNN is ranked in the second place at five stations, and ranked in the third, fourth, and fifth places in the remaining three stations, while MLR was ranked in the last place with very low accuracy at all stations. Overall, the results suggest that the ELM is more effective than the MLPNN and MLR for modelling DO concentration in river ecosystems.

The zoea developmental toxicity of Scylla serrata from stage I to stage II was determined by exposing to a range of secondary treated sewage concentrations. Results indicated that the relative progress of zoea stage I to zoea stage II negatively correlated with increasing sewage concentrations. Data was analyzed statistically to determine lethal, median lethal, sublethal, low observed effect, and no observed effect concentrations. Water samples collected along the Buckingham canal discharge zone were also analyzed for its toxicity to the larval development. Fecal indicator organisms chosen to determine the water quality were E. coli, enterococci, C. perfrigens, and F+ coliphages. Concentrations of these fecal markers were determined in the raw influent, primary treated effluent, secondary treated effluent, and in four discharge zone sites. Data showed that this biological toolbox is helpful for providing baseline information on the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment and environmental health of the discharge zone.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	20					16927	16932		10.1007/s11356-017-9196-x								WOS:000405580000033	28577142

The results revealed that article was the most used document type accounting for 94.79% (14,006) of the records. With the rapid development of eutrophication domain after 2004, the annual article publishing amount also grew notably in each country, with the list of US tops. International cooperation was not enough to compare with that between institutions. An author keyword analysis showed that "phosphorus," "nutrients," "nitrogen," "water quality," "phytoplankton," and "sediment" were the most popular keywords. And it was also found that climate change, life cycle assessment, and chlorophyll a appear with high frequency in recent years, indicating that the eutrophication mechanism analysis might turn from uni-factor microresearch to multi-factor macroresearch, and the eutrophication management research tends to be whole-process management research. In addition, the future focuses of research directions, including (1) eutrophication and its ecosystem response, (2) eutrophication management, (3) eutrophication and climate change interactions, (4) eutrophication monitoring and forecast, and (5) ecological restoration of eutrophication. These findings are useful for the future endeavor of eutrophication academic research.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	20					17103	17115		10.1007/s11356-017-9294-9								WOS:000405580000048	28585009					
J	Byrne, P; Runkel, RL; Walton-Day, K				Byrne, Patrick; Runkel, Robert L.; Walton-Day, Katherine			Synoptic sampling and principal components analysis to identify sources of water and metals to an acid mine drainage stream	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Combining the synoptic mass balance approach with principal components analysis (PCA) can be an effective method for discretising the chemistry of inflows and source areas in watersheds where contamination is diffuse in nature and/or complicated by groundwater interactions. This paper presents a field-scale study in which synoptic sampling and PCA are employed in a mineralized watershed (Lion Creek, Colorado, USA) under low flow conditions to (i) quantify the impacts of mining activity on stream water quality; (ii) quantify the spatial pattern of constituent loading; and (iii) identify inflow sources most responsible for observed changes in stream chemistry and constituent loading. Several of the constituents investigated (Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) fail to meet chronic aquatic life standards along most of the study reach. The spatial pattern of constituent loading suggests four primary sources of contamination under low flow conditions. Three of these sources are associated with acidic (pH < 3.1) seeps that enter along the left bank of Lion Creek. Investigation of inflow water (trace metal and major ion) chemistry using PCA suggests a hydraulic connection between many of the left bank inflows and mine water in the Minnesota Mine shaft located to the north-east of the river channel. In addition, water chemistry data during a rainfall-runoff event suggests the spatial pattern of constituent loading may be modified during rainfall due to dissolution of efflorescent salts or erosion of streamside tailings. These data point to the complexity of contaminant mobilisation processes and constituent loading in mining-affected watersheds but the combined synoptic sampling and PCA approach enables a conceptual model of contaminant dynamics to be developed to inform remediation.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	20					17220	17240		10.1007/s11356-017-9038-x								WOS:000405580000058	28589273

Field investigations and numerical simulations were carried out to examine the groundwater dynamics in the intertidal zone of a carbonate sandy aquifer on the tropical island of Rarotonga, Cook Islands. The study site was featured by distinct cross-shore slope breaks on the beach surface. Measured pore water salinities revealed different distributions under the influences of different beach profiles, inland heads, and tidal oscillations. Fresh groundwater was found to discharge around a beach slope break located in the middle area of the intertidal zone. The results indicate a strong interplay between the slope break beach morphology and tidal force in controlling the nearshore groundwater flow and solute transport. The fresh groundwater discharge location was largely determined by the beach morphology in combination with the tidal force. The nearshore groundwater flow can be very sensitive to beach slope breaks, which induce local circulation and flow instabilities. As slope breaks are a common feature of beaches around the world, these results have important, general implications for future studies of nutrients transport and transformations in nearshore aquifers and associated fluxes via submarine groundwater discharge.

The objectives were to assess the water quality outflow parameters, the potential of L. minor concerning the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and four azo dyes (Acid blue 113, reactive blue 198, Direct Orange 46 and Basic Red 46) and the plants' growth rate. Findings show that all mean outflow values of COD, total dissolved solids (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower within the outdoor compared to the indoor experiment except the dissolved oxygen (DO). The COD removal was low for both experiments. The outflow TDS values were acceptable for all ponds. The pond systems were able to reduce only BR46 significantly (p < 0.05) for the tested boundary conditions. Removals under laboratory conditions were better than those for semi-natural environments, indicating the suitability of operating the pond system as a polishing step in warmer regions. The mean outflow values of zinc and copper were below the thresholds set for drinking and irrigation waters and acceptable for L. minor. The dyes inhibited the growth of the L. minor.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	19			SI		16031	16040		10.1007/s11356-017-9245-5								WOS:000405561200014	28537020

Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been successfully applied for modeling DO content in aquatic ecosystems with limited data. However, the efficacy of these AI models in predicting DO levels in the hypoxic river systems having multiple pollution sources and complicated pollutants behaviors is unclear. Given this dilemma, we developed a promising AI model, known as support vector machine (SVM), to predict the DO concentration in a hypoxic river in southeastern China. Four different calibration models, specifically, multiple linear regression, back propagation neural network, general regression neural network, and SVM, were established, and their prediction accuracy was systemically investigated and compared. A total of 11 hydro-chemical variables were used as model inputs. These variables were measured bimonthly at eight sampling sites along the rural-suburban-urban portion of Wen-Rui Tang River from 2004 to 2008. The performances of the established models were assessed through the mean square error (MSE), determination coefficient (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) model efficiency. The results indicated that the SVM model was superior to other models in predicting DO concentration in Wen-Rui Tang River. For SVM, the MSE, R-2, and NS values for the testing subset were 0.9416 mg/L, 0.8646, and 0.8763, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that ammonium-nitrogen was the most significant input variable of the proposal SVM model. Overall, these results demonstrated that the proposed SVM model can efficiently predict water quality, especially for highly impaired and hypoxic river systems.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	19			SI		16062	16076		10.1007/s11356-017-9243-7								WOS:000405561200017	28537025

Some physicochemical parameters as well as somatic indexes, gills and liver histopathology, genotoxicity, and biochemical biomarkers were evaluated. The highest gonadosomatic index (GSI) and antioxidant parameters (catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities, non-protein thiols), as well as the lowest damage to biomolecules (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, DNA damage) were observed in site 0 (Piava River), which is located at an environmental protected area. Site 1, located in the same river, but downstream site 0 and outside the protection area, presents some level of impact. Fish from site 2 (Antas River), which lack of riparian forest and suffer from silting, presented the highest micronucleus incidence and no melanomacrophages. Differently, individuals from site 3 (Xambr River) and site 4 (Pinhalzinho River) which receive surface runoff from Umuarama city, urban and industrial sewage, have the highest incidences of liver and gill histopathological alterations, including neoplasia, which indicated the worst health conditions of all sites. In particular, site 4 had high levels of total nitrogen and ammonia, high turbidity, and very low oxygen levels, which indicate important chemical impact. Comparison of the biomarkers in fish allowed classification of the five sites in terms of environmental impact and revealed that sites 3 and 4 had particular poor water quality.

However, the low nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) restricted its widely application. To date, many attempts have been conducted to improve its NUE. In the present study, effect of micro- and macro-nutrient addition on performance of tilapia-pak choi aquaponics was investigated. Results showed that the addition of micro- and macro-nutrients improved the growth of plant directly and facilitated fish physiology indirectly, which subsequently increased NUE of aquaponics from 40.42 to 50.64%. In addition, remarkable lower total phosphorus concentration was obtained in aquaponics with micro- and macro-nutrient addition, which was attributed to the formation of struvite. Most of the added micro-nutrients were enriched in plant root, while macro-nutrients mainly existed in water. Moreover, no enrichment of micro- and macro-nutrients in aquaponic products (i.e., fish and plant leaves) was observed, indicating that it had no influence on food safety. The findings here reported manifest that appropriate addition of micro- and macro-nutrients to aquaponics is necessary, and would improve its economic feasibility.

The mixtures of dyes were selected as the researching examples. A novel self-developed optical fibre sensor system was used to directly measure UV-Vis spectroscopy of dye solution. The system could realize on-line in-situ detection of the spectrum for higher concentration solution, without sampling and dilution process. In this study, both methods, principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares (PLS), were used to develop regression models (Absorbance-COD) respectively to predict COD of training set and prediction set after the spectrum preprocessing including z-score, smoothing, 1st derivation, etc. With experiments using mixtures of dyes solution, the results show that PCR model with z-score preprocessing performed best in the three preprocessing methods (0. 961 for determination coefficient 122, 21. 8 for root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP)). Further study identified that using z-score, PLS model (0. 974 for R-2, 19. 6 for RMSEP) achieved better results than PCR did. The results indicated that without the process of digestion, it was feasible to use UV-Vis combined with z-score preprocessing and PLS calibration for COD detection. The method could apply to the rapid and accurate determination of COD in mixtures dyes solution and proved to be successful in enhancing the prediction performance of COD and showed good potential to be applied in on-line water quality monitoring. The overall results showed that the self-developed system could be applied to on-line detection of COD in mixtures dyes solution. This study laid a foundation for further implementation of on-line in-situ detection of COD and other water quality parameters of dyeing wastewater.

The Biological Flora of Coastal Dunes and Wetlands: Halodule wrightii Ascherson	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Information on the seagrass Halodule wrightii was assembled describing its taxonomy, phylogeny, and geographic distribution and its plant communities, ecology, population biology, reproduction, and biotic interactions. The objective was to review the current understanding of its role as a pioneer species that thrives in nutrient-rich waters and has a broad tolerance range to abiotic factors, such as salinity, temperature, depth, and light. Its short life cycle, high degree of vegetative reproduction, and rapid growth allow it to colonize areas that have undergone disturbances, e.g., those affected by hurricanes. It occurs in monospecific stands or mixed with other seagrasses (Ruppia maritima, Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme, Zostera marina) and exhibits both vegetative and sexual reproduction but does not flower often. Worsening water quality is the main cause of seagrass decline in the world, along with other human activities, such as fishing, dredging, boating, and tourism. Given its usefulness, it is important to establish programs for the restoration and management of this species.

Depuration and Relaying: A Review on Potential Removal of Norovirus from Oysters	COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND FOOD SAFETY												Pollution of coastal waters can result in contamination of bivalve shellfish with human enteric viruses, including norovirus (NoV), and oysters are commonly implicated in outbreaks. Depuration is a postharvest treatment involving placement of shellfish in tanks of clean seawater to reduce contaminant levels; this review focuses on the efficacy of depuration in reducing NoV in oysters. There have been many NoV outbreaks from depurated oysters containing around 10(3) genome copies/g oyster tissue, far exceeding the median infectious dose (ID50). Half of the published NoV reduction experiments showed no decrease in NoV during depuration, and in the remaining studies it took between 9 and 45.5 d for a 1-log reduction-significantly longer than commercial depuration time frames. Surrogate viruses are more rapidly depurated than NoV; the mean number of days to reduce NoV by 1 log is 19, and 7.5 d for surrogates. Thus, surrogates do not appear to be suitable for assessing virological safety of depurated oysters; data on reduction of NoV infectivity during depuration would assist evaluations on surrogate viruses and the impact of methods used. The longer persistence of NoV highlights its special relationship with oysters, which involves the binding of NoV to histo-blood group-like ligands in various tissues. Given the persistence of NoV and on-going outbreaks, depuration as currently performed appears ineffective in guaranteeing virologically safe oysters. Conversely, relaying oysters for 4 wk is more successful, with low NoV concentrations and no illnesses associated with products. The ineffectiveness of depuration emphasizes the need for coastal water quality to be improved to ensure oysters are safe to eat.

In this study, hydrogeochemical and isotope methods were employed to determine regional and local hydrogeology and characteristics of the basin. Optical, thermal and radar remote sensing products were used to update geological and structural maps of the basin and determine sampling points using the judgment sampling method. A total of 363 samples from wells, springs, rivers, lakes, swamps and rain were collected for this study, and an additional 270 water quality data sets were added from previous studies. These data were analyzed for their hydrogeochemical characteristics and isotope signatures. Analysis of the oxygen, deuterium and tritium isotopes shows the groundwater of the basin is modern water. Among all basins in Ethiopia, the Baro-Akobo Basin shows the highest enrichment. This indicates the proximity of the rainfall sources, which presumably are the Sudd and other wetlands in South Sudan. The hydrochemical properties of the waters show evapotranspiration is the dominant hydrologic process in the basin and explains the large amount of water that is lost in the lowland plain. Analysis of radon-222 shows no significant groundwater flux over the wetlands, which are part of Machar Marshes. This shows evaporation to be dominant hydrologic process in this zone. Results from all analyses help explain the limited holding capacity of the aquifers in the recharge zone and their vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts and climate variability. There is a trend of decreasing surface flow and rainfall and increasing water soil erosion.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							466	10.1007/s12665-017-6773-8								WOS:000405283600021

In the present study, a study of the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater was undertaken in the Sonipat district of Haryana in India together with the use of stable isotope (delta O-18 and delta D) measurements and GIS analysis. A total of 53 groundwater samples were collected from seven blocks of the district, and 14 water quality parameters and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta D) were analysed to infer hydrogeochemical processes taking place in the area. The integration of hydrochemistry with GIS is very helpful to understand the factors governing in the area. The majority of the samples showed Na-Cl type of hydrochemical facies. The trilinear plot for major cations and anions in groundwater indicates dominance of sodium, calcium, chloride and bicarbonate ions. Nitrate plumes in the groundwater appear to be migrating in groundwater from the central and south-western parts of the area towards the urbanized areas. A total of 64% of the samples exceed the maximum permissible limit of 1.5 mg/L given by WHO for fluoride. Besides natural sources such as silicate and carbonate weathering, ion exchange, and reverse ion exchange, the leaching of surficial salts and untreated industrial wastes along with unregulated abstraction are contributing to poor groundwater quality in the study area. An assessment of saturation indices has shown that groundwater in the area is unsaturated with respect to anhydrite, halite and gypsum suggesting significant contribution of Ca2+, Mg2+ and other ions in the groundwater. A scatter plot of delta O-18 versus Cl also suggests mixing of saline water with fresh groundwater.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							465	10.1007/s12665-017-6789-0								WOS:000405283600020

However, the quality of groundwater in this area is deteriorating due to intensive industrial and agricultural activities, and this has a great adverse impact on human health. In order to better understand the pollution status of groundwater and the health risks to local residents, comprehensive water quality index was applied to assess the quality of drinking water in Yulin City, Northwest China, and sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage, residual sodium carbonate and permeability index were used to evaluate the quality of irrigation water. Moreover, the health risks caused by ingestion of groundwater were evaluated using the model proposed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. The results show that all groundwater samples for irrigation will not induce soil salinization, but more than half of them are not suitable for drinking, and Fe, Mn, TH, Mg2+ and NO3-N are the common contaminants which are mainly from natural processes, industrial and agricultural activities. The health risk assessment indicates that children face greater non-carcinogenic risk than adults. The order of contribution of contaminants to non-carcinogenic risk is NO3- > As > F- > Fe > Mn > Ba2+ > Cr6+ > Zn > NO2-. The average carcinogenic risk of carcinogens (Cr6+ and As) is 1.17 x 10(-4) and 1.37 x 10(-4) for adults and children, respectively, which surpasses the permissible level (1 x 10(-6)) stipulated by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the PR China. Hence, effective measures are highly demanded to manage groundwater pollution and reduce the risks to human health.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2017	76	13							467	10.1007/s12665-017-6781-8								WOS:000405283600022

Interrelationship between geochemical elements of sediment and groundwater at Samrak Park Delta of Nakdong River Basin in Korea: multivariate statistical analyses and artificial neural network approaches	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This research was conducted at Samrak Park Delta of Nakdong River Basin in Busan Metropolitan City, Korea. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the interrelationship of geochemical elements in sediments and groundwater through multivariate statistical analyses and a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network model. The mean concentrations of chemical elements were Si (46%), Fe (16.9%), Al (15.7%), K (7.5%) and Ca (4.5%) in sediments, and Na (8650 mg/L), Mg (999 mg/L), Ca (432 mg/L), K (293 mg/L) and Cl (17,640 mg/L) in groundwater, respectively. The principal component analysis produced 3 kinds of factors with the variances of 63.37, 27.02 and 9.62%, respectively. It is suggested that the chemical components of sediments and groundwater were mainly originated from source rocks and seawater intrusion, with the minor impacts of irrigation and industry. Cluster analysis also showed that chemical elements were mainly controlled by the natural geogenic sources and seawater intrusion. Multilayer perceptron of artificial neural network (ANN) presented the good interrelationship between sediment and groundwater. The determination coefficients (R-2) between ANN predicted values and observed values in groundwater showed the high values of 0.61-0.97 except Mg, Mn and Sr. It is revealed that the chemical components of sediment and groundwater were derived from local geological origin and from the minor impact of anthropogenic sources. Multivariate analyses and ANN contributed to the identification of the mutual relationship between the geochemical elements of sediment and those of groundwater.

However, human activities significantly decreased groundwater quality. In this study, the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater quality was evaluated in an arid area where long-term paper wastewater irrigation has been implemented. For this study, seven wells were regularly monitored for physicochemical parameters over a period of 1 year. Statistical and graphical approaches were applied to interpret the spatiotemporal variation of groundwater quality parameters in the wastewater irrigation zone. Correlation analysis was also carried out to reveal the sources of some major ions. The results indicate that the groundwater type in the study area is dominated by the Cl-Na, followed by the HCO3-Na, the HCO3-Ca center dot Mg, and the SO4 center dot Cl-Ca center dot Mg types. Groundwater in the area is significantly contaminated locally with fluoride, nitrite and ammonia, and the chemical oxygen demand levels were increased in some groundwater monitoring wells. Most contaminants showed an increasing trend from the Yellow River water irrigation zone toward the wastewater irrigation zone. Rock weathering, mineral dissolution, and cation exchange are important processes controlling groundwater quality, but human activities, such as wastewater irrigation, play an undeniable role in affecting groundwater quality in this area. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the formation and circulation of groundwater under human activities and provide a scientific basis for regional water quality evaluation, water quality improvement, and protection.

Watershed specific crop and livestock management data were acquired through personal interviews, surveys, feedlot permits, and site visits. These data, together with published resources, were used to develop an open-source Agricultural P Balance Calculator to compute P use efficiencies of livestock operations, crop production, and collectively, the watershed's agricultural system. In 2010, the P use efficiency was 1.7, indicating that more P was being exported from the watershed as agricultural products than imported, implying that crops were "mining" P from watershed soils. The Agricultural P Balance Calculator enables users to identify production areas where P use efficiency strategies could be incorporated into conservation implementation planning, thereby enhancing prospects for meeting P reduction goals.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JUL-AUG	2017	72	4					395	404		10.2489/jswc.72.4.395								WOS:000405360300013

Firstly, the bidirectional operation energy performance of eco-gate pump was verified by the model test. The results showed that the numerical simulation results were consistent with the model test results with an error of +/- 2% at the optimum operating condition both in the pumping mode and the powering mode, which verified the reliability and accuracy of numerical stimulation. The major sources of error associated with the power losses were due to the fact that the blade tip leakage and the blade deflection were not considered in computational fluid dynamics simulation. The thickened blade edges also contributed to the differences. On this basis, different schemes of runner blade's setting angles, blade number, blade lean angle, bulb body's length, and shoulder profile line were designed, and their influences on eco-gate pump's performance were analyzed to choose the best runner type and bulb body's profile line through the computational fluid dynamics numerical simulations. The numerical results showed that the eco-gate pump had the best hydraulic performance when the blade's setting angle was phi=23 degrees, blade number z=5, blade's lean angle a=0 degrees and bulb body's shoulder profile line was convex type with length L=100mm. The developed pump showed the highest efficiency of 70.95% under the condition of design discharge of 500L/s and design lift of 1.0m. Furthermore, the whole flow pattern of the optimized pump was analyzed. Overall, the eco-gate pump presented in this paper can make use of its low-lift pumping function to replenish the target water body more efficient than other similar products. At the same time, it also can utilize the micro-head water energy fully to generate power.																	0954-4062	2041-2983				JUL	2017	231	14					2636	2649		10.1177/0954406216638882								WOS:000405529800007

Summertime hypoxia has been observed in Chesapeake Bay for over 80 years, with scientific attention and understanding increasing substantially during the past several decades after rigorous and routine monitoring programs were put in place. More recently, annual forecasts of the severity of summer hypoxia and anoxia (no oxygen) from simple empirically derived nutrient load-response models have been made. A review of these models over the past decade indicates that they have been generally accurate, with the exception of a few summers when wind events or storms significantly disrupted the water column. Hypoxic and anoxic conditions, as well as their forecasts, have received increased media attention over the past 5 years, contributing to an ongoing public dialogue about Chesapeake Bay restoration progress.

Linking the biological impacts of ocean acidification on oysters to changes in ecosystem services: A review	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Continued anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are acidifying our oceans, and hydrogen ion concentrations in surface oceans are predicted to increase 150% by 2100. Ocean acidification (OA) is changing ocean carbonate chemistry, including causing rapid reductions in calcium carbonate availability with implications for many marine organisms, including biogenic reefs formed by oysters. The impacts of OA are marked. Adult oysters display both decreased growth and calcification rates, while larval oysters show stunted growth, developmental abnormalities, and increased mortality. These physiological impacts are affecting ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services by oyster reefs. Oysters are ecologically and economically important, providing a wide range of ecosystem services, such as improved water quality, coastlines protection, and food provision. OA has the potential to alter the delivery and the quality of the ecosystem services associated with oyster reefs, with significant ecological and economic losses. This review provides a summary of current knowledge of OA on oyster biology, but then links these impacts to potential changes to the provision of ecosystem services associated with healthy oyster reefs.

A Comparison of Main and Side Channel Physical and Water Quality Metrics and Habitat Complexity in the Middle Mississippi River	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Worldwide large rivers have been severely modified by human intervention. Many modifications result in disconnection of the river from floodplain and off-channel habitats generally characterized by lower velocities and Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. shallower depths relative to the main channel, conditions vital to many organisms. Extensive levees on the Middle Mississippi River (MMR) have cut off backwater systems and disconnected the river from 80% of its floodplain. However, the system is characterized by large side channels associated with islands. We examined a long term data set for differences in physical (e.g. depth and velocity) and water quality metrics (e.g. temperature, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll, % organic matter) between the main and side channels of a 128-km reach of the MMR. We compared variability between main and side channels using the coefficient of variation (COV). All metrics differed between habitats. Side channels were shallower with lower velocities and had greater mean and COV of % organic matter and more variable dissolved oxygen concentrations. Velocity, temperature, and suspended solids were similar in the spring. COVs were lowest in both habitats during the spring for all metrics except temperature and DO. Resource management in the MMR tends to focus on maintaining existing side channels because of the difficulty of working in the heavily used navigation channel. This study shows that these actions protect areas that function differently than the main channel for most of the year. However, our results also highlight the need for restoration activities aimed at restoring floodplain connectivity, especially during the spring.

Effects of Urban Sprawl on Riparian Vegetation: Is Compact or Dispersed Urbanization Better for Biodiversity?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Compact urbanization is the main strategy for sustainable urban development. However, it is yet unclear whether compact urban forms are ecologically more favourable than dispersed ones. In this paper, we studied the effects of urban sprawl on the riparian vegetation condition in one of the most degraded watersheds in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, Argentina. We conducted random sampling of the riparian vegetation at sites along streams in the basin and assessed urban indicators at the reach and sub-watershed scales for each of those sites in a geographic information system: urban area, impervious surface, population density and two landscape metrics of dispersion. The indicators assessed explained a high proportion of the variability of the vegetation response variables, thereby confirming the importance of urban sprawl pressure in shaping riparian communities in fluvial ecosystems. Dispersed urbanization had more positive than negative effects on the vegetation in the study area. Riverbanks associated with dispersed urbanization had more plant species, including exotics, when urban sprawl was assessed at the local scale. At the sub-watershed scale, dispersed urbanized areas were richer in native plants and most of the functional groups, and poorer in exotic species. The model of the compact city, including bio-corridors along watercourses, has been proposed for the Buenos Aires conurbation process for the next decades. Our results showed that the quality of existing river corridors across the compact matrix was not desirable and best practices for redesigning a more sustainable landscape structure are necessary, including the restoration of habitats for wetland species.

Researchers used a root cause analysis (RCA) approach to identify and address factors affecting water quality in the HD and portable RO machines at our institution. Methods: A multidisciplinary team reviewed processes, interviewed staff members, and identified opportunities to improve the current sampling and machine disinfection processes. The RCA team identified and implemented 5 interventions, of which 3 were process (changes in water sampling technique, machine disinfection processes, and allocation of machine maintenance duties) and 2 were structural (regular cleaning of water sampling tubes and spigots and addition of new water sampling sites in the system) measures. Results: Postimplementation of new protocols, 100% of water cultures of HD and RO machines consistently met the required regulatory standards as recorded over a period of 8 months. Conclusions: RCA approach helped improve patient safety, quality of care, streamlined processes, and improved efficiencies of work for staff within the HD program.

We used a framework to present the effect of the two fundamental social, political and economic changes on the biodiversity and ecosystems of Hungary from 1989 until recently. First, following the democratic transformation in 1989 social, political, economic and institutional drivers led to the increase in farmland biodiversity, improvement of water quality due to less chemical use and decrease of habitat loss within protected areas. At the same time, land privatisation and uncertain ownership led to habitat degradation, abandonment and fragmentation. These changes were coupled with the spread of alien species and re-ploughing. The second change was joining the European Union in 2004. This resulted in the establishment of the Natura 2000 network, the application of the relevant EU policies, and access to conservation related EU funds, which contributed to successful habitat restorations increasing of some charismatic species' populations. Meanwhile, however, disappearance of extensive farming practices, agricultural intensification and infrastructural developments driven by some increasing EU funds led to a net habitat loss, degradation and decline in biodiversity, with more than half of the species of European importance having unfavourable conservation status. Increased support for conservation institutions, adaptive and extended agri-environment schemes and further research and monitoring to establish, refine and supervise sustainable management practices, including water management, are needed to prevent further biodiversity loss in the coming years.

J	Pramanik, BK; Shu, L; Jegatheesan, V				Pramanik, Biplob Kumar; Shu, Li; Jegatheesan, Veeriah			A review of the management and treatment of brine solutions	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												There has been a considerable expansion in the use of desalination plants for supplying potable water to many communities in the world. However, the production of brine, which is known to be a concentrated solution, is an integral part of the operation of the desalination plant, which faces critical environmental challenges because of its high salinity. Therefore, a cost-effective and environmentally benign brine management system is required prior to its proper disposal. Currently, several disposal options including surface water discharge, deep well injection, and evaporation ponds have been used. However, these processes are unsustainable and their use is limited by a high capital cost and limited applications. Various conventional treatments including physicochemical, oxidation and biological processes with varying extents of organics removal have been reported. Nowadays, membrane-based technologies appear to be cost-effective methods for managing brine concentrate as they can recover valuable resources and produce clean water with high recovery. This paper critically reviews current technologies for concentrate management, including disposal practices and treatment processes. The characteristics of the brine in terms of water quality and its impact on open water bodies are discussed. This paper examines emerging membrane processes such as forward osmosis, membrane distillation, and electrodialysis that show promise for minimizing brine volume, in recovering valuable resources and improvement of water recovery. This paper also discusses the fact that integrated membrane processes are better for brine management for resource recovery together with water purification in wastewater treatment facilities and can achieve a zero liquid discharge.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				JUL 1	2017	3	4					625	658		10.1039/c6ew00339g								WOS:000404718800004

Emerging investigators series: hydrogen sulfide production in municipal stormwater retention ponds under ice covered conditions: a study of water quality and SRB populations	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Stormwater retention ponds have become an integral component of stormwater management across the world. Under prolonged hypoxia, these ponds are capable of releasing large quantities of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas. In this study, water quality constituents and bacterial communities in sediment were analyzed in two stormwater retention ponds, RSP1 (reference pond) and RSP2 (problematic pond) over a period of two years, to identify the factors driving H2S production and understand the microbial community associated with H2S production in stormwater ponds. It was found that the background total sulfide concentrations were not statistically different between the two ponds during summer (RSP2: 0.012 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.010 +/- 0.001 mg L-S-1) and were statistically different during ice covered winter operation (RSP2: 6.375 +/- 1.135 mg L-S-1; RSP1: 0.016 +/- 0.009 mg L-S-1). The study showed a lack of correlation between total sulfide concentrations in RSP2 and soluble chemical oxygen demand, sulfate, soluble total phosphorus, total ammonia nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite and pH. However, DO concentrations demonstrated a strong negative correlation with total sulfides concentrations in RSP2 (p < 0.006, r = -0.58, n = 26), which confirmed DO as the critical water quality parameter linked to H2S production in stormwater ponds. Finally, it was found that seasonal change, ice covered versus non-ice covered operation and a comparison between a H2S emitting pond and non-emitting pond all did not promote a measurable proliferation of sulfatereducing bacteria nor a community shift in the sulfate-reducing bacterial population. Hence, the study demonstrates that sulfide production is a result of increased ubiquitous SRB activity in stormwater retention ponds and the emission of H2S gas is not indicative of SRB proliferation or a population shift towards specific SRB taxa.

Improved contaminant removal in vegetated stormwater biofilters amended with biochar	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												The potential for carbonaceous sorbents to improve contaminant removal (particularly for trace organic contaminants, TOrCs) in stormwater biofilters was evaluated in intermittently dosed, vegetated columns simulating scaled-down treatment systems. Columns amended with biochar or granular activated carbon (GAC) were evaluated relative to performance benchmarks set by columns representing unamended treatment systems (i.e., sand filters and vegetated biofilters). Biochar amendment (6.7 wt%, 33 vol%) strongly improved TOrC removal, despite potential fouling due to the presence of an upper compost-amended layer. Biochar-amended biofilter columns maintained greater than 99% TOrC removal throughout five months of dosing with TOrC-spiked creek water (equivalent to approximately 1.3 years of runoff volume), relative to less than 50% removal of most TOrCs by unamended biofilter columns. GAC amendment (6.7 wt%, 12.5 vol%) also improved TOrC removal, though less effectively than biochar (>70% removal), because the bio-char's lower density (i.e., higher volume composition) and smaller particles improved performance. These results indicate that full-scale biochar-amended biofilters could potentially remove TOrCs effectively for several years, as treatment depths up to five times greater than the 10 cm experimental depth may be feasible for full-scale systems. Further, contaminant removal survey experiments conducted after 6 months of operation revealed that biochar amendment improved removal of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, nitrate, and total dissolved phosphorus in biofilters by greater than 60%. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of biochar amendment to broadly improve contaminant removal in biofilters, motivating and informing the application of full-scale biochar-amended biofilters for improved water quality.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				JUL 1	2017	3	4					726	734		10.1039/c7ew00070g								WOS:000404718800011

Various methods are available for Chl a analysis, but the majority of them are of limited throughput and require considerable effort and time from the operator. The present study describes a high-throughput, microplate-based fluorometric assay for rapid quantification of Chl a in phytoplankton extracts. Microplate sealing combined with ice cooling was proved an effective means for diminishing solvent evaporation during sample loading and minimized the analytical errors involved in Chl a measurements with a fluorescence microplate reader. A set of operating parameters (settling time, detector gain, sample volume) were also optimized to further improve the intensity and reproducibility of Chl a fluorescence signal. A quadratic regression model provided the best fit (r (2) = 0.9998) across the entire calibration range (0.05-240 pg mu L-1). The method offered excellent intra- and interday precision (% RSD 2.2 to 11.2%) and accuracy (% relative error -3.8 to 13.8%), while it presented particularly low limits of detection (0.044 pg mu L-1) and quantification (0.132 pg mu L-1). The present assay was successfully applied on marine phytoplankton extracts, and the overall results were consistent (average % relative error -14.8%) with Chl a concentrations (including divinyl Chl a) measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). More importantly, the microplate-based method allowed the analysis of 96 samples/standards within a few minutes, instead of hours or days, when using a traditional cuvette-based fluorometer or an HPLC system.

A global, spatially-explicit assessment of irrigated croplands influenced by urban wastewater flows	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												When urban areas expand without concomitant increases in wastewater treatment capacity, vast quantities of wastewater are released to surface waters with little or no treatment. Downstream of many urban areas are large areas of irrigated croplands reliant on these same surface water sources. Case studies document the widespread use of untreated wastewater in irrigated agriculture, but due to the practical and political challenges of conducting a true census of this practice, its global extent is not well known except where reuse has been planned. This study used GIS-based modeling methods to develop the first spatially-explicit estimate of the global extent of irrigated croplands influenced by urban wastewater flows, including indirect wastewater use. These croplands were further classified by their likelihood of using poor quality water based on the spatial proximity of croplands to urban areas, urban wastewater return flow ratios, and proportion of wastewater treated. This study found that 65% (35.9 Mha) of downstream irrigated croplands were located in catchments with high levels of dependence on urban wastewater flows. These same catchments were home to 1.37 billion urban residents. Of these croplands, 29.3 Mha were located in countries with low levels of wastewater treatment and home to 885 million urban residents. These figures provide insight into the key role that water reuse plays in meeting the water and food needs of people around the world, and the need to invest in wastewater treatment to protect public health.																	1748-9326					JUL	2017	12	7							074008	10.1088/1748-326/aa75d1								WOS:000404943700001

The faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) used in the present study included Escherichia colt (E. colt) and Enterococcus (ENT). FIB and aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB) were quantified during July 2015 (dry season) and November 2015 (rainy season) in order to assess the quality of drinking water from wells (n = 3; P1-P3), and two rivers, the River Lukemi (RLK, n=3) and River Luini (RLN, n = 2) in the city of Kikwit, which is located in the province of Kwilu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kikwit is well known for its outbreaks of persistent and recurrent waterborne diseases including Entamoeba, Shigella, typhoid fever, cholera, and Ebola Viral Hemorrhagic Fever. Consequently, E. colt, ENT, and AMB were quantified in water samples according to the standard international methods for water quality determination using the membrane filtration method. The FIB characterization was performed for human-specific Bacteroides by PCR using specific primers. The results obtained revealed high FIB concentrations in river samples collected during both seasons. For example, E. colt respectively reached 4.3 x 10(4) and 9.2 x 10(4) CFU 100 mL(-1) in the dry season and the wet season. ENT reached 5.3 x 10(3) CFU 100 mL(-1) during the dry season and 9.8 x 10(3) CFU 100 mL(-1) in the wet season. The pollution was significantly worse in the wet season compared to the dry season. Surprisingly, no faecal contamination was observed in well water samples collected in the dry season while E. coil and ENT were detected in all wells in the wet season with values of 6, 7, and 11 CFU mL-1 for E colt in wells P1-P3, respectively and 3, 5, 9 CFU mL(-1)for ENT in the same wells. Interestingly, the PCR assays for human-specific Bacteroides HF183/HF134 indicated that 97-100% captured in all analyses of isolated FIB were of human origin. The results indicate that contamination of E. coil, ENT, and AMB in the studied water resources increases during the wet season. This study improves understanding of the microbiological pollution of rivers and wells under tropical conditions and will guide future municipal/local government decisions on improving water quality in this region which is characterised by persistent and recurrent waterborne diseases. Although the epidemiology can be geographically localised, the effects of cross border transmission can be global. Therefore, the research results presented in this article form recommendations to municipalities/local authorities and the approach and procedures can be carried out in a similar environment.

Integration of population census and water point mapping data-A case study of Cambodia, Liberia and Tanzania	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 has expanded the Millennium Development Goals' focus from improved drinking-water to safely managed water services. This expanded focus to include issues such as water quality requires richer monitoring data and potentially integration of datasets from different sources. Relevant data sets include water point mapping (WPM), the survey of boreholes, wells and other water points, census and household survey data. This study examined inconsistencies between population census and WPM datasets for Cambodia, Liberia and Tanzania, and identified potential barriers to integrating the two datasets to meet monitoring needs. Literatures on numbers of people served per water point were used to convert WPM data to population served by water source type per area and compared with census reports. For Cambodia and Tanzania, discrepancies with census data suggested incomplete WPM coverage. In Liberia, where the data sets were consistent, WPM-derived data on functionality, quantity and quality of drinking water were further combined with census area statistics to generate an enhanced drinking-water access measure for protected wells and springs. The process revealed barriers to integrating census and WPM data, including exclusion of water, points not used for drinking by households, matching of census and WPM source types; temporal mismatches between data sources; data quality issues such as missing or implausible data values, and underlying assumptions about population served by different water point technologies. However, integration of these two data sets could be used to identify and rectify gaps in WPM coverage. If WPM databases become more complete and the above barriers are addressed, it could also be used to develop more realistic measures of household drinking-water access for monitoring.

J	Dinka, MO				Dinka, Megersa Olumana			Lake Basaka Expansion: Challenges for the Sustainability of the Matahara Irrigation Scheme, Awash River Basin (Ethiopia)	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												The Matahara Sugar Estate (MSE), after nearly 60years of irrigation, is experiencing the effects of waterlogging and salinization in some fields. The problem is believed to be the result of the expansion of (saline and alkaline) Lake Basaka towards the plantation fields. The objective of this study was to determine the geometry of the lake (area and shape) in roughly the past half- century (1957-2015) from both Landsat images and local information and then assess its negative effects on MSE's soil and water quality. Monthly groundwater (GW) depth was monitored using piezometer tubes. Water and soil samples were collected from each of the piezometer locations and analysed for important physico-chemical parameters. The results indicate that the lake expanded approximately 47.3km(2) in the past half-century. The soil quality was found to be very poor in plantation sections with very shallow GW depth and severe salinity conditions. The lake, as revealed by the results, is intruding into the groundwater system of MSE on the Abadir side. Assuming continuation of the past trends, the lake is expected to inundate parts of MSE in the next few years and, hence, challenge the production and productivity of MSE significantly. The lake has the potential to join the Awash River, thereby impacting all downstream irrigation developments in the basin and the livelihood of the people depending on the water resources. As the area is situated in the uppermost part of Main Ethiopian Rift Valley, other factors are expected to exacerbate its expansion even in the future. Overall, the study results present the potential damage caused by the lake to MSE and provides valuable information for the reclamation measures to be taken for the sustainability of MSE.

J	Darzi-Naftchali, A; Karandish, F; Asgari, A				Darzi-Naftchali, Abdullah; Karandish, Fatemeh; Asgari, Ahmad			Diagnosing Drainage Problems in Coastal Areas Using Machine-Learning and Geostatistical Models	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												This study focuses on diagnosing drainage problems in the coastal areas of Iran by using geostatistical methods, support vector machines (SVMs) and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Groundwater level (WD) and quality were monitored at 37 shallow wells scattered over a 25 000ha area at different times. Using prepared raster maps of pH, ESP, EC and WD by the best method, drainage problems were categorized into eight classes. Both SVM and ANFIS models significantly improved predicted data for pH, ESP, EC and WD compared with geostatistical models, while SVMs provided slightly better results which were used for further analysis. More than 60% of the area needs drainage to lower the groundwater table in pre-planting and post-harvest periods, while during the growing seasons, more than about 72% of the area requires drainage for salinity control. Based on the results, identifying drainage problems at basin scale is possible with cost-efficient machine learning models with minimum time and data requirements and investment for detailed field surveys.

Hydraulic conditions are primarily governed by transient events generated by valve modulation or pumping action. We investigate the impact of transient events on the rate of chlorine decay under various flow conditions. To comprehensively compare the performance of existing chlorine models, 14 candidate models for chlorine concentration were used under various transient conditions. Two-dimensional (2D) transient flow analysis was conducted to investigate the unknown processes of chlorine decay under transient conditions. General formulations for modeling chlorine decay were used to comprehensively study the decay under unsteady conditions and to effectively incorporate the impact of transients into generic model structures. The chlorine decay patterns in the constructed water distribution system were analyzed in the context of transient events. Linear relationships between the model parameters and the frequency of transient events were determined under unsteady conditions, and the impact of turbulence intensity was successfully incorporated into model parameter evaluations. The modeling results from 2D transient analysis exhibit similar predictability as those obtained from calibration using the genetic algorithm.																	1464-7141	1465-1734				JUL	2017	19	4					522	537		10.2166/hydro.2017.082								WOS:000404905000003						
J	Zhao, Y; Song, KS; Wen, ZD; Fang, C; Shang, YX; Lv, LL				Zhao, Ying; Song, Kaishan; Wen, Zhidan; Fang, Chong; Shang, Yingxin; Lv, Lili			Evaluation of CDOM sources and their links with water quality in the lakes of Northeast China using fluorescence spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The spatial distributions of the fluorescence intensities F-max), for chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) components, the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310) and their correlations with water quality of 19 lakes in the Songhua River Basin (SHRB) across semiarid regions of Northeast China were examined with the data collected in September 2012 and 2015. The 19 lakes were divided into two groups according to EC (threshold value = 800 mu S cm(-1)): fresh water (N = 13) and brackish water lakes (N = 6). The fluorescent characteristics of CDOM in the 19 lakes were investigated using excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) coupled with parallel factor (PARAFAC) and multivariate analysis. Two humic-like components (C1 and C3), one tryptophan-like component (C2), and one tyrosine-like component (C4) were identified by PARAFAC. The component C4 was not included in subsequent analyses due to the strong scatter in some colloidal water samples from brackish water lakes. The correlations between F-max for the three EEM-PARAFAC extracted CDOM components C1-C3, the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310) and the water quality parameters (i.e., TN, TP, Chl-a, pH, EC, turbidity (Turb) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)) were determined by redundancy analysis (RDA). The results of RDA analysis showed that spatial variation in land cover, pollution sources, and salinity/EC gradients in water quality affected F-max for the fluorescent components C1-C3 and the fluorescence indices (FI370 and FI310). Further examination indicated that the CDOM fluorescent components and the fluorescence indices (FI370 and F1310) did not significantly differ (t-test, p > 0.05) in fresh water (N = 13) and brackish water lakes (N = 6). There was a difference in the distribution of the average F-max for the CDOM fluorescent components between Cl to C3 from agricultural sources and urban wastewater sources in hypereutrophic brackish water lakes. The F-max for humic-like components Cl and C3 spatially varied with land cover among the 19 lakes. Our results indicated that the spatial distributions of F-max for CDOM fluorescent components and their correlations with water quality can be evaluated by EEM-PARAFAC and multivariate analysis among the 19 lakes across semiarid regions of Northeast China, which has potential implication for lakes with similar genesis.

Assessment of nutrient loadings of a large multipurpose prairie reservoir	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The relatively low water flow velocities in reservoirs cause them to have high capacities for retaining sed-iments and pollutants, which can lead to a reduction in downstream nutrient loading. Hence, nutrients can progressively accumulate in reservoirs, resulting in the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems and water quality. Lake Diefenbaker (LD) is a large multipurpose reservoir, located on the South Saskatchewan River (SSR), that serves as a major source of freshwater in Saskatchewan, Canada. Over the past several years, changes in land use (e.g. expansion of urban areas and industrial developments) in the reservoir's catchment have heightened concerns about future water quality in the catchment and in the reservoir. Intensification of agricultural activities has led to an increase in augmented the application of manure and fertilizer for crops and pasture. Although previous research has attempted to quantify nutrient retention in LD, there is a knowledge gap related to the identification of major nutrient sources and quantification of nutrient export from the catchment at different spatial scales. Using the SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed (SPARROW) model, this gap has been addressed by assessing water quality regionally, and identifying spatial patterns of factors and processes that affect water quality in the LD catchment. Model results indicate that LD retains about 70% of the inflowing total nitrogen (TN) and 90% of the inflowing total phosphorus (TP) loads, of which fertilizer and manure applied to agricultural fields contribute the greatest proportion. The SPARROW model will be useful as a tool to guide the optimal implementation of nutrient management plans to reduce nutrient inputs to LD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xian, CC; Qi, ZM; Tan, CS; Zhang, TQ				Xian, Changchi; Qi, Zhiming; Tan, Chin S.; Zhang, Tie-Quan			Modeling hourly subsurface drainage using steady-state and transient methods	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Computer models have been frequently used to simulate the hydrologic and environmental processes in subsurface-drained cropland. The widely-tested steady-state Hooghoudt (ssH) equation, implemented in the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2, version 2.94.00), serves in simulating subsurface drainage. However, transient methods such as the integrated Hooghoudt (inH) and van Schilfgaarde (vanS) equations have seldom been implemented in models. In the present study, RZWQM2's hydrologic component was modified to initiate the soil water redistribution process when rainfall occurred. The three drainage equations (ssH, inH and vanS) were tested in each of two versions of RZWQM2 (original and modified). Field data from Iowa (2007-2008) and Ontario (2009-2010) were used to evaluate different model version x equation combinations' simulation accuracy at both daily and hourly scales, evaluated using the percent of bias (PBIAS), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), and the Index of Agreement (IoA). On a daily scale and across equations, for the Iowa data the original model (PBIAS <= 14.96, NSE <= 0.40, >= 0.69) was outperformed by the modified model (PBIAS <= 6.48, NSE >= 0.70, IoA >= 0.76). Similarly, for the Ontario data, the original model (PBIAS <= 8.87,NSE >= 0.19, IoA >= 0.65) was outperformed by the modified model (PBIAS <= 3.59,NSE >= 0.31,IoA >= 0.67). However, based on a parity of PBIAS, NSE and IoA values, hourly scale tile drainage computed using the modified model equipped with transient equations did not improve model performance compared with the original ssH equation.

It varies spatio-temporally over large waterbodies and its well distributed measurement on field is tedious and time consuming. Generally, normalized difference turbidity index (NOT!), or band ratio, or regression analysis between turbidity concentration and band reflectance, approaches have been adapted to retrieve turbidity using multispectral remote sensing data. These techniques usually provide qualitative rather than quantitative estimates of turbidity. However, in the present study, spectral similarity analysis, between the spectral characteristics of spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing data and spectral library generated on field, was carried out to quantify turbidity in the part of Chilika Lake, Odisha, India. Spatial spectral contextual image analysis, spectral angle mapper (SAM) technique was evaluated for the same. The SAM spectral matching technique has been widely used in geological application (mineral mapping), however, the application of this kind of techniques is limited in water quality studies due to non availability of reference spectral libraries. A spectral library was generated on field for the different concentrations of turbidity using well calibrated instruments like field spectro-radiometer, turbidity meter and hand held global positioning system. The field spectra were classified into 7 classes of turbidity concentration as <5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-25, 25-45, 45-100 and >100 NTU for analysis. Analysis reveal that at each location in the lake under consideration, the field spectra matched with the image spectra with SAM score of 0.8 and more. The observed turbidity at each location was also very much falling in the estimated turbidity class range. It was observed that the spectral similarity approach provides more quantitative estimate of turbidity as compared to NDTI. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Metal-fluxes characterization at a catchment scale: Study of mixing processes and end-member analysis in the Meca River watershed (SW Spain)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Fluxes of acidity and contaminants from acid mine drainage (AMD) sources to the receiving surface water bodies were studied in a mining-impacted watershed (Meca River, SW Spain) using a novel methodology based on the joint application of EMMA and MIX codes. The application of EMMA and elemental ratios allowed delimiting the end-members responsible for water quality variations at a catchment scale. The further application of MIX quantified the significant impact of AMD on the river quality; less than 10% of AMD relative contribution is enough to maintain acidic conditions during most of the year. The mixing model also provided information about the element mobility, distinguishing those elements with a quasi conservative behavior (e.g., Cu, Zn, Al, Co or Ni) from those affected by mineral precipitation/dissolution (e.g., K, Si, Na, Sr, Ca, Fe, Pb, or As). Floods are the main driver of dissolved and, mainly particulate, contaminants in the catchment. Thus, the first rainfall events in November only accounted for 19% of the annual Meca flow but yielded between 26 and 43% of the net acidity and dissolved metal loads (mainly, Fe, As and Pb). Concerning particulate transport, around 332 tons of particulate Fe, 49 tons of Al, 0.79 tons of As and 0.37 tons of Pb were recorded during these first floods. The particulate As concentration can be up to 34 times higher than the dissolved one during floods and between 2 and 4 times higher for Fe, Pb and Cr. This integrated modeling approach could be a promising and useful tool to face future restoration plans in derelict mines worldwide. This approach would allow prioritizing remedial measures, achieving an environmental and cost-effective restoration of degraded areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Teegavarapu, RSV; Nayak, A				Teegavarapu, Ramesh S. V.; Nayak, Anurag			Evaluation of long-term trends in extreme precipitation: Implications of in-filled historical data use for analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study focuses on the assessment of biases from infilling missing precipitation data on the detection of long-term change using parametric and non-parametric statistical techniques. Long-term historical precipitation data available for almost 100 years at 53 rain gages in south Florida, USA, with gages having varying lengths of missing data are used for the study. Precipitation data with gaps and time series with spatial interpolated data are analyzed. Chronologically complete datasets are often used in climate variability studies by analyzing data in multiple temporal windows. The temporal windows selected in this work coincide with Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO) cool and warm phases that strongly influence precipitation extremes and characteristics in the study region. Selection of these windows has helped in evaluating the extremes derived based on infilled and unfilled data. The frequency of occurrence of precipitation extremes over a pre-specified threshold is also analyzed. Results indicate that infilled precipitation data introduce large biases in the statistical trends and over and under-estimate low and high extremes respectively. Evaluation of three extreme precipitation indices (i.e. Rx1 day, R25mm and R50mm) indicates that bias increases with increase in amount of missing data. Nonparametric hypothesis tests indicate that statistical distributions of data of infilled and unfilled data are different when the data infilled is more than 5% of the entire data. Infilled data also introduced high variability in precipitation extremes in AMO cool and warm phases along with the changes in the frequency of occurrence of extreme events over a threshold.

Upon reaching freshwater, these nutrients can lead to extensive growth of harmful algae, which results in eutrophication. Many Chinese lakes are subject to such eutrophication, especially in highly polluted areas, and as such, understanding nutrient fluxes to these lakes offers insights into the varying processes governing pollutant fluxes as well as lake water quality. Here we analyse water quality data, recorded between 2006 and 2014 in 862 freshwater lakes in four geographical regions of China, to assess the input of phosphorus from human activity. We find that improvements in sanitation of both rural and urban domestic wastewater have resulted in large-scale declines in lake phosphorus concentrations in the most populated parts of China. In more sparsely populated regions, diffuse sources such as aquaculture and livestock farming offset this decline. Anthropogenic deforestation and soil erosion may also offset decreases in point sources of pollution. In the light of these regional differences, we suggest that a spatially flexible set of policies for water quality control would be beneficial for the future health of Chinese lakes.

Although amphibians might not be expected to host mammalian faecal indicator bacteria (FIB), it is possible that they may have human FIB on their skin after exposure to human waste. We collected faeces and skin wash from green tree frogs (Litoria caerulea) from a natural environment, a suburban site, and a suburban site near a creek occasionally contaminated with sewage effluent. We used molecular techniques to test for FIB that are routinely used to indicate human faecal contamination. Enterococci colonies were isolated from both faecal and skin wash samples, and specific markers (Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron) were found in frog faeces, demonstrating that these markers are not human-or mammalian-specific. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron was detected in frogs from both natural and urban sites, but E. faecium was only associated with the sewage impacted site.																	0008-4166	1480-3275				JUL	2017	63	7					633	637		10.1139/cjm-2017-0119								WOS:000404463600007	28414918

This paper employs formal concept analysis (FCA) to examine water reporting of selected companies in the US food and beverage industry that have followed the water guidelines set forth by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and in the disclosure guidelines of the CEO Water Mandate. Assessments of water consumption and water withdrawal were cited more often in our sample firms' CSR reports. FCA results also identify the major focus of our sample firms as setting sustainable water management goals and water quality strategy. Other important issues included leadership, partnership, and employee involvement. While the FCA text mining tool is demonstrated using water-related behaviors here, it can be used to identify continuous improvement opportunities and examine many other issues of interest to corporate stakeholders in other industries and communities worldwide.

Previous studies have developed many numeric modeling methods and data driven approaches for water quality assessment. The cluster analysis, an approach widely used for grouping data, has also been employed. However, there are complex correlations between water quality variables, which play important roles in water quality assessment but have always been overlooked. In this paper, we analyze correlations between water quality variables and propose an alternative method for water quality assessment with hierarchical cluster analysis based on Mahalanobis distance. Further, we cluster water quality data collected form coastal water of Bohai Sea and North Yellow Sea of China, and apply clustering results to evaluate its water quality. To evaluate the validity, we also cluster the water quality data with cluster analysis based on Euclidean distance, which are widely adopted by previous studies. The results show that our method is more suitable for water quality assessment with many correlated water quality variables. To our knowledge, it is the first attempt to apply Mahalanobis distance for coastal water quality assessment.

J	Hayat, E; Baba, A				Hayat, Ehsanullah; Baba, Alper			Quality of groundwater resources in Afghanistan	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water is the main source of energy production and economy in Afghanistan where agriculture accounts for more than 50% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Access to safe drinking water is still a problem in the country, which has caused different health issues and even child mortality especially in rural areas. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in the country. However, little knowledge is available about the quality of groundwater throughout the entire country, and its quality has not been investigated extensively yet like in other countries in the world. While most people think that consuming groundwater is a reliable and safe source of drinking water for health, the United Nations (UN) agencies report various kinds of waterborne diseases and even child mortalities due to drinking water quality in the country. In this article, significant geogenic and anthropogenic factors that play a vital role in groundwater contamination of the country are identified and explained. Different geogenic contaminations such as arsenic, fluoride, sulfate, and boron occur in several areas of Afghanistan that have a direct effect on human health. The water quality mapping for Afghanistan is completed for half of the country, which shows that groundwater is plagued by high levels of fluoride and arsenic in some areas. The water quality mapping of the other half of the country cannot be completed due to security concerns currently. Also, there are different kinds of waterborne diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, and dysentery that can be seen in different parts of the country because of anthropogenic activities which continuously deteriorate groundwater.

Discharge permit market and farm management nexus: an approach for eutrophication control in small basins with low-income farmers	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The economic concerns of low-income farmers are barriers to nutrient abatement policies for eutrophication control in surface waters. This study brings up a perspective that focuses on integrating multiple-pollutant discharge permit markets with farm management practices. This aims to identify a more economically motivated waste load allocation (WLA) for non-point sources (NPS). For this purpose, we chose the small basin of Zrebar Lake in western Iran and used the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) for modeling. The export coefficients (ECs), effectiveness of best management practices (BMPs), and crop yields were calculated by using this software. These variables show that low-income farmers can hardly afford to invest in BMPs in a typical WLA. Conversely, a discharge permit market presents a more cost-effective solution. This method saves 64% in total abatement costs and motivates farmers by offering economic benefits. A market analysis revealed that nitrogen permits mostly cover the trades with the optimal price ranging from $6 to $30 per kilogram. However, phosphorous permits are limited for trading, and their price exceeds $60 per kilogram. This approach also emphasizes the establishment of a regional institution for market monitoring, dynamic pricing, fair fund reallocation, giving information to participants, and ensuring their income. By these sets of strategies, a WLA on the brink of failure can turn into a cost-effective and sustainable policy for eutrophication control in small basins.

J	Liu, A; Carroll, S; Dawes, L; Goonetilleke, A				Liu, An; Carroll, Steven; Dawes, Les; Goonetilleke, Ashantha			Monitoring of a mixed land use catchment for pollutant source characterisation	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Protection of surface water quality is a key driver in catchment management, particularly for areas undergoing land use change. Changing land use can result in the input of a range of pollutants to surface waters, resulting in water quality impairment, leading to eutrophication and the appearance of algae blooms. This study investigated a mixed land use coastal catchment by undertaking extensive field sampling and data analysis for pollutant source characterisation. The objective was to contribute to a greater understanding of pollutant inputs to surface water resources and for effective catchment management. Based on data analysis results, a diversity of pollutant sources was noted, including both natural areas and areas subject to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and urban developments, with agricultural areas being comparatively more significant in exporting nutrients. Additionally, pollutant inputs into estuarine and freshwater areas were found to have specific characteristics influenced by land use. The pollutant inputs from these sources were found to be significantly affected by seasonal factors, with the dominant pollutant sources differing between the wet and dry seasons. This underlines the importance of taking seasonal factors into account in the development of effective catchment management strategies. Based on the study outcomes, a critical point monitoring program was developed with a focus on preventing algae blooms. This will allow the development of a decentralised catchment management strategy where resource-efficient monitoring of critical pollutant parameters at key locations can be undertaken for minimising the risk from algae blooms, rather than implementing a whole of catchment and resource-demanding large-scale monitoring program.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							336	10.1007/s10661-017-6047-7								WOS:000404652900033	28612335

Monitoring data were collected from sites approximately 35 m upstream and downstream of dams and reference sites located approximately 5 km upstream of all dams. Results indicate that oxygen levels, macroinvertebrate diversity, and proportion of sensitive taxa were significantly lower upstream and downstream of dams in comparison with upstream reference reaches. The strong correlation between water quality and macroinvertebrates in this system implies that removal of the lower three dams would lead to improvements in water quality, biotic integrity, and resilience in lower Bushkill Creek. Sediment analyses and toxicity assays suggest that dam removal and sediment mobilization may route contaminated sediments downstream at concentrations that may harm more sensitive biota. However, macroinvertebrate mortality and behavior were not significantly different from clean water controls for the large majority of toxicity assays. All together, these results suggest that dams 1-3 are good candidates for successful stream restoration but that the removals would best be planned in a way that mitigates potential impacts of contaminated legacy sediment.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							344	10.1007/s10661-017-6060-x								WOS:000404652900041	28634867

Resulting data set is statistically analyzed to discriminate between the natural or anthropic origin of the elements. Analyses indicate that in all cases, the main source of most major and trace elements is geological weathering, being thus individual bedrock composition the main driver of differences between lakes. Several anthropogenic sources of airborne Cu, Sc, Co, and Cr must be also considered. The shallowness of the lake is also a factor that may influence element cycling and concentration levels in its water mass. Concentrations of anthropogenic elements were low, comparable to those reported in other glacial lakes, way below the WHO, US EPA, EC, and Spanish legal limits for drinking water quality, indicating the absence of serious pollution. Toxic heavy metals Cd, Pb, Hg, and Zn were not detected in any of the tarns.

S.; Doledec, Sylvain; Feio, Maria Joao			Chironomidae traits and life history strategies as indicators of anthropogenic disturbance	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In freshwater ecosystems, Chironomidae are currently considered indicators of poor water quality because the family is often abundant in degraded sites. However, it incorporates taxa with a large ecological and physiological diversity and different sensitivity to impairment. Yet, the usual identification of Chironomidae at coarse taxonomic levels (family or subfamily) masks genus and species sensitivities. In this study, we investigate the potential of taxonomic and functional (traits) composition of Chironomidae to detect anthropogenic disturbance. In this context, we tested some a priori hypotheses regarding the ability of Chironomidae taxonomic and trait compositions to discriminate Mediterranean streams affected by multiple stressors from least-disturbed streams. Both taxonomic and Eltonian trait composition discriminated sites according to their disturbance level. Disturbance resulted in the predicted increase of Chironomidae with higher number of stages with hibernation/diapause and of taxa with resistance forms and unpredicted increase of the proportion of taxa with longer life cycles and few generations per year. Life history strategies (LHS), corresponding to multivoltine Chironomidae that do not invest in hemoglobin and lack strong spring synchronization, were well adapted to all our Mediterranean sites with highly changeable environmental conditions. Medium-size animals favored in disturbed sites where the Mediterranean hydrological regime is altered, but the reduced number of larger-size/carnivore Chironomids suggests a limitation to secondary production. Results indicate that Chironomidae genus and respective traits could be a useful tool in the structural and functional assessment of Mediterranean streams. The ubiquitous nature of Chironomidae should be also especially relevant in the assessment of water bodies naturally poor in other groups such as the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, such as the lowland rivers with sandy substrates, lakes, or reservoirs.

In this research, a novel risk-based framework is developed and implemented in a distribution network spanning over 64 km(2) for supplying water to the city of Al-Khobar (Saudi Arabia) through 473-km-long water mains. The framework integrates the planning of linear assets (i.e., pipes) and placement of booster stations to optimize residual chlorine in the WDS. Failure mode and effect analysis are integrated with the fuzzy set theory to perform risk analysis. A vulnerability regarding the probability of failure of pipes is estimated from historical records of water main breaks. The consequence regarding residual chlorine availability has been associated with the exposed population depending on the land use characteristics (i.e., defined through zoning). EPANET simulations have been conducted to predict residual chlorine at each node of the network. A water quality index is used to assess the effectiveness of chlorine practice. Scenario analysis is also performed to evaluate the impact of changing locations and number of booster stations, and rehabilitation and/or replacement of vulnerable water mains. The results revealed that the proposed methodology could facilitate the utility managers to optimize residual chlorine effectively in large WDS.

The basic principle in photometric measurements is the incident light at a given wavelength that is either reflected, scattered, or transmitted in the body of water. Here, we discuss the transmittance measurements. The amount of transmittance is inversely proportional to the concentration of the substance measured. However, the transmittance is subject to interference, because it can be affected by factors other than the substance targeted in the water. In this study, interference with the UV/Vis sensor nitrate plus nitrite measurements caused by organic carbon was evaluated. Total or dissolved organic carbon as well as nitrate plus nitrite concentrations were measured in various boreal waters with two UV/Vis sensors (5-mm and 35-mm pathlengths), using conventional laboratory analysis results as references. Organic carbon increased the sensor nitrate plus nitrite results, not only in waters with high organic carbon concentrations, but also at the lower concentrations (<10 mg C L-1) typical of boreal stream, river, and lake waters. Our results demonstrated that local calibration with multiple linear regression, including both nitrate plus nitrite and dissolved organic carbon, can correct the error caused by organic carbon. However, high-frequency optical sensors continue to be excellent tools for environmental monitoring when they are properly calibrated for the local water matrix.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							357	10.1007/s10661-017-6056-6								WOS:000404652900054	28656558

In addition, quality parameters such as temperature, pH, and total alkalinity (TA) in 44 swimming pools located in the city center and districts of Canakkale, Turkey, were examined in the summer period. While FC and RC amounts were analyzed using tablet tests with N-N-diethyl phenylenediamine (DPD 1) and potassium iodine (DPD 3) using the colorimetric method in the comparator, TA and CyA levels were measured with a photometric method. Temperature and pH were measured using YSI 556 MPS. Levels of CyA, FC, RC, pH, temperature, and TA varied between 0.00 and 725.0 mg L-1 (108.0 +/- 111.4 mg L-1), 0.00 and 5.00 mg L-1 (1.60 +/- 0.962 mg L-1), 0 and 0.55 mg L-1 (0.087 +/- 0.059), 6.40 and 8.20 mg L-1 (7.30 +/- 0.038 mg L-1), 22.0 and 32.0 degrees C (27.6 +/- 1.45 degrees C), and 0.00 and 391.0 mg L-1 129.3 +/- 89.0), respectively. The findings were compared to standard limit values of the Ministry of Health of the Turkish Republic and other countries. Not only maximum concentrations of CyA but also the average concentrations exceeded the standard limit values of different countries in July and August with high tourism activity in Turkey. Although there is no problem in view of average values of other quality parameters, there are some problems in view of the maximum values in pool waters compared to standard limit values.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							338	10.1007/s10661-017-6031-2								WOS:000404652900035	28620710

Brady			Evaluating expected outcomes of acid remediation in an intensively mined Appalachian watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Assessments of watershed-based restoration efforts are rare but are essential for the science of stream restoration to advance. We conducted a watershed scale assessment of Abram Creek before and after implementation of a watershed-based plan designed to maximize ecological recovery from acid mine drainage (AMD) impairment. We surveyed water chemistry, physical habitat, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish community structure in three stream types: AMD-impacted(14 streams), AMD-treated (13 streams), and unimpaired reference (4 streams). We used in-stream measurements to quantify ecological loss from AMD, the amount of ecological recovery expected through remediation, and the observed degree of post-treatment recovery. Sites impaired by AMD improved in water quality with AMD treatment. Dissolved metals and acidity declined significantly in treated streams, but sulfate and specific conductance did not. Likewise, sites impaired by AMD improved in bio-condition scores with AMD treatment. EPT genera increased significantly but were lower compared to unimpaired streams. We found fish at nine treated sites that had none before treatment. Community-level analyses indicated improved but altered assemblages with AMD treatment. Analysis of pretreatment conditions indicated that only 30% of the historic fishery remained. Remediation was expected to recover 66% of the historic fishery value, and assessment of posttreatment conditions indicates that 52% of the historic fishery has been recovered after 3 years. Developing expected endpoints for restoration outcomes provides a tool to objectively evaluate successes and can guide adaptive management strategies.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUL	2017	189	7							339	10.1007/s10661-017-6036-x								WOS:000404652900036	28620711

Soil temperature responses to climate change along a gradient of upland-riparian transect in boreal forest	CLIMATIC CHANGE												There is growing evidence of climate change impacts on northern ecosystems. While most climate change studies base their assessments on air temperature, spatial variation of soil temperature responses have not been fully examined as a metric of climate change. Here we examined spatial variations of soil temperature responses to an ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) projections at multiple depths in upland and riparian zones in the Swedish boreal forest. Modeling showed a stronger influence of air temperature on riparian soil temperature than was simulated for upland soils. The RCM ensemble projected a warming range of 4.7-6.0 degrees C in riparian and 4.3-5.7 degrees C in upland soils. However, soils were slightly colder in the riparian zone during winter. While the historical record showed that upland soils are about 0.4 degrees C warmer than the riparian soils, this may be reversed in the future as model projections showed that on an annual basis, riparian soils might be slightly warmer by 0.2 to 0.4 degrees C than upland soils. However, upland soils could warm up earlier (April) compared to riparian soils (May).

VARIATION IN MALATHION SENSITIVITY AMONG POPULATIONS OF BLANCHARD'S CRICKET FROGS (ACRIS BLANCHARDI) AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RISK ASSESSMENT	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Intraspecific variability in contaminant sensitivity could undermine risk assessments for nontarget organisms such as amphibians. To test how amphibian populations vary in tolerance to anticipated lethal and sublethal exposures to a pesticide, we exposed Blanchard's cricket frogs (Acris blanchardi) from 3 populations across a broad portion of their range to the insecticide malathion. Exposure in mesocosms to a nominal concentration of 1 mg/L (measured concentrations at 1 h and 24 h postaddition of 0.160 mg/L and 0.062 mg/L, respectively), a realistic direct-overspray scenario, reduced survival to metamorphosis by 43% relative to controls and revealed variation in tolerance among populations. Survival ranged from 74% for the most tolerant population to 18% for the least tolerant population, a 4.1-fold difference. Mass at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis were unaffected. Although malathion reduced zooplankton abundance, it did not alter food resources (periphyton or phytoplankton relative abundance), or a suite of water-quality variables (pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen). A 96-h time-to-death assay designed to isolate direct, lethal effects also revealed variation in tolerance among populations. Time to death (mean +/- standard error) ranged from 2.4 +/- 0.18 h for the least tolerant population to 17.8 +/- 4.72 h for the most tolerant population, a 7.4-fold difference. However, relative sensitivities of populations differed in the mesocosm and laboratory studies, which differed in exposure concentrations, suggesting that populations tolerant of high concentrations can be more sensitive to lower concentrations. We suggest that direct overspray could reduce larval survival in the field for this species. Studies assessing the role of contaminants in declines or extrapolating to untested populations, especially across large geographical regions, should quantify the range of intraspecific variation. Risk assessors could address intraspecific variability directly by using an intraspecific uncertainty factor.

Predictors of anemia in women of reproductive age: Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION												Background: Anemia in women of reproductive age (WRA) (age range: 15-49 y) remains a public health problem globally, and reducing anemia in women by 50% by 2025 is a goal of the World Health Assembly. Objective: We assessed the associations between anemia and multiple proximal risk factors (e.g., iron and vitamin A deficiencies, inflammation, malaria, and body mass index) and distal risk factors (e.g., education status, household sanitation and hygiene, and urban or rural residence) in nonpregnant WRA. Design: Cross-sectional, nationally representative data from 10 surveys (n = 27,018) from the Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia (BRINDA) project were analyzed individually and pooled by the infection burden and risk in the country. We examined the severity of anemia and measured the bivariate associations between anemia and factors at the country level and by infection burden, which we classified with the use of the national prevalences of malaria, HIV, schistosomiasis, sanitation, and water-quality indicators. Pooled multivariate logistic regression models were constructed for each infection-burden category to identify independent determinants of anemia (hemoglobin concertation, <120 g/L). Results: Anemia prevalence was similar to 40% in countries with a high infection burden and 12% and 7% in countries with moderate and low infection burdens, respectively. Iron deficiency was consistently associated with anemia in multivariate models, but the proportion of anemic women who were iron deficient was considerably lower in the high-infection group (35%) than in the moderate-and low-infection groups (65% and 71%, respectively). In the multivariate analysis, inflammation, vitamin A insufficiency, socioeconomic status, and age were also significantly associated with anemia, but malaria and vitamin B-12 and folate deficiencies were not. Conclusions: The contribution of iron deficiency to anemia varies according to a country's infection burden. Anemia-reduction programs for WRA can be improved by considering the underlying infection burden of the population and by assessing the overlap of micronutrient deficiencies and anemia.																	0002-9165	1938-3207				JUL 1	2017	106	1		S			416S	427S		10.3945/ajcn.116.143073								WOS:000404595400008	28615262

The robotic system consists of a mobile robot to transport a water multiparameter sonde and six containers for distributing food onto the pond surface, a dispatcher unit to dispense a precise amount of food from the containers, and a computer running as a server to define, over the Internet, the feeding and monitoring schedule through a client application. The development methodology starts by making an abstract functionality model to accomplish the tasks. Next, the functionality model is described using the unified modeling language (UML) that specifies the structure and behavior of the system components. Later, the methodology translates the UML dynamic description depicted by statechart diagrams into Petri net (PN) formalism. PN models are merged and analyzed based on their behavioral properties to validate the design as a stable event-based Internet system. Following the UML and PN designs, the robotic system is implemented.

Validation of alkaline disinfection for recycled water schemes	HYDROMETALLURGY					10th International Alumina Quality Workshop (AQW)	APR 19-24, 2015	Perth, AUSTRALIA					Alcoa of Australia's recycled water schemes use a single chemical treatment process of alkaline disinfection. Recycled water schemes are approved by the Department of Health and are based on the water quality being fit for purpose and are assessed using the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling (AGWR) 2006 and Department of Health WA Guidelines for the Use of Recycled Water in Western Australia (2011). However, the guidelines refer to residential and municipal recyded water uses and exposures and guidance refers to conventional, not alkali, disinfection. Disinfection with a chemical agent (e.g. chlorine, chloramine or, as in this case, caustic) requires some minimum effective concentration (often denoted C) and minimum contact time (often denoted T) to be effective. CT values are widely published for common disinfectants, but not for caustic Therefore Alcoa completed microbial inactivation studies to establish a CT - equivalent for caustic and to determine whether the reference pathogens and microbial indicator organisms from the AGWR were relevant to the scheme. Despite the presence of a reasonably applicable guideline, the tasks undertaken at the Alcoa site were specifically assessed to help better estimate exposure since those given in the national guidelines were not necessarily intended to cover industrial uses. The microbial log reduction requirements of the scheme were determined using the default values stated in the Australian Guidelines for Water Recycling, as well as from using actual measured volumes from personal exposure monitoring. Margins of safety between alkaline disinfection capability and health requirements were identified and assessed.

Moreover the estimations of these models are compared with the multiple linear regression. In this context, monthly mean quantities of the temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, discharge and dissolved oxygen data recorded at Broad River near Carlisle, SC in USA are used. The accuracy of the models is compared with one other by using determination coefficient, mean absolute error, root mean square error and mean absolute relative error statistics.

Approaches for evaluating subsurface phosphorus loss potential from soil profiles	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The importance of subsurface phosphorus (P) transport in deterioration of surface water quality is well documented. Practices and treatments have been identified and modeling approaches have been implemented to decrease the subsurface P load to surface waters. Soil phosphorus storage capacity (SPSC) is a site-assessment tool that predicts the potential for P loss from soils. We examined the use of SPSC to assess soil profile P distributions and loss potentials for two contrasting soil types: manure-impacted Spodosols and Ultisols. Our specific objectives were to (i) validate prediction of the Langmuir P bonding strength, K-L, the Freundlich adsorption coefficient, K-F, or the linear adsorption coefficient, K-D of Spodosols (Ap, E and Bh horizons) and Ultisols (Ap, E and Bt horizons) using SPSC-based equations developed for surface and sub-surface horizons (Ap, E and Bt) of Ultisols and (ii) identify factors affecting retention and release of P. Results showed that SPSC derived from oxalate-extractions data can effectively predict P isotherm parameters used in P transport models. The SPSC also captured differences between soil horizons within a profile pertinent to P loss. Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) concentrations related to negative SPSC, likely due to the presence of these components in dairy manure. The initial sorbed P in the solid phase (So) of both soil types was related to soil components such as Mg, Ca and total P when SPSC was positive. The equations developed from A, E and Bt horizons of Ultisol relating isotherm parameters to the PSR and SPSC made successful predictions for all horizons of Ultisols sampled from locations different from those in the current study and Spodosols suggesting that such equations might be applicable across a wide range of soils.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				JUL 1	2017	245						92	99		10.1016/j.agee.2017.05.006								WOS:000403988600010

However, relatively little research has been conducted on managing P in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production systems, where fanning practices differ from those of upland cropping systems due to water ponding on the soil surface (field ponding water; FPW). Because FPW is a direct source of surface runoff, identifying the main source of P and the critical period of high P concentrations in the FPW provide important insights to mitigating P runoff losses. In this study, field monitoring and laboratory incubation experiments were combined to evaluate how soil P content and conventional P fertilizer application affected FPW P concentrations in rice-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation systems of five Chinese rice producing regions. All soils had Olsen-P concentrations (10.1-20.5 mg kg(-1)) well below the critical levels (30-172 mg kg(-1)) for promoted risks of P loss. However, conventional P application rate significantly elevated FPW P concentrations compared to no P application, and P fertilizer contributed 47-92% of total P (TP) and 59-97% of total dissolved P (TDP) in the FPW. Temporarily, both TP and TDP concentrations peaked one day after P application (0.15-8.90 mg TP L-1 and 0.16-4.49 mg TDP L-1), then decreased rapidly and stabilized five days later. We conclude that fertilizer is the major source of P loss in Chinese rice production systems, and that P fertilizer rate should be optimized to reduce P concentrations in the effluent water in the first week following P application.

Mansoor			Influence of sludge characteristics on coagulant recovery from water treatment sludge: a preliminary study	JOURNAL OF MATERIAL CYCLES AND WASTE MANAGEMENT												This study investigated the effect of raw water quality and coagulant type and dosage on the efficiency of aluminium recovery from water treatment sludge by acidification process. One of the features of this study is to prioritise several factors affecting aluminium recovery using demonstrating experiments and analysing the result using model. The previous studies comparing the aluminium recovery from PACl and alum sludge had collected the sludge from treatment plants treating different source water. However, this study compares aluminium recovery from PACl and alum sludge obtained from treating same source water. Water treatment sludge was prepared in laboratory by coagulating raw water with different inorganic and organic contents using aluminium sulphate (alum) and polyaluminium chloride (PACl) as coagulants. The effect of the different factors on the aluminium recovery efficiency was evaluated using a 2(3) full factorial experimental design. The aluminium recovery efficiency was higher for PACl sludge compared to alum sludge with recovery ranging from 62.5 to 74.5 % for alum sludge and from 70.7 to 84.0 % for PACl sludge. At higher concentrations of organic matter and turbidity in the raw water, lower aluminium recovery efficiency was observed for both the sludges. The study thus shows the important effects of raw water quality and coagulant type and dose on the recovery process.

J	Wang, HJ; Liang, XM; Wang, HZ				Wang Haijun; Liang Xiaomin; Wang Hongzhu			Sustainable fisheries in shallow lakes: an independent empirical test of the Chinese mitten crab yield model	CHINESE JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												Next to excessive nutrient loading, intensive aquaculture is one of the major anthropogenic impacts threatening lake ecosystems. In China, particularly in the shallow lakes of mid-lower Changjiang (Yangtze) River, continuous overstocking of the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) could deteriorate water quality and exhaust natural resources. A series of crab yield models and a general optimum-stocking rate model have been established, which seek to benefit both crab culture and the environment. In this research, independent investigations were carried out to evaluate the crab yield models and modify the optimum-stocking model. Low percentage errors (average 47%, median 36%) between observed and calculated crab yields were obtained. Specific values were defined for adult crab body mass (135 g/ind.) and recapture rate (18% and 30% in lakes with submerged macrophyte biomass above and below 1 000 g/m(2)) to modify the optimum-stocking model. Analysis based on the modified optimum-stocking model indicated that the actual stocking rates in most lakes were much higher than the calculated optimum-stocking rates. This implies that, for most lakes, the current stocking rates should be greatly reduced to maintain healthy lake ecosystems.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				JUL	2017	35	4					894	901		10.1007/s00343-017-6045-1								WOS:000403701200020

Chemical, biological, and DNA markers for tracing slaughterhouse effluent	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Agricultural practices, if not managed correctly, can have a negative impact on receiving environments via waste disposal and discharge. In this study, a chicken slaughter facility on the rural outskirts of Sydney, Australia, has been identified as a possible source of persistent effluent discharge into a peri-urban catchment. Questions surrounding the facility's environmental management practices go back more than four decades. Despite there having never been a definitive determination of the facility's impact on local stream water quality, the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (NSW EPA) has implemented numerous pollution reduction requirements to manage noise and water pollution at the slaughter facility. However, assessment of compliance remains complicated by potential additional sources of pollution in the catchment. To unravel this long-standing conundrum related to water pollution we apply a forensic, multiple lines of evidence approach to delineate the origin of the likely pollution source(s). Water samples collected between 2014 and 2016 from irrigation pipes and a watercourse exiting the slaughter facility had elevated concentrations of ammonia (max: 63,000 mu g/L), nitrogen (max: 67,000 mu g/L) and phosphorus (max: 39,000 mu g/L), which were significantly higher than samples from adjacent streams that did not receive direct runoff from the facility. Arsenic, sometimes utilised in growth promoting compounds, was detected in water discharging from the facility up to 4 times (max 3.84 mu g/L) local background values (< 0.5 mu g/L), with inorganic As(Sigma V+III) being the dominant species. The spatial association of elevated water pollution to the facility could not unequivocally distinguish a source and consequently DNA analysis of a suspected pollution discharge event was undertaken. Analysis of catchment runoff from several local streams showed that only water sampled at the downstream boundary of the facility tested positive for chicken DNA, with traces of duck DNA being absent, which was a potential confounder given that wild ducks are present in the area. Further, PCR analysis showed that only the discharge water emanating from the slaughter facility tested positive for a generalized marker of anthropogenic pollution, the clinical class 1 integron-integrase gene. The environmental data collected over a three-year period demonstrates that the slaughter facility is indisputably the primary source of water-borne pollution in the catchment. Moreover, application of DNA and PCR for confirming pollution sources demonstrates its potential for application by regulators in fingerprinting pollution sources.

J	Zhang, L; Wu, PT; Zhu, DL; Zheng, C				Zhang, Lin; Wu, Pute; Zhu, Delan; Zheng, Chao			Effect of pulsating pressure on labyrinth emitter clogging	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												Emitter clogging has a direct impact on the performance and service life of a drip irrigation system. A study of labyrinth emitter clogging was conducted to determine the effects of pulsating versus constant pressure on average emitter flow rate (), the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (Cu), and the location of clogged emitters. Under constant pressure, emitters in this study began to be clogged after the 8th irrigation, whereby 15 emitters eventually became clogged; the average emitter flow rate decreased to 75% of the original emitter flow rate () after the 15th irrigation, and Cu decreased rapidly by 68.2%. For pulsating pressure, emitters began to be clogged after the 14th irrigation, only 5 emitters became clogged, and only decreased to 85.3% of , and Cu declined by only 22.6%. These results demonstrate that the anti-clogging performance of emitters with pulsating pressure is better than with constant pressure. Emitter clogging at a constant pressure generally occurred at the inlet and front of labyrinth channels, mainly due to deposition of sediment particles. Emitter clogging with pulsating pressure is due to other impurities (e.g., debris of Teflon tape) besides sediment particles plugging the labyrinth channel. Pulsating pressure is recommended for use in drip irrigation to prevent emitter clogging.

J	Arslan, S				Arslan, Sebnem			Assessment of groundwater and soil quality for agricultural purposes in Kopruoren basin, Kutahya, Turkey	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This research evaluated the irrigation water and agricultural soil quality in the Kopruoren Basin by using hierarchical cluster analysis. Physico-chemical properties and major ion chemistry of 19 groundwater samples were used to determine the irrigation water quality indices. The results revealed out that the groundwaters are in general suitable for irrigation and have low sodium hazard, although they are very hard in nature due to the dominant presence of Ca+2, Mg+2 and HCO3- ions. Water samples contain arsenic in concentrations below the recommended guidelines for irrigation (59.7 14.7 mu g/l), however, arsenic concentrations in 89% of the 9 soil samples exceed the maximum allowable concentrations set for agricultural soils (81 +/- 243 mg/kg). Nickel element, albeit not present in high concentrations in water samples, is enriched in all of the agricultural soil samples (390 +/- 118.2 mg/kg). Hierarchical cluster analysis studies conducted to identify the sources of chemical constituents in water and soil samples elicited that the chemistry of the soils in the study area are highly impacted by the soil parent material and both geogenic and anthropogenic pollution sources are responsible for the metal contents of the soil samples. On the other hand, water chemistry in the area is affected by water-rock interactions, anthropogenic and agricultural pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ahmed, AH; Rayaleh, WE; Zghibi, A; Ouddane, B				Ahmed, Abdoulkader Houssein; Rayaleh, Waiss Elmi; Zghibi, Adel; Ouddane, Baghdad			Assessment of chemical quality of groundwater in coastal volcano sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti, Horn of Africa	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												This research is conducted to evaluate the current status of hydrogeochemical contaminants and their sources in groundwater in the volcano-sedimentary aquifer of Djibouti. Groundwater samples were mostly collected from the volcanic and inferoflux aquifers and then were analyzed for quality on physicochemical parameters (EC, pH, Temperature, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, NO3-, Na+ Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Br-, F-), minor and trace elements (Li, Ba, B, Sr, Si, Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, Pb, Co, Cu, Ni, Zn, Ti, V, As, Se). The interpretations of hydrochemical data are shown numerically and graphically through the Piper diagram such as the multivariate statistical analysis, binary diagram, the calculation of the saturation indexes, the index of base exchanges and ratio of Na+/Cl-, HCO3-/Cl-. The seawater ratio and ionic deviation in the groundwater were calculated using the chloride concentration. These processes can be used as indicators of seawater intrusion progress. This study reveals three groundwater quality groups and how the quality of water supply has been deteriorated through the process of seawater intrusion. The seawater intrusion extends into the Gulf basalts aquifer that covers nearly 12% of the whole area according to some observations. Some toxic elements present in drinking water (As and Se) have already exceeded the maximum permissible in almost the entire of the Gulf basalts aquifer affected by seawater intrusion. Indeed, some correlations were found between As, Se, with electrical conductivity and among other minor and trace elements such as Br, B, Sr, Co and Cr. It indicates that all these elements are mainly controlled by naturel/geogenic processes. The Principal component Analysis and the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis have led to the confirmation of the hypotheses developed in the previous hydrochemical study in which two factors explain the major hydrochemical processes in the aquifer. These factors reveal first the existence of an intensive intrusion of seawater and second the mechanisms of contamination through the recharge processes of groundwater. Consequently, the assessment of water quality and the determination of the risk of water contamination by pollution seems to be very useful for an effective management of groundwater resources, and also for preventing salinization and minimizing the phenomena of seawater intrusion.

Assessment of Hydro-geochemical Evolution Mechanism and Suitability of Groundwater for Domestic and Irrigation Use in and Around Ludhiana city, Punjab, India	JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION												Groundwater and surface water samples in and around Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Ludhiana were collected and analyzed for physico-chemical characteristics. The groundwater in the study area was found to be controlled by rock-water interaction, carbonate mineral (calcite and dolomite) weathering and ion exchange processes. The water facies were mainly of Ca-Mg-HCO3 and Na-HCO3 types, showing fresh water characteristics. All the groundwater samples were found to be with in the safe limits with respect to the dissolved solids, major cations, major anions and trace elements making it suitable for domestic use. However, the hardness may affect the acceptability of this groundwater for drinking. Most of the groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation, considering salinity hazard, sodicity hazard and bicarbonate hazard. However, magnesium hazard is found to persist in 63% of groundwater samples. The canal water is found to be of good quality for irrigation.																	0257-7968					JUL	2017	21	4					260	270										WOS:000403887500003

One component of monitoring is measuring the phytoplankton community composition and detecting whether that has changed. From April to October 2012, by using ships-of-opportunity (SOOP), we collected simultaneous samples from 15 stations in the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Proper to study the spatial variability in the phytoplankton species composition and biomass throughout the growing season. The analysis was performed with 10 dominant taxa constituting 83-97% of the total phytoplankton biomass. We set the criterion of the statistically significant (p < 0.05) Bray-Curtis similarity for the station pairs to be mutually representative according to the species composition and biomass. Our results indicated that in areas of similar hydrological conditions, it is sufficient to have sampling stations in 50-65 km distance between one another, but in the areas with varying hydrographical conditions, i.e. coastal areas, higher spatial coverage may be needed. Whenever possible, it is recommended to combine monitoring efforts between the Baltic Sea countries in the offshore areas, including SOOP. The need for further harmonization of phytoplankton analysis between countries is addressed in order to have comparable data sets by different countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Results of some water quality measurements are presented, showing that these lagoons have poor ecological status where they experience either a lack of flushing by the tide, or large amounts of anthropogenic inputs, or both. A vulnerability assessment is applied to the lagoons in question and this reveals a varying degree of threat from climate change to the operation and use of the lagoons. Our understanding of these systems suggests that a set of 10 hydrodynamic models, underpinned by an understanding of the local coastal sediment transport in each case, is appropriate, and could then be used to inform stakeholders and management in decision making. Integrated, broad ranging management strategies must adapt to the realities of climate change in order to allow the sustainable use of these lagoons in providing economic benefits, ecosystem services, and elements of coastline protection for the benefit of the local and regional population and its economy.

A case study of the Blackwater estuary in southern Ireland	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The environmental status of many European estuaries has improved in recent years as a result of the implementation of a range of different legislative measures. Better municipal waste water treatment and a reduction in the application of inorganic and organic fertiliser to agricultural lands are the main reasons for these improvements. It is anticipated, however, that the ending of the EU milk quota in 2015, and the proposed enlargement of the European dairy sector will lead to a market-driven increase in milk production through an increase in animal numbers and higher productivity. This new production is likely to lead to an increase in pressures with the potential to impact on the quality of surface waters, including estuarine waters. In this paper we focus on the Blackwater estuary in southern Ireland which has seen a marked improvement in water quality due to a reduction in riverine nutrient inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen. A bio-physical model is used to test nutrient-input scenarios likely to represent the range of nutrient loadings that may arise as a result of increased agricultural production. The outputs from these different scenarios are used to assess if recent improvements in estuarine water quality will be undermined or even negated by the proposed expansion of the Irish dairy sector. Appropriate management options to address these potential impacts are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, in association with climate change impacts, the ecosystems of the GBR have degraded greatly in recent decades, and the decline in ecosystem health continues. Improved agricultural management practices are now being funded to reverse the decline. However the quantum of reduction in contaminant loads from individual rivers needed to reverse the decline is not known. To estimate load reductions that would reverse the decline we developed what we term Ecologically Relevant Targets (ERTs). These targets are the load reductions of sediment, nutrients and pesticides needed such that GBR lagoonal waters meet the relevant water quality guidelines for the region. The methodology proposed for setting the ERTs is described and examples of ERTs set for the Burdekin Region of the GBR are given. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, As, Se, Al, Cd and Cr were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for the assessment of spatio-temporal variations, source apportionment and heavy metal pollution indexing. The results demonstrated that concentrations of the metals showed significant seasonality and most variables exhibited higher levels in the pre-monsoon season. The principle component analysis for ionic source identification was synthesized into three factors with eigen values cut off at greater than unity and explained about 64.8% of the total variance. The extracted factors seemed to be associated to the geogenic, extensive mining and allied transportation sources of the elements.

Persistent toxic pollutants representing three classes: organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were studied in grab water samples, in passive samplers/SemiPermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) and in fish tissues collected along the Strymonas River, northern Greece at three sampling campaigns during the year 2013. Almost all the target compounds were detected in the study river of Strymonas, northern Greece at the periods of high rainfall intensity and/or low flow-rate. The most frequently detected compounds were 1,2-benzanthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, endosulfan sulfate, endrin aldehyde, fluorene, methoxychlor, polychlorinated biphenyl PCB 28, PCB 180 and pyrene. The family of DDT compounds and aldrin were also occasionally detected. Agricultural run-off and waste effluents are the main sources of hydrophobic organic compounds in the river basin. The use of SPMDs allowed the detection of more micropollutants than active sampling (31 vs. 16, respectively). Results showed relatively low risk however the potential risk associated with micropollutants such as 1,2-benzanthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), endosulfan II, methoxychlor, PCB 180 and pyrene should not be neglected. Performing risk assessment based on passive sampling, more information was obtained about temporal and spatial variation.

Impact of ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate on tadpoles of Alytes obstetricans	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The presence of pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers negatively affect aquatic communities in general, and particularly amphibians in their larval phase, even though sensitivity to pollutants is highly variable among species. The Llobregat Delta (Barcelona, Spain) has experienced a decline of amphibian populations, possibly related to the reduction in water quality due to the high levels of farming activity, but also to habitat loss and alteration. We studied the effects of increasing ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate levels on the survival and growth rate of Alytes obstetricans tadpoles under experimental conditions. We exposed larvae to increasing concentrations of nitrate and ammonium for 14 days and then exposed them to water without pollutants for a further 14 days. Only the higher concentrations of ammonium (> 33.75 mg/L) caused larval mortality. The growth rate of larvae was reduced at a22.5 mg/L NH4 (+), although individuals recovered and even increased their growth rate once exposure to the pollutant ended. The effect of nitrate on growth rate was detected at a80 mg/L concentrations, and the growth rate reduction in tadpoles was even observed during the post-exposure phase. The concentrations of ammonium with adverse effects on larvae are within the range levels found in the study area, while the nitrate concentrations with some adverse effect are close to the upper range limit of current concentrations in the study area. Therefore, only the presence of ammonium in the study area is likely to be considered of concern for the population of this species, even though the presence of nitrate could cause some sublethal effects. These negative effects could have an impact on population dynamics, which in this species is highly sensitive to larval mortality due to its small clutch size and prolonged larval period compared to other anuran amphibians.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				JUL	2017	26	5					667	674		10.1007/s10646-017-1799-y								WOS:000403461400009	28409413

The set of models describe the dynamics of flow rates and major pollutants (COD, TSS, N and P) within the catchment (CT), sewer network (SN), wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and river water system (RW) for a hypothetical, though realistic, UWS. Evaluation criteria are developed to allow for direct assessment of the river water quality instead of the traditional emission based metrics (for sewer overflows and WWTP discharge). Three case studies are included to illustrate the applicability of the proposed toolbox and also demonstrate the potential benefits of implementing integrated control in the BSM-UWS platform. Simulation results show that the integrated control strategy developed to maximize the utilization of the WWTP's capacity represents a balanced choice in comparison to other options. It also improves the river water quality criteria for unionized ammonia and dissolved oxygen by 62% and 6%, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pilot scale experiments were performed in a distribution system simulator by injecting arsenic and measuring both adsorption onto iron pipe material and the oxidation of arsenite by hypochlorite in tap water to form arsenate. A mathematical model describing these processes was developed and simulated using EPANET-MSX, a hydraulic and multi-species water quality software for pipe networks. Model parameters were derived from the pilot-scale experiments. The model was applied to both the distribution system simulator and EPANET example network #3, a real-world model of a drinking water system serving approximately 78,000 customers. The model can be applied to systems-level studies of arsenic fate and transport in drinking water resulting from natural occurrences, accidental spills, or intentional introduction into water.

This study assessed the suitability of marginal lands in Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) for three promising biofeedstocic crops, switchgrass, Miscanthus and hybrid poplar. The land suitability was categorized into 5 suitability classes (not-, poorly-, moderately-, good-and highly-suitable) based on a fuzzy logic based land suitability evaluation procedure. The results showed that 60% of marginal lands in UMRB were moderately to highly suitable for growth of the targeted biofeedstock crops. Predicted bioethanol production from marginal land in the UMRB with consideration of suitability level was two thirds of the production predicted without consideration of suitability level. Our results better constrain the potential of marginal land for biofuel production as well as the importance of land suitability evaluation for policy analysis targeting biofuel development on marginal lands.

Beyond SDG 11 concerning the development of sustainable cities, many of the SDGs target activities falling within the responsibility of local governments. Thus, cities will play a leading role in the achievement of these goals, and we argue that the information systems (IS) community must be an active partner in these efforts. This paper aims to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by developing a conceptual model to explain the role of IS in building smart sustainable cities and providing a framework of action for IS researchers and city managers. To this end, we conduct grounded theory studies of two green IS used by an internationally recognized smart city to manage water quality and green space. Based on these findings, we articulate a model explaining how an integrated information ecosystem enables the interactions between three interrelated spheres - administrative, political and sustainability - to support the development of smart sustainable cities. Moving from theory to practice, we use two real-world scenarios to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Finally, we define an action framework outlining key actions for cities and suggest corresponding questions for future research. Beyond a simple call-to-action, this work provides a much-needed foundation for future research and practice leading to a sustainable future for all.																	1350-1917	1365-2575				JUL	2017	27	4			SI		427	461		10.1111/isj.12138								WOS:000403480500003

A legal framework with scientific basis for applying the 'polluter pays principle' to soil conservation in rural watersheds in Brazil	LAND USE POLICY												The "polluter pays principle" (PPP) has been looked at from the perspective of legal values and technical principles, namely of soil science, to evaluate the acceleration of soil erosion and the consequent development of degraded areas in the Uberaba River basin (area: 2419 km(2)), state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Having accomplished this goal, the study highlights the importance of PPP for the conservation of soil and development of an ecologically equilibrated environment. The diagnosis of degraded areas was based on the coupling of a Geographic Information System with soil loss, land use conflict and tolerance to soil loss models, and revealed a preoccupying situation because an extension of approximately 905 km(2) (1/3 of the basin) has been considered in advanced state of degradation potentially causing environmental damage (e.g., decline of soil fertility and hence crop production, negative impacts of soil particles export on stream and lake water quality and biodiversity of riverine ecosystems). Facing this problem, a legal framework standing on doctrinaire principles, federal laws and the Brazilian Constitution has been proposed whereby the protagonists of soil degradation are called to assume responsibility as well as the costs of repairing this negative condition. Although the study has been carried out on a specific country wider pre-defined settings, the rationale behind the proposals can easily be transposed to other scenarios because the scientific methods on which soil degradation has been defined and mapped are generally applicable, while the suggested legal values are currently applied to many regions on the planet.

Design of a decision support tool for visualising E-coil risk on agricultural land using a stakeholder-driven approach	LAND USE POLICY												Enabling knowledge exchange between scientists and decision-makers is becoming increasingly necessary to promote the development of effective decision-support tools (DSTs) for environmental management. Participation of stakeholders in the design process beyond a basic level of consultation is essential for promoting trust in modelled outputs and accelerating eventual uptake of resulting tools and models by end-user communities. This study outlines the development of a DST to visualise and communicate the spatial and temporal patterns of E. coli (a faecal indicator organism) on agricultural land, as a first step in managing microbial pollution risks to the wider environment. A participatory approach was used to engage regulators, catchment managers, environmental scientists, farmers and farm advisors, researchers in geospatial technologies and water industry staff in the co-design of a novel, user-friendly and accessible DST for guiding on-farm microbial risk assessment. Recommendations for maximising the benefits of a participatory process to DST design are discussed with reference to a series of opportunities and limitations identified by our stakeholder cohort during the development of the Visualising Pathogen & Environmental Risk (ViPER) DST. The resulting toolkit provides environmental managers and farm advisors with one of the first freely-available DSTs for visualising patterns of E. coli inputs to pasture in space and time, and begins to address the lack of advisory tools currently available for informing decision-making with respect to managing microbial risks in agricultural systems.

Phosphate Removal from Agricultural Drainage Water Using an Iron Oxyhydroxide Filter Material	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Phosphate discharged in agricultural drainage causes water quality degradation on local, regional, and national scales. Iron oxyhydroxide filter materials can potentially remove the soluble phosphate present in drainage waters. Laboratory saturated column experiments and preliminary small-scale field tests were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of a synthetic goethite iron oxyhydroxide (alpha-FeOOH) filter material for phosphate treatment. Original iron oxyhydroxide filter material (SG-IOH-O) and the same filter material regenerated with sodium hydroxide (SGIOH- R) were assessed. Results of replicated laboratory experiments showed that columns packed with SGIOH- O or SG-IOH-R almost totally removed phosphate (>98%) from drainage waters spiked with an additional 1 or 10 ppm phosphate-P (PO4-P). The column experiments with SG-IOH-O or SG-IOH-R additionally indicated that contact times of only 10 to 15 s were sufficient for near complete removal of phosphate from drainage water spiked with 1 ppm PO4-P. In an initial small-scale filter treatment system field test with SG-IOH-O, percent phosphate removal averaged 89% in the first 200 days, which then decreased to an average 40% phosphate removal in the last 80 days. Following this initial field test, two field tests, one with SG-IOH-O and the other with SG-IOH-R, were conducted concurrently over a period of 193 days, with the SG-IOH-O system phosphate removal averaging 75%, while the SG-IOHR system phosphate removal averaged 34%. This study's findings support possible goethite iron oxyhydroxide filter material use for drainage water phosphate treatment; however, larger-scale field investigations are needed, particularly with modified regeneration procedures.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	2017	228	7							240	10.1007/s11270-017-3410-9								WOS:000403574400008

Erosion froma Cross-Country Natural Gas Pipeline Corridor: The Critical First Year	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Sediment losses as concentrations and yields were measured for a year from 12 segments of a newly constructed (buried) natural gas pipeline on the US Forest Service's Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia. Pipeline segments were separated by waterbars which served as drainage features. Six segments were northwest-facing, and six were southeast-facing. Three segments on each aspect were seeded with warm season native herbaceous species at rates used by the Forest Service (1x). All remaining segments received seeding at three times that rate (3x). Forest Service-established rates of fertilizer, lime, and straw mulch were applied to all segments. Sediment concentrations and yields generally were highest at the start of the study, respectively, averaging approximately 1660 mg L-1 and 340 kg ha(-1) during the first 3 months following completion of corridor reclamation, but they were less than from nearby less-steep forest road corridors. Concentrations and yields fell significantly after the first 3 months; declines were attributed to revegetation on the ROW. At the end of the first growing season, vegetative cover on all segments ranged from 55 to 79%, with no differences between seeding rates. Mean runoff was significantly higher on the northwest-facing segments than on the southeast-facing segments, but runoff volumes did not decrease on either aspect in concert with loadings or concentrations. Higher runoff on the northwest-facing segments may have been due to clay-skinned peds in subsurface soil that limited vertical drainage. Even with a heavy straw mulch cover on the right-of-way, the timing of the highest sediment losses immediately following pipeline construction suggests that implementation of additional surface-protection best management practices could be beneficial until vegetation is reestablished.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	2017	228	7							232	10.1007/s11270-017-3374-9								WOS:000403574400001

Influence of Sewered Versus Septic Systems on Watershed Exports of E-coli	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Elevated bacteria concentrations have led to the impairment (e.g., closures of shellfisheries and recreational beaches) of coastal waters. Although many previous studies have suggested that wastewater inputs can lead to elevated fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations in surface waters, few studies have quantified wastewater-associated FIB exports at the watershed scale. The goal of this study was to estimate bacterial exports at the watershed scale based on wastewater management approach (septic vs. sewer). Six watersheds (three exclusively on septic and three exclusively served by a sewer system) were selected for water quality assessment and comparison. Streams were monitored approximately monthly from August 2011 to June 2012 during baseflow conditions. Additionally, three storms were monitored. Samples were collected in sterile 100-mL bottles and analyzed for Escherichia coli concentrations. Discharge from streams was measured and bacterial exports were estimated by multiplying discharge by E. coli concentration. The results revealed that (1) during baseflow conditions, septic watersheds contained elevated stream discharge and E. coli concentrations and exports as compared to sewer watersheds; (2) warmer months had elevated E. coli watershed exports compared to colder months in both septic and sewer watersheds; and (3) storms significantly increased watershed E. coli exports in both septic and sewer watersheds. Storms significantly increased watershed E. coli exports in both septic and sewered watersheds, but E. coli counts in sewered watersheds were considerably greater likely due to greater impervious surface coverage and or leaky sewer infrastructure. These findings in conjunction with previous studies suggest that septic systems may play a pivotal role in the delivery of FIB to receiving waters, particularly during baseflow conditions.

In 2003, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) concluded that atrazine poses potential risks to sensitive aquatic species. Consequently, a surface water monitoring program was developed to assess whether measured levels of atrazine could impact aquatic plants in vulnerable watersheds. To facilitate evaluation of the monitoring data, the Agency needed to establish a level of concern (LOC) below which atrazine would not cause unacceptable adverse effects to aquatic plant communities. Several attempts at developing a community-level LOC have followed from USEPA but none have been formally accepted or endorsed by independent Scientific Advisory Panels. As part of registration review, the USEPA needs to revisit development of a community-level LOC for atrazine that will be protective of aquatic plant communities. This article reviews 4 methods that can or have been used for this purpose. Collectively, the methods take advantage of the large number of single species and mesocosm studies that have been conducted for aquatic plants exposed to atrazine. The Plant Assemblage Toxicity Index (PATI) and the Comprehensive Aquatic Systems Model for atrazine (CASM(ATZ2)) incorporate single-species toxicity data but are calibrated with micro- and mesocosm study results to calculate community-level LOCs. The Brock et al. scoring system relies exclusively on mesocosm studies. Single-species toxicity data were used in a modified version of the USEPA's Water Quality Criteria (WQC) method. The 60-day LOCs calculated using the 4 methods ranged from 19.6 to 26 mu g/L. A weight-of-evidence assessment indicated that the CASM(ATZ2) method was the most environmentally relevant and statistically reliable method. Using all 4 methods with weights based on method reliability, the weighted 60-day LOC was 23.6 mu g/L. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:686-701.

An improved method for calculating toxicity-based pollutant loads: Part 1. Method development	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												Pollutant loads are a means for assessing regulatory compliance and setting targets to reduce pollution entering receiving waterbodies. However, a pollutant load is often comprised of multiple chemicals, which may exert joint toxicity on biota. When the ultimate goal for assessing pollutant loads is to protect ecosystems from adverse effects of toxicants, then the total pollutant load needs to be calculated based on the principles of mixture toxicology. In this article, an improved method is proposed to convert a pollutant load to a toxicity-based load (toxic load) using a modified toxic equivalency factor (TEF) derivation method. The method uses the relative potencies (RePs) of multiple species to represent the response of the ecological community. The TEF is calculated from a percentile of a cumulative distribution function (CDF) fitted to the RePs. The improvements permit the determination of which percentile of the CDF generates the most environmentally relevant and robust toxic loads. That is, environmental relevance ensures that a reduction in the toxic load is likely to result in a corresponding improvement in ecosystem health and robustness ensures that the calculation of the toxic loads is not biased by the reference chemical used. The improved methodology will therefore ensure that correct management decisions will be made and ultimately, a reduction in the toxic load will lead to a commensurate improvement in water quality.

Development and implementation of a site-specific water quality limit for uranium in a high conservation value ecosystem	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												Water quality guideline values (GVs) are a key tool for water quality assessments. Site-specific GVs, which incorporate data relevant to local conditions and organisms, provide a higher level of confidence that the GV will protect the aquatic ecosystem at a site compared to generic GVs. Site-specific GVs are, therefore, considered particularly suitable for sites of high sociopolitical or ecological importance. The present paper provides an example of the refinement of a site-specific GV for high ecological value aquatic ecosystems in Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory, Australia, to improve its site specificity and statistical robustness, thereby increasing confidence in its application. Uranium is a contaminant of concern for Ranger U mine, which releases water into Magela Creek and Gulungul Creek in Kakadu National Park. A site-specific GV for U has been applied, as a statutory limit, to Magela Creek since 2004 and to Gulungul Creek since 2015. The GV of 6g/LU was derived from toxicity data for 5 local species tested under local conditions. The acquisition of additional U data, including new information on the effect of DOC on U toxicity, enabled a revision of the site-specific U GV to 2.8g/LU and an ability to adjust the value on the basis of environmental concentrations of DOC. The revised GV has been adopted as the statutory limit, with the regulatory framework structured so the GV requires adjustment based on DOC concentration only when an exceedance occurs. Monitoring data for Magela Creek (2001-2013) and Gulungul Creek (2003-2013) downstream of the mine show that dissolved U has not exceeded 1g/L. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:765-777.

As part of a risk-spreading strategy, only a fraction of the egg bank hatches during a single inundation. Besides this dispersal in time, resistant dormant eggs also disperse in space via vectors including wind, water and animals. The structure and functioning of the dormant egg bank has important consequences for (meta) population and (meta) community structure and dynamics. Here, we merge empirical and theoretical data into a conceptual framework for the study of population and community responses in temporary ponds along a gradient in hydrological disturbance. Overall, we conclude that changes in hydrological disturbance may compromise both the abiotic (i.e. water quality) and biotic (i.e. population and community processes) integrity of temporary pools which is especially relevant in light of ongoing anthropogenic alterations in the hydrology of inland waters.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2017	796	1					201	222		10.1007/s10750-016-3006-1								WOS:000403357600017						
J	Neto, RM; Nocko, HR; Ostrensky, A				Neto, Roberto Montanhini; Nocko, Helder Rafael; Ostrensky, Antonio			Carrying capacity and potential environmental impact of fish farming in the cascade reservoirs of the Paranapanema River, Brazil	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												The objective of this study was to simulate changes in water quality standards caused by the installation of aquaculture parks for caged fish farming in the eight large artificial reservoirs in the Paranapanema River according to the different scenarios of technical and legal limitations: (i) occupancy of 1% of the total surface of the reservoirs and (ii) occupancy according to the environmental carrying capacity. For water quality modelling, these two scenarios were simulated to determine the trophic state index (TSI) of each reservoir. Based on the total area of all reservoirs in the first scenario, the fish farm facilities would occupy 18.3km(2) and have an annual fish production of an estimated 513 thousand MT. However, because of limitations in the carrying capacity, the annual production in the second scenario would be 98 thousand MT and the fish farm facilities would occupy 3.5km(2). Simulating the TSI for the first scenario, approximately 75% of the total area of all reservoirs was estimated to change from oligo or mesotrophic conditions to eutrophic, supereutrophic and hypereutrophic conditions, and four reservoirs may become completely eutrophic (Canoas 2, Canoas 1, Taquarucu and Rosana). For the second scenario, however, eutrophic areas accounted for less than 30% of the total, although the Taquarucu and Rosana reservoirs were still at risk of total eutrophication. These results indicate as well-intentioned legislation can have unintended environmental consequences in dynamic social-ecological aquaculture systems as in the case of large reservoirs in the Paranapanema River.

Effects of egg stocking density on egg hatchability, larval quality and water quality for pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides, and pigfish, Orthopristis chrysoptera	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												Pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides Linnaeus) and pigfish (Orthopristis chrysoptera L.) are relatively new, cultured species commonly used as marine baitfish in the south-eastern United States and currently have no defined protocols for egg incubation. Thus, experiments were conducted to determine efficient egg stocking densities during static and flow-through incubation that yielded higher quality larvae. Eggs of each species were incubated statically at 250, 500, 1000 and 2000eggsL(-1), and after incubation, egg hatching success, larval survival to first feeding, larval morphometrics and water quality were assessed. Stocking densities above 250eggsL(-1) led to significant reductions in pinfish hatching success and water quality degradation, evident from decreased dissolved oxygen and pH levels and increased nitrogenous wastes. Increased stocking densities for pigfish also resulted in significant water quality degradation, although hatching success was unaffected up to a density of 1000eggsL(-1). A high flow-through water exchange rate of 2000% daily resulted in significant reductions in nitrogenous wastes and greater stability in dissolved oxygen and pH levels during incubation when compared to static treatments of the same egg density. Additionally, the high exchange rate of 2000% was critical inmaintaining high hatching success and larvalsurvival to first feeding at stocking densities of 1000eggsL(-1) for pinfish and up to 4000eggsL(-1) for pigfish. No clear patterns in larval morphometrics were observed among stocking densities. Static incubation densities of 250 and 1000eggsL(-1) are recommended for pinfish and pigfish, respectively.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				JUL	2017	48	7					3589	3605		10.1111/are.13185								WOS:000403357900026

According to the major component of stocked animals, the ponds were grouped into four types: black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus, largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, yellow catfish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco and pearl mussel Hyriopsis cumingii ponds. Each type of pond was stocked with three species of Chinese carps (silver carp, bighead carp and gibel carp) to form a unique mode of fish polyculture or mussel-fish integrated culture. The bacterial composition was identified using 16S rDNA sequencing. Totally, 3701 and 11150 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified from the water and sediment samples respectively. The number of OTUs, abundance-based coverage estimator, Chao1 index and Shannon diversity index were lower in the water column than in the sediment, suggesting that diversity and stability of bacterial community were higher in the sediment. In the water column, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated at the phylum level, and 26 dominant genera were identified. In the sediment, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and Nitrospirae dominated at the phylum level, and 25 dominant genera were identified. Bacterial compositions between the ponds with different aquaculture modes were similar at the phylum levels, but varied at the genus levels. The bacterial composition in the ponds was correlated with hardness, ammonia and total nitrogen in the water column. This study indicates that the type of aquaculture mode is a factor regulating the microbial community, which provides an insight towards microbial management through probiotic manipulation in pond culture.

However, the influence of additional drivers is more difficult to identify. The implementation of long-term monitoring and the development of reliable tools can help to reveal fine local drivers structuring fish populations in contrasted flow regimes. This study used data series for nine reaches monitored for nine to nineteen years in four French salmonid streams. Study reaches were within five bypassed sections influenced by instream flow. A deterministic trout population dynamics model was applied on each reach, with calibration and validation procedures. Results revealed that biological drivers structured all reaches similarly. In addition, seven other drivers were identified. Among these additional drivers, hydrology mainly explained temporal fluctuations in trout density, regardless of reach. Three drivers independent of hydrology were also revealed: poor water quality, limited spawning area and the effect of power plant operations (overtopping, flushing or plant shutdown). All drivers influenced the whole bypassed section and were never limited to the scale of the reach (sampling area). Further analyses of each driver are now needed, to regionalise and quantify their respective impact precisely. Thus, assessment of trout population status would be simplified, enabling implementation of efficient management rules.

The aim of this study was to investigate the critical swimming capacity and metabolism of the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, focusing on sex and size effects, to evaluate the influence of water flow on its invasive success. Specimens of mosquitofish were captured from the Ter Vell lagoon (L'Estartit, north-eastern Spain) in July 2014, and we measured the critical swimming speed (U-crit) and oxygen consumption of individual fish (30 females and 30 males) using a mini swim tunnel. The mean U-crit of this poeciliid fish was estimated at 14.11cms(-1) (range=4.85-22.26), which is lower than that of many other fishes of similar size and confirms that this species is limnophilic and its invasive success might be partially explained by hydrologic alterations. However, the U-crit and maximal metabolic rate vary markedly with fish size and sex, with males having much higher values for the same body mass, and thus probably being more resistant to strong water flows. Multiple regression models illustrate that multivariate analyses might increase the predictive power and understanding of swimming performance and metabolic traits, compared to results from conventional simple regressions.

Calcium nitrate was reacted with potassium phosphate in presence of ammonia for controlled pH to synthesize Hap nanorods, which was characterized using FTIR, XRD, SEM, TG-DTA, and TEM/EDS for determining its phase composition, structural and thermal decomposition behavior. When USPM method was used for synthesis, the yield of the Hap nanorods was improved from 83.24 +/- 1.0% to 90.2 +/- 1.0%, and complete phase transformation occurred with formation of elongated Hap nanorods. Effects of process parameters such as solution pH, contact time and adsorbent dose were studied through response surface methodology (RSM). A simple quadratic model was developed using Central Composite Design (CCD) and optimum parameters for fluoride adsorption process were determined to be pH 7, contact time 3 h and adsorbent dose 7 g/L for maximum removal capacity. Fluoride removal efficiency was predicted to be 93.64% which was very close to the experimental value obtained at 92.86% using ultrasonically prepared Hap. Fluoride adsorption isotherms fitted the Freundlich isotherm with an adsorption capacity of 1.49 mg/g, while the kinetic studies revealed that the process followed pseudo-second order model. The treated water quality parameters such as residual fluoride, calcium leached, total hardness and alkalinity was investigated, and it was observed that all these parameters were within the permissible limits as per WHO and BIS standards.

According to the previously selected operational condition, a continuous-flow US/UV baffled reactor was continuously operated in a wastewater treatment plant at a pilot scale for nearly three months, and the disinfection influent and effluent were analyzed, including fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, and fecal streptococci. The US/UV baffled reactor could guarantee a high effluent disinfection performance in terms of fecal coliforms removal even with the fluctuation of the secondary effluent. All the disinfected effluents satisfied the requirement of the "Pollutants Discharge Standard of Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant in China" (fecal coliforms below 1000 CFU/L for class 1A), and 87% of the tested fecal coliforms concentration in the disinfected effluent was below 100 CFU/L, nearly eliminating all fecal coliforms. Further analysis of the E. coli and fecal streptococci showed the broad disinfection ability and high disinfection efficiency of the US/UV baffled reactor. The flexibility of the specific energy consumption for the disinfection system depends on the water quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This Himalayan geothermal region encompassed hot springs ranging in temperature from 60 to 95 degrees C, in pH from 6.2 to 9.4, and in mineralogy from bicarbonates (Tato Field), sulfates (Tatta Pani) to mixed type (Murtazaabad). Microbial community structures in these geothermal springs remained largely unexplored to date. In this study, we report a comprehensive, culture-independent survey of microbial communities in nine samples from these geothermal fields by employing a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. The bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi were dominant in all samples from Tato Field, Tatta Pani, and Murtazaabad. The community structures however depended on temperature, pH, and physicochemical parameters of the geothermal sites. The Murtazaabad hot springs with relatively higher temperature (90-95 degrees C) favored the growth of phylum Thermotogae, whereas the Tatta Pani thermal spring site TP-H3-b (60 degrees C) favored the phylum Proteobacteria. At sites with low silica and high temperature, OTUs belonging to phylum Chloroflexi were dominant. Deep water areas of the Murtazaabad hot springs favored the sulfur-reducing bacteria. About 40% of the total OTUs obtained from these samples were unclassified or uncharacterized, suggesting the presence of many undiscovered and unexplored microbiota. This study has provided novel insights into the nature of ecological interactions among important taxa in these communities, which in turn will help in determining future study courses in these sites.

J	Grochowska, J; Augustyniak, R; Lopata, M				Grochowska, Jolanta; Augustyniak, Renata; Lopata, Michal			How durable is the improvement of environmental conditions in a lake after the termination of restoration treatments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The study was conducted on Lake Dlugie,a water body lying in Olsztyn, a town situated in northeastern Poland. From 1956 to 1976raw wastewater was discharged into Lake Dlugie and therefore heavy pollution was the reason for the total degradation of this lake. The concentrations of nutrients were very high in the bottom water layer (TN 22.89 mg L-1, TP 3.50 mg L-1). The mean concentration of chlorophyll an exceeded 60 mu g L-1 on average and Secchi disc visibility was less than 1 m. The discontinuation of sewage discharge into the lake caused the saprotrophic state to transform into hypertrophy. Further improvement of the environmental conditions in the lake was possible only after the implementation of an appropriate restoration method. The restoration procedure of this lake began in 1987. The first stage involved an artificial aeration method, and the second stage consisted of a phosphorus inactivation method. The applied restoration methods led to the improvement of Lake Dlugie's water quality. Even ten years after the restoration oscillated in the range of 5-10 mu g L-1, Chlorophyll a contents oscillated in the range of 5-10 mu g L-1, and Secchi disc visibility amounted to c.a. 4.5 m.

They are affected by nutrient and light availability and seasonal changes. In this study, we investigated the changes of C/N metabolism and growth of three natural submersed macrophyte populations (i.e., each in a different site), Potamogeton maackianus, in response to water depth gradients with 0.5 m interval in a freshwater lake for four seasons. Changes were identified by measuring the biomass of the sampled macrophytes and metabolite contents of soluble carbohydrate (SC), starch, and free amino acid (FAA) in their organs. Results showed that no significant and consistent changes were found in the SC and FAA contents in leaves and stems from 1.0 m to 5.5 m water depth, as compared to previous results of controlled studies, suggesting a relative stable C/N metabolism in response to the depth gradients in studied natural populations of P. maackianus. The metabolite contents with the most variations appeared mainly because of seasonal changes. The metabolite contents of the macrophyte populations were more closely correlated with the chemical parameters than with the light parameters in water columns. No significant correlations were found between the metabolite contents with the light attenuation coefficient ($K$) and Secchi depth (SD) in water columns. The NO3-N and total phosphorus (TP) contents in water columns were positively correlated with the SC and starch contents in leaves, respectively. The NH4-N content in water columns was negatively related to the FAA content in leaves. Metabolite contents had weak correlations with depth gradients and light parameters, probably because of the physiological integration among individuals by developed stolons and the canopy-forming characteristic of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of water quality to the C/N metabolism in natural population of submersed macrophyte. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Tromboni, F; Dodds, WK				Tromboni, F.; Dodds, W. K.			Relationships Between Land Use and Stream Nutrient Concentrations in a Highly Urbanized Tropical Region of Brazil: Thresholds and Riparian Zones	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Nutrient enrichment in streams due to land use is increasing globally, reducing water quality and causing eutrophication of downstream fresh and coastal waters. In temperate developed countries, the intensive use of fertilizers in agriculture is a main driver of increasing nutrient concentrations, but high levels and fast rates of urbanization can be a predominant issue in some areas of the developing world. We investigated land use in the highly urbanized tropical State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We collected total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and inorganic nutrient data from 35 independent watersheds distributed across the State and characterized land use at a riparian and entire watershed scales upstream from each sample station, using ArcGIS. We used regression models to explain land use influences on nutrient concentrations and to assess riparian protection relationships to water quality. We found that urban land use was the primary driver of nutrient concentration increases, independent of the scale of analyses and that urban land use was more concentrated in the riparian buffer of streams than in the entire watersheds. We also found significant thresholds that indicated strong increases in nutrient concentrations with modest increases in urbanization reaching maximum nutrient concentrations between 10 and 46% urban cover. These thresholds influenced calculation of reference nutrient concentrations, and ignoring them led to higher estimates of these concentrations. Lack of sewage treatment in concert with urban development in riparian zones apparently leads to the observation that modest increases in urban land use can cause large increases in nutrient concentrations.

Influence of Select Antibiotics on Vibrio fischeri and Desmodesmus subspicatus at mu g L-1 Concentrations	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The presence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment is a contemporary reality and it is necessary to understand more about the effects of this presence on organisms. The purpose of this work was to assess the ecotoxicity of antibiotics metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, and sulphamethoxazole (single and mixture) in Vibrio fischeri and Desmodesmus subspicatus at mu g L-1 concentrations. The evaluation of the toxic effect of the antibiotics on V. fischeri and D. subspicatus was based on fluorescence and bioluminescence tests, respectively, using nominal concentrations. When tested individually, the four antibiotics gave rise to a toxic effect on the evaluated organisms. Sulphamethoxazole caused a higher toxic effect on V. fischeri and D. subspicatus from 7.81 to 500 mu g L-1. Trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole showed hormesis for the concentrations, which ranged from 7.81 to 62.5 mu g L-1. The mixture of antibiotics induced a toxic effect on the V. fischeri and D. subspicatus organisms (from 0.03 to 1 mu g L-1 concentrations) than when the antibiotics were evaluated individually. These results were significant since water quality problems are widespread all over the word, and emerging pollutants such as antibiotics have been detected in the aquatic environment in very low concentrations.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JUL	2017	60	1					157	164		10.1007/s00267-017-0841-4								WOS:000402792800011	28271212					
J	Piano, E; Falasco, E; Bona, F				Piano, Elena; Falasco, Elisa; Bona, Francesca			How does water scarcity affect spatial and temporal patterns of diatom community assemblages in Mediterranean streams?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Mediterranean streams are mostly characterised by intermittent flow regime, with droughts in summer followed by floods in autumn. During droughts, the creation of lentic habitats (i.e. lentification process) and isolated pools in the riverbeds (i.e. fragmentation process) represents a strong selective pressure on biotic communities, which might be intensified by human-induced water scarcity. In the highly heterogeneous habitat patches created by these processes, species sorting may be driven by stochastic mechanisms, as well as by environmental filtering. In this work, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns in the assemblage of diatom communities during water scarcity periods in Mediterranean streams. Five oligotrophic streams, which were similar in terms of physical and chemical parameters, were sampled in the Ligurian Alps (NW Italy). Data were collected during moderate flow in April 2014 and then at least monthly during water scarcity, from June to September 2014, in: (1) lentic sites, where the water flow became slower but was permanent all year around, (2) fragmented sites, where the riverbed stretch dried out creating isolated pools. For each sampling site, we collected six benthic diatom samples from different microhabitats. We examined which type of factors, i.e. spatial or environmental, better explained the temporal and spatial variation in diatom communities. We then calculated the turnover and nestedness components of dissimilarity by comparing samples collected during moderate flow with samples obtained during a period of water scarcity. We further investigated if the idiosyncrasy of diatom species, i.e. a measure of their discrepancy from a nested pattern, could be explained by the ecological niche width of species and/or by species traits. Our results showed a contribution of both environmental and spatial factors in determining species composition during water scarcity, with the overall trends in community structure being driven by species turnover. The percentage of idiosyncratic species (those departing from the nested pattern) increased with increasing water scarcity, but showed no differences in terms of species traits. According to our results, species turnover, with replacement of sensitive species by tolerant species, seemed to be the dominating process in diatom benthic communities during water scarcity in the streams under investigation. A better evaluation of species autecology could improve the evaluation of water quality in Mediterranean streams.

Sequential rather than interactive effects of multiple stressors as drivers of phytoplankton community change in a large lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Predicting how freshwater biota respond to multiple stressors is currently a major challenge facing aquatic ecologists and environmental managers. Lake Simcoe is an ideal location to test the impact of multiple stressors on aquatic biota over time, as changes in climate warming, species invasions, nutrient loading, and human population growth have occurred throughout the last three decades. In this study, we used a suite of multivariate analyses to quantify the unique and interactive effects of physico-climatic, water quality, and biological variables in explaining phytoplankton community composition from 1986 to 2012. Changes in water quality, zooplankton abundance and community composition (following the invasion of Bythotrephes longimanus), euphotic zone temperature and thermal stability, and the invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) acting at different times throughout the period of record, were associated with major shifts in the phytoplankton community of Lake Simcoe: dominance of eutrophic diatoms and cyanobacteria from 1986 to 1997 shifted to chlorophytes after 1998, then again to a diverse mix of taxa represented by all major categories of algae after 2004. Contrary to expectation, we found little evidence that interactions between multiple stressors are taking place in Lake Simcoe. Instead, our results demonstrated the sequential nature of multiple stressors in influencing interannual variation in phytoplankton community structure. By occurring consecutively over time, we propose a sequence of stressors has influenced the ecological health of the lake over the preceding three decades. Considered by category, biological stressors, followed by water quality, then temperature and climate, explained the largest amount of total variance in the phytoplankton data. The prominence of zooplankton community changes as significant predictors of phytoplankton community change throughout the period of record suggests the top-down effect of these herbivores are also very important. Our results highlight the importance of extensive ecosystem monitoring in determining ecosystem health. Our approach may assist in the management of other aquatic systems, where identifying when multiple stressors are not operating may simplify the management process, allowing remediation efforts to focus on the most impactful stressors as primary targets for ecosystem restoration.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2017	62	7					1288	1302		10.1111/fwb.12945								WOS:000403021500015

This study investigates the geochemical variations of groundwater and surface water before, during, and after hydraulic fracturing and in relation to various geospatial parameters in an area of shale gas development in northwestern West Virginia, United States. To our knowledge, we are the first to report a broadly integrated study of various geochemical techniques designed to distinguish natural from anthropogenic sources of natural gas and salt contaminants both before and after drilling. These measurements include inorganic geochemistry (major cations and anions), stable isotopes of select inorganic constituents including strontium (Sr-87/Sr-86), boron (delta B-11), lithium (delta Li-7), and carbon (delta C-13-DIC), select hydrocarbon molecular (methane, ethane, propane, butane, and pentane) and isotopic tracers (delta C-13-CH4, delta C-13-C2H6), tritium (H-3), and noble gas elemental and isotopic composition (helium, neon, argon) in 105 drinking-water wells, with repeat testing in 33 of the wells (total samples = 145). In a subset of wells (n = 20), we investigated the variations in water quality before and after the installation of nearby (<1 km) shale-gas wells. Methane occurred above 1 ccSTP/L in 37% of the groundwater samples and in 79% of the samples with elevated salinity (chloride > 50 mg/L). The integrated geochemical data indicate that the saline groundwater originated via naturally occurring processes, presumably from the migration of deeper methane-rich brines that have interacted extensively with coal lithologies. These observations were consistent with the lack of changes in water quality observed in drinking-water wells following the installation of nearby shale-gas wells. In contrast to groundwater samples that showed no evidence of anthropogenic contamination, the chemistry and isotope ratios of surface waters (n = 8) near known spills or leaks occurring at disposal sites mimicked the composition of Marcellus flowback fluids, and show direct evidence for impact on surface water by fluids accidentally released from nearby shale-gas well pads and oil and gas wastewater disposal sites. Overall this study presents a comprehensive geochemical framework that can be used as a template for assessing the sources of elevated hydrocarbons and salts to water resources in areas potentially impacted by oil and gas development.

Understanding the correlations between landscape variables and nitrate pollutant is a priority in order to assess pollutants loading and predicting the impact on surface water quality. The soil and water assessment tool was used to simulate nitrate loads in different land cover types in different years. The landscape pattern was calculated by FRAGSTATS. The contributing share of each land use/land cover shows nitrate pollutant produced by grassland (5.7%) and forest (29%) are less than those produced by agricultural land (64.2%). Agricultural land was identified as the main source of nitrate pollution. Paddy fields and orchards had the most intensive soluble nitrate loss especially in spring and summer. Statistical analysis indicated that nitrate was positively associated with patch density, edge density, patch number, total edge, effective mesh size, largest patch index, and landscape shape index (p <= 0.01). We then analyzed how nitrate was related to landscape attributes in six different sites. Also the regression analysis results suggested that landscape metrics could account for more than 94% of the variance of nitrate in the whole catchment. The regression models confirmed the great importance of the agriculture metrics and forest metric in predicting nitrate in watershed. Defining the generation and extent of pollution in this particular watershed which discharges into the Caspian Sea can constitute an important step toward protecting this ecosystem.																	1611-2490	1611-2504				JUL	2017	15	3					541	552		10.1007/s10333-016-0570-y								WOS:000402004500007

A lot of fish species grow in this lake and many birds and ducks live and nest in this area. A total of 12 sets of surface water samples were collected from three representative points from Braeni Lake, during 2015 and 2016 for three seasons (autumn, winter and spring). The samples were taken bi-monthly. In situ, using a portable multiparameter WTW Multi 350i, were determined the physico-chemical parameters like: pH, EC, TDS, ORP, and salinity. In laboratory by using an ion chromatograph (IC500 Dionex) were analysed the following cations: NH4+, Mg-2(+), Ca-2(+), Li+, Na+, K+ and anions F- Cr-, NO2-, Br-, NO3-, PO43-, SO42-. The content of heavy metals (Cd, Pb and Fe) was analysed using an atomic absorption spectrometer (ZEEnit 700 Analytik Jena). The cations concentration varied between: 56.31 - 75.97 mg/L for Na+, 20.44 - 26.66 mg/L for K+, 35.92 - 54.80 mg/L for Mg2+, 67.83 - 144.22 mg/L for Ca2+. N-NH4+ was found only in one sample (0.3 mg/L) and Li+ was found in three samples (0.25 - 0.26 mg/L). The anions concentration varied between: 26.78 - 48.93 mg/L (Cl-), 0.20 - 0.51 mg/L (F), 0.19 - 4.07 mg/L (N-NO3-), 124.77 - 193.51 mg/L (SO42-).

In many Cluj county rural areas, the drinking water from private wells is highly polluted with nitrate, as a result of agricultural activity (including excess application of inorganic nitrogenous fertilizers and manures) or seepage of human sewage from private septic systems. This study presents quality assessment of drinking water from Cluj county, regarding nitrate concentration. Drinking water parameter like conductivity, pH, turbidity, nitrite, ammonium, nitrates were investigated. The study was carried out in the January - December, 2015. The nitrate concentrations were low in drinking water samples from surface source in the ranged between 1.68-3.34 mg/L. On the other hand in groundwater samples high nitrate concentration was obtained 4.78-47.81 mg/L, but not exceed the limits indicated by the legislation (50mg/L).																	1842-4090	1844-489X				JUL	2017	12	2					389	393										WOS:000402360400009

A multilevel analysis	ENERGY POLICY												Increased hydraulic fracturing operations (also known as 'fracking') in the U.S. have introduced a larger portion of the public to new and more extensive risks and benefits: from concerns of impacts on water quality and human health to benefits from increased oil and gas production and local economic development. As most policy affecting fracking occurs at the state-level, it is important to understand how citizens' support for the technology is shaped by their states' industrial, environmental, and socioeconomic experiences. Using a nationally representative survey, we construct a multilevel model to understand how individuals' support for fracking varies as a function of both individual- and state-level characteristics. At the state-level, we find that people residing in states with a higher poverty rate and higher ground water use for public drinking supply are more likely to support fracking. At the individual level, the relationships between risk/benefit perceptions and support vary as a function of the state people live in. Additionally, the positive relationship between conservatism and support for fracking is stronger for people residing in states with a higher poverty rate. Based on these findings, we discuss the dynamics of public opinion in social contexts and implications on energy policymaking.

A Modeling Study of the Impacts of Mississippi River Diversion and Sea-Level Rise on Water Quality of a Deltaic Estuary	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Freshwater and sediment management in estuaries affects water quality, particularly in deltaic estuaries. Furthermore, climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence also affect estuarine water quality by changing salinity, circulation, stratification, sedimentation, erosion, residence time, and other physical and ecological processes. However, little is known about how the magnitudes and spatial and temporal patterns in estuarine water quality variables will change in response to freshwater and sediment management in the context of future SLR. In this study, we applied the Delft3D model that couples hydrodynamics and water quality processes to examine the spatial and temporal variations of salinity, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-alpha concentration in response to small (142 m(3) s(-1)) and large (7080 m(3) s(-1)) Mississippi River (MR) diversions under low (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative SLR (RSLR = eustatic SLR + subsidence) scenarios in the Breton Sound Estuary, Louisiana, USA. The hydrodynamics and water quality model were calibrated and validated via field observations at multiple stations across the estuary. Model results indicate that the large MR diversion would significantly affect the magnitude and spatial and temporal patterns of the studied water quality variables across the entire estuary, whereas the small diversion tends to influence water quality only in small areas near the diversion. RSLR would also play a significant role on the spatial heterogeneity in estuary water quality by acting as an opposite force to river diversions; however, RSLR plays a greater role than the small-scale diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of the water quality parameters in this deltaic estuary.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				JUL	2017	40	4					1028	1054		10.1007/s12237-016-0197-7								WOS:000402100700008

For this purpose, surface water quality data was collected from a drainage canal that bisected the southeast district of Ningbo Municipality (Zhejiang) from 2013 to 2015. The sampling transect was designed to represent the change in land-use from the agriculture dominated rural hinterland, to the predominantly urban city-centre. To calculate the representative land-use fraction of each sampling location, the contributing area was defined using an uni-directional 1 km vector line-buffer around the 'upstream' section of canal. The spatial and temporal variation of EC, DO, NH3 and turbidity indicated a measureable difference between the urban and rural sections of the channel. Water quality indicators were most sensitive to urban and parkland land-use types. The study yielded an increased spatial resolution to knowledge of water-quality variability in the urban environment compared to previous studies within the YRD region. The results were used to make recommendations for the development of an effective long-term strategy for the improvement in surface water quality in this region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a novel index of biotic integrity based on bacteria (Ba-IBI) was first developed for Qinhuai River in Nanjing city, China. Thirty-two biofilm samples were collected along the river bank and the bacterial communities were identified by high-throughput sequencing. By the range, responsive, and redundancy tests, four core metrics were selected from the dataset of 78 candidate metrics, including Pielou's evenness index, proportion of Paenibacillus, proportion of OTUs tolerant to organic pollution and proportion of Nitrosomonas. The results showed that the Ba-IBI was able to effectively discriminate different impaired site groups, and had a good correlation with the index of water quality (r = 0.79, p < 0.01) and the qualitative habitat evaluation index (r = 0.51, p < 0.01). Moreover, the Ba-IBI was negatively correlated with the number of population within a 1 km buffer (r = 0.71, p < 0.01). Application of the index showed that most of the sites were in the poor or bad class in the river. Our study revealed that the Ba-IBI is an effective and reliable approach for assessing the ecological status of Qinhuai River basin, which can complement the existing ecological assessment approaches for urban. rivers. Meanwhile, repeted surveys and field validations are still needed to further improve the applicability of the index in future studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Haas, MB; Guse, B; Fohrer, N				Haas, Marcelo B.; Guse, Bjoern; Fohrer, Nicola			Assessing the impacts of Best Management Practices on nitrate pollution in an agricultural dominated lowland catchment considering environmental protection versus economic development	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Water quality is strongly affected by nitrate inputs in agricultural catchments. Best Management Practices (BMPs) are alternative practices aiming to mitigate the impacts derived from agricultural activities and to improve water quality. Management activities are influenced by different governmental policies like the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). Their distinct goals can be contrasting and hamper an integrated sustainable development. Both need to be addressed in the actual conjuncture in rural areas. Ecohydrological models like the SWAT model are important tools for land cover and land use changes investigation and the assessment of BMPs implementation effects on water quality. Thus, in this study, buffer strip, fertilization reduction and alternative crops were considered as BMPs and were implemented in the SWAT model for the Treene catchment. Their efficiency in terms of nitrate loads reduction related to implementation costs at the catchment scale was investigated. The practices correspond to the catchment conditions and are based on small and mid areal changes. Furthermore, the BMPs were evaluated from the perspective of ecologic and economic policies. The results evidenced different responses of the BMPs. The critical periods in winter were addressed by most of the BMPs. However, some practices like pasture land increase need to be implemented in greater area for better results in comparison to current activities. Furthermore, there is a greater nitrate reduction potential by combining BMPs containing fertilization reduction, buffer strips and soil coverage in winter. The discussion about efficiency showed the complexity of costs stipulation and the relation with arable land and yield losses. Furthermore, as the government policies can be divergent an integrated approach considering all the involved actors is important and seeks a sustainable development. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Deng, WH; Wang, GY				Deng, Weihui; Wang, Guoyin			A novel water quality data analysis framework based on time-series data mining	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The rapid development of time-series data mining provides an emerging method for water resource management research. In this paper, based on the time-series data mining methodology, we propose a novel and general analysis framework for water quality time-series data. It consists of two parts: implementation components and common tasks of time-series data mining in water quality data. In the first part, we propose to granulate the time series into several two-dimensional normal clouds and calculate the similarities in the granulated level. On the basis of the similarity matrix, the similarity search, anomaly detection, and pattern discovery tasks in the water quality time-series instance dataset can be easily implemented in the second part. We present a case study of this analysis framework on weekly Dissolve Oxygen time-series data collected from five monitoring stations on the upper reaches of Yangtze River, China. It discovered the relationship of water quality in the mainstream and tributary as well as the main changing patterns of DO. The experimental results show that the proposed analysis framework is a feasible and efficient method to mine the hidden and valuable knowledge from water quality historical time-series data.

J	Corrales, J; Naja, GM; Bhat, MG; Miralles-Wilhelm, F				Corrales, Juliana; Naja, G. Melodie; Bhat, Mahadev G.; Miralles-Wilhelm, Fernando			Water quality trading opportunities in two sub-watersheds in the northern Lake Okeechobee watershed	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												For decades, the increase of nutrient enrichment has threatened the ecological integrity and economic sustainability of many rivers, lakes, and coastal waters, including Lake Okeechobee, the second largest freshwater lake in the contiguous United States. Water quality trading programs have been an area of active development to both, reduce nutrient pollution and minimize abatement costs. The objective of this study was to apply a comprehensive modeling framework, integrating a hydrologic-water quality model with an economic model, to assess and compare the cost-effectiveness of a water quality trading program over a command-and-control approach in order to reduce phosphorus loadings to Lake Okeechobee. The Upper Kissimmee (UK) and Taylor Creek/Nubbin Slough (TCNS) sub-watersheds, identified as major sources of total phosphorus (TP) loadings to the lake, were selected for this analysis. The effect of different caps on the market potential was assessed while considering four factors: the least-cost abatement solutions, credit prices, potential cost savings, and credit supply and demand. Hypothetical trading scenarios were also developed, using the optimal caps selected for the two sub watersheds. In both sub-watersheds, a phosphorus credit trading program was less expensive than the conventional command-and-control approach. While attaining cost-effectiveness, keeping optimal credit prices, and fostering market competition, phosphorus reduction targets of 46% and 32% were selected as the most appropriate caps in the UK and TCNS sub-watersheds, respectively. Wastewater treatment facilities and urban areas in the UK, and concentrated animal feeding operations in the TCNS sub watershed were identified as potential credit buyers, whereas improved pastures were identified as the major credit sellers in both sub-watersheds. The estimated net cost savings resulting from implementing a phosphorus trading program in the UK and TCNS sub-watersheds were 76% ($ 34.9 million per year) and 45% ($ 3.2 million per year), respectively. It is important to note that the realization of the environmental and economic benefits of this market-based alternative is also contingent on other important factors, such as the market structure, the specific program rules, the risk perception, and the education and outreach to develop trusted relationships among regulatory agencies, the public sector, and other stakeholders. Nevertheless, this research provided the foundation for stakeholders to better understand whether water quality trading has the potential to work in the Lake Okeechobee watershed and to facilitate the development of a pilot program.

J	Cai, BM; Wang, CC; Zhang, B				Cai, Beiming; Wang, Chencheng; Zhang, Bing			Worse than imagined: Unidentified virtual water flows in China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The impact of virtual water flows on regional water scarcity in China had been deeply discussed in previous research. However, these studies only focused on water quantity, the impact of virtual water flows on water quality has been largely neglected. In this study, we incorporate the blue water footprint related with water quantity and grey water footprint related with water quality into virtual water flow analysis based on the multiregional input-output model of 2007. The results find that the interprovincial virtual flows accounts for 23.4% of China's water footprint. The virtual grey water flows are 8.65 times greater than the virtual blue water flows; the virtual blue water and grey water flows are 91.8 and 794.6 Gm(3)/y, respectively. The use of the indicators related with water quantity to represent virtual water flows in previous studies will underestimate their impact on water resources. In addition, the virtual water flows are mainly derived from agriculture, chemical industry and petroleum processing and the coking industry, which account for 66.8%, 7.1% and 6.2% of the total virtual water flows, respectively. Virtual water flows have intensified both quantity- and quality-induced water scarcity of export regions, where low-valueadded but water-intensive and high-pollution goods are produced. Our study on virtual water flows can inform effective water use policy for both water resources and water pollution in China. Our methodology about virtual water flows also can be used in global scale or other countries if data available. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrogen Source Inventory and Loading Tool: An integrated approach toward restoration of water-quality impaired karst springs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Nitrogen (N) from anthropogenic sources has contaminated groundwater used as drinking water in addition to impairing water quality and ecosystem health of karst springs. The Nitrogen Source Inventory and Loading Tool (NSILT) was developed as an ArcGIS and spreadsheet-based approach that provides spatial estimates of current nitrogen (N) inputs to the land surface and loads to groundwater from nonpoint and point sources within the groundwater contributing area. The NSILT involves a three-step approach where local and regional land use practices and N sources are evaluated to: (1) estimate N input to the land surface, (2) quantify subsurface environmental attenuation, and (3) assess regional recharge to the aquifer. NSILT was used to assess nitrogen loading to groundwater in two karst spring areas in west-central Florida: Rainbow Springs (RS) and Kings Bay (KB). The karstic Upper Floridan aquifer (UFA) is the source of water discharging to the springs in both areas. In the KB study area (predominantly urban land use), septic systems and urban fertilizers contribute 48% and 22%, respectively, of the estimated total annual N load to groundwater 294,400 kg-N/yr. In contrast for the RS study area (predominantly agricultural land use), livestock operations and crop fertilizers contribute 50% and 13%, respectively, of the estimated N load to groundwater. Using overall groundwater N loading rates for the KB and RS study areas, 4.4 and 3.3 kg N/ha, respectively, and spatial recharge rates, the calculated groundwater nitrate-N concentration (2.1 mg/L) agreed closely with the median nitrate-N concentration (1.7 mg/L) from groundwater samples in agricultural land use areas in the RS study area for the period 2010-2014. NSILT results provide critical information for prioritizing and designing restoration efforts for water-quality impaired springs and spring runs affected by multiple sources of nitrogen loading to groundwater. The calculated groundwater N concentration for the KB study area (1.45 mg/L) was approximately three times higher than the median N concentration (0.45 mg/L) for wells located in urban land use areas.

However, implementing this empirical comparative approach at a greater spatial scale remains a challenge due to the diversity of biogeographical contexts encompassed by regional and national scales. We showed in previous studies that the use of standard organisms caged permits the use of a common biomonitor over a far greater geographical range, while limiting the influence of confounding factors on levels of bioavailable contamination. In this study, levels of Cd, Hg, Ni and Pb contamination assessed by active biomonitoring with caged Gammarus fossarum were compared to abundances of on-site gammarids, on 94 sites in France. Based on this national dataset of in situ bioassays, we first re-determined bioavailable background assessment concentrations (BBACs), i.e. concentrations measured in caged G. fossarum indicating a significant bioavailable contamination, which we had previously defined at a regional scale for these four metallic elements. On-site gammarid abundances were retrieved from monitoring programs implemented by French water agencies for the evaluation of ecological status for the European Water Framework Directive. These abundances were corrected for the influence of stream physico-chemical typology in order to permit a reliable comparison of gammarid densities between sites at the national scale. Clear trends of degradation of gammarid densities with increasing levels of bioaccumulated concentrations were identified for three of the four elements (Cd, Ni and Pb). Threshold concentrations in caged organisms above which the numbers of free-ranging gammarids were abnormally low namely bioavailable ecological assessment concentrations (BEACs) were determined. The reliability and validity of the BEACs, their comparison with BBACs and their usefulness in terms of prioritisation of contaminants, sites in freshwater management, are discussed.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the variability of surface water quality in inland waters in China, the affecting drivers behind the changes, and how the government-financed conservation actions have impacted water quality. Water quality was found to be poorest in the North and the Northeast China Plain where there is greater coverage of developed land (cities + cropland), a higher gross domestic product (GDP), and higher population density. There are significant positive relationships between the concentration of the annual mean chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the percentage of developed land use (cities + cropland), GDP, and population density in the individual watersheds (p < 0.001). During the past decade, following Chinese government financed investments in environmental restoration and reforestation, the water quality of Chinese inland waters has improved markedly, which is particularly evident from the significant and exponentially decreasing GDP-normalized COD and ammonium (NH4+-N) concentrations. It is evident that the increasing GDP in China over the past decade did not occur at the continued expense of its inland water ecosystems. This offers hope for the future, also for other industrializing countries, that with appropriate environmental investments a high GDP can be reached and maintained, while simultaneously preserving inland aquatic ecosystems, particularly through management of sewage discharge.

In both deep and shallow lakes, we found marked seasonality in the ratio between total N and total P (TN:TP) and in the inorganic concentrations of nitrogen (DIN), indicating that N more easily becomes a limiting nutrient as summer proceeds. TN:TP reached its lowest values of < 7 (by mass) in August in 25% of the shallow lakes. Chla generally related more strongly to TP than to TN, but at high TP concentrations TN explained more of the variability in Chla than TP. Macrophyte cover tended to decrease at increasing TN when TP was between 0.1 and 0.4 mg/l. At macrophyte cover above 20%, Chla was considerably lower compared with lakes with low macrophyte cover. We conclude that P is of key importance for the ecological quality of Danish lakes but that increased N concentrations, particularly in shallow lakes with moderate to high TP, may have significantly adverse effects on lake water quality and ecological status in summer.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2017	795	1					35	48		10.1007/s10750-017-3110-x								WOS:000401917000003

Natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale region: well pad densities and aquatic communities	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Few studies have examined the relationship between natural gas development and surface water quality using well pad density (the number of well pads/km(2)) as an indicator of potential impacts to aquatic life, specifically fish, salamander, and crayfish assemblages. We tested the hypothesis that animal assemblages, assessed by densities of ecologically important species, will differ among groups of watersheds with different well pad densities. In 2011, sites were sampled in Pennsylvania between July 13 and September 14 (N = 28; 10 = no well pads, 8 = low density, 10 = moderate density). We did not detect evidence of impact on fish, salamander, and crayfish assemblages. It should be noted that this study primarily assessed infrastructure-related impacts. Watersheds under investigations in this study area included no stream withdrawals for drilling and relatively low well pad density (<= 0.541 well pads/km(2)), which reduces the amount of roads and pipeline as well as sediment runoff reaching the stream from this and other infrastructure during development. In addition, setback and landscape limitations also kept well pads relatively far from surface waters, and these watersheds remained highly forested after development because most were in state forests. Therefore, these findings represent the least intrusive scenario for impacts to aquatic communities while extracting natural gas.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2017	795	1					49	64		10.1007/s10750-017-3112-8								WOS:000401917000004

HYDROBIOLOGIA												Two methods of quantifying diatoms were compared: (i) by counting valves, and (ii) by simple assignment of individual species to a seven-point scale according to their coverage on a glass slide. The saprobity-trophic index introduced in the Czech Republic for assessing the ecological status of running waters in accordance with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) was used for comparison. There were no statistically significant differences between the indices as calculated by the studied methods, and therefore the comparable indicative values of the two approaches were demonstrated. In all cases, however, indices based on coverage classes achieved higher correlation with the fundamental water chemistry parameters than did indices based on diatom valve counts. To explain the cause of higher correlations, different variants of editing input data were used. The results support the assumption that the main cause of the poorer predictive value for the index based on diatom valve counts is that the abundant taxa are attributed too much importance in the final assessment of the environment quality. Using degrees of coverage for the quantification of diatoms in evaluating the ecological status thus appears to be preferable (or at least sufficient) for the given purpose.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2017	795	1					113	127		10.1007/s10750-017-3123-5								WOS:000401917000008

Carbon dioxide emissions and sediment organic carbon burials across a gradient of trophic state in eleven New Zealand lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lakes are known to be important to the global carbon balance as they are both CO2 sources to the atmosphere and also accumulate large amounts of carbon in their sediment. CO2 flux dynamics across the air-water interface in 11 lakes of varying trophic state in the Rotorua region, New Zealand, derived from measured alkalinity, pH and wind speed at given temperature, showed that lakes may shift from being atmospheric CO2 sources to sinks due to seasonal changes in phytoplankton productivity and lake mixing dynamics. Decreases in trophic state (i.e. improved water quality) in some of the lakes over the eight-year monitoring period were associated with increased surface water CO2 concentrations and, as a consequence, increased CO2 flux to the atmosphere. Organic carbon content analysis of the bottom sediments revealed that lakes with high phytoplankton productivity, indicated by high chlorophyll a biomass, generally had high rates of carbon deposition to the sediments, but not all deposited carbon was permanently buried. Remineralization of the organic carbon accrued in productive lakes may potentially generate CO2, as well as CH4, which promotes these lakes to act as greenhouse gas emitters.

The aeration process is achieved by injecting air over the surfaces of submerged, translating blades. Mathematical model and numerical methods employed are validated by comparing predicted results against prior experimental measurements. Parametric study is conducted in a two-dimensional geometry by employing the Eulerian multiphase model with k-omega SST turbulence model to assess the significance of interfacial forces and the parameters affecting features of dissolved oxygen. Multiphase mixture model with LES turbulence model is employed to study oxygen dissolution in three-dimensional geometries. A single blade and an array of blades with free ends are considered. Aeration does not influence the drag coefficient of the single blade while it can have profound influence on drag forces acting on blades in an array configuration. While achieving aeration to improve water quality this study can aid in designing and optimizing river current energy harvesting devices consisting of translating blades. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Both the predicted and real-world performance of these heat exchangers is affected by the fouling build-up on the heat transfer surfaces. Thus, accurate quantification of fouling thermal resistance is required to address the correlation between the fouling resistance of heat transfer tubes and operation conditions. A newly developed Fouling Measurement System (FMS) supports research on the relationships between fouling development and operation condition by measuring fouling thermal resistance on the heat transfer surface. Part I of this two-part series describes the design and evaluation of FMS. An uncertainty analysis of fouling thermal resistance was conducted to identify measurement component contributions to the uncertainty of final results and guide component selection. In Part II, FMS commissioning was performed, and a primary fouling test and analysis on cooling water quality were conducted. The FMS consists of three subsystems: heat pump subsystem, cooling/chilled water subsystem and control and data acquisition (DAQ) subsystem. The FMS has three heat pumps individually installed with a shell-and-tube condenser and separately equipped with a cooling/chilled water supply loop. In the cooling/chilled water subsystem, these three heat pumps share the same cooling water pool and chilled water pool, which ensures that the cooling/chilled water supplied to each heat pump is uniform. A cooling water tower was installed outside the Air Quality Lab in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to cool down the cooling water of the FMS, and to evaporate water and keep the cooling water at the required range. In the control and DAQ subsystem, the control of water temperature, water quality, water velocity, and refrigerant saturation temperature are described. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Commissioning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER												The Fouling Measurement System (FMS) supports research on the relationships between fouling deposit and operation condition involving water velocity, water quality and tube geometry by measuring variation of fouling resistance on a heat transfer tube during long-term running. Part I of this series provides the description and design evaluation of the newly developed FMS. Part II of this series describes FMS commissioning and documents the entire system performance and primary fouling test with nine same type enhanced tubes. Results of system commissioning demonstrated that the FMS would take 128 min to reach steady-state. Water velocity could be controlled at three velocities of similar to 0.9 m/s, similar to 1.6 m/s and similar to 2.4 m/s respectively to satisfy the experiment requirement. Saturation temperature can be adjusted in the range of similar to 34.0-35.5 degrees C at water velocity of 0.99 m/s, as a result, the heat flux varied from similar to 20.1 kW/m(2) to 26.5 kW/m(2) correspondingly. The rising rate of electrical conductivity (EC) was 130 mu s/cm per day. All the parameters of the cooling water were controlled at the required range, except calcium hardness, which is 480-860 ppm and much higher than the upper limit of 391 ppm. The fouling resistances increased to 0.3865-0.5078 m(2) K/kW after 60 days at an amplitude of 12.48% around the averaged value of 0.4864 m(2) K/kW. The water-side pressure drop decreased from 4.34-4.62 kPa at clean condition to 2.90-3.10 kPa at fouled condition after 60-day continuous running at similar to 0.99 m/s. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A year-long monitoring program in the shore area of Chongqing Urban Section of the Jialing River (JR) was launched to determine the variations in carbonic anhydrase activity (CAA) and its change mechanism in the hydro-fluctuation belt of the tributaries in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) area. The variations in basic water quality parameters, different carbon forms, and CAA were investigated from November 2013 to October 2014. Results showed that the mean CAA value in JR was 0.67 +/- 0.31 EU/10(6) cells. CAA was high during the flood stage, low during the impounding stage, and peaked on April 3, 2014 during the discharging stage. No significant difference was observed in the CAA of different sampling sites in JR. However, a significant difference was observed between the CAA of JR and that of the Yangtze River. Correlation analyses showed that water temperature, pH, algal cell density, and dissoluble organic carbon were positively correlated with CAA, whereas CO2 and dissoluble inorganic carbon were negatively correlated with CAA. A model for CAA and related parameters was built through principal component regression. The equation was expressed as follows: CM = 0.116T + 0.00746Cells+0.0156pH-0.0157CO(2)-0.0150D1C+0.0135D0C+0.565. Results revealed that CAA in JR was controlled by multiple factors, which could be used for CM monitoring. The model demonstrated a potential value in controlling algal blooms. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Kamata, M; Asami, M; Matsui, Y				Kamata, Motoyuki; Asami, Mari; Matsui, Yoshihiko			Presence of the beta-triketone herbicide tefuryltrione in drinking water sources and its degradation product in drinking waters	CHEMOSPHERE												Triketone herbicides are becoming popular because of their herbicidal activity against sulfonylurea-resistant weeds. Among these herbicides, tefuryltrione (TFT) is the first registered herbicide for rice farming, and recently its distribution has grown dramatically. In this study, we developed analytical methods for TFT and its degradation product 2-chloro-4-methylsulfonyl-3-[(tetrahydrofuran-2-ylmethoxy) methyl] benzoic acid (CMTBA). TFT was found frequently in surface waters in rice production areas at concentrations as high as 1.9 a. The maximum observed concentration was lower than but close to 2 mu g/L, which is the Japanese reference concentration of ambient water quality for pesticides. However, TFT was not found in any drinking waters even though the source waters were purified by conventional coagulation and filtration processes; this was due to chlorination, which transforms TFT to CMTBA. The conversion rate of TFT to CMBA on chlorination was almost 100%, and CMTBA was stable in the presence of chlorine. Moreover, CMTBA was found in drinking waters sampled from household water taps at a similar concentration to that of TFT in the source water of the water purification plant. Although the acceptable daily intake and the reference concentration of CMTBA are unknown, the highest concentration in drinking water exceeded 0.1 mu g/L, which is the maximum allowable concentration for any individual pesticide and its relevant metabolites in the European Union Drinking Directive.

Leachate, generated during the landfill treatment of municipal solid waste, is the important hotspot of the antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and no effective on-site treatment has been put forward for preventing ARGs dissemination. Herein, the aged refuse bioreactor was employed to remove antibiotics and ARGs from leachate, and the great removal performance was observed. For the detected antibiotics, the total removal efficiency was about 76.75%, and sulfanilamide and macrolide were removed with high efficiencies (>80%). Among the target ARGs, tetracycline and macrolide resistance genes (tetM, tetQand ermB) were eliminated with 1.2-2.0 orders of magnitude. The occurrences of ARGs did not correlated with water quality parameters such as COD, total nitrogen, ammonia, nitrate and nitrite, but closely linked to the variations of the bacterial community structure. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated the significant correlations between four genera and the distribution of ARGs, which implied that these key genera (including potential pathogens) drove the ARGs removal. Furthermore, the hydraulic loading test confirmed that the aged refuse bioreactor was capable of achieving high removal efficiencies even under shock loading for the higher loading was negative for the proliferations of potential ARGs hosts. This study suggested that aged refuse bioreactor could be a promising way for antibiotics and ARGs on-site removal from leachate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The device uses the ascorbic acid method, a colourimetric absorbance based assay, for phosphate determination. The integrated system consists of two components; the disposable centrifugal microfluidic disc and the complementary system. The microfluidic disc is designed to have similar dimensions to that of a compact disc, with a slightly thicker composition. Capillary active micro-channels are integrated internally, through which small and precise volumes of fluids can flow. Upon loading of the disc with a water sample and chemical reagents, the fluids can be moved through the disc using centrifugal force. This is created by rotation of the disc by the motor in the complementary system. The loaded fluids are then mixed due to rapid expansion and contraction as they are forced through the microfluidic channels and significantly larger reservoirs. Once mixing has occurred, this force will then drive the fluid into the optical detection zone. The low-cost optical detection system incorporated into the complementary system consists of an LED-photodiode transducing pair that measures the absorbance of light by the molybdenum blue complex formed at 880 nm. The total mass of 2 kg and dimensions of 20 cm x 18 cm x 14 cm make this system portable and convenient for analysis at the sampling site. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of this device were 5 and 14 jig L-1 PO4-P, respectively. The linear range of 14-800 mu g L-1 and sensitivity of 0.003 AU L mu g(-1) make it suitable for analysing water bodies with low levels of phosphate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A worldwide data set of 699 observations drawn from 133 studies combines information reported in primary studies with geospatial data. The meta-analysis explores antagonisms and synergies between ecosystem services. This is the first meta-analysis to incorporate simultaneously external geospatial data and ecosystem service interactions. We first show that it is possible to reliably predict the value of ecosystem services provided by lakes based on their physical and geographic characteristics. Second, we demonstrate that interactions between ecosystem services appear to be significant for explaining lake ecosystem service values. Third, we provide an estimation of the average value of ecosystem services provided by lakes: between 106 and 140 USD$2010 per respondent per year for non-hedonic price studies and between 169 and 403 USD$2010 per property per year for hedonic price studies.

Due to their solubility, they can be affected by changes in the soil water regime. This needs to be taken into account when assessing the environmental and agronomical impacts of the adoption of irrigation. To gain knowledge on the importance of the effect of irrigation on carbonates dynamics in the tilled layer (0-20 cm) of agricultural soils, we conducted a two-step study embracing field observations and numerical simulation. First, carbonates storage and their size distribution were quantified for two different situations (irrigation and non-irrigation) in three irrigation districts with different time under irrigation (Valtierra (19 years), Miranda (5 years) and Funes (12 years)) in Navarre (Spain). Soil sampling was designed to ensure homogeneous comparisons in the most characteristic soil types at each site (Xeric Haplocalcid, Typic Calcixerept and Xeric Haplocalcid, respectively). Carbonates concentration was systematically lower with irrigation in the finest (<50 mu m) soil fraction: 22.2 +/- 1.4 g carbonates 100 g(-1) fraction without irrigation for 16.1 +/- 0.9 with irrigation in Valtierra, 26.7 +/- 1.1 for 19.1 +/- 3.8 in Miranda and 27.8 +/- 2.9 for 22.7 +/- 1.5 at Funesl. However, the net annual balance of total carbonates-C between irrigated and non irrigated condition was neutral at the three sites. This can be explained by agricultural management affecting carbonates in the sand-size fraction, including the addition of carbonates with fertilizers, and coarse carbonate particles brought to the surface by tillage. In a second step, a simplified model was developed for use with easily available data in most irrigation districts, and numerical simulations of the geochemical interactions between the soil, the soil solution and irrigation water were run using actual soil and soil solution data from the tilled layer of another pair of plots in Funes (Funes2). Sensitive analysis was also conducted to investigate the potential impact of water quality and crop types as sources of variability on the model outputs. The modelling results showed annual values of carbonates-C loss in the range between 13.52 and 12.06 g m(-2) year(-1) in the studied depth under irrigation, depending on the quality of irrigation water, for 0.46 g m(-2) without irrigation. These data were within the range of carbonates budgets found in the literature but one order of magnitude lower than the observed results in the fine fraction in the field. Overall, our results showed that irrigation can significantly alter carbonates dynamics in semi-arid Mediterranean land, which implies that human use can significantly alter the mineral phase of these soils in a relatively short time lapse. Simple geochemical models can be a useful approach to evaluate changes in the carbonates balance at the local and regional scale when irrigation is applied, although they have to be improved to account for other factors related to agricultural management and local geochemical conditions.

This paper presents a novel 3D information acquisition and location method, by means of an information acquisition platform consisting of a monitoring terminal, frame grabbers, a single camera and a single mirror. Using this platform, we propose a theoretical 2D image model for locating 3D targets and then validate it using data obtained from both real and artificial fish. The proposed model is based on the principles of light refraction, plane mirror imaging, underwater objects and camera imaging as well as the technologies of digital to analog conversion and object segmentation. In contrast with existing methods, our method can accurately reflect 3D information of aquatic organisms, thus providing critical technical support for the development of water quality monitoring systems in the future.

Modeling Water-Quality Parameters Using Genetic Algorithm-Least Squares Support Vector Regression and Genetic Programming	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The modeling and monitoring of water-quality parameters is necessary because of the ever increasing use of water resources and contamination caused by sewage disposal. This study employs two data-driven methods for modeling water-quality parameters. The methods are the least-squares support vector regression (LSSVR) and genetic programming (GP). Model inputs to the LSSVR algorithm and GP were determined using principal component analysis (PCA). The coefficients of the LSSVR were selected by sensitivity analysis employing statistical criteria. The results of the sensitivity analysis of the LSSVR showed that its accuracy depends strongly on the values of its coefficients. The value of the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) statistic was negative for 60% of the combinations of coefficients applied in the sensitivity analysis. That is, using the mean of a time series would produce a more accurate estimate of water-quality parameters than the LSSVR method in 60% of the combinations of parameters tried. The genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with LSSVR to produce the GA-LSSVR algorithm with which to achieve improved accuracy in modeling water-quality parameters. The GA-LSSVR algorithm and the GP method were employed in modeling Na+, K+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl-, pH, electric conductivity (EC), and total dissolved solids (TDS) in the Sefidrood River, Iran. The results indicate that the GA-LSSVR algorithm has better accuracy for modeling water-quality parameters than GP judged by the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the NS criterion. The NS static established, however, that the GA-LSSVR and GP methods have the capacity to model water-quality parameters accurately.

Moreover, these systems are vulnerable to either accidental spills or intentional unauthorized discharges. To properly manage them, a limited number of sensors could be placed at different locations to monitor the water quality. In this paper, multiobjective and single-objective optimization procedures to optimally locate sensors in sewer systems are proposed, tested, and compared. The multiobjective procedures include objective functions related to information theory (IT procedure), detection time and reliability (DR procedure), and a combination of them (IT_DR procedure). The single-objective procedures include a greedy-based objective function (GR procedure) and a merged objective function (DR_IT_GR procedure). The procedures show a similar performance when applied on a small network, whereas in a real system, the results show that (1)the IT-based method can be effectively used as a filtering technique; (2)the DR_IT_GR procedure outperforms the other multiobjective ones; and (3)the GR procedure is very efficient in finding the Pareto extreme solutions.

Optimizing Locations for Chlorine Booster Stations in Small Water Distribution Networks	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												In this paper, an index-based approach is proposed to locate chlorine booster stations in a water distribution network (DN). Chlorination is a common practice for secondary disinfection, essential for protection against microbiological regrowth and contaminant intrusion. However, higher levels of free residual chlorine (FRC) may lead to unwanted disinfectant by-products (DBPs) and taste and odor complaints. Booster chlorination can be used to maintain minimum levels of FRC. This requires proper selection of booster locations. The approach proposed here uses a generic hydraulic and water quality modeling software programmers' toolkit to predict FRC and total trihalomethanes (TTHMs) converted, thereafter, into a water quality index (WQI). A heuristic algorithm maximum covering location problem (MCLP) used in optimization maximizes WQI. TTHM is converted into trihalomethane (THM) species using quadratic optimization, then to cancer and noncancer risk potentials. Finally, the required number of booster stations is recommended based on a trade-off analysis of risk potentials, WQI, and the life cycle cost of booster chlorination. For proof of concept, case studies are conducted in a hypothetical and a municipal DN.

Water quality indices can and have been used to identify threats to water quality along a stream and contribute to better water resources management. There are many water quality indices for the assessment and use of surface water for drinking purposes. However, there is no well-established index for the assessment and direct use of river water for irrigation purposes. The aim of this study was to adopt the framework of the National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) and, with adjustments, apply it in a way which will conform to irrigation water quality requirements. To accomplish this, the NSFWQI parameters for drinking water use were amended to include water quality parameters suitable for irrigation. For each selected parameter, an individual weighting chart was generated according to the FAO 29 guideline. The NSFWQI formula was then used to calculate a final index value, and for each parameter an acceptable range in this value was determined. The new index was then applied to the Ghezel Ozan River in Iran as a case study. A forty five year record of water quality data (1966 to 2010) was collected from four hydrometery stations along the river. Water quality parameters including Na+, Cl-, pH, HCO(-)3, EC, SAR and TDS were employed for water quality analysis using the adjusted NSFWQI formula. The results of this case study showed variation in water quality from the upstream to downstream ends of the river. Consistent monitoring of the river water quality and the establishment of a long term management plan were recommlended for the protection of thisvaluable water resource. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION												The presence of pollutants in waters, particularly from heavy metals, is of grave concern worldwide due to its cytotoxicity to organisms. Fish and aquatic organisms are very sensitive to the increasing Cu concentrations in water. Therefore, Cu toxicity partly depends on water quality. To address the effects of impulsive copper contamination of the phytoplanktonzooplankton population dynamics, we've built a model that focuses on the interaction between algae and Daphnia with deterministic and stochastic impulse copper. In fact the Results have shown three types of outcomes depending on copper concentration. In low (4.4 mu g L-1) copper concentration, deterministic and stochastic pulses may promote the persistence of Daphnia and algae populations unlike the absence of pulses. Whereas, in high (28 mu g L-1) concentration, it accelerates deficiency and toxicity processes, leads to the extinction of all populations and in intermediate concentrations. Deterministic and stochastic pulses may transform population dynamics in complex oscillations. Numerical results show that the system that has been considered has more complex dynamics including bifurcation, period-doubling oscillations and chaos. Depending on minimum copper concentration in the environment, the bifurcation diagram has highlighted the resilience or the regime shifts of the system in occurrence of pulse contamination.																	1007-5704	1878-7274				JUL	2017	48						170	178		10.1016/j.cnsns.2016.12.009								WOS:000395211000013						
J	Chen, HJ; Zhang, XY; Demars, C; Zhang, MH				Chen, Huajin; Zhang, Xuyang; Demars, Christopher; Zhang, Minghua			Numerical simulation of agricultural sediment and pesticide runoff: RZWQM and PRZM comparison	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Agricultural sediment and pesticide runoff is a widespread ecological and human health concern. Numerical simulation models, such as Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) and Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM), have been increasingly used to quantify off-site agricultural pollutant movement. However, RZWQM has been criticized for its inability to simulate sedimentation processes. The recent incorporation of the sedimentation module of Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems has enabled RZWQM to simulate sediment and sediment-associated pesticides. This study compares the sediment and pesticide transport simulation performance of the newly released RZWQM and PRZM using runoff data from 2 alfalfa fields in Davis, California. A composite metric (based on coefficient of determination, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, index of agreement, and percent bias) was developed and employed to ensure robust, comprehensive assessment of model performance. Results showed that surface water runoff was predicted reasonably well (absolute percent bias <31%) by RZWQM and PRZM after adjusting important hydrologic parameters. Even after calibration, underestimation bias (-89% <= PBIAS <= -36%) for sediment yield was observed in both models. This might be attributed to PRZM's incorrect distribution of input water and uncertainty in RZWQM's runoff erosivity coefficient. Moreover, the underestimation of sediment might be less if the origin of measured sediment was considered. Chlorpyrifos losses were simulated with reasonable accuracy especially for Field A (absolute PBIAS <= 22%), whereas diuron losses were underestimated to a great extent (-98% <= PBIAS <= -65%) in both models. This could be attributed to the underprediction of herbicide concentration in the top soil due to the limitations of the instantaneous equilibrium sorption model as well as the high runoff potential of herbicide formulated as water-dispersible granules. RZWQM and PRZM partitioned pesticides into the water and sediment phases similarly. According to model predictions, the majority of pesticide loads were carried via the water phase. On the basis of this study, both RZWQM and PRZM performed well in predicting runoff that carried highly adsorptive pesticides on an event basis, although the more physically based RZWQM is recommended when field-measured soil hydraulic properties are available.

J	Zhong, XX; Xu, GJ; Xu, HL				Zhong Xiaoxiao; Xu Guangjian; Xu Henglong			Use of multiple functional traits of protozoa for bioassessment of marine pollution	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Ecological parameters based on multiply functional traits have many advantages for monitoring programs by reducing "signal to noise" ratios of observed species data. To identify potential indicators for bioassessment of marine pollution in function space, the functional patterns of protozoan communities and relationships with environmental changes were studied in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea during a 1-year period. The results showed that: (1) the spatial variability in functional trait distributions of the protozoa was significantly associated with changes in environmental variables, especially chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrients on spatial scale; (2) the functional traits, especially food resources and feeding type, were significantly correlated with COD and nutrients; and (3) the functional diversity indices were generally related to nutrients or COD. Based on the results, we suggest that the functional traits and diversity indices of protozoan communities may be used as more effective indicators for bioassessment of marine pollution.

Environmental indicators and macrobenthic communities, were investigated during summer and winter 2015. Results indicated a strong seasonality in biotope of intertidal and subtidal zones. Lower macrobenthic diversity were calculated from subtidal inner bay, reflecting the effects of anthropogenic nutrients. However, intertidal sites in that part were indicated to be in a relatively healthier ecological status. Seasonal effects of excess nutrients on benthic habitat were reflected in ecological indicators. It is concluded that the excess nutrients at spatiotemporal scales, influences on the health of benthic habitat. Eventually, it is recommended by this research that, with considering the natural/anthropogenic circumstances, the taxonomic and phylogenetic ecological indicators would be helpful tools to evaluate the benthic health of a typical sub-tropical semi-enclosed bay.

Four types of coastal engineering works were analyzed, namely port construction, petroleum exploitation, fishery and aquaculture, and seawall defense. In addition, two areas with limited human disturbances were considered for comparison. From the weights of the response value for each indicator, port construction was determined to be the primary impact contributor among the four engineering works studies. Specifically, hydrodynamic conditions, ecological status, economic costs, and engineering intensity were on average 72.78%, 65.03%, 75.03%, and 66.35% higher than those of other engineering types. Furthermore, fishery and aquaculture impact on water quality was 42.51% higher than that of other engineering types, whereas seawall defense impact on landscape variation was 51.75% higher than that of other engineering types. The proposed indicator system may provide effective coastal management in future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Variation in the health and biochemical condition of the coral Acropora tenuis along two water quality gradients on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												This study explores how plasticity in biochemical attributes, used as indicators of health and condition, enables the coral Acropora tenuis to respond to differing water quality regimes in inshore regions of the Great Barrier Reef. Health attributes were monitored along a strong and weak water quality gradient, each with three reefs at increasing distances from a major river source. Attributes differed significantly only along the strong gradient; corals grew fastest, had the least dense skeletons, highest symbiont densities and highest lipid concentrations closest to the river mouth, where water quality was poorest. High nutrient and particulate loads were only detrimental to skeletal density, which decreased as linear extension increased, highlighting a trade-off. Our study underscores the importance of assessing multiple health attributes in coral reef monitoring. For example, autotrophic indices are poor indicators of coral health and condition, but improve when combined with attributes like lipid content and biomass.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				JUN 30	2017	119	2					106	119		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.03.066								WOS:000403985200012	28460877

Results from the bench-scale experiments showed that the commercial hydroponic nutrient solution (i.e. solution containing water and essential nutrients) exhibited similar performance (i.e., water flux and reverse salt flux) to other inorganic draw solutions when treating synthetic wastewater. The use of hydroponic solution is highly advantageous since it provides all the required macro- (i.e., N, P and K) and micronutrients (i.e., Ca, Mg, S, Mn, B, Zn and Mo) in a single balanced solution and can therefore be used directly after dilution without the need to add any elements. After long-term operation (i.e. up to 75% water recovery), different physical cleaning methods were tested and results showed that hydraulic flushing can effectively restore up to 75% of the initial water flux while osmotic backwashing was able to restore the initial water flux by more than 95%; illustrating the low-fouling potential of the FDFO process. Pilot-scale studies demonstrated that the FDFO process is able to produce the required nutrient concentration and final water quality (i.e., pH and conductivity) suitable for hydroponic applications. Coupling FDFO with pressure assisted osmosis (PAO) in the later stages could help in saving operational costs (i.e., energy and membrane replacement costs). Finally, the test application of nutrient solution produced by the pilot FDFO process to hydroponic lettuce showed similar growth pattern as the control without any signs of nutrient deficiency.

Morbidity and mortality can be considerable on a farm with huge economic consequences for the farmer as well as compromised welfare for the mink kits. Although efforts have been taken to identify etiologic agents involved in outbreaks, the syndrome is still regarded as multifactorial and recurring problems on the same farms draw attention to management and environmental risk factors. In the preweaning period from May to June 2015, a case control study was carried out on 30 Danish mink farms. Data concerning management, biosecurity, hygiene, feed consumption, antibacterial prescription and production efficiency were analyzed. Results: The proportion of 1-year old females, farm size (total number of females), energy supply per female in the late gestation period, and dogs accessing the farm area were significantly associated with being a case farm. Case farms were prescribed almost twice the amount of antibacterials per gestational unit (female and litter) as in control farms. Farmers on case farms spent significantly more time nursing and treating the animals and experienced more females with mastitis compared to farmers on control farms. No significant differences in cleaning practices or hygienic measures between case and control farms were found and there were no differences in drinking water quality, bedding material, composition neither of color types nor in management regarding litter equalization. Conclusions: Results from this study showed an association between the occurrence of pre-weaning diarrhea on mink farms and parity profile, farm size and feeding intensity in the gestational period. The access of dogs to the farm area was a significant risk factor, but needs further clarification.

Rainfall and streamflow sensor network design: a review of applications, classification, and a proposed framework	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Sensors and sensor networks play an important role in decision-making related to water quality, operational streamflow forecasting, flood early warning systems, and other areas. In this paper we review a number of existing applications and analyse a variety of evaluation and design procedures for sensor networks with respect to various criteria. Most of the existing approaches focus on maximising the observability and information content of a variable of interest. From the context of hydrological modelling only a few studies use the performance of the hydrological simulation in terms of output discharge as a design criterion. In addition to the review, we propose a framework for classifying the existing design methods, and a generalised procedure for an optimal network design in the context of rainfall-runoff hydrological modelling.

Altered acrylic acid concentrations in hard and soft corals exposed to deteriorating water conditions	FACETS												A reliable marker of early coral response to environmental stressors can help guide decision-making to mitigate global coral reef decline by detecting problems before the development of clinically observable disease. We document the accumulation of acrylic acid in two divergent coral taxa, stony small polyp coral (Acropora sp.) and soft coral (Lobophytum sp.), in response to deteriorating water quality characterized by moderately increased ammonia (0.25 ppm) and phosphate (0.15 ppm) concentrations and decreased calcium (360 ppm) concentration, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomic techniques. Changes in acrylic acid concentration in polyp tissues free of zooxanthellae suggest that acrylic acid could be a product of animal metabolism and not exclusively a metabolic by-product of the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in marine algae or bacteria. Our findings build on previously documented depletions of acrylic acid in wild coral potentially correlated to temperature stress and provide additional insight into approaches to further characterize the nature of the metabolic accumulation of acrylic acid under controlled experimental conditions.

Understanding the differences in risk factors in various environments can help to explain differences in the occurrence of these outcomes and can be used to develop public health programs, interventions, and policies. Efforts to characterize urban and rural differences have largely focused on social and demographic characteristics. A paucity of national standardized environmental data has hindered efforts to characterize differences in the physical aspects of urban and rural areas, such as air and water quality. Reporting Period: 2008-2012 for air quality and 2010-2015 for water quality. Description of System: Since 2002, CDC's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program has collaborated with federal, state, and local partners to gather standardized environmental data by creating national data standards, collecting available data, and disseminating data to be used in developing public health actions. The National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (i.e., the tracking network) collects data provided by national, state, and local partners and includes 21 health outcomes, exposures, and environmental hazards. To assess environmental factors that affect health, CDC analyzed three air-quality measures from the tracking network for all counties in the contiguous United States during 2008-2012 and one water-quality measure for 26 states during 2010-2015. The three air-quality measures include 1) total number of days with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels greater than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 24-hour average PM2.5 (PM2.5 days); 2) mean annual average ambient concentrations of PM2.5 in micrograms per cubic meter (mean PM2.5); and 3) total number of days with maximum 8-hour average ozone concentrations greater than the NAAQS (ozone days). The water-quality measure compared the annual mean concentration for a community water system (CWS) to the maximum contaminant level (MCL) defined by EPA for 10 contaminants: arsenic, atrazine, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), haloacetic acids (HAAS), nitrate, perchloroethene (PCE), radium, trichloroethene (TCE), total trihalomethanes (TTHM), and uranium. Findings are presented by urban-rural classification scheme: four metropolitan (large central metropolitan, large fringe metropolitan, medium metropolitan, and small metropolitan) and two nonmetropolitan (micropolitan and noncore) categories. Regression modeling was used to determine whether differences in the measures by urban-rural categories were statistically significant. Results: Patterns for all three air-quality measures suggest that air quality improves as areas become more rural (or less urban). The mean total number of ozone days decreased from 47.54 days in large central metropolitan counties to 3.81 days in noncore counties, whereas the mean total number of PM2.5 days decreased from 11.21 in large central metropolitan counties to 0.95 in noncore counties. The mean average annual PM2.5 concentration decreased from 11.15 mu g/m(3) in large central metropolitan counties to 8.87 mu g/m(3) in noncore counties. Patterns for the water-quality measure suggest that water quality improves as areas become more urban (or less rural). Overall, 7% of CWSs reported at least one annual mean concentration greater than the MCL for all 10 contaminants combined. The percentage increased from 5.4% in large central metropolitan counties to 10% in noncore counties, a difference that was significant, adjusting for U.S. region, CWS size, water source, and potential spatial correlation. Similar results were found for two disinfection by-products, HAAS and TTHM. Arsenic was the only other contaminant with a significant result. Medium metropolitan counties had 3.1% of CWSs reporting at least one annual mean greater than the MCL, compared with 2.4% in large central counties. Interpretation: Noncore (rural) counties experienced fewer unhealthy air-quality days than large central metropolitan counties, likely because of fewer air pollution sources in the noncore counties. All categories of counties had a mean annual average PM2.5 concentration lower than the EPA standard. Among all CWSs analyzed, the number reporting one or more annual mean contaminant concentrations greater the MCL was small. The water-quality measure suggests that water quality worsens as counties become more rural, in regards to all contaminants combined and for the two disinfection by-products individually. Although significant differences were found for the water-quality measure, the odds ratios were very small, making it difficult to determine whether these differences have a meaningful effect on public health. These differences might be a result of variations in water treatment practices in rural versus urban counties. Public Health Action: Understanding the differences between rural and urban areas in air and water quality can help public health departments to identify, monitor, and prioritize potential environmental public health concerns and opportunities for action. These findings suggest a continued need to develop more geographically targeted, evidence-based interventions to prevent morbidity and mortality associated with poor air and water quality.																	1545-8636					JUN 23	2017	66	13					1	10										WOS:000404693800001	28640797

Amplified surface temperature response of cold, deep lakes to inter-annual air temperature variability	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Summer lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) have previously been shown to respond more rapidly to climatic warming compared to local summer surface air temperatures (SATs). In a globalscale analysis, we explore the factors underpinning the observation of an amplified response of summer LSWT to SAT variability using 20 years of satellite-derived temperatures from 144 lakes. We demonstrate that the degree of amplification in inter-annual summer LSWT is variable, and is greater for cold lakes (e.g. high latitude and high altitude), which are characterised by a short warming season, and deep lakes, that exhibit long correlation timescales of temperature anomalies due to increased thermal inertia. Such lakes are more likely to display responses in excess of local inter-annual summer SAT variability. Climatic modification of LSWT has numerous consequences for water quality and lake ecosystems, so quantifying this amplified response at a global scale is important.																	2045-2322					JUN 23	2017	7								4130	10.1038/s41598-017-04058-0								WOS:000404118700021	28646229

Ravi; Kruse, Peter			Reagent-Free Quantification of Aqueous Free Chlorine via Electrical Readout of Colorimetrically Functionalized Pencil Lines	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES												Colorimetric methods are commonly used to quantify free chlorine in drinking water. However, these methods are not suitable for reagent-free, continuous, and autonomous applications. Here, we demonstrate how functionalization of a pencil-drawn film with phenyl-capped aniline tetramer (PCAT) can be used for quantitative electric readout of free chlorine concentrations. The functionalized film can be implemented in a simple fluidic device for continuous sensing of aqueous free chlorine concentrations. The sensor is selective to free chlorine and can undergo a reagent-free reset for further measurements. Our sensor is superior to electrochemical methods in that it does not require a reference electrode. It is capable of quantification of free chlorine in the range of 0.1-12 ppm with higher precision than colorimetric (absorptivity) methods. The interactions of PCAT with the pencil-drawn film upon exposure to hypochlorite were characterized spectroscopically. A previously reported detection mechanism relied on the measurement of a baseline shift to quantify free chlorine concentrations. The new method demonstrated here measures initial spike size upon exposure to free chlorine. It relies on a fast charge built up on the sensor film due to intermittent PCAT salt formation. It has the advantage of being significantly faster than the measurement of baseline shift, but it cannot be used to detect gradual changes in free chlorine concentration without the use of frequent reset pulses. The stability of PCAT was examined in the presence of free chlorine as a function of pH. While most ions commonly present in drinking water do not interfere with the free chlorine detection, other oxidants may contribute to the signal. Our sensor is easy to fabricate-and robust, operates reagent-free, and has very low power requirements and is thus suitable for remote deployment.

From soil water to surface water - how the riparian zone controls element transport from a boreal forest to a stream	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Boreal headwaters are often lined by strips of highly organic soils, which are the last terrestrial environment to leave an imprint on discharging groundwater before it enters a stream. Because these riparian soils are so different from the Podzol soils that dominate much of the boreal landscape, they are known to have a major impact on the biogeochemistry of important elements such as C, N, P and Fe and the transfer of these elements from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. For most elements, however, the role of the riparian zone has remained unclear, although it should be expected that the mobility of many elements is affected by changes in, for example, pH, redox potential and concentration of organic carbon as they are transported through the riparian zone. Therefore, soil water and groundwater was sampled at different depths along a 22m hillslope transect in the Krycklan catchment in northern Sweden using soil lysimeters and analysed for a large number of major and trace elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Si, Sr, Th, Ti, U, V, Zn, Zr) and other parameters such as sulfate and total organic carbon (TOC). The results showed that the concentrations of most investigated elements increased substantially (up to 60 times) as the water flowed from the uphill mineral soils and into the riparian zone, largely as a result of higher TOC concentrations. The stream water concentrations of these elements were typically somewhat lower than in the riparian zone, but still considerably higher than in the uphill mineral soils, which suggests that riparian soils have a decisive impact on the water quality of boreal streams. The degree of enrichment in the riparian zone for different elements could be linked to the affinity for organic matter, indicating that the pattern with strongly elevated concentrations in riparian soils is typical for organophilic substances. One likely explanation is that the solubility of many organophilic elements increases as a result of the higher concentrations of TOC in the riparian zone. Elements with low or modest affinity for organic matter (e.g. Na, Cl, K, Mg and Ca) occurred in similar or lower concentrations in the riparian zone. Despite the elevated concentrations of many elements in riparian soil water and groundwater, no increase in the concentrations in biota could be observed (bilberry leaves and spruce shoots).

Galvanic Corrosion of Lead by Iron (Oxyhydr)Oxides: Potential Impacts on Drinking Water Quality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Lead exposure via drinking water remains a significant public health risk; this study explored the potential effects of upstream iron corrosion on lead mobility in water distribution systems. Specifically, galvanic corrosion of lead by iron (oxyhydr)oxides was investigated. Coupling an iron mineral cathode with metallic lead in a galvanic cell increased lead release by 531 mu g L-1 on average a 9-fold increase over uniform corrosion in the absence of iron. Cathodes were composed of spark plasma sintered Fe3O4 or alpha-Fe2O3 or field extracted Fe3O4 and alpha-FeOOH. Orthophosphate immobilized oxidized lead as insoluble hydroxypyromorphite, while humic acid enhanced lead mobility. Addition of a humic isolate increased lead release due to uniform corrosion by 81 mu g L-1 and-upon coupling lead to a mineral cathode-release due to galvanic corrosion by 990 mu g L-1. Elevated lead in the presence of humic acid appeared to be driven by complexation, with Pb-208 and UV254 size-exclusion chromatograms exhibiting strong correlation under these conditions (R-average(2) = 0.87). A significant iron corrosion effect was consistent with field data: lead levels after lead service line replacement were greater by factors of 2.3-4.7 at sites supplied by unlined cast iron distribution mains compared with the alternative, lined ductile iron.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				JUN 20	2017	51	12					6812	6820		10.1021/acs.est.7b01671								WOS:000404087400021	28557454

A Complementary Isothermal Amplification Method to the US EPA Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Approach for the Detection of Enterococci in Environmental Waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We report a novel molecular assay, based on helicasedependent amplification (HDA), for the detection of enterococci as markers for fecal pollution in water. This isothermal assay targets the same Enterococcus 23S r-RNA gene region as the existing quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Methods 1611 and 1609 but can be entirely performed on a simple heating block. The developed Enterococcus HDA assay successfully discriminated 15 enterococcal from 15 non-enterococcal reference strains and reliably detected 48 environmental isolates of enterococci. The limit of detection was 25 target copies per reaction, only 3 times higher than that of qPCR. The applicability of the assay was tested on 30 environmental water sample DNA extracts, simulating a gradient of fecal pollution. Despite the isothermal nature of the reaction, the HDA results were consistent with those of the qPCR reference. Given this performance, we conclude that the developed Enterococcus HDA assay has great potential as a qualitative molecular screening method for resource-limited settings when combined with compatible up- and downstream processes. This amplification strategy can pave the way for developing a new generation of rapid, low-cost, and field-deployable molecular diagnostic tools for water quality monitoring.

However, little empirical evidence exists to characterize the potential health benefits from sanitation externalities. This study investigated the effect of community sanitation coverage versus individual household sanitation access on child health and drinking water quality. Using a Census of 121 villages in rural Mali, we analyzed the association of community latrine coverage (defined' by a 200 m radius surrounding a household) and individual household latrine ownership with child growth and household stored water quality. Child height-for-age had a significant and positive linear relationship with community latrine coverage, while child weight-for-age and household water quality had nonlinear relationships that leveled off above 60% coverage (p < 0.01; generalized additive models). Child growth and water quality were not associated with individual household latrine ownership. The relationship between community latrine coverage and child height was strongest among households without a latrine; for these households, each 10% increase in latrine coverage was associated with a 0.031 (p-value = 0.040) increase in height-for-age z-score. In this study, the level of sanitation access of surrounding households was more important than private latrine access for protecting water quality and child health.

With few exceptions, such test systems are discontinuous. They require exposure of the biological test material in small units, such as multiwell plates, during prolonged incubation periods, and do not allow online read-outs. It is mostly due to these shortcomings that applications in continuous monitoring of, e.g., drinking or surface water quality are largely missing. We propose the use of pipetting robots that can be used to automatically exchange samples in multiwell plates with fresh samples in a semi-static manner, as a potential solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we developed a simple and low-cost, versatile pipetting robot constructed partly using open source hardware that has a small footprint and can be used for online monitoring of water quality by means of an automated whole-organism bioassay. We tested its precision in automated 2-fold dilution series and used it for exposure of zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) a common model species in ecotoxicology to cadmium chloride and permethrin. We found that, compared to conventional static or semi-static exposure scenarios, effects of the two chemicals in zebrafish embryos generally occurred at lower concentrations, and analytically verified that the increased frequency of media exchange resulted in a greater availability of the chemical. In combination with advanced detection systems this custom-made pipetting robot has the potential to become a valuable tool in future monitoring strategies for drinking and surface water.

Here we investigate the role of guano on corals reefs across scales by analyzing the stable nitrogen isotopic (delta N-15) values of the scleractinian coral Pocillopora damicornis on fringing reefs around two Pacific remote islets with large seabird colonies. Marine stations closest to the seabird colonies had higher nitrate + nitrite concentrations compared to more distant stations. Coral and zooxanthellae delta N-15 values were also higher at these sites, suggesting that guano-derived nitrogen is assimilated into corals and contributes to their nitrogen requirements. The spatial extent of guano influence was however restricted to a local scale. Our results demonstrate that seabird-derived nutrients not only spread across the terrestrial ecosystem, but also affect components of the adjacent marine ecosystem. Further studies are now needed to assess if this nutrient input has a positive or negative effect for corals. Such studies on remote islets also open fresh perspectives to understand how nutrients affect coral reefs isolated from other anthropogenic stressors.

E. coli isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 18 antibiotics. Most of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline (TE), followed by ampicillin (AM), piperacillin (PIP), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT), and chloramphenicol (C). The antibiotic resistance rate of E. coli isolates from two water sources was similar; For E. coli isolates from the Qiantang River, their antibiotic resistance rates decreased from up-to downstream. Seasonally, the dry and wet season had little impact on antibiotic resistance. Spearman's rank correlation revealed significant correlation between resistance to TE and phenicols or ciprofloxacin (CIP), as well as quinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin) and cephalosporins or gentamicin (GM). Pearson's chi-square tests found certain water parameters such as nutrient concentration were strongly associated with resistance to some of the antibiotics. In addition, tet genes were detected from all 82 TE-resistant E. coli isolates, and most of the isolates (81.87%) contained multiple tet genes, which displayed 14 different combinations. Collectively, this study provided baseline data on antibiotic resistance of drinking water sources in Hangzhou city, which indicates drinking water sources could be the reservoir of antibiotic resistance, potentially presenting a public health risk.																	1664-302X					JUN 16	2017	8								1133	10.3389/fmicb.2017.01133								WOS:000403403700002	28670309

In the 2013-2015 period, randomly were taken eleven samples from four small artificial lakes located in the Bucharest-Ilfov area. From the computed basic statistic on 77 values were obtained both perfect positive correlation and perfect negative correlation for the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Strong positive correlation was found between the pair pH -SO42+ and between SO42+ -N-NO2- a low positive correlation. From the cluster analysis of six indicators, five clusters were achieved. The high level of similarity was obtained between CBO5 and SO42+ with a percent of 87.7%. For the analyzed water samples, the obtained value of 3.05 indicates a low degree of contamination for the monitored small artificial lakes. The Ptot values ranged from 0.02 mg/L to 0.23 mg/L and led to the establishment of the eutrophication status of the lakes water, from eutrophic status to hypereutrophic status, according to Romanian Order no. 161 of 2006. According to the same legislative act, the water of the monitored lakes falls within second class of water quality.																	2069-5837					JUN 15	2017	7	3					2048	2052										WOS:000411240800004						
J	Zhou, LX				Zhou Lixiang			Biomineralization: a Pivotal Process in Developing a Novel Passive Treatment System for Acid Mine Drainage	ACTA CHIMICA SINICA												Biomineralization, a ubiquitous phenomenon found in nature, is a process of the formation of mineral crystal mediated biologically. However, little information is available on how to consciously regulate and strengthen this biomineralization process with an aim to treat effectively wastewater. Here we develop a novel passive biomineralization-limestone ditch treatment system (PBDTS) for purifying toxic metal-containing acid mine drainages (AMD) generated in many mines. It is well documented that the treatment of AMD by traditional passive limestone ditch treatment system (PLDTS) consume a large amount of lime and consequently produce many toxic residue to be treated due to high concentration of dissolved iron and sulphate in AMD. In the paper, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans biofilm formed in elastic filler packed in AMD will oxide Fe(2+)in AND into Fe3+ and subsequently form biogenic schweitmannite [Fe8O8(OH)(6)SO4]. Newly formed schwertmannite as a crystal seed will grow by self and scavenge, to a great extent, most of toxic metalloid As and a few of heavy metal cation;through co-precipitation and/or adsorption processes. The remaining non-mineralized Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by Acidiphilic iron-reducing bacterial (Acidiphilium sp.) immobilized in slow-release organic carbon-source material filled in next stage of AMD ditch. The resulting Fe2+ from the biological reduction of Fe3+ are re-oxidized by Acidithiobacillits ferrooxidans and hydrolyzed to form schwertmannite through several oxidizing-reducing cycles. As a result, most of soluble Fe and sulphate in AMD can be removed and recovered in the form of schwertmannite in acidic AMD environment. The effluent of AMD pre-treated by biomineralization could be neutralized and easily reach a water quality standard by China only with a few of lime. The results from simulation test showed that such a novel PBDTS could save more than 80% of lime requirement amount and produce less than 10% of toxic neutralized residues with comparison to traditional PLDTS. Moreover, the levels of nonferrous metals in the neutralized residues obtained in PBDTS are more than 10 times higher than that in PLDTS. Therefore, the neutralized residues obtained in PBDTS could be considered as nonferrous metal mine to be exploited. Undoubtedly, more attention should be paid to the role of biomineralization in wastewater treatment. Finally, future research needs are proposed in the paper.																	0567-7351					JUN 15	2017	75	6					552	559		10.6023/A17020058								WOS:000406823300005

Sediment Budgets in Cold Environments (SEDIBUD)	SEP 01-04, 2014	Environm Res Station Schneefernerhaus, GERMANY	I A G	Environm Res Station Schneefernerhaus			Suspended sediment transport can affect water quality and aquatic ecosystems, and its quantification is of the highest importance for river and watershed management. Suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and discharge were measured at two locations in the Estero Morales, a Chilean Andean stream draining a small basin (27 km(2)) hosting glacierized areas of about 1.8 km(2). Approximately half of the suspended sediment yield (470 t year(-1) km(-2)) was transported during the snowmelt period and half during glacier melting. The hysteresis patterns between discharge and SSC were calculated for each daily hydrograph and were analysed to shed light on the location and activity of different sediment sources at the basin scale. During snowmelt, an unlimited supply of fine sediments is provided in the lower and middle part of the basin and hysteresis patterns tend to be clockwise as the peaks in SSC precede the peak of discharge in daily hydrographs. Instead, during glacier melting the source of fine sediments is the proglacial area, producing counterclockwise hysteresis. It is suggested that the analysis of hysteretic patterns over time provides a simple concept for interpreting variability of location and activity of sediment sources at the basin scale.

J	Osadchiev, A; Korshenko, E				Osadchiev, Alexander; Korshenko, Evgeniya			Small river plumes off the northeastern coast of the Black Sea under average climatic and flooding discharge conditions	OCEAN SCIENCE												This study focuses on the impact of discharges of small rivers on the delivery and fate of fluvial water and suspended matter at the northeastern part of the Black Sea under different local precipitation conditions. Several dozens of mountainous rivers flow into the sea at the study region, and most of them, except for several of the largest, have little annual runoff and affect adjacent coastal waters to a limited extent under average climatic conditions. However, the discharges of these small rivers are characterized by a quick response to precipitation events and can significantly increase during and shortly after heavy rains, which are frequent in the considered area. The delivery and fate of fluvial water and terrigenous sediments at the study region, under average climatic and rain-induced flooding conditions, were explored and compared using in situ data, satellite imagery, and numerical modeling. It was shown that the point-source spread of continental discharge dominated by several large rivers under average climatic conditions can change to the line-source discharge from numerous small rivers situated along the coast in response to heavy rains. The intense line-source runoff of water and suspended sediments forms a geostrophic alongshore current of turbid and freshened water, which induces the intense transport of suspended and dissolved constituents discharged with river waters in a northwestern direction. This process significantly influences water quality and causes active sediment load at large segments of the narrow shelf at the northeastern part of the Black Sea compared to average climatic discharge conditions.

The key factors controlling GHG emission from subtropical estuarine wetlands were investigated in this study, which continuously monitored the uptake/emission of GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) by/from a subtropical estuarine wetland located in the Minjiang estuary in the coastal region of southeastern China. A self-designed floating chamber was used to collect air samples on site at three environmental habitats (Phragmites australis marsh, mudflats, and river water). The CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations were then measured using an automated nondispersive infrared analyzer. The magnitudes of the CO2 and N2O emission fluxes at the three habitats were ordered as river water > P. australis > mudflats. P. australis emitted GHGs through photosynthesis and respiration processes. Emissions of CH4 from P. australis and the mudflats were revealed to be slightly higher than those from the river water. The total GHG emission fluxes at the three environmental habitats were quite similar (4.68-4.78 g m(-2) h(-1)). However, when the total carbon dioxide equivalent fluxes (CO2-e) were considered, the river water was discovered to emit the most CO2-e compared with P. australis and the mudflats. Based on its potential to increase global warming, N2O was the main contributor to the total GHG emission, with that emitted from the river water being the most considerable. Tidal water carried onto the marsh had its own GHG content and thus has acted as a source or sink of GHGs. However, water quality had a large effect on GHG emissions from the river water whereas the tidal water height did not. Both high salinity and large amounts of sulfates in the wetlands explicitly inhibited the activity of CH4-producing bacteria, particularly at nighttime.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				JUN 15	2017	119	1					289	298		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.04.005								WOS:000403511000045	28434669

In general, loss of water quality and biological communities and massive development of toxic microorganisms are some of the consequences of this phenomenon. To reveal changes in species composition and cell abundance of the taxocoenosis of epibenthic dinoflagellates before and after a harmful algal bloom event in the water column that lasted about 150 days (August-December 2011) in the Dzilam - San Crisanto area (northern Yucatan Peninsula, southeastern Gulf of Mexico) were the main objectives of the present study. In August 2011 and September 2012, sampling along 20 transects perpendicular to the coastline along the entire northern Yucatan coast, starting from 20 sampling sites from El Cuyo in the east to Celestun in the west, at a distance of 50, 150 and 250 m from the coast, was carried out. Physicochemical characteristics measured before and after the bloom were within the ranges previously reported in the study area. Salinity was the most stable characteristic, with mean values of 36.25 and 36.42 in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Phosphates were the only parameter that showed a wide range with higher values before the bloom (0.03-0.54 mu M/I). A total of 168 macrophyte (seaweeds and seagrasses), sponge and sediment samples (105 in 2011 and 63 in 2012) that included associated microphytobenthos were taken by snorkeling from 0.7 to 5 m depth. Six substrate types were distinguished: Chlorophyta, Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyta, Angiospermae (seagrasses), Demospongiae (sponges) and sediment. Chlorophytes dominated the collected samples: 38 samples in 2011 and 23 in 2012. Avrainvillea longicaulis f. laxa predominated before the bloom and Udotea flabellum after it. In total, 25 epibenthic dinoflagellate species from 11 genera were found. The genus Prorocentrum was the most representative in terms of the number of species. The highest total dinoflagellate cell abundances were observed in the sites with different types of macrophytes (up to 2441 cells/g substrate wet weight in 2011 and up to 1068 cells/g in 2012). The lowest cell densities were observed in the areas with scarce or no macrophytes on sandy seafloor. Before the bloom, Prorocentrum rhathymum (up to 4995 cells/g) and P. cf. sipadanensis (up to 5275 cells/g) were the most abundant, and after the bloom the latter was dominant (up to 3559 cells/g); in 2012, both variety of substrates and dinoflagellate cell abundance diminished. A canonical correspondence analysis revealed significant relationships between the physicochemical variables and epiphytic/benthic dinoflagellate species either before or after the bloom. The pelagic bloom resulted in the loss of substrate for epiphytic dinoflagellates, which caused replacement of the dominant species and a decrease in cell abundance of the whole taxocoenosis.

Predicting saturation-excess runoff distribution with a lumped hillslope model: SWAT-HS	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Saturation-excess runoff is the major runoff mechanism in humid well-vegetated areas where infiltration rates often exceed rainfall intensity. Although the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is one of the most widely used models, it predicts runoff based mainly on soil and land use characteristics, and is implicitly an infiltration-excess runoff type of model. Previous attempts to incorporate the saturation-excess runoff mechanism in SWAT fell short due to the inability to distribute water from one hydrological response unit to another. This paper introduces a modified version of SWAT, referred to as SWAT-Hillslope (SWAT-HS). This modification improves the simulation of saturation-excess runoff by redefining hydrological response units based on wetness classes and by introducing a surface aquifer with the ability to route interflow from drier to wetter wetness classes. Mathematically, the surface aquifer is a nonlinear reservoir that generates rapid subsurface stormflow as the water table in the surface aquifer rises. The SWAT-HS model was tested in the Town Brook watershed in the upper reaches of the West Branch Delaware River in the Catskill region of New York, USA. SWAT-HS predicted discharge well with a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.68 and 0.87 for daily and monthly time steps. Compared to the original SWAT model, SWAT-HS predicted less surface runoff and groundwater flow and more lateral flow. The saturated areas predicted by SWAT-HS were concentrated in locations with a high topographic index and were in agreement with field observations. With the incorporation of topographic characteristics and the addition of the surface aquifer, SWAT-HS improved streamflow simulation and gave a good representation of saturated areas on the dates that measurements were available. SWAT-HS is expected to improve water quality model predictions where the location of the surface runoff matters.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				JUN 15	2017	31	12					2226	2243		10.1002/hyp.11179								WOS:000402884400007

Electrical resistivity imaging of hydrologic flow through surface coal mine valley fills with comparison to other landforms	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Surface coal mining has altered land cover, near-surface geologic structure, and hydrologic processes of large areas in central Appalachia, USA. These alterations are associated with changes in water quality such as elevated total-dissolved solids, which is usually measured via its surrogate, specific conductance (SC). The SC of valley fill effluent streams is a function of fill construction methods, materials, and age; yet hydrologic studies that relate these variables to water quality are sparse due to the difficulty of conducting traditional hydrologic studies in mined landscapes. We used electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to visualize the subsurface geologic structure and hydrologic flow paths within a valley fill. ERI is a noninvasive geophysical technique that maps spatiotemporal changes in resistivity of the subsurface. We paired ERI with artificial rainfall experiments to track infiltrated water as it moved through the valley fill. Results indicate that ERI can be used to identify subsurface geologic structure and track advancing wetting fronts or preferential flow paths. Our results suggest that the upper portion of the fill contains significant fines, whereas the deeper profile is primarily large rocks and void spaces. Water tended to pond on the surface of compacted areas until it reached preferential flow paths, where it appeared to infiltrate quickly down to >15m depth in 75min.

C.; Ng, Edward; Chow, Cheuk Lun			Temperature and cooling demand reduction by green-roof types in different climates and urban densities: A co-simulation parametric study	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS												This paper presents a parametric study on the effect of four green-roof types on outdoor/indoor temperature and cooling demand under four different climates and three urban densities using co-simulation approach with ENVI-met and EnergyPlus. Results reveal an outdoor nighttime warming effect of not more than 0.2 degrees C which is most obvious with the semi-extensive while the outdoor and indoor cooling effect ranges between 0.05-0.6 degrees C and 0.4-1.4 degrees C, respectively depending on the green-roof type, urban density and time of the day. These daytime temperature reductions also vary per prevailing climates and follow this order: hot-dry, hot (orwarm)-humid, and temperate which can be explained by the interplay between solar intensity/air temperature and relative humidity between the regions. In a hot-humid region, the evaporative cooling potential of greenery is dampened when compared to hot-dry region. This is also true for region with low solar intensity and humidity like the temperate region. In terms of cooling demand reduction, 5.2% was observed in hot-dry climate on the hottest day of the year with full-intensive green-roof while the least saving of 0.1% was found with semi-extensive green-roof in temperate climate. In general, for both outdoor temperature and cooling demand reduction, semi-intensive green-roof was found more effective than its full-extensive counterpart while the higher spatial green roof is most important for indoor temperature reduction irrespective of the leaf density of the greenery. Therefore, the intent of green-roof installation should be a determining factor for the type and spatial extent to be implemented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.					K.W.D., Kalani C.

Effect of aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) on recovered stormwater quality variability	WATER RESEARCH												Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) is increasingly being considered as a means of reusing urban stormwater to supplement available urban water resources. Storage of stormwater in an aquifer has been shown to affect water quality but it has also been claimed that storage will also decrease the stormwater quality variability making for improved predictability and management. This study is the first to document the changes in stormwater quality variability as a result of subsurface storage at four full scale ASR sites using advanced statistical techniques. New methods to examine water quality are required as data is often highly left censored and so traditional measures of variability such as the coefficient of variation are inappropriate. It was observed that for some water quality parameters (most notably E. coli) there was a marked improvement of water quality and a significant decrease in variability at all sites. This means that aquifer storage prior to engineered treatment systems may be advantageous in terms of system design to avoid over engineering. For other parameters such as metal(loids)s and nutrients the trend was less clear due to the numerous processes occurring during storage leading to an increase in variability, especially for geogenic metals and metalloids such as iron and arsenic. Depending upon the specific water quality parameters and end use, use of ASR may not have a dampening effect on stormwater quality variability. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wu, BL; Wang, XCC; Dzakpasu, M				Wu, Baolei; Wang, Xiaochang C.; Dzakpasu, Mawuli			Genetic characterization of fecal impacts of seagull migration on an urban scenery lake	WATER RESEARCH												A microbial source tracking scheme was devised to differentiate fecal impacts of seagulls from that of human activities on an urban scenery lake in southern China, which is a major wintering ground for the black-headed seagull. Fecal contamination of seagulls was characterized by quantifying a novel genetic marker targeting Catellicoccus marimamalium. Quantification of this marker was combined with those of Escherichia coli, human-associated Bacteroidales, thermophilic Campylobacter and Helicobacter. Findings of a year-round study indicate that C marimamalium levels correlated strongly, both spatially and temporally, with seagull migration. A steady increase in C marimammalium concentrations was recorded between October 2014 and March 2015, which peaked at about 5-log copies/100 mL in January. However, a background level of about 2.1-log copies/100 mL was noticeable from April through September when seagulls were absent, probably due to other host sources or secondary habitats for C marimammalium. Seagull migration also caused an apparent elevation of E. coli concentrations (86% and 60%, respectively for qPCR and culture method; p < 0.001) as well as Campylobacter and Helicobacter (66% and 68%, respectively; p < 0.001). Nonetheless, in contrast to the declining levels of E. coli, Campylobacter and Helicobacter, the human-specific Bacteroidales marginally increased in the seagull-absent season, indicating a limited influence of human activities, compared with seagull migration, on the seasonal variations in microbial water quality of the lake. The elevated levels of FIB, Campylobacter and Helicobacter along with C marimammalium may imply human health risk of the lake water due to seasonal seagull migration, which requires further investigation for risk assessment.

In relation to this, socio-economic development can only be considered sustainable when the ecosystem is under normal carrying capacity. However, accurately evaluating the environmental carrying capacity and efficiently remediating related problems are difficult to carry out in the absence of systematic methods to identify the influencing factors. Hence, this study established an integrated identification method, including the selection and horizontal independence test of potential factors as well as the identification of control factors and water quality effects. We identified the control factors and proposed a series of remediation measures based on the survey and statistical data from 1982 to 2015 in Qingdao and its coastal area. Results indicated 21 control factors, five of which were high-level control factors in Qingdao offshore, namely, wastewater discharge, livestock production, ammonia nitrogen emission, river runoff, sewage treatment. In addition, reclamation area was identified as significant pollution contributors in the Jiaozhou Bay. These control factors showed that the carrying capacity for land-based pollutant emissions and shoreline destruction in the Qingdao offshore is generally overloaded, especially in Jiaozhou Bay. The reduction of land-based pollutants and watershed restoration projects, such as the removal of artificial dikes and the rehabilitation of its natural shoreline, are thus needed to resolve this problem in Jiaozhou Bay. Meanwhile, only differential reduction approaches on land-based pollutants are needed for other coastal waters in Qingdao, such as adjusting the industrial structure, enhancing investments in sewage treatment facilities.

Kinetics and mechanism of sulfate radical- and hydroxyl radical-induced degradation of highly chlorinated pesticide lindane in UV/peroxymonosulfate system	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Lindane is a highly persistent chlorinated pesticide and a potent endocrine disruptor. The strong electron withdrawing property of the chlorine atoms results in a relatively low reactivity of lindane with (OH)-O-center dot in conventional advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). In this study, the degradation of lindane by UV (254 nm)/peroxymonosulfate (UV/PMS), which can generate both (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot-, was investigated. A second-order rate constant of 13 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) between lindane and SO4 center dot- was determined using competition kinetics, suggesting a strong role of SO4 center dot-. The degree of degradation changed with different initial solution pH, achieving 86, 92 and 55% removal of lindane at pH 4.0, 5.8 and 8.0, respectively, in 180 min, attributable to the varying concentrations of (OH)-O-center dot and SO4 center dot-. The addition of common water quality constituents, e.g., humic acid or inorganic anions, at pH 5.8 showed a varied inhibition effect with 61% degradation in the presence of 1.0 mg L-1 humic acid, and 45, 60, 88 and 91% degradation in the presence of 1 mM CO32-, HCO3-, Cl- and SO42-, respectively, in 180 min. With the kinetics being demonstrated to be feasible, the degradation mechanism of lindane by UV/PMS was also assessed. Based on the detected by-products through GC-MS analysis, plausible reaction pathways were proposed, suggesting dechlorination, chlorination, dehydrogenation and hydroxylation via (OH)-O-center dot and/or SO42- attack. Meanwhile, reasonable mineralization efficiency was observed, with a 56% total organic carbon removal in 360 min, at an initial PMS concentration of 500 mu M. Results from both degradation kinetics and transformation mechanism indicate that UV/PMS is a potential method for the treatment of water contaminated with lindane. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of early water exposure on modified cementitious coating	CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS												Treating concrete surfaces with cementitious coating, especially those are used as a reservoir for potable and recreational water, is increasingly gaining popularity as a safer and better alternative to conventional coating material formulated from epoxies, urethanes, acrylics and polyureas. Despite good resistance to weathering, scratches and loads, deficient curing of cementitious coating can lead to reduced performance and undesirable release of pollutants from the coating to water. In this study, the performance of a dual crystalline cementitious coating, which combines hydroscopic (water combining) and hydrophobic (water chasing) properties, for concrete protection was evaluated in an attempt to evaluate whether water affinity of the material can overcome the issue of reduced performance. The results were compared with a polymer modified cementitious coating. The influence of early exposure to water, after 24 h of curing, was assessed by coating pull-off testing and level of pollutants for the first 21-days. The water quality was found "good" to "excellent" according to World Health Organization (WHO) standard at all curing times for both materials with no surface cracking or other defects were noted. The crystalline coating needed 120-240 h for optimum curing, whilst polymeric coating needed 72. In terms of pull-off strength, the polymer coatings on the rough and smooth substrates yielded results greater than 1-MPa after 120-h curing, while crystalline coating took 240-h. However, compared to polymeric coating, the crystalline coating absorbed less water thought out the test duration, indicating that good overall performance.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, most studies have focused on natural and re -wetted peatlands, but in Central Europe a large proportion of organic soils are drained and under agricultural use. Furthermore, measures such as deep ploughing or sand addition have been conducted to improve trafficability and have resulted in topsoil horizons consisting of a peat -sand mixture. Very little is known about DOC losses" from such soils. Moreover, peat soils frequently feature both mobile zones, characterised by active water and solute transport, and immobile zones, which.exchange solutes with the mobile zone by diffusion. Surprisingly, however, the effects of this dual porosity on DOC transport have not yet been explored. This study investigated the physicochemical controls on DOC concentrations in a peat -sand mixture by means of a saturated column experiment with undisturbed columns. The soil came from a former bog in northern Germany where peat layers remaining after peat extraction were mixed with the underlying mineral soil by ploughing. Three pumping rates and two levels of electrical conductivity (EC) were applied. The transport properties of the soil were obtained by analysing breakthrough curves of potassium bromide using the transport model STANMOD, which is based on the two -region non -equilibrium concept. The results of the column study were compared to DOC concentrations measured bi-weekly for two years at the field site from where the columns were taken. Despite a similar texture and soil organic carbon (SOC) content, the fraction of the mobile zone in the columns varied between 51% and 100% of total porosity. Thus even heavily degraded organic soils mixed with sand still showed a dual porosity comparable to degraded peat soils. Percolating the columns with the high EC solution caused low pH values, probably due to ion exchange and cation bridging. The combination of high EC and low pH greatly decreased DOC concentrations at the outlet of the columns. DOC concentrations decreased and fluxes increased as the pumping rates increased. Taking pore water velocity in the mobile zone into account could help to explain the differences between the columns. Overall, transport of DOC did not seem to be limited by production of DOC, but by rate -limited exchange processes. In contrast to the column experiment, field concentrations of DOC were much higher and were not related to pH, but increased with higher electrical conductivity. These higher concentrations could be explained by low pore water velocities and the slightly higher SOC content in the field. This first experiment on DOC transport in peat -sand mixtures taking the dual -porosity nature of organic soils into account clearly demonstrated the importance of pore water velocity and thus the residence time for DOC concentrations. While hydrochemical conditions are frequently addressed in laboratory studies, there is a need for improved understanding of their interaction with hydrology and soil physical properties, especially when attempting to interpret DOC data on different spatial and temporal scales.(C) 2017 The Author(s).

Combining the flexibility of structure and modifying of pore surface, a multiwalled divider installation (MWDI) strategy is proposed and used for property enhancement. We herein report three metal Organic frameworks (MOFs) 1-3 based on a C-3 symmetry organic phosphonic ligand with topology increased from 3,6-connected to 3,8-connected. Among them, MOFs 1 and 2 with remaining binding sites and large pores display lower luminescence response to Co2+ than does the applying standard. Guided by the MWDI strategy, 3 with high rigid framework and triple molecular installer divided rhombic pore was achieved under top-down topological analysis as anticipated, which endows high sensitivity and rapid response to Co2+, contributed by the synergy from free activated sites and appropriate pore and molecular dividing effect. Particularly, the high stability of 3 in boiling solvent and acid/base solutions has been evidenced and explained by structural robustness and kinetic inertness. Moreover, 3 shows excellent detection ability toward trinitrophenol (TNP) over other aromatic analytes in water, attributing to the predomination of energy transfers. Of note is that the used framework can be in situ regenerated into a fresh one. That provides a promising strategy to prepare effective and economic luminescent sensors in a predictable way for property modification.																	1944-8244					JUN 14	2017	9	23					19881	19893		10.1021/acsami.7b04265								WOS:000403631300059	28534627

The input of excessive amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus both from point and nonpoint sources could impair surface water quality and prevent its use for human consumption. The objective of this work was to evaluate surface water quality in small catchments under agricultural use located within this river basin. To this end, 5 streams and 4 small polders were surveyed between September 2008 and December 2009. The median concentrations of total phosphorus and total nitrogen in the streams across all sites and periods were 770 and 1659 mu g L-1, respectively, exceeding in the case of total phosphorus national and international thresholds. Furthermore, soluble phosphorous, the most readily available form to algae, represented 88.3% of total phosphorus. Concentrations of phosphorous and nitrogen in polders were also high. The eutrophication process of this water bodies could be linked to the intensive agricultural land use in the area because the nutrient input from cities and industries was not relevant in these catchments.																	1178-6221					JUN 14	2017	10						1	8		10.1177/1178622117715446								WOS:000403604500001

We hypothesized that urban infrastructure significantly alters downstream water quality and contributes to variability in GHG saturation and emissions. We measured gas saturation and estimated emission rates in headwaters of two urban stream networks (Red Run and Dead Run) of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research project. We identified four combinations of stormwater and sanitary infrastructure present in these watersheds, including: (1) stream burial, (2) inline stormwater wetlands, (3) riparian/floodplain preservation, and (4) septic systems. We selected two first-order catchments in each of these categories and measured GHG concentrations, emissions, and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC) and nutrient concentrations biweekly for 1 year. From a water quality perspective, the DOC: NO3- ratio of streamwater was significantly different across infrastructure categories. Multiple linear regressions including DOC: NO (-)(3) and other variables (dissolved oxygen, DO; total dissolved nitrogen, TDN; and temperature) explained much of the statistical variation in nitrous oxide (N2O, r(2) = 0.78), carbon dioxide (CO2, r(2) = 0.78), and methane (CH4, r(2) = 0.50) saturation in stream water. We measured N2O saturation ratios, which were among the highest reported in the literature for streams, ranging from 1.1 to 47 across all sites and dates. N2O saturation ratios were highest in streams draining watersheds with septic systems and strongly correlated with TDN. The CO2 saturation ratio was highly correlated with the N2O saturation ratio across all sites and dates, and the CO2 saturation ratio ranged from 1.1 to 73. CH4 was always supersaturated, with saturation ratios ranging from 3.0 to 2157. Longitudinal surveys extending form headwaters to third-order outlets of Red Run and Dead Run took place in spring and fall. Linear regressions of these data yielded significant negative relationships between each gas with increasing watershed size as well as consistent relationships between solutes (TDN or DOC, and DOC: TDN ratio) and gas saturation. Despite a decline in gas saturation between the headwaters and stream outlet, streams remained saturated with GHGs throughout the drainage network, suggesting that urban streams are continuous sources of CO2, CH4, and N2O. Our results suggest that infrastructure decisions can have significant effects on downstream water quality and greenhouse gases, and watershed management strategies may need to consider coupled impacts on urban water and air quality.																	1726-4170	1726-4189				JUN 13	2017	14	11					2831	2849		10.5194/bg-14-2831-2017								WOS:000403227200001

We investigated the transport of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in lawn irrigation driven surface runoff from a residential neighborhood (28 ha) of 56% impervious and 44% pervious areas. Pervious areas encompassing turfgrass (lawns) in the neighborhood were irrigated with the reclaimed water in common areas during the evening to late night and with the municipal water in homeowner's lawns during the morning. The stormwater outlet pipe draining the residential neighborhood was instrumented with a flow meter and Hach autosampler. Water samples were collected every 1-h and triple composite samples were obtained at 3-h intervals during an intensive sampling period of 1-week. Mean concentrations, over 56 sampling events, of total N (TN) and total P (TP) in surface runoff at the outlet pipe were 10.9 +/- 6.34 and 1.3 +/- 1.03 mg L-1, respectively. Of TN, the proportion of nitrate-N was 58% and other-N was 42%, whereas of TP, orthophosphate-P was 75% and other-P was 25%. Flow and nutrient (N and P) concentrations were lowest from 6:00 a.m. to noon, which corresponded with the use of municipal water and highest from 6:00 p.m. to midnight, which corresponded with the use of reclaimed water. This data suggests that N and P originating in lawn irrigation driven surface runoff from residential catchments is an important contributor of nutrients in surface waters.																	1932-6203					JUN 12	2017	12	6							e0179151	10.1371/journal.pone.0179151								WOS:000403088400032	28604811

Since benthic macroinvertebrate assembly can reflect the benthic stream conditions, we assessed the river habitat integrity based on benthic macroinvertebrate multi-metric model. The development and application of Benthic macroinvertebrate multi-metric index (B-MMI) was based on samples collected from October to November 2014 at representative sites from upper to lower reaches in Luanhe River, Haihe River Basin, China. Hydromorphology, water quality and land use patterns were considered to define reference sites and metrics related to macroinvertebrate community composition, structure, function and tolerance to pollution were selected as candidate metrics. Then, Range, sensitivity and redundancy tests were used to select candidate metrics based on their ability to distinguish the reference and impaired sites. As the result, four core indicators were selected to build the B-MMI: EPT%, Tubificidae%, BI (Biotic Index), Collect-Gatherers%. The values of B-MMI ranged from 0.21 to 3.75 in 17 sites. Based on B-MMI values, the habitat integrity of 29% sites were in very poor status and 6% were in excellent status. The upper reaches were influenced by animal husbandry and tourism, while the lower reaches were influenced by urbanization and dams. More good habitats were located in middle reaches under less human disturbances. Overall, this B-MMI shows promise for developing biomonitoring tools to assess the habitat integrity of streams, to provide appropriate restoration strategies and policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, overall water quality of the river is very poor, i.e., Class IV (based on the Malaysian water quality standards), mainly due to wastewater discharged from residential area and industries without being properly treated. Due to severe pollution, aquatic ecosystem has not been properly developed. Thus, it is being considered to construct a new wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to prevent discharge of pollutants and to improve the river water quality. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the pollution sources along the river and assess their impacts on the water quality. In addition, a numerical model was formulated with the Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code (EFDC) to find a best plan to improve the water quality. Through the model simulation, it was found that wastewater from all the U-drains and culverts along the river should be collected by sewer, transported to a WWTP for treatment, and then pumped to the upstream of the river for discharge. It was also found that if the WWTP would reduce pollution load by 80%, the current water quality of the river would improve by 80% to achieve Class II. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In spite of this estuary being small and characterized by a short residence time, the environmental factors most highly correlated with the bacterial community mirrored those reported to govern larger estuaries, specifically salinity and temperature. Additionally, bacterial community changes in the estuary appeared to vary with precipitation. For example, an increase in freshwater bacteria (Comamonadaceae and Sphingobacteriaceae) was observed in high precipitation periods compared to the predominately marine-like bacteria (Rhodobacterales and Oceanospirillales) that were found in low precipitation periods. Notably, we observed a significantly higher relative abundance of Comamonadaceae than previously described in other estuaries. Furthermore, anthropic factors could have an impact on this particular estuary's bacterial community structure. For example, ecosystem changes related to the channelization of the estuary likely induced a low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, high temperature, and high chlorophyll concentration period in the inner euhaline water in summer (samples with salinity >30 ppt). Those samples were characterized by a high abundance of facultative anaerobes. For instance, OTUs classified as Cryomorphaceae and Candidatus Aquiluna rubra were negatively associated with DO concentration, while Oleiphilaceae was positively associated with DO concentration. Additionally, microorganisms related to biological treatment of wastewater (e.g Bdellovibrio and Zoogloea) were detected in the samples immediately downstream of the Bilbao Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). There are several human activities planned in the region surrounding the Estuary of Bilbao (e.g. sediment draining, architectural changes, etc.) which will likely affect this ecosystem. Therefore, the addition of bacterial community profiling and diversity analysis into the estuary's ongoing monitoring program would provide a more comprehensive view of the ecological status of the Estuary of Bilbao.

Importance of demographic surveys and public lands for the conservation of eastern hellbenders Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis in southeast USA	PLOS ONE												Comparisons of recent and historic population demographic studies of eastern hellbenders Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis have identified significant population declines and extirpations associated with habitat degradation, poor water quality and disease, leading to nomination as a candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act. However, populations in the southern Appalachian region of the range have received less attention despite relatively high levels of watershed protection due to the establishment of federally protected National Forest and National Park public lands. These watersheds likely represent some of the best remaining available habitat, yet the lack of published studies make assessment of population stability and viability very difficult. Our objectives were to (1) conduct a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) demographic study and a point transect survey on the Hiwassee River in Tennessee which is designated a National Scenic River, and is largely contained within the Cherokee National Forest, (2) quantify the size structure of the population, (3) compare abundance, survival and recruitment with historic and contemporary hellbender populations across the range, (4) assess the importance of this population and the significance of National Forest and National Park lands in the context of hellbender population conservation in the southeastern United States. We detected all age classes present, with larval hellbenders comprising 21.5% of captures. Using a combination of static life table and CMR methods, we determined that survival rates during the first year were low ( similar to 10%), but were high (68-94%) for taggable sized hellbenders. Density of hellbenders at the study site was very high (84 taggable sized hellbenders per 100m of river) compared to recent demographic studies conducted in other regions of the range. We detected hellbenders over similar to 28 km of river, with a mean density of 23 taggable sized hellbenders per 100m of river, and a total population estimate of 6440 taggable hellbenders. National Forest and National Park lands are likely to continue to play a particularly important role in providing suitable habitat for hellbenders in the southern Appalachians. In fact, only six of 21 known hellbender locations in Tennessee appear to show consistent larval recruitment, all of which are located within or adjacent to National Forest or National Park land.

Because of this issue, many of these tailings ponds have been treated by restoration and sealing processes in recent years. In this work, the efficacy of geophysical techniques (electrical resistivity imaging and ground penetrating radar) as tools for assessing the effectiveness of the insulating process of these structures has been analysed. For this purpose, we selected the abandoned mining district of Linares-La Carolina (Southern Spain) where, during the mining activity, these materials were stockpiled without corrective measures. This study demonstrates the usefulness of electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) for characterising the inner structure of abandoned tailings ponds, determining the geometry of such deposits and evaluating the potential risks that they pose. Furthermore, ERI makes it possible to visualise higher moisture zones associated with the leaking of leachates that circulate through these residues. The presence of humid areas could denote defects at the sealing stage. The ground penetrating radar (GPR) technique was very useful for an accurate analysis of the most superficial part, where the seal is constructed. In particular, the technique made it possible to differentiate between various encapsulation levels created during sealing, as well as detect imperfections in the insulation layers and zones with higher moisture at a low depth. A chemical quality analysis of the surface waters surrounding the dumps studied indicates that, with the exception of As, the concentrations of most metal(loid)s analysed (Al, Ba, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sr and Zn) have significantly decreased after the restoration works. However, it appears that leaks continue to appear in some sludge pond sectors that favour the mobilisation and even incorporation of certain toxic elements from the mining waste into the riverbed. Therefore, Pb (20 mu g/L) and Se (1.5 mu g/L) dissolved in the surface waters continue to exceed the maximum concentrations allowed by the European Union environmental quality standards.

Efficient visible light driven floating photocatalysts, namely N, P co-doped TiO2/expanded graphite carbon layer (NPT-EGC) composites, were successfully synthesized using a sol-carbonization method, and then applied as algaecides. The synthesized photocatalysts were characterized by means of XRD, FESEM/EDS, TEM, FTIR spectroscopy, XPS, UV-vis DRS, and PL spectroscopy. The results show that the NPT-EGC composites have a worm-like structure with the N, P co-doped TiO2 particles immobilized on the surface. Among the NPT-EGC photocatalysts with different calcination temperatures, NPT-EGC450 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity. The removal rate of the algal cells is 98.15% for NPT-EGC450 following 9 h of visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic destruction process can be divided into a rapid adsorption phase and a repeat of the cell reduction phase-lag phase. During the photocatalytic process, the algal cells were damaged as a result of photocatalysis induced oxidation and inhibition. In addition, we simulated the release of MC-LR in the photocatalytic destruction process for the algal cells. The results show that the photocatalyst can remove both the algal cells and MC-LR simultaneously with high efficiency. After three consecutive cycles, the removal rate of the algal cells is still more than 90% for NPT-EGC450, which demonstrates that the NPT-EGC photocatalyst has good reusability and stability.																	2044-4753	2044-4761				JUN 7	2017	7	11					2335	2346		10.1039/c7cy00133a								WOS:000403002700020

We investigated soil carbon fractions and microbial community structure by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis in a 10-year field experiment using an integrated rice-crayfish (CR) model and a rice monoculture (MR) model at soil depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-40 cm. Compared with the MR model, the CR model had significantly more total organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon contents in all of the layers examined and microbial biomass carbon content in the 20-40 cm layer. Principal components analysis revealed that microbial community composition in the CR model differed from that in the MR model in the 20-30 cm layer. Higher proportions of gram-negative bacteria, aerobic bacteria and fungi in the 20-30 cm soil layer were observed for the CR model than the MR model. These results indicate that the CR model increases soil carbon levels, and strongly affects microbial community composition and structure in the deeper layers of soil, thereby accelerating subsurface soil nutrient cycling.																	2045-2322					JUN 6	2017	7								2856	10.1038/s41598-017-02984-7								WOS:000425909100001	28588212

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Microbial water quality monitoring is crucial for managing water resources and protecting public health. However, institutional testing activities in sub-Saharan Africa are currently limited. Because the economics of water quality testing are poorly understood, the extent to which cost may be a barrier to monitoring in different settings is unclear. This study used cost data from eighteen African monitoring institutions (piped water suppliers and health surveillance agencies in six countries) and estimates of water supply type coverage from fifteen countries to assess the annual financial requirements for microbial water testing at both national and regional levels, using World Health Organization recommendations for sampling frequency. We found that a microbial water quality test costs 21.0 +/- 11.3 USD, on average, including consumables, equipment, labor, and logistics, which is higher than previously calculated. Our annual cost estimates for microbial monitoring of piped supplies and improved point sources ranged between 8,000 USD for Equatorial Guinea and 1.9 million USD for Ethiopia, depending primarily on the population served but also on the distribution of piped water system sizes. A comparison with current national water and sanitation budgets showed that the cost of implementing prescribed testing levels represents a relatively modest proportion of existing budgets (<2%). At the regional level, we estimated that monitoring the microbial quality of all improved water sources in sub-Saharan Africa would cost 16.0 million USD per year, which is minimal in comparison to the projected annual capital costs of achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6.1 of safe water for all (14.8 billion USD).

Interaction between Physical Heterogeneity and Microbial Processes in Subsurface Sediments: A Laboratory-Scale Column Experiment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Physical heterogeneity determines interstitial [GRAPHIC] fluxes in porous media. Nutrients and organic matter distribution in depth influence physicochemical and microbial processes occurring in subsurface. Columns 50 cm long were filled with sterile silica sand following five different setups combining fine and coarse sands or a mixture of both mimicking potential water treatment barriers. Water was supplied continuously to all columns during 33 days. Hydraulic conductivity, nutrients and organic matter, biofflm biomass, and activity were analyzed in order to study the effect of spatial grain size heterogeneity on physicochemical and microbial processes and their mutual interaction. Coarse sediments showed higher biomass and activity in deeper areas compared to the others; however, they resulted in incomplete denitrification, large proportion of dead bacteria in depth, and low functional diversity. Treatments with fine sediment in the upper 20 cm of the columns showed high phosphorus retention. However, low hydraulic conductivity values reported in these sediments seemed to constraint biofflm activity and biomass. On the other hand, sudden transition from coarse-to-fine grain sizes promoted a hot-spot of organic matter degradation and biomass growth at the interface. Our results reinforce the idea that grain,: size disposition in subsurface sandy sediments drives the interstitial fluxes, influencing microbial processes.

Application of an unstructured 3D finite volume numerical model to flows and salinity dynamics in the San Francisco Bay-Delta	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												A linked modeling approach has been undertaken to understand the impacts of climate and infrastructure on aquatic ecology and water quality in the San Francisco Bay-Delta region. The Delft3D Flexible Mesh modeling suite is used in this effort for its 3D hydrodynamics, salinity, temperature and sediment dynamics, phytoplankton and water-quality coupling infrastructure, and linkage to a habitat suitability model. The hydrodynamic model component of the suite is D-Flow FM, a new 3D unstructured finite-volume model based on the Delft3D model. In this paper, D-Flow FM is applied to the San Francisco Bay-Delta to investigate tidal, seasonal and annual dynamics of water levels, river flows and salinity under historical environmental and infrastructural conditions. The model is driven by historical winds, tides, ocean salinity, and river flows, and includes federal, state, and local freshwater withdrawals, and regional gate and barrier operations. The model is calibrated over a 9-month period, and subsequently validated for water levels, flows, and 3D salinity dynamics over a 2 year period. Model performance was quantified using several model assessment metrics and visualized through target diagrams. These metrics indicate that the model accurately estimated water levels, flows, and salinity over wide-ranging tidal and fluvial conditions, and the model can be used to investigate detailed circulation and salinity patterns throughout the Bay-Delta. The hydrodynamics produced through this effort will be used to drive affiliated sediment, phytoplankton, and contaminant hindcast efforts and habitat suitability assessments for fish and bivalves. The modeling framework applied here will serve as a baseline to ultimately shed light on potential ecosystem change over the current century. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Foresters' Perceptions of the Frequency, Cost, and Rationale for Seasonal Timber Harvesting Restrictions in Wisconsin	FOREST SCIENCE												Seasonal timber harvesting restrictions (STHRs) are applied for a variety of reasons, such as reducing risk of oak wilt and soil disturbance and protecting public resources such as water quality, rare species, and public roads during spring thaw. These restrictions may reduce timber supply during spring and summer. We conducted a survey of 184 private sector foresters and 197 public agency foresters in Wisconsin to estimate the frequency of, rationale for, and cost-effectiveness of STHRs. The response rate was 65%. Survey respondents reported that timber sales were most commonly restricted to comply with best management practices (64% of sales), reduce soil disturbance (56%), prevent oak wilt (39%), and address access concerns (34%). The most common motivations for STHRs were professional judgment of foresters and landowner objectives. Foresters reported that most restrictions were effective in achieving their goals and that landowners supported the restrictions. However, respondents perceived that STHRs reduced stumpage prices by 5 to 12%. We estimated that STHRs cost landowners $ 22.2 million annually statewide ($ 3.15 ton(-1)) of restricted timber based on perceived reductions in stumpage prices. Public agency foresters perceived that most categories of restrictions were cost-effective, whereas forest industry foresters believed a smaller subset of restrictions were cost-effective.																	0015-749X	1938-3738				JUN 2	2017	63	3					331	341		10.5849/FS-2016-051								WOS:000416746600010

The bioeroding sponges Cliona spp. are strong competitors for space and may take advantage of coral bleaching, damage, and mortality. Benthic surveys of the inshore GBR (2005-2014) revealed that the percent cover of the most abundant bioeroding sponge species, Cliona orientalis, has not increased. However, considerable variation in C. orientalis cover, and change in cover over time, was evident between survey locations. We assessed whether biotic or environmental characteristics were associated with variation in C. orientalis distribution and abundance. The proportion of fine particles in the sediments was negatively associated with the presence-absence and the percent cover of C. orientalis, indicating that the sponge requires exposed habitat. The cover of corals and other sponges explained little variation in C. orientalis cover or distribution. The fastest increases in C. orientalis cover coincided with the lowest macroalgal cover and chlorophyll a concentration, highlighting the importance of macroalgal competition and local environmental conditions for this bioeroding sponge. Given the observed distribution and habitat preferences of C. orientalis, bioeroding sponges likely represent site-specific - rather than regional - threats to corals and reef accretion.

Groundwater suitability evaluation by CCME WQI model for Kadava River Basin, Nashik, Maharashtra, India	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												In this study, an attempt has been made to use the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI) model to classify groundwater suitability (n = 40) of Kadava river basin during pre and post monsoon season of 2012. The CCME WQI model computed for drinking and irrigation through guidelines of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). The pH, EC, TDS, TH, Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Fluoride, Sulfate and Nitrate variables were considered. The groundwater samples were classified into five categories from poor to excellent, ranges from 0 to 100. The result reveals that, the groundwater quality is poor to fair and majority of samples having marginal water quality for drinking. The groundwater quality is quite good for irrigation and it ranges from fair to good type with maximum samples fall in fair category. In the study area, the groundwater quality is considerably affected and found vulnerable in pre monsoon season due to intensive agriculture and anthropogenic activities. Spatial distribution maps of water quality index for pre and post monsoon season were prepared through GIS technique. In pre monsoon season, except Central part, many groundwater samples are found vulnerable and restricting their use for drinking. Three vulnerable hotspots are identified in North, NE and South region in post monsoon season. In pre monsoon season, Central, South and North part is affected; while, in post monsoon season, few patches in North, Central and Southern area are critical for irrigation use. In the study area, few aquifers are found to be problematic and thus limiting their use for drinking and irrigation. The CCME WQI is an effective tool to assess the groundwater quality and to communicate the health of water to multiple users. It gives precise results and water quality report in an easier way to the policy and decision makers. Finally, the study confirmed that the groundwater quality is influenced by agricultural activities and appropriate water management plan is essential to nurture precious groundwater resources in the study area.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				JUN	2017	3	2					557	565		10.1007/s40808-017-0316-x								WOS:000432244700005

Thermophilic biological treatment could save a large amount of thermal energy, but the major obstacle of a reuse are the poor sludge settling properties under thermophile conditions, leading to insufficient water quality if conventional gravimetric phase separation is applied. MBR technology is a promising alternative which allows a recirculation of treated water for improving the water and energy footprint. So far, there is only limited experience with thermophilic MBR at the time. In this study, a thermophilic MBR with a submerged membrane (TSMBR) was operated to treat wastewater from a paper mill with a COD concentration of 25-30 g L-1. The TSMBR was integrated into the operational process of the paper mill. Research questions were the influence of suspended solids, food to microorganism ratio (F/M ratio), cross-flow-aeration and filtration flux to the fouling of the membrane. Applying the critical flux concept, optimal operating conditions and costs for a future economic full-scale implementation could be derived. Key results are inter alia a sub-critical flux of below 10 L m(-2) h(-1) is recommended for long-time durability of the membrane for minimizing the irreversible fouling and the permeability decrease. A chemical cleaning does not change the critical flux, but improves the permeability of the membrane significantly. of suspended solids of above 14 g L-1. A stable process and cleaning could only be ensured by a F/M ratio of below 0.4 g(COD) g(MLSS)(-1) d(-1). Higher values result in an increased cake layer formation and intensive foaming.

Therefore, it is important to develop an environmentally friendly and economic method to treat palm oil mill effluent (POME). The main aim of this study was to investigate the potential of Lemna minor (L. minor) and Chlamydomonas incerta (C. incerta) with catalog number (KR349061) for the bioremediation of POME in order to achieve higher water quality standard and further produce organic fertilizer. In this study, three different experiments were conducted by using L. minor, followed by addition of C. incerta, and further combination of L. minor and C. incerta. The concentration of nitrate (NO3-), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), phosphate (PO4-P), Electrical Conductivity (EC) and salinity in produced fertilizer were measured, and then they were compared with two current commercial fertilizers. Growth factors such as growth rates, average number of leaf and height of root of L. minor of plants were also determined. The results showed that the microalgae and macrophytes were capable of removing only 4.4% of chemical organic demand (COD) whereas the respective maximum removal rates for NO3-, NH3-N, and PO4-P were 12.5%, 11.3%, and 70.47%. Also, the average differences of NO3-, NH3-N, and PO4-P concentrations in produced fertilizer in comparison with two current commercial fertilizers were 95, 39.5, and 62.5 mg/g, respectively. The results of this study revealed that only L. minor was converted into fertilizer. This study elaborated that both L. minor and C. incerta are able to remove a part of organic pollutants and nutrients from POME.

Trading on risk: The moral logics and economic reasoning of North Carolina farmers in water quality trading markets	ECONOMIC ANTHROPOLOGY												Water quality trading (WQT) is a popular policy for improving the quality of waterways across the United States by reducing water pollution. However, in established markets, few trades are happening, making environmental gains from WQT limited. Despite these trends, policy makers continue to implement this market-based approach to achieve clean water Successful markets rely on stakeholders' willingness to buy and sell in the market, yet research has not focused on this aspect of WQT. The stakeholders involved in WQT are frequently farmers (as sellers) trading with developers and urban municipalities (as buyers). To better understand stakeholder decisions about WQT, this research sought to document barriers and catalysts for farmers participation in a brand-new WQT program in the Jordan Lake Watershed, North Carolina. Key findings from interviews with ninety farmers show that most have high conservation rates and know about local water problems. Nevertheless, they were unwilling or unlikely to participate in the program. We offer detailed evidence of the complex ways farmers calculate risk for farm practices and environmental health as an indication that their perceptions of risk and moral sensibilities involve a broader set of costs and values than accounted for in the WQT policy design, ultimately making trading unviable.																	2330-4847					JUN	2017	4	2					225	238		10.1002/sea2.12090								WOS:000427918900006

The accelerated pace of these changes is shareholder and by the manifestation of extreme events, which in recent years become more intense and frequent. The drought events frequent manifestation over the Republic of Moldova territory, in the context of climate change, requires a scientific monitoring adjusted. The dry period's manifestation is greatly conditioned by increasing daytime temperatures (above 25 degrees C) and the lower relative humidity (below 30%). At present, on the background of climate change, there is an increase of dry days. Over the Republic of Moldova territory, their occurrence during growth and development of crops particularly damaging role in obtaining low yields. Meanwhile, prolonged dry periods, may possibly cause fires, at the same time can determine lands' irrigation and surface water quality. In this context, there is a need to estimate the evaporation's spatial and temporal variability, the number of dry days and their correlation to Dry Periods Index (Izu), the index developed at regional level.																	1843-5971	2284-7820				JUN	2017	11	1					5	20		10.1515/pesd-2017-0001								WOS:000424586700001

Long-Term Land Cover Data for the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, 2010-2050	DATA												Land cover data are often used to examine the impacts of landscape alterations on the environment from the local to global scale. Although various agencies produce land cover data at various spatial scales, data are still limited at the regional scale over extended timescales. This is a critical data gap since decision-makers often use future and long-term land cover maps to develop effective policies for sustainable environmental systems. As a result, land change science incorporates common data mining tools to create future land cover maps that extend over long timescales. This study applied one of the well-known land cover change models, called Land Transformation Model (LTM), to produce urbanization maps for the Lower Peninsula of Michigan in United States from 2010 to 2050 with five year intervals. Long-term urbanization data in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan can be used in various environmental studies such as assessing the impact of future urbanization on climate change, water quality, food security and biodiversity.

Short-Term Nitrogen and Phosphorus Release during the Disturbance of Surface Sediments: A Case Study in an Urbanised Estuarine System (Gold Coast Broadwater, Australia)	JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Understanding the effects of sediment disturbances on nutrient loadings is important for the management of estuarine settings. This study investigated the initial influence of sediment disturbance on water column nutrient concentrations in a shallow estuarine setting within the Gold Coast Broadwater, using a laboratory-based approach. Undisturbed sediment cores (200 mm empty set x 330 mm length, plexiglass) were incubated before and after being subjected to a disturbance event, to investigate the effect on the immediate and subsequent short-term water column nutrient concentrations. Sediment NH4+ (bio) and PO43- (bio) concentrations ranged from 150 to 478 and 1.50 to 8.56 nmol g(-1) dry wt, respectively. Water column NH4+ concentrations underwent the greatest increase (>1000% or approx. 14 times greater) immediately following disturbance, with mean effluxes increasing by >300%. Thereafter, water column NH4+ concentrations and efflux rates declined to near initial pre-disturbance concentrations. Water column NH4+ concentrations accounted for 0.58%-5.50% of the depth-integrated sediment NH4+ bio concentration, indicating mobilization of the sediment bound exchangeable NH4+. The observed changes in PO43- concentrations and fluxes were much lower in comparison to those observed for N-species. Following disturbance, increases in the water column PO43- concentration accounted for 7.16%-8.22% depth-integrated sediment bioavailable PO43- at + 1 and + 2 hours, and 5.65% at + 7 hours, respectively. These results provide important insight into the potential implications of disturbance events, such as vessel activities and dredging operations, within the case study region, providing information for potential management options and relevant water quality concerns.																	2077-1312					JUN	2017	5	2							16	10.3390/jmse5020016								WOS:000423689700002

J	McInnes, RJ; Everard, M				McInnes, R. J.; Everard, M.			Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services (RAWES): An example from Colombo, Sri Lanka	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												Wetlands make essential positive contributions to multiple dimensions of human wellbeing. However, recognition of these benefits is often lacking in decision-making, compromising the wellbeing of both the ecosystem and is many linked human beneficiaries. Wetland site managers, decision-makers and stakeholders all need to better understand the benefits provided by wetlands. Despite a plethora of available assessment techniques, very few approaches are genuinely rapid, applicable across different wetland types or consider the realities of time and money resource constraints. The Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services (RAWES) approach is presented as a method that meets these needs, illustrated through its practical application in over 60 different wetland sites supporting development of a Wetland Strategy for the Metro Colombo Region, Sri Lanka. The approach is based on the trained, local assessors using a variety of field indicators in order to assess the positive or negative contribution over 30 wetland ecosystem services provide at local, regional or global scales. Outputs are simplified, signalling to decision- makers the diversity of interlinked ecosystem service outcomes consequent from management policies and actions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Spatio-temporal changes of water quality variables in a highly disturbed river	GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM												Quality of river varies widely depending on the land use in the catchment and environmental factors. Many rivers in developing countries are unhealthy because they contain harmful physical, chemical and biological agents. Zanjanrud River, located in Zanjan Province, Iran, where recently faced human intervention needs a regular monitoring from upstream to downstream for sustainable management. Hence, the current study aimed to assess spatial and temporal variations of pollutant in Zanjanrud River in different stations from headstream to tail of the river. To achieve this goal, semi-monthly samples were collected from October 2015 to Jun 2016 at 5 stations along the river. The physicochemical variables were monitored and analysed using two-way analysis of variance. The results showed the highest values of suspended and dissolved solids and total solids (220.13 +/- 5.57, 641.6 +/- 39.63 and 793.6 +/- 34.5mg/L respectively) were at the tail site in low-flow period. Nitrate-nitrogen and nitrate were also highest (5.39 +/- 02.44 and 23.90 +/- 10.85 mg/L) at the middle of the river where was vicinity to farm lands. The values of pH and dissolved oxygen ranged from 6 to 8.15 and 0.5 to 4mg/L respectively with the highest values in high-flow period at most of the study sites. The maximum and minimum values of electrical conductivity (1439 and 256 mu s/cm) were recorded at tail site and headstream site respectively. Hardness had an increasing trend from upstream to downstream (189.60 +/- 53.53 to 515.83 +/- 64.77mg/L). Phosphorus was also lowest (0.09 +/- 0.04mg/L) at upstream. Results illustrated the high degree of pollutant in studied river. So, an effective management of erosion, domestic waste and agricultural activities in watershed is highly recommended.					kavian, ataollah/0000-0003-1767-0708												2383-3572					SUM	2017	3	3					243	256		10.22034/gjesm.2017.03.03.002								WOS:000416768300002

Evaluation of seasonal variability in surface water quality of Shallow Valley Lake, Kashmir, India, using multivariate statistical techniques	POLLUTION												Seasonal variation in water quality of Anchar Lake has been evaluated, using two multivariate statistical techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA). Water quality data, collected during four seasons, have been analyzed for 13 parameters and ANOVA has shown that pH (F-3= 10.86, P < 0.05), temperature (F-3 = 65, P < 0.05), electrical conductivity (F-3= 32.72, P < 0.05), Calcium (F-3= 36.84, P < 0.05), Magnesium (F-3= 16.52, P < 0.05), nitrate-nitrogen (F-3= 48.06, P < 0.05), ammonical nitrogen (F-3 = 198.75, P < 0.05), and dissolved oxygen (F-3= 4.96, P < 0.05) varied by season, whereas the substantial variations of sodium (F-2= 7.18, P < 0.05), phosphate-phosphorous (F-2= 25.31, P < 0.05), biological oxygen demand (F-2= 11.02, P < 0.05), and chemical oxygen demand (F-2= 37.73, P < 0.05) were based on different sites. CA has grouped the three sampling sites throughout the four seasons into three clusters of similar water quality as relatively Less-Polluted (LP), Medium-Polluted (MP), and Highly-Polluted (HP). In addition, PCA has been applied on the extract to recognize the factors, responsible for water quality variations in four seasons of the year, resulting in four principal components for winter, summer, and autumn, five ones for spring, accounting for 79.58%, 89.07%, 83.34%, and 93.13% of total variance respectively. Thus the factors, responsible for water quality variation, are mainly related to domestic wastewaters, seasonal variation, agricultural runoff, and catchment geology. These results will help decision-makers better understand the influence of various factors on water quality and manage pollution/eutrophication adaptively in Anchar Lake.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SUM	2017	3	3					349	362		10.7508/pj.2017.03.001								WOS:000414862900001

Characterization of tannery effluents of Hazaribagh area, Dhaka, Bangladesh	POLLUTION												The present investigation characterizes tannery effluents by determining water quality parameters and some selected trace metallic constituents in order to measure the magnitude of environmental pollution. Effluents and sediments have also been used to isolate chromium-resistant bacteria, collected from Hazaribagh area, Dhaka, claimed to be increasing Cr (VI)-enriched environments, and utilized to reduce Cr (VI). The pH, TDS, DO, and EC values of all investigated samples have been within the range of 4.35 to 9.74, 290 to 9,200 mg/L, 1.5 to 4.90 mg/L, and 587 to 19,000 mu s/cm, respectively. The concentrations of trace metallic constituents have been determined by means of Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS), giving the following ranges: Cr: 14.282 to 6,769.554 mg/L; Cd: 1.546 to 2.214 mg/L; Pb: 18.808 to 32.026 mg/L; Cu: 1.522 to 2.578 mg/L; Zn: 0.682 to 8.688 mg/L; Fe: 1.37 to 108.556 mg/L; and Mn: 3.494 to 17.17 mg/L. The order of trace metallic constituents in the effluent samples was Cr > Fe > Pb > Mn > Zn > Cd > Cu. The water quality parameters and metallic constituents' concentration were higher than that of standard permissible limits in all the examined samples. The average number of Cr (VI)-resistant bacteria in the sediment samples with glucose (0.5%, w/v) supplementation was 2.35x 10(3) CFU/gm at 24h. One of the representative isolate was able to tolerate up to 400 mg/L of K2Cr2O7 as Cr (VI). The bacteria, isolated in the present study, can be used as eco-friendly biological agents for the remediation and/or detoxification of chromium (Cr) pollution from the chromium contaminated environments.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SUM	2017	3	3					395	406		10.7508/pj.2017.03.005								WOS:000414862900005

Assessment of water quality in Halda River (the Major carp breeding ground) of Bangladesh	POLLUTION												The present study has been conducted to assess the surface water quality of Halda River from September 2015 to March 2016. DO, BOD5, COD, pH, EC, Chloride, Alkalinity, and Hardness concentrations in water samples have been found to range within 0.93-5.15 mg/L, 30-545 mg/L, 43-983 mg/L, 6.3-7.3, 110-524 uS/cm, 12-56 mg/L, 35-67 mg/L, and 38-121 mg/L, respectively. Multivariate statistical analyses, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as well as Correlation Matrix (CM) have revealed significant anthropogenic pollutant intrusions in water. Cluster Analysis (CA) has indicated decent results of rendering three different groups of resemblance between the two sampling sites, reflecting the different water quality indicators of the river system. A very strong positive linear relation has been found between COD and BOD (1.000), hardness and EC (0.993), pH and DO (0.979), hardness and COD (0.929), hardness and BOD (0.924), EC and COD (0.922), and EC and BOD (0.916) at a significance level of 0.01, proving their common origin entirely from industrial effluents, municipal wastes, and agricultural activities. River Pollution Index (RPI) has indicated that the water from rivers at Kalurghat and Modhunaghat varied from low to high pollution, which is due to the former area's being mostly industrial zone with some domestic sewage, while the latter underwent less industrial activities. On the contrary, lots of agricultural activities have been found in Modhunaghat. Use of river water can pose serious problems to human health and aquatic ecosystem via biological food chain. The present research suggests special preference for proper management of the river with eco-friendly automation along with development of the country's sustainable economic.				Bhuyan, Md.

Assessment of the presence of metals and quality of water used for irrigation in Kwara State, Nigeria	POLLUTION												In Nigeria irrigated agriculture is an important tool for economic growth, food security, and poverty reduction during dry periods of rain-fed agriculture. The concentration and composition of dissolved constituents in water determines its quality for irrigation use. Water quality studies strongly suggest that agriculture is a leading source of water quality problems, due to pesticides and other agro-inputs, widely used by farmers to improve agricultural productivity. Poor quality irrigation water would therefore obviously affect soil quality and crop productivity. This study was carried out in 2015 to assess the presence of metals and physical properties of water, used for irrigation in Kwara state, Nigeria. Samples were randomly collected from thirty irrigation sources in three senatorial zones of Kwara State. The samples were analyzed for the presence of metals and water quality parameters, using standard procedures. Results showed that the highest concentration of Sulphate (7.0mg/L), Nitrate (8.9mg/L), Sodium (31.6mg/L), Calcium (3.1mg/L), and Magnesium (0.7) ions were within acceptable limits. The Sodium Adsorption Ratio, an indicator for water suitability in agricultural irrigation as well as a standard diagnostic parameter for the sodicity hazard of a soil, was significantly the highest (22.7) in Kwara North. Results of the study point to the need for an effective irrigation water quality assessment to curb nonpoint source pollution that could be caused by improper use of chemicals and pesticides by farmers.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SUM	2017	3	3					461	470		10.7508/pj.2017.03.011								WOS:000414862900011						
J	Raju, A; Singh, A				Raju, Ashwani; Singh, Anjali			Assessment of Groundwater Quality and Mapping Human Health Risk in Central Ganga Alluvial Plain, Northern India	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												The present paper deals with the assessment of hydrogeochemical processes controlling groundwater quality in Lucknow urban area located in an alluvial plain of Ganga-Gomti interfluve, India. Physico-chemical data were derived from 42 groundwater samples, and were further used to map human health risk in Lucknow monitoring area. The analysis reveals that the carbonate and silicate weathering along with reverse ion exchange, cation exchange, sulphide oxidation, dissociation of residual halides are the major solute processes controlling the ionic concentration of groundwater in Lucknow. Groundwater is predominantly of Na+-Ca2+-HCO3- type having all cations and anions within prescribed WHO limits except for Fe2+ and NO3-. Ionic concentrations of groundwater were combined to derive a Water Quality Index (WQI) using spatial overlay in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). WQI reveals that about 47.8% of the total 133.52 km(2) area covering Cis-Gomti localities of the city has nearly poor water quality for drinking use which is possibly due to high Fe2+ and NO3- influx in shallow unconfined aquifers. WQI is integrated with urban population density index data to map spatial distribution of human health risk due to consumption of poor water quality. Results reveal that the sites located in and around the vicinity of Alambagh, Kaiserbagh and Hazratganj, covering 9.81% of the total area, are potential ` hot spot' at moderate to high health risk, and require substantial remediation measures to control the anthropogenic influx on a long-term basis.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				JUN	2017	4	2					375	397		10.1007/s40710-017-0232-0								WOS:000414367800005

The methodology is developed in accordance with ISO 14040s and ISO 14046. This study suggested the water depletion and eutrophication results of white radishes as water footprint results. The water depletion results are 25.58 m(3) freshwater/ton (spring season white radish), 20.74 m(3) freshwater/ton (autumn season white radish), 26.68 m(3) freshwater/ton (alpine region white radish), and 28.56 m(3) freshwater/ton (facility white radish), respectively. And the eutrophication results are 3.23E-11 kg P/ton (spring season white radish), 2.66E-11 kg P/ton (autumn season white radish), 3.94E-11 kg P/ton (alpine region white radish), and 1.56E-11 kg P/ton (facility white radish), respectively. In conclusion, autumn season white radish is more competitive than other cultivation types in the context of water footprint assessment. As a result, switching from other cultivation types to autumn season white radish is expected to offer a more water -efficient means of white radish cultivation. Henceforth, drawing upon evidence within this report, decision -makers would be wise to cultivate in more effective water use cultivation type and crop species.

The seasonal variation of the physicochemical parameters including pH, temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (O-2), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total organic carbon (TOC), and trace metals were assessed in water samples collected from wells (n=3) and two rivers which were the River Lukemi (RLK, n=3) and River Luini (RLN, n=2) located in the City of Kikwit (Province of Kwilu, Democratic Republic of the Congo). Samples were collected during the dry and wet seasons. The concentration of trace metals (Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb, and Pb) in water was measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), and soluble ions (Nat Kt NFLit SO42-, NO3, and Cl)-analysis was performed using Ion Chromatography. The results indicate the seasonal difference in the physicochemical composition of water e.g., the pH was lower in the wet compared to the dry season. pH values during the wet season ranged from 4.12 to 5.60 in wells and from 5.55 to 6.31 in rivers while the dry season values ranged from 6.27 to 6.98 in wells and from 7.09 to 7.44 in rivers. The concentrations of soluble ions and other physicochemical parameters (O-2, DOC and TOC) also varied with the seasons, being higher in the wet and lower in the dry season. With the exception of Mn, the average concentrations of other trace metals measured in water samples from wells and rivers met the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking/domestic water quality. Mn concentration in water samples analysed ranged between 634 to 812 and 1352-1741 ng L-1 during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. These results imply that the high concentration of Mn in the water samples may be explained by the geological origin and result of natural weathering processes. In general, according to the parameters analysed, the water samples taken from the sites studied in both seasons appear to meet drinking water standards according to the WHO guidelines but with the two exceptions of the pH and Mn. This study is important for the present situation and can be applied in similar environmental compartments in the future to assess the availability of safe drinking water in developing countries.

They analyzed E. coli and fecal sterol concentrations in samples from four heronries during the breeding seasons in 2011-2013. The highest E. coli concentrations were in water samples from the two largest heronries established directly over water. The main sterols in fecal samples were cholesterol and stigmasterol, and in water, cholesterol, coprostanol, and cholestanol. Total sterols ranged 979 to 5838 ng/g dry weight in fecal samples, and 13 to 600 ng/L in water samples. There was a positive correlation between E. coli and the sum of bird sterols in water exposed directly to fecal deposition, but not in water surrounding the heronries. The authors found a strong association between E. coli and stigmasterol, suggesting that the presence of stigmasterol in water could be used for predicting E. coli sources from heronries nesting close to waterbodies.

Apart from the mutual benefits, plant-microbe interactions also influence the water quality especially at rhizosphere providing inherent ability to the aquatic system for the mitigation of pollution from the water column. The review presents and in-depth information along with certain research advancements made in the field of ecological and bio/chemical aspects of plant-microbe interactions and the underlying potential to improve water quality.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1079	1090		10.1007/s13201-016-0415-2								WOS:000411085600003

The physicochemical characterization of water samples using different parameters was conducted for water quality monitoring. Heavy metal analysis was performed to quantify the toxic components present in water samples. It was observed that although the water samples of all the sites demonstrated mutagenic as well as genotoxic activity, the effect was quite significant with the water samples from sites containing water from river Satluj, i.e., site 1 (upstream Satluj river), site 2 (Satluj river) and site 3 (reservoir Satluj). The high level of pollution due to industrial effluents and agricultural run-off at these sites may engender the genotoxicity and mutagenicity of water samples.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1107	1115		10.1007/s13201-015-0347-2								WOS:000411085600006

Hydrochemical data from 19 groundwater and 7 rock samples have been used to evaluate water quality, water types, and sources of various ions as well as origin of the groundwater. The study results show that the quality of groundwater from the area is generally not good due to their fluoride (F-), bicarbonate (HCO3-) and electrical conductivity (EC) concentrations. The F- contents of the groundwater have values as high as 1.97 mg/ L, with 53 % of the groundwater having concentrations of F- exceeding the WHO recommended allowable limits. These high F- values have the potential of causing serious health problems such as kidney failure, dental and skeletal fluorosis, reproductive problem and reduction in intelligent quotient of consumers. A plot of Gibbs diagram reveals that rock weathering and precipitation are the major hydrogeochemical processes regulating the water chemistry of the study area. Petrographic thin-section analyses of rock samples identify minerals present to be muscovite, plagioclase feldspars, quartz, sericite and iron oxide. Stable isotope (O-18 and H-2) composition of the waters reveals that most of the groundwater is likely to be recharged from local precipitation, indicating their meteoric origin. Some samples, however, showed considerable evaporation.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1117	1129		10.1007/s13201-015-0348-1								WOS:000411085600007

Application of multivariate statistical technique for hydrogeochemical assessment of groundwater within the Lower Pra Basin, Ghana	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Multivariate statistical technique and hydrogeo-chemical approach were employed for groundwater assessment within the Lower Pra Basin. The main objective was to delineate the main processes that are responsible for the water chemistry and pollution of groundwater within the basin. Fifty-four (54) (No) boreholes were sampled in January 2012 for quality assessment. PCA using Varimax with Kaiser Normalization method of extraction for both rotated space and component matrix have been applied to the data. Results show that Spearman's correlation matrix of major ions revealed expected process-based relationships derived mainly from the geochemical processes, such as ion-exchange and silicate/aluminosilicate weathering within the aquifer. Three main principal components influence the water chemistry and pollution of groundwater within the basin. The three principal components have accounted for approximately 79% of the total variance in the hydrochemical data. Component 1 delineates the main natural processes (water-soil-rock interactions) through which groundwater within the basin acquires its chemical characteristics, Component 2 delineates the incongruent dissolution of silicate/aluminosilicates, while Component 3 delineates the prevalence of pollution principally from agricultural input as well as trace metal mobilization in groundwater within the basin. The loadings and score plots of the first two PCs show grouping pattern which indicates the strength of the mutual relation among the hydrochemical variables. In terms of proper management and development of groundwater within the basin, communities, where intense agriculture is taking place, should be monitored and protected from agricultural activities. especially where inorganic fertilizers are used by creating buffer zones. Monitoring of the water quality especially the water pH is recommended to ensure the acid neutralizing potential of groundwater within the basin thereby, curtailing further trace metal mobilization processes in groundwater within the basin.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1131	1150		10.1007/s13201-017-0540-6								WOS:000411085600008

Produced water re-injection in a non-fresh water aquifer with geochemical reaction, hydrodynamic molecular dispersion and adsorption kinetics controlling: model development and numerical simulation	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												An improved produced water reinjection (PWRI) model that incorporates filtration, geochemical reaction, molecular transport, and mass adsorption kinetics was developed to predict cake deposition and injectivity performance in hydrocarbon aquifers in Nigeria oil fields. Thus, the improved PWRI model considered contributions of geochemical reaction, adsorption kinetics, and hydrodynamic molecular dispersion mechanism to alter the injectivity and deposition of suspended solids on aquifer wall resulting in cake formation in pores during PWRI and transport of active constituents in hydrocarbon reservoirs. The injectivity decline and cake deposition for specific case studies of hydrocarbon aquifers in Nigeria oil fields were characterized with respect to its well geometry, lithology, and calibrations data and simulated in COMSOL multiphysics software environment. The PWRI model was validated by comparisons to assessments of previous field studies based on data and results supplied by operator and regulator. The results of simulation showed that PWRI performance was altered because of temporal variations and declinations of permeability, injectivity, and cake precipitation, which were observed to be dependent on active adsorption and geochemical reaction kinetics coupled with filtration scheme and molecular dispersion. From the observed results and findings, transition time tr to cake nucleation and growth were dependent on aquifer constituents, well capacity, filtration coefficients, particle-to-grain size ratio, water quality, and more importantly, particle-to-grain adsorption kinetics. Thus, the results showed that injectivity decline and permeability damage were direct contributions of geochemical reaction, hydrodynamic molecular diffusion, and adsorption kinetics to the internal filtration mechanism, which are largely dependent on the initial conditions of concentration of active constituents of produced water and aquifer capacity.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1169	1189		10.1007/s13201-016-0490-4								WOS:000411085600011

The main aim of this study has been to assess the variability of groundwater parameters to develop water quality of Tirupati area and its suitability for domestic and irrigation purpose. Further, the samples were analyzed for pH, EC, TDS, carbonates, bicarbonates, alkalinity, chlorides, sulfates, hardness, fluoride, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Based on the analytical results, chemical indices like percent sodium, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), adjusted SAR, percent sodium (Na %), residual sodium carbonate (RSC) and permeability index (PI) have been calculated. Chadha rectangular diagram for geochemical classification and hydrochemical processes of groundwater indicated that most of waters are Ca-Mg-HCO3 and Ca-Mg-Cl types. Assessment of water samples from various methods indicated that majority of the water samples are suitable for domestic and irrigation purpose.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1203	1212		10.1007/s13201-016-0448-6								WOS:000411085600013						
J	Parsaie, A; Haghiabi, AH				Parsaie, Abbas; Haghiabi, Amir Hamzeh			Computational Modeling of Pollution Transmission in Rivers	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Modeling of river pollution contributes to better management of water quality and this will lead to the improvement of human health. The advection dispersion equation (ADE) is the government equation on pollutant transmission in the river. Modeling the pollution transmission includes numerical solution of the ADE and estimating the longitudinal dispersion coefficient (LDC). In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for numerical modeling of the pollution transmission in rivers. It is related to use both finite volume method as numerical method and artificial neural network (ANN) as soft computing technique together in simulation. In this approach, the result of the ANN for predicting the LDC was considered as input parameter for the numerical solution of the ADE. To validate the model performance in real engineering problems, the pollutant transmission in Severn River has been simulated. Comparison of the final model results with measured data of the Severn River showed that the model has good performance. Predicting the LDC by ANN model significantly improved the accuracy of computer simulation of the pollution transmission in river.

J	Verma, RK; Murthy, S; Verma, S; Mishra, SK				Verma, Ravindra Kumar; Murthy, Shankar; Verma, Sangeeta; Mishra, Surendra Kumar			Design flow duration curves for environmental flows estimation in Damodar River Basin, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												In this study, environmental flows (EFs) are estimated for six watersheds of Damodar River Basin (DRB) using flow duration curve (FDC) derived using two approaches: (a) period of record and (b) stochastic approaches for daily, 7-, 30-, 60-day moving averages, and 7- daily mean annual flows observed at Tenughat dam, Konar dam, Maithon dam, Panchet dam, Damodar bridge, Burnpur during 1981-2010 and at Phusro during 1988-2010. For stochastic FDCs, 7-day FDCs for 10, 20-, 50- and 100-year return periods were derived for extraction of discharge values at every 5% probability of exceedance. FDCs derived using the first approach show high probability of exceedance (5-75%) for the same discharge values. Furthermore, discharge values of 60-day mean are higher than those derived using daily, 7-, and 30-day mean values. The discharge values of 95% probability of exceedance (Q95) derived from 7Q10 (ranges from 2.04 to 5.56 cumec) and 7Q100 (ranges from 3.4 to 31.48 cumec) FDCs using the second approach are found more appropriate as EFs during drought/low flow and normal precipitation years.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1283	1293		10.1007/s13201-016-0486-0								WOS:000411085600021						
J	Nemcic-Jurec, J; Jazbec, A				Nemcic-Jurec, Jasna; Jazbec, Anamarija			Point source pollution and variability of nitrate concentrations in water from shallow aquifers	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Agriculture is one of the several major sources of nitrate pollution, and therefore the EU Nitrate Directive, designed to decrease pollution, has been implemented. Point sources like septic systems and broken sewage systems also contribute to water pollution. Pollution of groundwater by nitrate from 19 shallow wells was studied in a typical agricultural region, middle Podravina, in northwest Croatia. The concentration of nitrate ranged from <0.1 to 367 mg/l in water from wells, and 29.8 % of 253 total samples were above maximum acceptable value of 50 mg/l (MAV). Among regions R1-R6, there was no statistically significant difference in nitrate concentrations (F = 1.98; p = 0.15) during the years 2002-2007. Average concentrations of nitrate in all 19 wells for all the analyzed years were between recommended limit value of 25 mg/l (RLV) and MAV except in 2002 (concentration was under RLV). The results of the repeated measures ANOVA showed statistically significant differences between the wells at the point source distance (proximity) of <10 m, compared to the wells at the point source distance of [20 m (F = 10.6; p < 0.001). Average annual concentrations of nitrate during the years studied are not statistically different, but interaction between proximity and years is statistically significant (F = 2.07; p = 0.04). Results of k-means clustering confirmed division into four clusters according to the pollution. Principal component analysis showed that there is only one significant factor, proximity, which explains 91.6 % of the total variability of nitrate. Differences in water quality were found as a result of different environmental factors. These results will contribute to the implementation of the Nitrate Directive in Croatia and the EU.

J	Shah, KA; Joshi, GS				Shah, Kosha A.; Joshi, Geeta S.			Evaluation of water quality index for River Sabarmati, Gujarat, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												An attempt has been made to develop water quality index (WQI), using six water quality parameters pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, electrical conductivity, nitrate nitrogen and total coliform measured at three different stations along the Sabarmati river basin from the year 2005 to 2008. Rating scale is developed based on the tolerance limits of inland waters and health point of view. Weighted arithmetic water quality index method was used to find WQI along the stretch of the river basin. It was observed from this study that the impact of human activity and sewage disposal in the river was severe on most of the parameters. The station located in highly urban area showed the worst water quality followed by the station located in moderately urban area and lastly station located in a moderately rural area. It was observed that the main cause of deterioration in water quality was due to the high anthropogenic activities, illegal discharge of sewage and industrial effluent, lack of proper sanitation, unprotected river sites and urban runoff.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1349	1358		10.1007/s13201-015-0318-7								WOS:000411085600026						
J	Mendhe, VA; Mishra, S; Varma, AK; Singh, AP				Mendhe, Vinod Atmaram; Mishra, Subhashree; Varma, Atul Kumar; Singh, Awanindra Pratap			Coalbed methane-produced water quality and its management options in Raniganj Basin, West Bengal, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Coalbed methane (CBM) recovery is associated with production of large quantity of groundwater. The coal seams are depressurized by pumping of water for regular and consistent gas production. Usually, CBM operators need to pump [10 m(3) of water per day from one well, which depends on the aquifer characteristics, drainage and recharge pattern. In India, 32 CBM blocks have been awarded for exploration and production, out of which six blocks are commercially producing methane gas at 0.5 million metric standard cubic feet per day. Large amount of water is being produced from CBM producing blocks, but no specific information or data are available for geochemical properties of CBM-produced water and its suitable disposal or utilization options for better management. CBM operators are in infancy and searching for the suitable solutions for optimal management of produced water. CBM- and mine-produced water needs to be handled considering its physical and geochemical assessment, because it may have environmental as well as long-term impact on aquifer. Investigations were carried out to evaluate geochemical and hydrogeo-logical conditions of CBM blocks in Raniganj Basin. Totally, 15 water samples from CBM well head and nine water samples from mine disposal head were collected from Raniganj Basin. The chemical signature of produced water reveals high sodium and bicarbonate concentrations with low calcium and magnesium, and very low sulphate in CBM water. It is comprehend that CBM water is mainly of Na-HCO3 type and coal mine water is of Ca-Mg-SO4 and HCO3-Cl-SO4 type. The comparative studies are also carried out for CBM-and mine-produced water considering the geochemical properties, aquifer type, depth of occurrence and lithological formations. Suitable options like impounding, reverse osmosis, irrigation and industrial use after prerequisite treatments are suggested. However, use of this huge volume of CBM- and mine-produced water for irrigation or other beneficial purposes may require careful management based on water pH, EC, TDS, alkalinity, bicarbonate, sodium, fluoride, metals content and SAR values.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1359	1367		10.1007/s13201-015-0326-7								WOS:000411085600027

The use of Moringa oleifera seed as a natural coagulant for wastewater treatment and heavy metals removal	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Moringa oleifera (MO) is a multipurpose tree with considerable potential and its cultivation is currently being actively promoted in many developing countries. Seeds of this tropical tree contain water-soluble, positively charged proteins that act as an effective coagulant for water and wastewater treatment. Based on this, water quality of "Sungai baluk'' river was examined before and after the treatment using MO seed. MO seed exhibited high efficiency in the reduction and prevention of the bacterial growth in both wastewater and "Sungai baluk'' river samples. The turbidity was removed up to 85-94% and dissolved oxygen (DO) was improved from 2.58 +/- 0.01 to 4.00 +/- 0.00 mg/L. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand ( BOD) were increased after the treatment from 99.5 +/- 0.71 to 164.0 +/- 2.83 mg/L for COD and from 48.00 +/- 0.42 to 76.65 +/- 2.33 mg/L for BOD, respectively. Nevertheless, there was no significant alteration of pH, conductivity, salinity and total dissolved solid after the treatment. Heavy metals such as Fe were fully eliminated, whereas Cu and Cd were successfully removed by up to 98%. The reduction of Pb was also achieved by up to 78.1%. Overall, 1% of MO seed cake was enough to remove heavy metals from the water samples. This preliminary laboratory result confirms the great potential of MO seed in wastewater treatment applications.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1369	1376		10.1007/s13201-016-0499-8								WOS:000411085600028

Hydrochemical characteristics and quality assessment of groundwater along the Manavalakurichi coast, Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The present study was carried out to find the groundwater quality of coastal aquifer along Manavalakurichi coast. For this study, a total of 30 groundwater samples were collected randomly from open wells and borewells. The concentration of major ions and other geochemical parameters in the groundwater were analyzed in the laboratory by adopting standard procedures suggested by the American Public Health Association. The order of the dominant cations in the study area was found to be Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, whereas the sequence of dominant anions was Cl- > HCO3- > SO42-. The hydrogeochemical facies of the groundwater samples were studied by constructing piper trilinear diagram which revealed the evidence of saltwater intrusion into the study area. The obtained geochemical parameters were compared with the standard permissible limits suggested by the World Health Organization and Indian Standard Institution to determine the drinking water quality in the study area. The analysis suggests that the groundwater from the wells W25 and W26 is unsuitable for drinking. The suitability of groundwater for irrigation was studied by calculating percent sodium, sodium absorption ratio and residual sodium carbonate values. The Wilcox and USSL plots were also prepared. It was found that the groundwater from the stations W1, W25 and W26 is unfit for irrigation. The Gibbs plots were also sketched to study the mechanisms controlling the geochemical composition of groundwater in the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1429	1438		10.1007/s13201-015-0325-8								WOS:000411085600033
