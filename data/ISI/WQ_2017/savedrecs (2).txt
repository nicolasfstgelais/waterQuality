J	Wu, Q; Qi, J; Xia, XH				Wu, Qiong; Qi, Jun; Xia, Xinghui			Long-term variations in sediment heavy metals of a reservoir with changing trophic states: Implications for the impact of climate change	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Two dated sediment cores from the Miyun Reservoir of Beijing in China were analyzed to reconstruct the pollution history of heavy metals including cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn) as well as phosphorus (P). Enrichment factor (EF) and geoaccumulation index (I-geo) were applied to assess the enrichment status of heavy metals. Average EF and I-geo values indicated that the studied heavy metals in the sediments mainly originated from non-point source pollution and soil-water erosion, showing low ecological risks. In addition, correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) identified that Cd, Zn, and P were mainly from agricultural diffusion pollution caused by utilization of the phosphate fertilizer; Zn, Ni, and Cr originated from soil erosion. PCA analysis was further conducted to investigate the relationships among meteorological factors, algae dominant total organic carbon (TOC), and heavy metals. Results showed that algae-dominant TOC had strong positive correlation with temperature, which can be explained by that increased temperature accelerated the growth of algae. Meanwhile the opposite loadings between algae-dominant TOC and heavy metal suggested that primary production played an important role in migration and transformation of metals. Moreover, stepwise multiple regression models showed that Fe was sensitive to temperature, which accounted for approximately 39.0% and 40.1% of the variations in Fe of two sediment cores, respectively. Fe showed significant decreasing trends during the past 50 years. Reductive environment of water-sediment interface caused by increasing temperature probably contributed to the restoration of ferric iron, resulting in the release of soluble Fe to overlying waters. Future climate change with elevated temperature and extreme weather events will aggravate the ecological risk of heavy metals in water environment due to the enhanced leaching effect and non-point source pollution as well as the release of heavy metals from sediments to water environment.

J	Wu, L; Chang, HY; Ma, XY				Wu, Lei; Chang, Huanyu; Ma, Xiaoyi			A modified method for pesticide transport and fate in subsurface environment of a winter wheat field of Yangling, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Guanzhong region is one of the water resources shortage areas and also an important food producing area in Chinese Loess Plateau. The unreasonable application of irrigation and pesticide not only reduces the utilization rate of pesticides, but also is a potential threat to aquatic environments. In order to explore the reasonable application pattern of irrigation and pesticide, a modified method considering crop water requirement and pesticide transport was established to simulate transport and fate of Triadimefon in subsurface environment of a winter wheat field in Yangling, China. Results indicate that: (1) the modified method introduces the concepts of crop water requirement and irrigation schedule, which can estimate irrigation amount more accurately and achieve the goal of water saving and agricultural diffuse pollution control more efficiently. The method shows good potential applications and implications in predicting pesticide exposure levels of different crops and in reducing pesticide pollution. (2) The changing trends of soil pesticide levels under different pesticide applications are various. The Triadimefon concentration level in surface soil layer (0.005 m) was directly affected by pesticide application and irrigation. The Triadimefon peak below the soil depth of 0.035 m has prominently delayed effects and it is mainly affected by irrigations. The concentration of pesticides decays rapidly with the increase of soil depth, and it can be ignored below the depth of 0.5 m. (3) The soil pesticide levels under different pesticide and irrigation modes show considerable differences, the irrigation is still the most significant factor affecting the level of soil pesticide residues under different time intervals between pesticide application and irrigation. The irrigation scheme of one-day interval and five-divided irrigation can effectively reduce deep soil pollution without affecting the normal growth of crops. Results may provide theoretical basis and guide farmers to choose appropriate irrigation and pesticide application patterns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Predicting diffuse microbial pollution risk across catchments: The performance of SCIMAP and recommendations for future development	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Microbial pollution of surface waters in agricultural catchments can be a consequence of poor farm management practices, such as excessive stocking of livestock on vulnerable land or inappropriate handling of manures and slurries. Catchment interventions such as fencing of watercourses, streamside buffer strips and constructed wetlands have the potential to reduce faecal pollution of watercourses. However these interventions are expensive and occupy valuable productive land. There is, therefore, a requirement for tools to assist in the spatial targeting of such interventions to areas where they will have the biggest impact on water quality improvements whist occupying the minimal amount of productive land. SCIMAP is a risk-based model that has been developed for this purpose but with a focus on diffuse sediment and nutrient pollution. In this study we investigated the performance of SCIMAP in predicting microbial pollution of watercourses and assessed modelled outputs of E. coli, a common faecal indicator organism (FIO), against observed water quality information. SCIMAP was applied to two river catchments in the UK. SCIMAP uses land cover riskweightings, which are routed through the landscape based on hydrological connectivity to generate catchment scale maps of relative in-stream pollution risk. Assessment of the model's performance and derivation of optimum land cover risk weightings was achieved using a Monte-Carlo sampling approach. Performance of the SCIMAP framework for informing on FIO risk was variable with better performance in the Yealm catchment (r(s) = 0.88; p < 0.01) than the Wyre (r(s) = -0.36; p > 0.05). Across both catchments much uncertainty was associated with the application of optimum risk weightings attributed to different land use classes. Overall, SCIMAP showed potential as a useful tool in the spatial targeting of FIO diffuse pollution management strategies; however, improvements are required to transition the existing SCIMAP framework to a robust FIO risk-mapping tool.

Such models commonly overlook the flow pathways of pollutants across the landscape. This work aims at closing such knowledge gap by developing a Spatially and Temporally Distributed Empirical model for Phosphorus Management (STEM-P) that simulates the daily phosphorus loss from source areas to receiving waters on a spatially-distributed grid-cell basis. STEM-P bypasses the use of complex mechanistic algorithms by representing the phosphorus mobilization and delivery processes with zero-order mobilization and first-order delivery, respectively. STEM-P was applied to a 217 km(2) watershed with mixed forest and agricultural land uses situated in southwestern China. The STEM-P simulation of phosphorus concentration at the watershed outlet approximated the observed data closely: the percent bias (P-bias) was -7.1%, with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (ENS) of 0.80 on a monthly scale for the calibration period. The Pbias was 18.1%, with a monthly ENS equal to 0.72 for validation. The simulation results showed that 76% of the phosphorus loadwas transported with surface runoff, 25.2% of which came from 3.4% of the watershed area (classified as standard A critical source areas), and 55.3% of which originated from 17.1% of the watershed area (classified as standard B critical source areas). The standard A critical source areas were composed of 51% residences, 27% orchards, 18% dry fields, and 4% paddy fields. The standard B critical source areas were mainly paddy fields (81%). The calculated spatial and temporal patterns of phosphorus loss and recorded flow pathways identified with the STEM-P simulations revealed the field-scale critical source areas and guides the design and placement of effective practices for non-point source pollution control and water quality conservation.

An area with mixed land-uses, typical of the piedmont-plain recharge area of the North China Plain, was selected to investigate different nitrate sources and the impact of land use on nitrate distribution in groundwater. Multiple environmental tracers were examined, including major ions, stable isotopes of water (delta H-2-H2O, delta O-18-H2O) and nitrate (delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3-). Groundwater was sampled from four land-use types; natural vegetation (NV), farmland (FL), economic forestland (EF) and residential areas (RA). A mixing model using delta O-18 and Cl-concentrations showed that groundwater recharge predominantly comprises precipitation and lateral groundwater flow from areas of natural vegetation in the upper catchment, while irrigation return water and wastewater from septic tanks were major inputs in farmland and residential areas, respectively. Land use variation is the major contributing factor to different nitrate concentrations. In total, 80%, 49% and 86% of samples from RA, FL and EF, respectively exceeded the WHO standard (50 mg/L NO3-), compared to 6.9% of samples from NV. Isotopes of delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- verified that nitrate in groundwater of the NV (with delta N-15 ranging from 1.7 parts per thousand to 4.7 parts per thousand) was sourced from soil and precipitation. Examination of delta N-15-NO3- vs delta O-18-NO3- values along with multivariate statistical analysis (principle component and cluster analysis) helped identify sources with overlapping isotopic values in other land-use areas (where delta N-15 values range from 2.5% to 10.2%). Manure and septic waste were dominant sources for most groundwater with high NO3- and Cl-concentrations in both farmland and residential areas. The lack of de-nitrification and fact that the area is a recharge zone for the North China Plain highlight the importance of controlling nitrate sources through careful application of manure and fertilizers, and control of septic leakage.

Coastal stormwater wet pond sediment nitrogen dynamics	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Wet ponds are a common type of stormwater control measure (SCM) in coastal areas of the southeastern US, but their internal nitrogen dynamics have not been extensively studied. Using flow-through intact sediment core incubations, net sediment N-2 fluxes before and after a nitrate addition from five wet ponds spanning a range of ages (3.25-10 years old) were quantified through membrane inlet mass spectrometry during early summer. Multiple locations within a single wet pond (6.16 years old) were also sampled during ambient conditions in late summer to determine the combined effects of depth, vegetation, and flow path position on net N-2 fluxes at the sediment-water interface. All pond sediments had considerable rates of net nitrogen fixation during ambient conditions, and net N-2 fluxes during nitrate-enriched conditions were significantly correlated with pond age. Following a nitrate addition to simulate storm conditions, younger pond sediments shifted towards net denitrification, but older ponds exhibited even higher rates of net nitrogen fixation. The pond forebay had significantly higher rates of net nitrogen fixation compared to the main basin, and rates throughout the pond were an order of magnitude higher than the early summer experiment. These results identify less than optimal nitrogen processing in this common SCM, however, data presented here suggest that water column mixing and pond sediment excavation could improve the capacity of wet ponds to enhance water quality by permanently removing nitrogen.

In Chile, land-use change has drastically intensified over the last decade, with native forests converted to exotic forest plantations and agricultural land. However, the effects thereof on aquatic ecosystems are not well understood. Closing this knowledge gap first requires understanding how human perturbations affect riparian and stream biota. Identified biological indicators could then be applied to determine the health of fluvial ecosystems. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of land-use change on the health of riparian and aquatic ecosystems by assessing riparian vegetation, water quality, benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, and functional feeding groups. Twenty-one sites in catchment areas with different land-uses (i.e. pristine forests, native forests, exotic forest plantations, and agricultural land) were selected and sampled during the 2010 to 2012 dry seasons. Riparian vegetation quality-was highest in pristine forests. Per the modified Macroinvertebrate Family Biotic Index for Chilean species, the best conditions existed in native forests and the worst in agricultural catchments. Water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages significantly varied across land-use areas, with forest plantations and agricultural land having high nutrient concentrations, conductivity, suspended solids, and apparent color. Macroinvertebrate assemblage diversity was lowest for agricultural and exotic forest plantation catchments, with notable non-insect representation. Collector-gatherers were the most abundant functional feeding group, suggesting importance independent of land-use. Land-use areas showed no significant differences in functional feeding groups. In conclusion, anthropogenic land-use changes were detectable through riparian quality, water quality, and macroinvertebrate assemblages, but not through functional feeding groups. These data, particularly the riparian vegetation and macroinvertebrate assemblage parameters, could be applied towards the conservation and management of riparian ecosystems through land-use change studies.

Application and validation of a new approach for modelling benthic invertebrate dispersal: First colonisation of a former open sewer system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Within a heavily modified catchment, formerly polluted streams are now free of untreated wastewater. Additionally, the morphology of streams has been improved by physical habitat restoration. Both water quality and structural improvements offered a unique opportunity to investigate the recolonisation of restored sections by benthic macroinvertebrates. As dispersal is a key mechanism for recolonisation, we developed a method to predict the dispersal of 18 aquatic insect taxa to 35,338 river sections (section length: 2 m) within the catchment. Source populations of insect taxa were sampled at 33 sites. In addition, 14 morphologically restored sites were sampled and constituted the validation dataset. We applied a "least-cost" modelling approach within a raster-based GIS model, combining taxon-specific aquatic and terrestrial dispersal capabilities with the "friction" that physical migration barriers impose on dispersal of aquatic and terrestrial stages. This taxon-specific modelling approach was compared to a conservative modelling approach, assuming a Euclidean distance of 5 km as the maximum dispersal distance for any source population regardless of dispersal barriers. Least-cost modelling showed a significantly better performance in terms of the correct classification rate (CCR) and true predicted absences (specificity), with on average 37% points higher CCR and 42% points higher specificity. Sensitivity was 18% points lower. At 71% of the validation sites, recolonisation was predicted with at least a modest goodness of fit (CCR > 70%). Conversely, the conservative modelling approach achieved a modest goodness of fit for only 14% of the validation sites. For 44% of the taxa, least-cost modelling showed a high CCR (= 100%), whereas the conservative approach showed a high CCR for none of the taxa. Our approach can help water managers select appropriate sites for restoration to increase recolonisation and biological recovery. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As an implicit consequence of this finding, it has been assumed that there are no long-term increasing trends in nutrient exports from these peatlands after the establishment of forestry. We analysed discharge total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) concentration data from 54 catchments with undrained pristine peatlands and 34 catchments with drained peatlands using data with considerably longer drainage history than in previous studies. Our results agree with previous studies in that discharge TN and TP concentrations in areas drained 20-30 years ago did not differ much from those in pristine sites. However, we also observed that the TN and TP concentrations were increasing with years since drainage of these catchments. Discharge TN and TP concentrations were over two times higher in areas drained 60 years ago when compared with more recently drained areas. Our results challenge the current perceptions by showing that forestry-drained peatlands may contribute to water eutrophication considerably more than previously estimated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanism on how sulfate-rich mine drainage affects freshwater ecosystems is largely unknown, and its potential ecological risk has not been assessed so far. During 2009-2016, water and macroinvertebrate samples from 405 sample sites were collected along the mine drainage gradient from circum-neutral to alkaline waters in Hun-Tai River, Northeastern China. Results of linear regressions showed that sulfate-rich mine drainage was significantly positively correlated with the constituents typically derived from rock weathering (Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- + CO32-); the diversity of intolerant stream macroinvertebrates exhibited a steep decline along the gradient of sulfate-rich mine drainage. Meanwhile, stressor-response relationships between sulfate-rich mine drainage and macroinvertebrate communities were explored by two complementary statistical approaches in tandem (Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis and the field-based method developed by USEPA). Results revealed that once stream sulfate concentrations in mine drainage exceeded 35 mg/L, significant decline in the abundance of intolerant macroinvertebrate taxa occurred. An assessment of ecological risk posed by sulfate-rich mine drainage was conducted based on a tiered approach consisting of simple deterministic method (Hazard Quotient, HQ) to probabilistic method (Joint Probability Curve, JPC). Results indicated that sulfate-rich mine drainage posed a potential risk, and 64.62-84.88% of surface waters in Hun-Tai River exist serious risk while 5% threshold (HC05) and 1% threshold (HC01) were set up to protect macroinvertebrates, respectively. This study provided us a better understanding on the impacts of sulfate-rich mine drainage on freshwater ecosystems, and it would be helpful for future catchment management to protect streams from mining activity.

Taking discharge as a representative water quantity indicator, as well as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) as water quality indicators for the twin rivers (i.e., the Chaohe and Baihe rivers) which run into the Miyun Reservoir in North China, this study calculated marginal probability distributions of these indicators, and analyzed the joint probability distribution of discharge and TN/TP concentration by applying the Frank copula function. According to an analysis of various scenario combinations of discharge and TN/TP concentration, the quantitative management intervals including the priority control interval, the key attention interval and the daily maintenance interval, were identified. The results were as follows: (a) a fitting degree evaluation indicated that the Pearson-III distribution for the marginal probability distribution of discharge and the lognormal distribution for that of TN/TP concentration were feasible. Additionally, the Frank copula theory was applicable for their joint probability analysis according to the applicability analysis and goodness-of-fit test; (b) regarding to the water quality of the Miyun Reservoir inflows, it is more important to enhance the control of the Chaohe River and the monitoring of TP concentration; and (c) the TN concentration within division values of discharge (i.e., 16.59, 24.14 m(3)/s) was tend to exceed the class III limitation of the Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water in China, and the concentrations of TN and TP increased as the discharge increased for the two rivers. The quantitative management intervals based on copula analysis is an intuitive and effective solution for comprehensive risk management of reservoir inflows. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Seena, S; Carvalho, F; Cassio, F; Pascoal, C				Seena, Sahadevan; Carvalho, Francisco; Cassio, Fernanda; Pascoal, Claudia			Does the developmental stage and composition of riparian forest stand affect ecosystem functioning in streams?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A common watershed restoration practice to improve water quality and stream ecosystem functions and services is replanting riparian corridors with plant species that may differ from those of natural communities. This restoration practice may have consequences on the aquatic ecosystem processes because organisms obtain energy from leaf litter inputs of the riparian zones. Leaf litter decomposition in streams is a vital ecosystem-level process, which depends on the activity of microorganisms and invertebrates. In the current study, we examined whether the type and developmental stage of riparian forest affect stream ecosystem functioning. We selected three wide-spread tree species in the Northwest Portugal, namely alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.), oak (Quercus robur L.) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and conducted stream litter decomposition experiments with leaf litter from trees differing in developmental stage to assess leaf mass loss, fungal and invertebrate biomass and diversity. Both type and developmental stage of riparian stand significantly affected leaf mass loss, biomass of fungi and benthic invertebrates, sporulation of fungi, and abundance of invertebrates. However, only developmental stage of the riparian stand had an impact on the richness and diversity of fungi, whereas invertebrate diversity and richness was influenced by both stage and type classes. Overall our study provides the novel information that stream ecosystem processes are dictated not only by the composition but also by the developmental stage of the riparian stand. Moreover, this study provides an insight into how by altering riparian forest community composition through restoration practices may have an impact on a key ecosystem process and may have implications for successfully implementing future management strategies.

In this study, we investigated if the oxygen isotope ratios in stream dissolved phosphate delta O-18(P)) can be used to distinguish between the phosphorus (P) originating from agricultural runoff and from rural sewage, at different periods of the year. Water was collected from septic tanks, drainage wells and the stream outlet in a small 7.3 km(2)) agricultural catchment to capture variations in the isotope signature at different flowevents. The d18OP signature in septic tank effluent (+ 13.2 to + 14.5%) was significantly different from that in drainage water (+ 9.0 to + 15.7%). Four different septic tanks had surprisingly similar isotope signature when 24 h composite samples were collected. Most of the water samples were not in oxygen isotope equilibrium. In three drainage wells, the d18OP signature varied from + 7.8 up to + 15.7% with higher values in periods with a larger contribution of superficial streamflow generation. A rainfall soon after manure had been spread resulted in a d18OP of 15.7% in a drainage well, and was also reflected in a similar value at the catchment outlet. This implies that the source isotope signal may be conserved during moderate or high flows. A three end-member model including the geological background would be a useful start to quantify the P contribution from diverse sources. Temporal differences in biological activity and the predominant transport pathways through soil profiles must be considered along with information about fertilisation. In combination with hydrological modelling of water pathways, this may considerably improve our understanding of catchment P losses. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To evaluate the response of tracemetals in coastal seawater to climatic changes and human disturbances, we report annual-resolution trace element data for a Porites coral core covering similar to 100 years of continuous growth from a fringing reef in Xiaodonghai Bay in the northern South China Sea. The results suggested that the trace metal contents in the coral skeleton demonstrated decadal to interdecadal fluctuations with several large or small peaks in certain years with remarkable environmental significances. All of the trace metals in coastal surface seawater, especially Cr and Pb (related to industrial or traffic emissions), were impacted by terrestrial inputs, except for Sr and U, which were impacted by the surface seawater temperature (SST). Moreover, Mn, Ni, Fe and Co were also contributed by weapons and military supplies during wars, and Cu, Cd and Zn were further impacted by upwelling associated with their biogeochemical cycles. Ba and rare earth element (REE) in coastal surface seawater were dominated by runoff and groundwater discharge associated with precipitation. This study provided the potential for some trace metals (e.g., REE, Ba, Cu, Cd, and Zn) in coral skeletons to be used as proxies of natural (e.g., upwelling and precipitation) and anthropogenic (e.g., war and coastal construction) variability of seawater chemistry to enable the reconstruction of environmental and climatic changes through time.

Water or sediment? Partitioning the role of water column and sediment chemistry as drivers of macroinvertebrate communities in an austral South African stream	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water pollution is a critical management issue, with many rivers and streams draining urban areas being polluted by the disposal of untreated solid waste and wastewater discharge, storm water and agricultural runoff. This has implications for biodiversity, and many rivers in the developing world are now considered compromised. We investigated benthic macroinvertebrate community structure and composition in relation to physico-chemical conditions of the water column and sediments. The study was conducted in an Austral catchment subject to both urban and agricultural pollutants in two different seasons. We assessed whether sediment characteristics were more important drivers of macroinvertebrate community composition than water column characteristics. We expected clear differences in macroinvertebrate community composition and in the associated community metrics due to distinct flow conditions between the two seasons. A combination of multivariate analyses (canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)) and biological indicator analysis were used to examine these patterns. Chironomidae was the most abundant family (>60%) in the upper mainstem river and stream sites. Stream sites were positively associated with CCA axis 2, being characterised by high turbidity and lower pH, salinity, phosphate concentration, channel width and canopy cover. Canopy cover, channel width, substrate embeddedness, phosphate concentration, pH, salinity and turbidity all had a significant effect on macroinvertebrate community composition. Using CCA variation partitioning, water quality was, however, a better predictor of benthic macroinvertebrate composition than sediment chemical conditions. Furthermore, our results suggest that seasonality had little effect on structuring benthic macroinvertebrate communities in this south-eastern zone of South Africa, despite clear changes in sediment chemistry. This likely reflects the relative lack of major variability in water chemistry compared to sediment chemistry between seasons and the relatively muted variability in precipitation between seasons than the more classic Austral temperate climates.

Surrogate measurements such as turbidity can improve understanding of pollutant behaviour, providing calibrations can be made cost-effectively and with quantified uncertainties. Here, we compared fortnightly and storm intensive water quality sampling with semi-continuous turbidity monitoring calibrated against spot samples as three potential methods for determining SS and PP concentrations and loads in an agricultural catchment over two-years. In the second year of sampling we evaluated the transferability of turbidity calibration relationships to an adjacent catchment with similar soils and land cover. When data from nine storm events were pooled, both SS and PP concentrations (all in log space) were better related to turbidity than they were to discharge. Developing separate calibration relationship for the rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph provided further improvement. However, the ability to transfer calibrations between adjacent catchments was not evident as the relationships of both SS and PP with turbidity differed both in gradient and intercept on the rising limb of the hydrograph between the two catchments. We conclude that the reduced uncertainty in load estimation derived from the use of turbidity as a proxy for specific water quality parameters in long-term regulatory monitoring programmes, must be considered alongside the increased capital and maintenance costs of turbidity equipment, potentially noisy turbidity data and the need for site-specific prolonged storm calibration periods.

Habitat degradation and species introductions are major threats to global biodiversity, and riverine fish are among the most threatened taxa in the world. Our interest was whether the presence of non-native species can affect native fish sensitivity to water quality deterioration in a large region in northeastern Spain (99,700 km(2), 15 catchments, 530 sites). We used a 'basemodel' with geographical and hydro-morphological variables, which are the major shaping factors in rivers. We tested whether water pollution, non-native species, or their interaction provided an improved understanding of patterns of distributions and health measurements of the twelve most common native species. There was little evidence that variation in native species abundance, where they occurred, the presence of diseases and changes in mean fish length or body condition was affected by water deterioration, the presence of non-native species, or their interaction. The disease rate and occurrence of native species might be affected, to a minor degree, by water quality changes and the presence of non-native species. Environmental conditions between sites with and without non-native fish differed in the condition of riparian areas and in water quality. Based on presence-absence data and changes in abundances through weighted average equations we also derived potential safe levels of salinization, nutrient pollution, and pH for the native fish. Overall, additive effects of stressors prevail over interactions, and the restoration of natural hydro-morphology in rivers is likely to be the most effective management approach to improving the prospects for the native fish fauna.

However, the effects of extreme floods of different return intervals on the floodplain and river channelmorphological evolution with the associated sediment transport processes are not well explored. Furthermore, different basin management action plans, such as engineering structure modifications, may also greatly affect the flood inundation, sediment transport, solute transport and morphological processes within extreme flood events. In this study, a coupled two-dimensional hydrodynamic, sediment transport and morphological model is applied to evaluate the impact of different river and basin management strategies on the flood inundation, sediment transport dynamics and morphological changes within extreme flood events of different magnitudes. The 10-year, 50-year, 100-year and 200-year floods are evaluated for the Lower Cache Creek system in California under existing condition and a potential future modification scenario. Modeling results showed that select locations of flood inundation within the study area tend to experience larger inundation depth and more sediment is likely to be trapped in the study area under potential modification scenario. The proposed two dimensional flow and sediment transport modeling approach implemented with a variety of inflow conditions can provide guidance to decision-makers when considering implementation of potential modification plans, especially as they relate to competing management strategies of large water bodies, such as the modeling area in this study.

This study proposes a set of sector-wise characterization factors (CFs), namely consumptive and degradative water stresses, to assess the impact of water withdrawals with a life cycle assessment approach. These CFs consider water availability, water quality, and competition for water between domestic, agricultural and industrial sectors and ecosystem at the watershed level. CFs were applied to a case study of regional water management of industrial water withdrawals in Taiwan to show that both regional or seasonal decrease in water availability contributes to a high consumptive water stress, whereas water scarcity due to degraded water quality not meeting sector standards has little influence on increased degradative water stress. Degradative water stress was observed more in the agricultural sector than in the industrial sector, which implies that the agriculture sector may have water quality concerns. Reducing water intensity and alleviating regional scale water stresses of watersheds are suggested as approaches to decrease the impact of both consumptive and degradative water use. The results from this study may enable a more detailed sector-wise analysis of water stress and influence water resource management policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Reuse water: Exposure duration, seasonality and treatment affect tissue responses in a model fish	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Partially remediated gray (reuse) water will likely find increasing use in a variety of applications owing to the increasing scarcity of freshwater. We aimed to determine if a model fish, the goldfish, could sense reuse water using olfaction (smell), and if 30 min or 7 d (acute) and 60 d (sub-chronic) exposures would affect their olfactory responses to natural odorants. We examined olfaction as previous studies have found that numerous chemicals can impair the olfactory sense, which is critical to carrying out numerous life-sustaining behaviors from feeding to mating. We also examined if fish olfactory and liver tissues would mount a response in terms of biotransformation enzyme gene expression, and whether treatment of reuse water with UV/H2O2 ameliorated adverse effects following reuse water exposure. We found that fish olfactory tissue responded to reuse water as it would to a natural odorant and that UV/H2O2 treatment had no influence on this. With acute exposures, olfactory impairment was apparent regardless of water type (e. g. responses of 23-55% of control), but in sub-chronic exposures, only the untreated reuse water caused olfactory impairment. The exposure of fish to reuse water increased the expression of one enzyme (CYP1A; >2.5-6.5 fold change) and reuse water treatment with UV/H2O2 reversed the effect. There was a seasonal effect that was likely due to changes in water quality (60 d summer exposure impaired ol-faction whereas spring and fall exposures did not). Overall, the data suggest that reuse water may be detected by olfaction, impair olfactory responses in fish receiving unavoidable exposures, and that exposure duration and season are important factors to consider regarding adverse effects.

Simulation of targeted pollutant-mitigation-strategies to reduce nitrate and sediment hotspots in agricultural watershed	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												About 50% of U.S. water pollution problems are caused by non-point source (NPS) pollution, primarily sediment and nutrients from agricultural areas, despite the widespread implementation of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs). However, the effectiveness of implementation strategies and type of BMPs at watershed scale are still not well understood. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) ecohydrological model was used to assess the effectiveness of pollutant mitigation strategies in the Raccoon River watershed (RRW) in west-central Iowa, USA. We analyzed fourteen management scenarios based on systematic combinations of five strategies: fertilizer/manure management, changing row-crop land to perennial grass, vegetative filter strips, cover crops and shallower tile drainage systems, specifically aimed at reducing nitrate and total suspended sediment yields from hotspot areas in the RRW. Moreover, we assessed implications of climate change on management practices, and the impacts of management practices on water availability, row crop yield, and total agricultural production. Our results indicate that sufficient reduction of nitrate load may require either implementation of multiple management practices (38.5% with current setup) or conversion of extensive areas into perennial grass (up to 49.7%) to meet and maintain the drinking water standard. However, climate change may undermine the effectiveness of management practices, especially late in the 21st century, cutting the reduction by up to 65% for nitrate andmore for sediment loads. Further, though our approach is targeted, it resulted in a slight decrease (similar to 5%) in watershed average crop yield and hence an overall reduction in total crop production, mainly due to the conversion of row-crop lands to perennial grass. Such yield reductions could be quite spatially heterogeneously distributed (0 to 40%). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The essence of NPS pollution is the transport of nutrients between soil and water. Traditional NPS pollution control strategies, however, are mainly based on the solid and liquid phases, with little focus on the bio-phase between water and soil. The pollutants produced from NPS can be regarded as a resource if recycled or reused in an appropriate way in the agricultural ecosystem. This mini review proposes novel strategies for NPS pollution control based on three phases (liquid, solid and bio-phase) and highlights the regulating services of an agricultural ecosystem by optimizing land use/cover types.

The role of baseflow in dissolved solids delivery to streams in the Upper Colorado River Basin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Salinity has a major effect on water users in the Colorado River Basin, estimated to cause almost $300million per year in economic damages. The Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Program implements and manages projects to reduce salinity loads, investing millions of dollars per year in irrigation upgrades, canal projects, and other mitigation strategies. To inform and improve mitigation efforts, there is a need to better understand sources of salinity to streams and how salinity has changed over time. This study explores salinity in the baseflow fraction of streamflow, assessing whether groundwater is a significant contributor of dissolved solids to streams in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). Chemical hydrograph separation was used to estimate baseflow discharge and baseflow dissolved solids loads at stream gages (n=69) across the UCRB. On average, it is estimated that 89% of dissolved solids loads originate from the baseflow fraction of streamflow, indicating that subsurface transport processes play a dominant role in delivering dissolved solids to streams in the UCRB. A statistical trend analysis using weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season was used to evaluate changes in baseflow dissolved solids loads in streams (n=27) from 1986 to 2011. Decreasing trends in baseflow dissolved solids loads were observed at 63% of streams. At the three most downstream sites, Green River at Green River, UT, Colorado River at Cisco, UT, and the San Juan River near Bluff, UT, baseflow dissolved solids loads decreased by a combined 823,000metrictons (mT), which is approximately 69% of projected basin-scale decreases in total dissolved solids loads as a result of salinity control efforts. Decreasing trends in baseflow dissolved solids loads suggest that salinity mitigation projects, landscape changes, and/or climate are reducing dissolved solids transported to streams through the subsurface. Notably, the pace and extent of decreases in baseflow dissolved solids loads declined during the most recent decade; average decreasing loads during the 2000s (28,200mT) were only 54% of average decreasing loads in the 1990s (51,700mT).

In addition to the visible colorimetric changes for the qualitative Cr identification, the A(630 nm/520) (nm) values changed linearly with Cr concentration over a range of 0.5-2.5 mu M and the detection limits reached 0.03 mu M and 0.07 mu M for Cr3+ and Cr2O72-, respectively, both of which satisfied the Cr water quality standards of the U.S. EPA, WHO and China. Furthermore, a more convenient method was developed for quantitative determination of Cr concentrations in practical samples based on the Eyedropper function in Microsoft's PowerPoint software, wherein the RGB (red, green and blue) value of the sample could be easily screened in the colorimetric card for a more accurate result with good recovery, avoiding complicated instrumentation.																	2040-3364	2040-3372				DEC 28	2017	9	48					19139	19144		10.1039/c7nr07761k								WOS:000418098000017	29184950

J	Kim, J; Lee, T; Seo, D				Kim, Jaeyoung; Lee, Tongeun; Seo, Dongil			Algal bloom prediction of the lower Han River, Korea using the EFDC hydrodynamic and water quality model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The lower part of the Han River, which flows through Seoul, Korea, experienced excessive toxic cyanobac-terial growth in 2015. Modeling of algal bloom occurrence patterns in the lower part of this river was performed using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) to understand algal dynamics and thus better develop management alternatives. For a 71 km long river section, 1175 horizontal 2-D grid elements were developed. This grid system was determined adequate, as the maximum values of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition and orthogonality deviation were 0.5 and 20.1, respectively. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was chosen as the primary indicator for the likelihood of algal blooms. Calibration and verification of EFDC were performed by comparing the model results to three years of field data collected from 2013 to 2015. Calibration accuracy was verified not only for physical variables, including the mean water level and temperature, but also for other water quality variables in various locations of the study area. To improve the prediction accuracy of Chl-a, three dominant groups of algae were considered: diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria. The optimum growth temperature ranges were selected based on field data for the study area. It was found necessary to apply different maximum growth rates for algal groups for the upstream and downstream regions of the study area to appropriately reflect field observations. This result indicates that more than three algal groups need to be included to improve Chl-a calibration accuracy for the study area, yet the current EFDC model can consider only up to three phy-toplankton groups. Although this problem could be overcome by assigning different maximum growth rates for different regions, it may be necessary to improve EFDC so that it can include more phytoplankton groups.

J	Freeman, LA; Ackleson, SG; Rhea, WJ				Freeman, Lauren A.; Ackleson, Steven G.; Rhea, William Joseph			Comparison of remote sensing algorithms for retrieval of suspended particulate matter concentration from reflectance in coastal waters	JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING												Suspended particulate matter (SPM) is a key environmental indicator for rivers, estuaries, and coastal waters, which can be calculated from remote sensing reflectance obtained by an airborne or satellite imager. Here, algorithms from prior studies are applied to a dataset of in-situ at surface hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, collected in three geographic regions representing different water types. These data show the optically inherent exponential nature of the relationship between reflectance and sediment concentration. However, linear models are also shown to provide a reasonable estimate of sediment concentration when utilized with care in similar conditions to those under which the algorithms were developed, particularly at lower SPM values (0 to 20 mg/L). Fifteen published SPM algorithms are tested, returning strong correlations of R-2 > 0.7, and in most cases, R-2 > 0.8. Very low SPM values show weaker correlation with algorithm calculated SPM that is not wavelength dependent. None of the tested algorithms performs well for high SPM values (> 30 mg/L), with most algorithms underestimating SPM. A shift toward a smaller number of simple exponential or linear models relating satellite remote sensing reflectance to suspended sediment concentration with regional consideration will greatly aid larger spatiotemporal studies of suspended sediment trends.

Organic amendments improve soil quality by increasing the load of essential nutrients and enhancing the productivity. Additionally, fresh water used for irrigation can affect soil quality of agricultural soils, mainly due to the presence of microbial contaminants and pathogens. In this study, we investigated how microbial communities in irrigation water might contribute to the microbial diversity and function of soil. Whole-metagenomic sequencing approaches were used to investigate the taxonomic and the functional profiles of microbial communities present in fresh water used for irrigation, and in soil from a vegetable crop, which received fertilization with organic compost made from animal carcasses. The taxonomic analysis revealed that the most abundant genera were Polynucleobacter (similar to 8% relative abundance) and Bacillus (similar to 10%) in fresh water and soil from the vegetable crop, respectively. Low abundance (0.38%) of cyanobacterial groups were identified. Based on functional gene prediction, denitrification appears to be an important process in the soil community analysed here. Conversely, genes for nitrogen fixation were abundant in freshwater, indicating that the N-fixation plays a crucial role in this particular ecosystem. Moreover, pathogenicity islands, antibiotic resistance and potential virulence related genes were identified in both samples, but no toxigenic genes were detected. This study provides a better understanding of the community structure of an area under strong agricultural activity with regular irrigation and fertilization with an organic compost made from animal carcasses.

The assessment results based on water quality index (WQI) showed that the water quality in Lake Poyang was generally "moderate", according to the classification of the surface water quality standard (GB3838-2002) in China, but a deteriorating trend was observed at the interannual scale. Seasonally, the water quality was best in summer and worst in winter. Easily treated parameters generally determined the WQI value in the assessment, especially total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), while toxic metals and other parameters in Lake Poyang were generally at low and safe levels for drinking water. Water level (WL) has a net positive effect on water quality in Lake Poyang through dilution of environmental parameters, which in practice means TN. Consequently, local management agencies should pay more attention to nutrient concentrations during the monitoring schedule, as well as during the low-water periods which manifest a relatively bad water quality state, especially with the prevailing low WL observed recently in Lake Poyang.																	2045-2322					DEC 21	2017	7								17999	10.1038/s41598-017-18285-y								WOS:000418562100039	29269834

Here we used the data produced by the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity program (CARICOMP), the longest, largest monitoring program in the wider Caribbean, to evidence local-scale (decreases in water quality) and global-scale (increases in temperature) stressors across the basin. Trend analyses showed that visibility decreased at 42% of the stations, indicating that local-scale chronic stressors are widespread. On the other hand, only 18% of the stations showed increases in water temperature that would be expected from global warming, partially reflecting the limits in detecting trends due to inherent natural variability of temperature data. Decreases in visibility were associated with increased human density. However, this link can be decoupled by environmental factors, with conditions that increase the flush of water, dampening the effects of human influence. Besides documenting environmental stressors throughout the basin, our results can be used to inform future monitoring programs, if the desire is to identify stations that provide early warning signals of anthropogenic impacts. All CARICOMP environmental data are now available, providing an invaluable baseline that can be used to strengthen research, conservation, and management of coastal ecosystems in the Caribbean basin.

Virus Transfer at the Skin-Liquid Interface	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Understanding virus transfer between liquid and skin is necessary to estimate transmission during water related activities. Here, we modeled virus transfer from liquid-to-skin and skin-to-liquid. We performed human subject studies using three bacteriophages as pathogenic virus surrogates: nonenveloped MS2 and Q beta and enveloped Phi 6. Our study shows that transfer from liquid-to-skin is describable by a single model based on (1) virus concentration and (2) volume of liquid remaining on skin. Contact times (0.1-30 min)) and virus species had little-to-no influence on virus transfer. Likewise, liquid conditions (pH 6-9, ionic strength 10-550 mM) had no influence on transfer as shown for MS2. The model: accounts for both, virus adsorbed onto the skin, and virus in the liquid retained on skin. In comparison, virus transfer from skin-to-liquid was influenced by the wetness of the skin and by liquid type (water, saliva). 90 +/- 19% of the virus inoculated on the skin are transferred to the water when the skin remains wet compared to 30 +/- 17% when the skin is dry. The transfer from skin-to-liquid was 41% higher when the recipient liquid was water as compared with saliva. This study quantifies virus transfer between liquid and skin and guides risk assessments of water-related activities.

Nontarget screening by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) offers the opportunity to comprehensively assess water treatment processes-by comparing the signal heights of all detectable compounds before and after treatment. Without preselection of known target compounds,, all accessible information is used to describe changes across processes and thus serves as.a measure for the treatment efficiency. In this study, we introduce a novel LC-HRMS data processing strategy for the reliable classification of signals based on the observed fold changes. An approach for filtering detected features was developed and, after parameter adjustment, validated for its recall and precision. As proof of concept, the fate of 411 target compounds in a 0:1,mu g/L standard mix was tracked throughout the data processing stages, where 406 targets were successfully recognized and retained during filtering. Potential pitfalls in signal classification were addressed. We found the recursive peak integration to-be a key point for the reliable classification of signal changes across a process. For evaluating the repeatability, a combinatorial approach was conducted to verify the consistency of the final outcome using technical replicates of influent and effluent samples taken from an ozonation process during drinking water treatment. The results showed sufficient repeatability and thus emphasized the applicability of nontarget screening for the assessment of water treatment processes. The developed data processing strategies may be transferred-to other research fields where sample comparisons are conducted.																	0003-2700	1520-6882				DEC 19	2017	89	24					13219	13226		10.1021/acs.analchem.7b03037								WOS:000418626300026

A diatom voucher flora from selected southeast rivers (USA)	PHYTOTAXA												This flora is intended to serve as an image voucher for samples analyzed for the U.S. Geological Survey Southeast Stream Quality Assessment (SESQA). The SESQA study included measurement of watershed and water quality parameters to determine the factors that have the greatest potential to alter biotic condition. Algal samples were collected at 108 sites in 2014, from streams representing gradients in chemical and physical alteration across the southeast region. More than 375 taxa were identified during analysis for species composition and abundance. This manuscript documents the flora with light micrographs of specimens representative of their morphologic range. We define "voucher flora" as images of specimens and the names applied to those specimens for a given project. Taxonomic vouchers from federal programs have generally not been made public, yet they are a salient element of a well-documented species dataset, particularly for long-term studies. This study is part of a broader effort to improve and encourage taxonomic consistency in federal, state and local programs by accessible identification resources and inter-lab comparisons.																	1179-3155	1179-3163				DEC 19	2017	332	2					101	140		10.11646/phytotaxa.332.2.1								WOS:000418149400001						
J	Abdelhamed, H; Lawrence, ML; Karsi, A				Abdelhamed, Hossam; Lawrence, Mark L.; Karsi, Attila			The Role of Edwardsiella ictaluri TonB Mutant in Edwardsiella ictaluri Virulence	FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY												Edwardsiella ictaluri is a Gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen that causes enteric septicemia in catfish (ESC). Stress factors including poor water quality, poor diet, rough handling, overcrowding, and water temperature fluctuations increase fish susceptibility to ESC. The TonB energy transducing system (TonB-ExbB-ExbD) and TonB-dependent transporters of Gram-negative bacteria support active transport of scarce resources including iron, an essential micronutrient for bacterial virulence. Deletion of the tonB gene attenuates virulence in several pathogenic bacteria. In the current study, the role of TonB (NT01EI_RS07425) in iron acquisition and E. ictaluri virulence were investigated. To accomplish this, the E. ictaluri tonB gene was in-frame deleted. Growth kinetics, iron utilization, and virulence of the Ei Delta tonB mutant were determined. Loss of TonB caused a significant reduction in bacterial growth in iron-depleted medium (p > 0.05). The Ei Delta tonB mutant grew similarly to wild-type E. ictaluri when ferric iron was added to the iron-depleted medium. The Ei Delta tonB mutant was significantly attenuated in catfish compared with the parent strain (21.69 vs. 46.91% mortality). Catfish surviving infection with Ei Delta tonB had significant protection against ESC compared with naive fish (100 vs. 40.47% survival). These findings indicate that TonB participates in pathogenesis of ESC and is an important E. ictaluri virulence factor.																	1664-042X					DEC 18	2017	8								1066	10.3389/fphys.2017.01066								WOS:000418163000001	29326601

Prediction of storm transfers and annual loads with data-based mechanistic models using high-frequency data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Excess nutrients in surface waters, such as phosphorus (P) from agriculture, result in poor water quality, with adverse effects on ecological health and costs for remediation. However, understanding and prediction of P transfers in catchments have been limited by inadequate data and over-parameterised models with high uncertainty. We show that, with high temporal resolution data, we are able to identify simple dynamic models that capture the P load dynamics in three contrasting agricultural catchments in the UK. For a flashy catchment, a linear, second-order (two pathways) model for discharge gave high simulation efficiencies for short-term storm sequences and was useful in highlighting uncertainties in out-of-bank flows. A model with non-linear rainfall input was appropriate for predicting seasonal or annual cumulative P loads where antecedent conditions affected the catchment response. For second-order models, the time constant for the fast pathway varied between 2 and 15 h for all three catchments and for both discharge and P, confirming that high temporal resolution data are necessary to capture the dynamic responses in small catchments (10-50 km(2)). The models led to a better understanding of the dominant nutrient transfer modes, which will be helpful in determining phosphorus transfers following changes in precipitation patterns in the future.

Determination of water quality in this study consisted of trophic status determination based on total phosphorus, total nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate), and water clarity. Data were obtained 4 times a year for 16 years (1999-2013). We determined the overall water quality status by comparing data with criteria specified in Ministerial Regulation (Permen) of the Environment Number 28 of 2009 on the Water Pollution Load Capacity of Lakes or Reservoirs. Data from 11 stations were analyzed, which indicated a hypertrophic state with very high pollution. Nanjung Post (upstream of the reservoir) had the highest levels of total P, total N, and chlorophyll a compared with the Muara Ciminyak Post and Muara Intake Post (the middle and downstream regions of the reservoir). Seasonal changes had no effect on the trophic status, regardless of dry, normal, or wet conditions.																	1178-6221					DEC 17	2017	10								UNSP 1178622117746660	10.1177/1178622117746660								WOS:000424043900001						
J	Duan, S; Huang, YM				Duan, Shuo; Huang, Yuming			Electrochemical sensor using NH2-MIL-88(Fe)-rGO composite for trace Cd2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ detection	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												A novel electrochemical sensor was developed for the sensitive and selective detection of Cu2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+, which was based on NH2-MIL-88(Fe)-rGO composite modified glass carbon electrode (NH2-MIL-88(Fe)-rGO/GCE). The NH2-MIL-88(Fe)-rGO composite was facilely prepared by a one-step method and characterized by SEM, XRD, Raman spectrum and electrochemical methods. The stepwise GCE modified process was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electrochemical behaviors of Cu2 +, Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions on the NH2-MIL-88(Fe)-rGO/GCE were explored by differential pulse anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). It was found that NH2-MIL-88(Fe)-rGO was capable of adsorbing Cu2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions from aqueous solutions and the NH2-MIL-88(Fe)-rGO/GCE could enhance the electrochemical responses of Cu2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+ effectively. Important operational parameters such as electrolyte pH and deposition time were investigated and optimized for the determination of trace Cu2+, Pb2+ and Cd2+ ions. Under the optimum conditions, the proposed electrochemical sensor had a linear range of 0.005-0.3 mu M for Cd2+, 0.01-0.3 mu M for Pb2+ and 0.005-0.05 mu M for Cu2+, respectively. The limits of detection (LODs) are 4.9 nM for Cd2+, 10 nM for Pb2+ and 3.6 nM for Cu2+, respectively. The proposed method has been successfully applied to determine three metal ions in water samples. The developed sensor promises simple preparation, fast operation, good sensitivity and excellent reusability, showing great potential for monitoring of water quality.																	1572-6657	1873-2569				DEC 15	2017	807						253	260		10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.11.051								WOS:000419414800032						
J	Pennesi, C; Danovaro, R				Pennesi, Chiara; Danovaro, Roberto			Assessing marine environmental status through microphytobenthos assemblages colonizing the Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) and their potential in coastal marine restoration	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Microphytobenthos is potentially highly sensitive to environmental alterations, but has been rarely utilized in monitoring studies. Here we investigated the use of microphytobenthos colonizing Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) to assess the marine environmental quality. We analysed microphytobenthic assemblages in terms of abundance, biomass and species composition on ARMS deployed in northern Adriatic Sea along a gradient of increasing impacts. We show that microphytobenthic variables changed significantly across sites, with lowest abundance and biodiversity in the highly impacted site. Moreover, the specific analysis of Diatoms revealed that genera like Entomoneis and Cylindrotheca could be used as indicators of nutrient enriched and stressed conditions. We provide evidence that the analysis of microphytobenthos colonizing artificial substrates could be used as a tool for detecting altered environmental characteristics. We also show that the ARMS, recreating hot spots of microphytobenthic biodiversity, and protect them from grazing, could be potentially utilized to restore degraded hard substrates. Our result indicates that microphytobenthos can be easily incorporated in future monitoring and restoration programmes to assess and improve marine environmental health.

Effects of suspended sediments and nutrient enrichment on juvenile corals	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Three to six-month-old juveniles of Acropora tennis, A. millepora and Pocillopora acute were experimentally co-exposed to nutrient enrichment and suspended sediments (without light attenuation or sediment deposition) for 40 days. Suspended sediments reduced survivorship of A. millepora strongly, proportional to the sediment concentration, but not in A. tennis or P. acuta juveniles. However, juvenile growth of the latter two species was reduced to less than half or to zero, respectively. Additionally, suspended sediments increased effective quantum yields of symbionts associated with A. millepora and A. tennis, but not those associated with P. acuta. Nutrient enrichment did not significantly affect juvenile survivorship, growth or photophysiology for any of the three species, either as a sole stressor or in combination with suspended sediments. Our results indicate that exposure to suspended sediments can be energetically costly for juveniles of some coral species, implying detrimental longer-term but species-specific repercussions for populations and coral cover.					de Beer, Dirk/0000-0001-5274-1781												0025-326X	1879-3363				DEC 15	2017	125	1-2					166	175		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.003								WOS:000418727000031

Fecal loading and factors predictive of fecal deposition also were assessed. After standardizing for beach area, daily beach use and fecal densities did not differ between beaches and yearly fecal loading estimates revealed that unrecovered dog feces likely contributes significantly to fecal contamination (1.4 and 0.2 metric tonnes/beach). Detection of feces was significantly associated with beach management type, transect position relative to mean low tideline, presence of beach wrack, distance to the nearest beach entrance, and season.

The surficial sediments were mainly composed of clayey silt and the TOC content in sediments decreased from the river to the shelf. The surficial sediments experienced Pb pollution; Cr only showed a certain level of pollution in the coastal area of the estuary but not in other areas, and Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd showed no pollution. The heavy metals mainly originated from natural weathering and erosion of rocks and soils in the catchment and enriched near the river mouth.

In this work water quality monitoring at different ports using a range of water quality evaluation indices was applied to assess the port water quality. Seawater samples at 30 stations in the year 2016-2017 from six ports in NSW, Australia, namely Port Jackson, Botany, Kembla, Newcastle, Yamba and Eden, were investigated to determine the physicochemical and biological variables that affect the port water quality. The large datasets obtained were designed to determine the Water Quality Index, Heavy metal Evaluation Index, Contamination Index and newly developed Environmental Water Quality Index. The study revealed medium water quality index and high and medium heavy metal evaluation index at three of the study ports and high contamination index in almost all study ports. Low level dissolved oxygen and higher level of total dissolved solids, turbidity, fecal coliforms, copper, iron, lead, zinc, manganese, cadmium and cobalt are mainly responsible for the poor water qualities of the port areas. Good water quality at the background samples indicated that various port activities are the likely cause for poor water quality inside the port area.

Hydrologic processes that govern stormwater infrastructure behaviour	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Using water budget data from published literature, we demonstrate how hydrologic processes govern the function of various stormwater infrastructure technologies. Hydrologic observations are displayed on a Water Budget Triangle, a ternary plot tool developed to visualize simplified water budgets, enabling side-by-side comparison of green and grey approaches to stormwater management. The tool indicates ranges of hydrologic function for green roofs, constructed wetlands, cisterns, bioretention, and other stormwater control management structures. Water budgets are plotted for several example systems to provide insight on structural and environmental design factors, and seasonal variation in hydrologic processes of stormwater management systems. Previously published water budgets and models are used to suggest appropriate operational standards for several green and grey stormwater control structures and compare between conventional and low-impact development approaches. We compare models, characterize and quantify water budgets and expected ranges for green and grey infrastructure systems, and demonstrate how the Water Budget Triangle tool may help users to develop a data-driven approach for understanding design and retrofit of green stormwater infrastructure.

Some studies showed that DES can be removed by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, However, no one has paid attention to the formation of oestrogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) and the persistence of DES in surface water remains a mystery. In this study, UV was found to be very effective in removing oestrogenic activity regardless of water quality. Three oestrogenic DBPs were specifically isolated by oestrogen receptor-based affinity chromatography and identified as 9,10-diethylphenanthrene-3,6-diol, cis-DES and Z,Z-dienestrol. Among them, 9,10-diethylphenanthrene-3,6-diol was proved to have stronger oestrogenic activity than E2, but it can be further photodegraded. In addition, DES was also demonstrated to be a photochromic compound, whose UV-induced intermediates can be transformed back to DES under sunlight, which significantly slows down the photodegradation of DES.

Legacy sediment, lead, and zinc storage in channel and floodplain deposits of the Big River, Old Lead Belt Mining District, Missouri, USA	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The Old Lead Belt of southeastern Missouri was one of the leading producers of Pb ore for more than a century (1869-1972). Large quantities of contaminated mine waste have been, and continue to be, supplied to local streams. This study assessed the magnitude and spatial distribution of mining-contaminated legacy sediment stored in channel and floodplain deposits of the Big River in the Ozark Highlands of southeastern Missouri. Although metal concentrations decline downstream from the mine sources, the channel and floodplain sediments are contaminated above background levels with Pb and Zn along its entire 171-km length below the mine sources. Mean concentrations in floodplain cores >2000 mg kg(-1) for Pb and >1000 mg kg(-1) for Zn extend 40-50 km downstream from the mining area in association with the supply of fine tailings particles that were easily dispersed downstream in the suspended load. Mean concentrations in channel bed and bar sediments ranging from 1400 to 1700 mg kg(-1) for Pb extend 30 km below the mines, while Zn concentrations of 1000-3000 mg kg(-1) extend 20 km downstream. Coarse dolomite fragments in the 2-16 mm channel sediment fraction provide significant storage of Pb and Zn, representing 13-20% of the bulk sediment storage mass in the channel and can contain concentrations of >4000 mg kg(-1) for Pb and >1000 mg kg(-1) for Zn. These coarse tailings have been transported a maximum distance of only about 30 km from the source over a period of 120 years for an average of about 250 m/y. About 37% of the Pb and 9% of the Zn that was originally released to the watershed in tailings wastes is still stored in the Big River. A total of similar to 157 million Mg of contaminated sediment is stored along the Big River, with 92% of it located in floodplain deposits that are typically contaminated to depths of 1.5-3.5 m. These contaminated sediments store a total of 188,549 Mg of Pb and 34,299 Mg of Zn, of which 98% of the Pb and 95% of the Zn are stored in floodplain deposits. Most of the metal mass in channel deposits is stored near the mines, with 72% of the Pb and 78% of the Zn occurring in the 25 km of channel proximal to the mine source. Although environmental assessments of streams contaminated by mines often focus on evaluating metal concentrations in the geochemically active fine sediment fractions, about 60% of the Pb stored in channels is associated with coarse dolomite tailings fragments deposited in channels within 25 km of the mines. The magnitude and basinwide distribution of Pb and Zn storage in legacy floodplain sediments ensures that remobilization by bank erosion will be a continuing problem for water quality far into the future.

Riverine discharges to Chesapeake Bay: Analysis of long-term (1927-2014) records and implications for future flows in the Chesapeake Bay basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The Chesapeake Bay (CB) basin is under a total maximum daily load (TMDL) mandate to reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment loads to the bay. Identifying shifts in the hydro-climatic regime may help explain observed trends in water quality. To identify potential shifts, hydrologic data (1927-2014) for 27 watersheds in the CB basin were analyzed to determine the relationships among long-term precipitation and stream discharge trends. The amount, frequency, and intensity of precipitation increased from 1910 to 1996 in the eastern U.S., with the observed increases greater in the northeastern U.S. than the southeastern U.S. The CB watershed spans the north-to-south gradient in precipitation increases, and hydrologic differences have been observed in watersheds north relative to watersheds south of the Pennsylvania Maryland (PA-MD) border. Time series of monthly mean precipitation data specific to each of 27 watersheds were derived from the Precipitation-elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) dataset, and monthly mean stream-discharge data were obtained from U.S. Geological Survey streamgage records. All annual precipitation trend slopes in the 18 watersheds north of the PA-MD border were greater than or equal to those of the nine south of that border. The magnitude of the trend slopes for 1927-2014 in both precipitation and discharge decreased in a north-to-south pattern. Distributions of the monthly precipitation and discharge datasets were assembled into percentiles for each year for each watershed. Multivariate correlation of precipitation and discharge within percentiles among the groups of northern and southern watersheds indicated only weak associations. Regional-scale average behaviors of trends in the distribution of precipitation and discharge annual percentiles differed between the northern and southern watersheds. In general, the linkage between precipitation and discharge was weak, with the linkage weaker in the northern watersheds compared to those in the south. On the basis of simple linear regression, 26 of the 27 watersheds are projected to have higher annual mean discharge in 2025, the target date for implementation of the TMDL for the CB basin.

In this study, selected EDCs were measured in water and sediments along two transboundary streams flowing from the Palestinian Authority (PA) into Israel (the Zomar-Alexander and Hebron-Beer Sheva Streams). We assessed how the complicated conflict situation between Israel and the PA and the absence of a coordinated strategy and joint stream management commission influence effective EDC control. Both streams receive raw Palestinian wastewater in their headwaters, which flows through rural areas and is treated via sediment settling facilities after crossing the 1949 Armistice Agreement Line. Four sampling campaigns were conducted over two years, with concentrations of selected EDCs measured in both the water and the sediments. Results show asymmetrical pollution profiles due to socio-economic differences and contrasting treatment capacities. No in-stream attenuation was observed along the stream and in the sediments within the Palestinian region. After sediment settling in treatment facilities at the Israeli border, however, significant reductions in the EDC concentrations were measured both in the sediments and in the water. Differences in sedimentation technologies had a substantial effect on EDC removal at the treatment location, positively affecting the streams' ability to further remove EDCs downstream. The prevailing approach to addressing the Israeli-Palestinian transboundary wastewater contamination reveals a narrow perspective among water managers who on occasion only take local interests into consideration, with interventions focused solely on improving stream water quality in isolated segments. Application of the "proximity principle" through the establishment of WWTPs at contamination sources constitutes a preferable strategy for reducing contamination by EDCs and other pollutants to ensure minimization of public health risks due to the pollution of streams and underlying potable groundwater.

Integrated treatment of acid mine drainage using BOF slag, lime/soda ash and reverse osmosis (RO): Implication for the production of drinking water	DESALINATION												Acid mine drainage has been an issue of prime concern to international scientific communities. This is due to the magnitude, nature and extent of its environmental impacts. Acid mine drainage (AMD) contains hazardous and toxic chemical species that require removal prior discharging mine water to different environmental compartments. A number of mine water treatment technologies have been developed but they were reported to contain certain benefits and drawbacks. However, there is a need to come-up with environmental friendly and zero liquid -discharge technologies. The purpose of this novel study was to produce drinking water and recover valuable minerals from acid mine drainage using an integration of Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) slag, lime, soda ash and Reverse Osmosis (RO) system. The process can produce very pure water and recover valuable minerals such as hematite, goethite, gypsum, and limestone. Furthermore, brine will be taken to free desalinator for further recovery of salts. To achieve the goals of this study, semi-pilot experiments were done in the laboratory using the aforementioned integrated approach. Interaction of BOF and AMD increased the pH of mine water to >= 8. > 99% metals and 75% sulphate were also removal using BOF slag. Residual sulphates and hardness were reduced using lime and soda ash respectively. Gypsum and brucite were recovered as valuable minerals in the lime reactor. Ca as hydrated lime and limestone were recovered in the soda ash reactor. The recovered minerals could be sold as valuable minerals to metallurgical houses and off-set the process/running cost. Reverse Osmosis (RO) was used to further clean the water to meet drinking water quality. A single pass RO system was simulated in Reverse Osmosis System Analysis (ROSA). The produced water meets the requirements of the South African National Standard (SANS) 241 Drinking Water Specifications. As such, it can be concluded that this integrated technology has shown that drinking water and valuable minerals can be recovered from AMD.

Historical developments in the understanding of acid sulfate soils	GEODERMA					8th International Acid Sulfate Soils Conference	JUL 17-23, 2016	Univ Maryland, College Park, MD	Int Union Soil Sci, Working Grp Acid Sulfate Soils	Univ Maryland			Literature about the historical and current recognition of kinds, names and classification for, overall processes (sulfidization and sulfuricization) that form and conditions that induce the formation of potential, active and post-active acid sulfate soils are reviewed to set the stage for papers presented elsewhere in this special issue of Geoderma that contains some of the papers presented at the Eighth International Acid Sulfate Soils Conference held at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA, July 17-23, 2016. Mention is made and examples cited of environmental problems such as AMD (acid mine drainage) and ARD (acid rock drainage), fish kills in waters receiving drainage from acid sulfate soils, even from ones considered post-active, and special land reclamation and management practices to produce crops on land disturbed (often deeply) by humans (including engineers poorly educated about acid sulfate soils) or by natural causes (sea level rise or fall, or extreme drought, such as the recent "Millennium Drought" in the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia. The global distribution of acid sulfate soils is considered, recognizing that post-active ones are extensive, with many likely currently unrecognized, although features in some of them, such as silcrete and ferricrete, likely owe their origin to acid sulfate weathering phenomena. Most coastal subaqueous soils are influenced by sulfidization and constitute sulfidic materials that if dredged and deposited in upland disposal areas become exposed to aerobic conditions and are likely to give rise to active acid sulfate soils with sulfuric horizons.

In Finland, AS soils are located mainly on the coast of the Baltic Sea, where rivers and estuaries suffer from acid leachates and waters do not meet with the criteria of good water quality set by the EU. Field drainage of cultivated AS soils is attributable to leaching of acidity, but regardless of various mitigation measures, the acidity of discharge water in these areas has not decreased significantly. In order to better understand the pathways involved in the formation of acidity, the redox status of 56 Finnish AS soil fields was examined using redox potential and pH data measured down to 2 m. The findings indicated that the oxidation of soils has occurred at depths below the drainage pipes, with the median being at a depth of 1.6 m. In fields cultivated for a long time, soil texture had a stronger effect on the depth of the redox interface than the drainage method; open ditch drainage and subsurface drainage; oxidation being faster in sandy and silty soils than in clayey soils. The isostatic land uplift also seems to affect the depth of the redox interface in the long run. Most of the studied fields had been cultivated for at least 30 years prior to the study. However, the pH values of the soils were still very low, probably due to actual and retained acidity. The prevention of oxidation of sulfidic materials in subsoils is important, but measures for neutralizing the acidity are needed. Without their it seems that the leaching of acidity will continue and may decrease only slowly. However, severe droughts during summers and the reclamation of unripe AS soils for any purpose will increase the leaching of acidity.

J	Skousen, J				Skousen, Jeff			A methodology for geologic testing for land disturbance: Acid-Base Accounting for surface mines	GEODERMA					8th International Acid Sulfate Soils Conference	JUL 17-23, 2016	Univ Maryland, College Park, MD	Int Union Soil Sci, Working Grp Acid Sulfate Soils	Univ Maryland			Acid mine drainage and acid sulfate soils are common consequences of disturbing earth materials containing pyrite and other sulfide-bearing minerals. in order to predict the acid-producing potential of geologic layers in eastern US coal mining regions, Acid-Base Accounting (ABA) was developed by researchers at West Virginia University. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the use of this method and its interpretation as a prediction tool, and to evaluate its accuracy from literature sources. ABA is an analytical procedure that provides an assessment of the acid-producing and acid-neutralizing potential of soils, sediments and rocks prior to coal mining, highway construction, and other large-scale earth-moving excavations. ABA includes techniques that measure the reactive sulfur content (which is converted to the acid-producing potential, Maximum Potential Acidity or MPA) and the reactive carbonate content (which is converted to acid-neutralizing potential, Neutralization Potential or NP). These two quantifiable properties in ABA are primarily used to predict the quality of drainage and soil quality by subtracting MPA from NP, resulting in a net NP value (either positive or negative). If the MPA value is higher for the sample (negative net NP), the rock sample is predicted to produce acidic drainage upon weathering and leaching. If the number for NP is higher (positive net NP), the rock is predicted to produce alkaline drainage. Other parameters such as rock type, color and paste pH help to refine the interpretation and prediction of net NP. After passage of laws requiring an assessment of surface mining on water quality, ABA became the preferred method to predict post-mining water quality, and permit decisions for surface mines are largely based on the net NP values of ABA. With this information, mining plans are developed which may include mixing overburden materials during mining and reclamation or removing acid-producing materials from the site, selective handling of these materials and placing in specific areas within the backfill, and amending these acid materials with alkaline material. ABA has proven to be a good tool to predict overburden quality that allows the application of prevention procedures to alleviate post-mining water and soil quality problems. Studies comparing the post-mining water quality with predictions made by ABA have confirmed the utility of ABA for permit decisions, pre-mine planning and reclamation practices.																	0016-7061	1872-6259				DEC 15	2017	308						302	311		10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.07.038								WOS:000413282100029						
J	Widyatmanti, W; Sammut, J				Widyatmanti, Wirastuti; Sammut, Jesmond			y Hydro-geomorphic controls on the development and distribution of acid sulfate soils in Central Java, Indonesia	GEODERMA					8th International Acid Sulfate Soils Conference	JUL 17-23, 2016	Univ Maryland, College Park, MD	Int Union Soil Sci, Working Grp Acid Sulfate Soils	Univ Maryland			Coastal planning policies and regulations in Indonesia have not adequately considered acid sulfate soils (ASS) as a constraint on development. Aquaculture is often undertaken in unsuitable areas, and fish and shrimp culture systems, in particular, fail after a short period of production because of the impacts of ASS on pond water quality and, subsequently, on fish and shrimp health. This study describes a mapping approach based on an understanding of the hydro-geomorphic controls on the formation and the distribution of ASS in Central Java, Indonesia. The underlying approach was to identify associations between ASS development and distribution within estuarine hydro-geomorphological units (HGUs). This study utilized a multi-level methodology involving multi-resolution, remotely-sensed data and GIS analysis, coupled with field and laboratory-based data, to obtain hydro-geomorphic and soil information at different mapping scales. An estuary classification scheme for Central Java identified river, tide and wave-dominated estuaries as the dominant estuary types. HGUs were identified in each estuary type to define the relationships between landform development processes and pyrite concentration in soil layers. Thirty-nine HGUs were classified based on landforms, marine and fluvial hydrology, geomorphic processes, land use, and vegetation types. Field and laboratory assessment of soil properties were undertaken to identify the horizontal distribution of ASS in the HGUS and its vertical character in soil profiles. In contrast to previous studies, the results showed that estuaries located in low-energy environments on the north coast have low (< 0.1%) pyrite concentrations in 90% of their HGUs. Decades-old intensive aquaculture and dredging activities, that led to repeated oxidation and leaching, were identified as factors for low pyrite "concentrations. On the south coast, the combination of a high river and marine energy environment created scattered landforms with soils that have very high (4-9%) pyrite concentrations. These ASS-bearing HGUs mostly developed in low energy estuarine environments overlying former high river energy environments. The information generated for each HGU facilitated the development of an ASS mapping model that incorporates knowledge on the relationship between soil and landform formation in Central Java estuaries. Knowing where ASS occur is essential to minimize the risk of environment degradation. Using multi-resolution, remotely sensed data decreases cost and labour, compared to more traditional mapping approaches, especially to identify sampling sites for field surveys. The resulting maps and mapping methods will improve land capability assessment for brackishwater aquaculture and other coastal land use in Indonesia.																	0016-7061	1872-6259				DEC 15	2017	308						321	332		10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.08.024								WOS:000413282100031

This study investigates the discharge of PAHs present in the untreated wastewater of vehicle-wash stations (VWS) located in district Peshawar, Pakistan. The data obtained was being novel with the detection of 16 USEPA PAHs (both individuals and total) and compared with earlier studies and international standards. The Sigma 16PAHs in wastewater from light vehicle-wash stations (LVWS) and heavy vehicle-wash stations (HVWS) ranged from 245-429 mu g/l and 9571582 mu g/l, respectively. A significant difference (p < 0.01) was observed in PAHs discharged from LVWS and HVWS. The projected Sigma 16PAHs discharge from both HVWS (92% of total generated PAHs) and LVWS (8%) was about 5109.9 g per annum. According to PAH diagnostic ratios, PAHs were both petrogenic (chrysene/benz(a) anthracene, low molecular weight/high molecular weight) and pyrogenic (phenanthrene/anthracene, fluoranthene/pyrene, fluoranthene/fluoranthene + pyrene) in origin. The highest toxic equivalent quotient (TEQ) value was shown by benzo(a) pyrene (21.6 mu g/l) followed by dibenz(ah) anthracene (9.81 mu g/l) in wastewater from HVWS. However, in LVWS the case was reversed with highest value (7.54 mu g/l) for dibenz(ah) anthracene followed by benzo(a) pyrene (3.54 mu g/l). The lowest TEQ value was indicated for phenanthrene (0.007 mu g/l) in wastewater of LVWS, while pyrene showed the lowest value (0.007 mu g/l) in wastewater of HVWS. The results indicated that VWS contribute significant amount of PAHs each year, which is of great concern regarding water quality, ecological and human health risk. This is the first systematic and comprehensive research related with generation of PAHs load per day, week, month and annum from VWS, their source apportionment and health effects in Pakistan.

Spatial prediction of water quality variables along a main river channel, in presence of pollution hotspots	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In order to treat and evaluate the available data of water quality and fully exploit monitoring results (e.g. characterize regional patterns, optimize monitoring networks, infer conditions at unmonitored locations, etc.), it is crucial to develop improved and efficientmethodologies. Accordingly, estimation ofwater quality along fluvial ecosystems is a frequent task in environment studies. In this work, a particular case of this problem is examined, namely, the estimation of water quality along a main stem of a large basin (wheremost anthropic activity takes place), fromobservational data measured along this river channel. We adapted topological kriging to this case, where eachwatershed contains all the watersheds of the upstreamobserved data ("nested support effect"). Data analysis was additionally extended by taking into account the upstream distance to the closest contamination hotspot as an external drift. We propose choosing the best estimationmethod by cross- validation. Themethodological approach in spatial variability modeling may be used for optimizing the water quality monitoring of a given watercourse. The methodology presented is applied to 28 water quality variables measured along the Santiago River inWestern Mexico. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Souter, L; Watmough, SA				Souter, Laura; Watmough, Shaun A.			Geochemistry and toxicity of a large slag pile and its drainage complex in Sudbury, Ontario	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Slag piles from mining activities are common worldwide, but in contrast to mine tailings the environmental impact of runoff from slag piles is less documented. This study was designed to assess the geochemistry and potential toxicity of water draining a large, 62.2 ha slag pile in Sudbury, Ontario. The Coniston slag pile contains 1220 Mt of slag from smelting local Ni-Cu ore between 1913 and 1972. Slag leaching experiments confirmed slag is a source of sulphate (SO4), heavy metals (including Fe, Al, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Mn) and base cations (Ca, K, Mg, Na). Concentrations of some metals draining through slag in column experiments were similar to concentrations measured at the base of the slag pile, although base cations, SO4 and pH were much higher, possibly because of water inputs interacting with the surrounding basic glaciolacustrine landscape. The high pH rapidly precipitates metals, leading to high accumulations in surface sediments in the pond-wetland complex draining from the pile. Away from the pile's base, vegetation cover increases, which increases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nutrient concentrations in runoff along with metals with strong binding affinities (e.g. Cu). Total metal concentration in water and sediment exceed provincial guidelines, particularly near the slag pile, however WHAM7 modeling indicated the free metal ion concentration in water is very low. Nevertheless, 48-h toxicity experiments showed that water with greater concentrations of solutes collected close to the slag negatively impacts D. magna, suggesting water draining the slag pile can adversely impact biota in nearby drainage areas.

Because organic additives can affect the approval test, the additive selected, and its use and validation should be included in the test report. This study assessed the effects of organic carbon additives on the concentration of total residual oxidants (TROs) and the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in test water containing additives varied depending on the type of additive, but all additives, except for methylcellulose, had concentrations similar to or higher than the theoretical values. There was a low concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) compared to the amount of corn starch added. Over the course of the five-day holding time, TRO concentrations tended to decrease. In general, substances with a large molecular size had a higher DBP concentration than their counterparts with a smaller molecular size, some of which, however produced the highest DBP concentrations due to their molecular structure. The results suggest that the formation of DBPs is affected by the reaction with TROs, molecular size, and molecular structure in a complex manner. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Robinson, HK; Hasenmueller, EA				Robinson, Heather K.; Hasenmueller, Elizabeth A.			Transport of road salt contamination in karst aquifers and soils over multiple timescales	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Road deicing has caused widespread environmental Na+ and Cl- release for decades, yet the transport and retention of these contaminants in karst aquifers and soils are poorly understood. We examined the transport dynamics of Na+ and Cl- from road salt in shallow groundwater during flooding and over seasonal timescales by intensively monitoring an urban and a rural karst spring over approximately 2 years. Furthermore, we used a 20-year dataset for the rural spring to determine how salt retention affected long-term geochemical trends in the shallowgroundwater. Salt transport was governed by hydrologic pathways through karst aquifers: during winter and early spring floods, flow through preferential pathways rapidly transported salty meltwater or stormwater over hours to days, while the remaining salt-contaminated water moved diffusely through the rock matrix on timescales of months to years. Flood hydrograph separations revealed that event water constituted 61.2% of stormflow on average at the urban spring, leading to more extreme variability in salt concentrations during flooding and throughout the year. This variability indicates that baseflow contributions to urban streams overlying karst aquifers with preferential flowpaths are likely less effective at buffering salt concentrations. In contrast, salt concentrations were less variable in the baseflow-dominated rural spring (28.7% event water). Furthermore, salt was episodically released from soils to shallow groundwater throughout the year during first flush events. A Cl- mass balance indicates that Cl- applied during previous winters persists within the springs' recharge basins for more than a year, raising baseline concentrations as road salt is introduced faster than it can be flushed from the basin. Inter-annual salt retention by soils or slow groundwater movement likely caused significant Cl- and specific conductivity (SpC) increases at the rural spring from 1996 to 2016.

The approach involves several pioneering modelling aspects: the inclusion of current management practices; an innovative calibration and validation methodology of streamflow and water quality; a sequential calibration starting from crop yields, followed by streamflow and nutrients; and the use of concentrations instead of loads in the calibration. The approach was applied in the Danube River Basin (800,000 km(2)), the second largest river basin in Europe, that is under great nutrients pressure. The model was successfully calibrated and validated at multiple gauged stations for the period 1995-2009. About 70% and 61% of monthly streamflow stations reached satisfactory performances in the calibration and validation datasets respectively. N-NO3 monthly concentrations were in good agreement with the observations, albeit SWAT could not represent accurately the spatial variability of the denitrification process. TN and TP concentrations were also well captured. Yet, local discrepancies were detected across the Basin. Baseflow and surface runoff were the main pathways of water pollution. The main sinks of TN and TP diffuse emissions were plant uptake which captured 58% of TN and 92% of TP sources, then soil retention (35% of TN and 2% of TP), riparian filter strips (2% both for TN and TP) and river retention (2% of TN and 4% of TP). Nitrates in the aquifer were estimated to be around 3% of TN sources. New reliable "state-of-the-art" knowledge of water and nutrients fluxes in the Danube Basin were thus provided to be used for assessing the impact of best management practices and for providing support to the implementation of the European Environmental Directives.

F.; Jin, Baoshi; Bastviken, David; Tan, Lishan; Tong, Chuan			Dynamics of dissolved nutrients in the aquaculture shrimp ponds of the Min River estuary, China: Concentrations, fluxes and environmental loads	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Dissolved inorganic nutrients (NO2--N, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and PO43--P) play a critical role in the effective management ofwater quality and prevention of fish and shrimp diseases in aquaculture systems. In this study, dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations in the water column and sediment porewater, and the fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI) were investigated in three intensive shrimp ponds with zero water exchange to examine nutrient cycling during the different growth stages of shrimps. Distinct changes in the dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations in both the water column and sediment porewater were observed among the three growth stages. Average NO2--N, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and PO43--P concentrations in the sediment porewater were 3.53, 2.81, 29.68, and 6.44 times higher, respectively, than those in the water column over the study period, indicating that the pond sediment acted as a net source of nutrients to the water column. This was further supported by the net release of nutrients from the sediments to the water column observed during the incubation experiment. Nutrient fluxes were dominated by NH4+-N, while NOx--N (NO2--N and NO3--N) and PO43--P fluxes remained low. The high rates of NH4+-N release from the sediment highlight the need of taking into account the biogeochemical role of sediments in mitigating the problem of water quality degradation in coastal shrimp ponds. Based on a total water surface area of mariculture ponds and a total mariculture production of 2.57 x 10(6) ha and 2.30 x 10(9) kg, respectively, we estimated conservatively that approximately 4.77 x 10(4) tons of total nitrogen and 3.75 x 10(3) tons of total phosphorus are being discharged annually from the mariculture ponds into the adjacent coastal zones across China. Results demonstrated the importance of aquaculture pond effluent as amajor contributor ofwater pollution in the coastal areas of China, and called for actions to properly treat these effluents in alleviating the eutrophication problem in the Chinese coastal zones.

J	Wang, WH; Chen, M; Guo, LD; Wang, WX				Wang, Wenhao; Chen, Min; Guo, Laodong; Wang, Wen-Xiong			Size partitioning and mixing behavior of trace metals and dissolved organic matter in a South China estuary	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Jiulong River estuary, located in the southeastern China, suffered from metal pollution due to industrial effluent releases. Mixing of effluent and estuarine water may have significantly affected the size distribution of trace metals and their environmental fate. In the present study, colloidal size distribution of organic matter and selected metals were quantified using asymmetric flow field-flowfractionation (AF4) and ICP-MS. We demonstrated a dominance of dissolved metals in the 1-10 kDa fraction, and metals such as Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Pb, Cd and Mn were mostly regulated by terrestrial fulvic acid. The larger inorganic colloids played a limited role, although Fe reduction was likely to affect the size partitioning of colloidal Mn. The holding pond represented a source of trace metals and chromophoric and humic-like dissolved organic matter to the estuary. Scavenging or removal behavior became evident following the intermittent mixing, and the small sized colloidal organic complexes were responsible for binding and stabilizing trace metals. Variations in particle size distributions indicated different sources, fates and geochemical controls of the metals. Our results highlighted the impacts of both natural and anthropogenic processes on the transformation of trace metals among phases in this dynamic estuary system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Land use affects total dissolved nitrogen and nitrate concentrations in tropical montane streams in Kenya	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												African tropical montane forests are facing fast and dynamic changes in land use. However, the impacts of these changes on stream water quality are understudied. This paper aims at assessing the effect of land use and physical catchment characteristics on stream water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate (NO3-N) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the Mau Forest, the largest tropical montane forest in Kenya. We conducted five synoptic stream water sampling campaigns at the outlets of 13-16 catchments dominated by either natural forest, smallholder agriculture or commercial tea and tree plantations. Our data show a strong effect of land use on TDN and NO3-N, with highest concentrations in stream water of catchments dominated by tea plantations (1.80 +/- 0.50 and 1.62 +/- 0.60 mg N l(-1), respectively), and lowest values in forested catchments (0.55 +/- 0.15 and 0.30 +/- 0.08 mg N l(-1), respectively). NO3-N concentration increased with stream temperature and specific discharge, but decreased with increasing catchment area. DOC concentrations increased with catchment area and precipitation and decreased with specific discharge, drainage density and topographic wetness index. Precipitation and specific discharge were also strong predictors for DON concentrations, with an additional small positive effect of tree cover. In summary, land use affects TDN and NO3-N concentrations in stream water in the Mau Forest region in Kenya, while DOC and DON were more related to hydrologic regimes and catchment properties. The importance of land use for NO3-N and TDN concentrations emphasizes the risk of increased nitrogen export along hydrological pathways caused by intensified land use and conversion of land to agricultural uses, which might result in deterioration of drinking water quality and eutrophication in surface water in tropical Africa.

Predicting improved optical water quality in rivers resulting from soil conservation actions on land	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Deforestation in New Zealand has led to increased soil erosion and sediment loads in rivers. Increased suspended fine sediment in water reduces visual clarity for humans and aquatic animals and reduces penetration of photosynthetically available radiation to aquatic plants. To mitigate fine-sediment impacts in rivers, catchment-wide approaches to reducing soil erosion are required. Targeting soil conservation for reducing sediment loads in rivers is possible through existing models; however, relationships between sediment loads and sediment-related attributes of water that affect both ecology and human uses of water are poorly understood. We present methods for relating sediment loads to sediment concentration, visual clarity, and euphotic depth. The methods require upwards of twenty concurrent samples of sediment concentration, visual clarity, and euphotic depth at a river site where discharge is measured continuously. The sediment-related attributes are related to sediment concentration through regressions. When sediment loads are reduced by soil conservation action, percentiles of sediment concentration are necessarily reduced, and the corresponding percentiles of visual clarity and euphotic depth are increased. The approach is demonstrated on theWairua River in the Northland region of New Zealand. For this river we show that visual clarity would increase relatively by approximately 1.4 times the relative reduction of sediment load. Median visual clarity would increase from 0.75m to 1.25m( making the river more often suitable for swimming) after a sediment load reduction of 50% associated with widespread soil conservation on pastoral land. Likewise euphotic depth would increase relatively by approximately 0.7 times the relative reduction of sediment load, and the median euphotic depth would increase from 1.5 m to 2.0 m with a 50% sediment load reduction.

Combined effects of water stress and pollution on macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages in a Mediterranean intermittent river	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Water stress is a key stressor in Mediterranean intermittent rivers exacerbating the negative effects of other stressors, such as pollutants, with multiple effects on different river biota. The current study aimed to determine the response of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages to instream habitat and water chemistry, at the microhabitat scale and at different levels of water stress and pollution, in an intermittent Mediterranean river. Sampling was conducted at high and low summer discharge, at two consecutive years, and included four reaches that were targeted for their different levels of water stress and pollution. Overall, the macroinvertebrate fauna of Evrotas River indicated high resilience to intermittency, however, variation in community structure and composition occurred under acute water stress, due to habitat alteration and change in water physico-chemistry, i.e. water temperature increase. The combined effects of pollution and high water stress had, however, pronounced effects on species richness, abundance and community structure in the pollution impacted reach, where pollution sensitive taxa were almost extirpated. Fish response to drought, in reaches free of pollution, consisted of an increase in the abundance of the two small limnophilic species, coupled with their shift to faster flowing riffle habitats, and a reduction in the abundance of the larger, rheophilic species. In the pollution impacted reach, however, the combination of pollution and high water stress led to hypoxic conditions assumed to be the leading cause of the almost complete elimination of the fish assemblage. In contrast, the perennial Evrotas reaches with relatively stable physicochemical conditions, though affected hydrologically by drought, appear to function as refugia for fish during high water stress. When comparing the response of the two biotic groups to combined acute water stress and pollution, it is evident that macroinvertebrates were negatively impacted, but fish were virtually eliminated under the two combined stressors.

The objectives of the study are (1) assess the present status and spatial distribution of the nitrate contamination (2) identify and distinguish themost likely sources of nitrate, (3) identify the relationship between H-3 and NO3- and F-, and (4) ascertain the potential human risk from exposure to nitrate contamination. The results showed that, nitrate concentrations varied from 0.42 to 431.17, 0.83 to 143.94, 0.03 to 28.94 mg/l with mean values of 36.09, 21.54 and 5.01 mg/l for boreholes, hand dug wells and the surface water respectively. These values showed that, about 95% of boreholes and hand dugwells and 45% of the surface water have nitrate concentration above the baseline value in the area. The NO3-/Cl- ratio showed that, 98.4%, 95% and 64% of the NO3- in the borehole, hand dugwells and the surfacewater are fromanthropogenic activities. The delta N-15, delta O-18-NO3 and H-3- data confirmed that NO3- in the samples was predominantly derived from manure (human and animal waste) and denitrification occurring in some areas. The isotopic data further affirms the hydro- chemical interpretation that, chemical fertilizer and atmospheric deposition are unlikely sources of NO3 in the area. The relationship between H-3 andNO(3)(-) concentrations showed that, higher NO3- values are associated with younger waters.

The monitoring data of water quality in a long-term(19902013) from Dianchi Lake confirmed the increase trend of COD concentration in the lake since 2007. The similarities and differences in the DOC components between the lake and its sources and the contribution from allochthonous and autochthonous DOC to the total DOC in this lake were determined to elucidate the reason of COD increase based on C/N atomic ratios, stable isotope abundance of carbon and nitrogen, UV-visible spectroscopy, three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3DEEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The terrigenous organic matter showed humic-like fluorescence, and the autochthonous organicmatter showed tryptophan-like components. Agricultural runoff (9.5%), leaf litter (7.5%) and urban runoff (13.2%) were themain sources of DOC in the lake. Sewage tail was a major source of organic materials, 3DEEM for the indicates that sewage tail DOC composition did not change markedly over the biodegradation period, indicating that sewage tail contains a high load of DOC that is resistant to further biodegradation and subsequently accumulates in the lake. The change of land use in the catchment and the increase of sewage tail load into the lake are the key factors for the increase in COD concentration in Dianchi Lake. Thus, the lake should be protected by controlling the pollution from the urban nonpoint sources and refractory composition in point sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Vitro, KA; BenDor, TK; Jordanova, TV; Miles, B				Vitro, Kristen A.; BenDor, Todd K.; Jordanova, Tania V.; Miles, Brian			A geospatial analysis of land use and stormwater management on fecal coliform contamination in North Carolina streams	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Although non-point source (NPS) pathogen pollution is a leading cause of stream impairment in the United States, the sources of NPS pollution are often difficult to ascertain. While previous studies have employed land use regression methods to develop a greater understanding of the sources and dynamics of microbial NPS pollution, little work has explicitly considered the effects of local, state, and federal stormwater management policies on water quality across multiple watersheds or at larger spatial scales. How do land use and stormwater management efforts collectively influence fecal coliform (FC) levels at a regional or multiple-watershed scale? We construct a unique spatial regression model of stream FC pollution (n = 327 monitoring stations) throughout the state of North Carolina (USA), incorporating both land cover and urban development variables. We then use a subset of our data (n(bmp) = 80 monitoring stations) to incorporate local stormwater control measures and stormwater management policies. Results demonstrate that the inclusion of policy and management variables improves the explanatory capacity for FC levels (R-2 = 0.4412 versus R-2 = 0.5323). Locally, this model can be used to better target stream restoration and water quality mitigation actions and investments, as well as help to predict FC levels at unmonitored locations throughout North Carolina's stream network. More generally, the novel structure of this model can also help examine the large-scale effects of stormwater regulations on surface water pathogen levels, helping researchers and planners better predict water quality in the absence of extensive monitoring station data.

J	Shupe, SM				Shupe, Scott M.			High resolution stream water quality assessment in the Vancouver, British Columbia region: a citizen science study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Changing land cover and climate regimes modify water quantity and quality in natural stream systems. In regions undergoing rapid change, it is difficult to effectively monitor and quantify these impacts at local to regional scales. In Vancouver, British Columbia, one of the most rapidly urbanizing areas in Canada, 750 measurements were taken from a total of 81 unique sampling sites representing 49 streams located in urban, forest, and agricultural-dominant watersheds at a frequency of up to 12 times per year between 2013 and 2016. Dissolved nitrate (NO3N) and phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations, turbidity, water temperature, pH and conductivity were measured by citizen scientists in addition to observations of hydrology, vegetation, land use, and visible stream impacts. Land cover was mapped at a 15-mresolution using Landsat 8 OLI imagery and used to determine dominant land cover for each watershed in which a sample was recorded. Regional, seasonal, and catchment-type trends in measurements were determined using statistical analyses. The relationships of nutrients to land cover varied seasonally and on a catchment-type basis. Nitrate showed seasonal highs in winter and lows in summer, though phosphate had less seasonal variation. Overall, nitrate concentrations were positively associated to agriculture and deciduous forest and negatively associated with coniferous forest. In contrast, phosphate concentrations were positively associated with agricultural, deciduous forest, and disturbed land cover and negatively associated with urban land cover. Both urban and agricultural land cover were significantly associated with an increase in water conductivity. Increased forest land cover was associated with better water quality, including lower turbidity, conductivity, and water temperature. This study showed the importance of high resolution sampling in understanding seasonal and spatial dynamics of stream water quality, made possible with the large number of measurements taken with the help of trained volunteers. The results underscore the value of citizen science in freshwater research. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A facility location model for municipal solid waste management system under uncertain environment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In municipal solid waste management system, decision makers have to develop an insight into the processes namely, waste generation, collection, transportation, processing, and disposal methods. Many parameters (e.g., waste generation rate, functioning costs of facilities, transportation cost, and revenues) in this system are associated with uncertainties. Often, these uncertainties of parameters need to be modeled under a situation of data scarcity for generating probability distribution function or membership function for stochastic mathematical programming or fuzzy mathematical programming respectively, with only information of extreme variations. Moreover, if uncertainties are ignored, then the problems like insufficient capacities of waste management facilities or improper utilization of available funds may be raised. To tackle uncertainties of these parameters in a more efficient manner an algorithm, based on interval analysis, has been developed. This algorithm is applied to find optimal solutions for a facility location model, which is formulated to select economically best locations of transfer stations in a hypothetical urban center. Transfer stations are an integral part of contemporary municipal solid waste management systems, and economic siting of transfer stations ensures financial sustainability of this system. The model is written in a mathematical programming language AMPL with KNITRO as a solver. The developed model selects five economically best locations out of ten potential locations with an optimum overall cost of [394,836, 757,440] Rs.(1) / day ([5906, 11,331] USD/day) approximately. Further, the requirement of uncertainty modeling is explained based on the results of sensitivity analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Additionally, these fluxes are seldom measured, hindering critical evaluation of model output. Analysis of the Canadian Small Lake Model (CSLM), a one-dimensional integral lake model, was performed to assess its ability to reproduce diurnal and seasonal variations in heat fluxes and the sensitivity of simulated fluxes to changes in model parameters, i.e., turbulent transport parameters and the light extinction coefficient (K-d). A C++ open-source software package, Problem Solving environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design Exploration (PSUADE), was used to perform sensitivity analysis (SA) and identify the parameters that dominate model behavior. The generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) was applied to quantify the fluxes' uncertainty, comparing daily-averaged eddy-covariance observations to the output of CSLM. Seven qualitative and two quantitative SA methods were tested, and the posterior likelihoods of the modeled parameters, obtained from the GLUE analysis, were used to determine the dominant parameters and the uncertainty in the modeled fluxes. Despite the ubiquity of the equifinality issue - different parameter-value combinations yielding equivalent results-the answer to the question was unequivocal: K-d, a measure of how much light penetrates the lake, dominates sensible and latent heat fluxes, and the uncertainty in their estimates is strongly related to the accuracy with which K-d is determined. This is important since accurate and continuous measurements of K-d could reduce modeling uncertainty.																	1027-5606	1607-7938				DEC 14	2017	21	12					6345	6362		10.5194/hess-21-6345-2017								WOS:000417943600002

In recent years, studies have increasingly focused on the relevance of sub-lethal effects of environmental contaminants. Sub-lethal toxicity endpoints such as behavioural responses are highly integrative and have distinct benefits for assessing water quality because they occur rapidly and thus can be used to sense the presence of toxicants. Our work describes a Lab-on-a-Chip system for the automated analysis of freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna locomotory responses to water-born toxicants. The design combines a Lab-on-a-Chip system for Daphnia sp. culture under perfusion with time-resolved videomicroscopy and software tracking locomotory activity of multiple specimens. The application of the system to analyse the swimming behaviour of water fleas exposed to different concentrations of water-born toxicants demonstrated that Lab-on-a-Chip devices can become important research tools for behavioural ecotoxicology and water quality biomonitoring.																	2045-2322					DEC 14	2017	7								17603	10.1038/s41598-017-17892-z								WOS:000417902200018

However, these wetland ecosystems are dependent on local climate and hydrology, and are therefore at risk due to climate and land use change. This study develops site-specific empirical hydrologic models for five forested wetlands with different characteristics by analyzing long-term observed meteorological and hydrological data. These wetlands represent typical cypress ponds/swamps, Carolina bays, pine flatwoods, drained pocosins, and natural bottomland hardwood ecosystems. The validated empirical models are then applied at each wetland to predict future water table changes using climate projections from 20 general circulation models (GCMs) participating in Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. We show that combined future changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration would significantly alter wetland hydrology including groundwater dynamics by the end of the 21st century. Compared to the historical period, all five wetlands are predicted to become drier over time. The mean water table depth is predicted to drop by 4 to 22 cm in response to the decrease in water availability (i.e., precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) by the year 2100.

J	Jasechko, S; Perrone, D				Jasechko, Scott; Perrone, Debra			Hydraulic fracturing near domestic groundwater wells	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Hydraulic fracturing operations are generating considerable discussion about their potential to contaminate aquifers tapped by domestic groundwater wells. Groundwater wells located closer to hydraulically fractured wells are more likely to be exposed to contaminants derived from on-site spills and well-bore failures, should they occur. Nevertheless, the proximity of hydraulic fracturing operations to domestic groundwater wells is unknown. Here, we analyze the distance between domestic groundwater wells (public and self-supply) constructed between 2000 and 2014 and hydraulically fractured wells stimulated in 2014 in 14 states. We show that 37% of all recorded hydraulically fractured wells stimulated during 2014 exist within 2 km of at least one recently constructed (2000-2014) domestic groundwater well. Furthermore, we identify 11 counties where most (> 50%) recorded domestic groundwater wells exist within 2 km of one or more hydraulically fractured wells stimulated during 2014. Our findings suggest that understanding how frequently hydraulic fracturing operations impact groundwater quality is of widespread importance to drinking water safety in many areas where hydraulic fracturing is common. We also identify 236 counties where most recorded domestic groundwater wells exist within 2 km of one or more recorded oil and gas wells producing during 2014. Our analysis identifies hotspots where both conventional and unconventional oil and gas wells frequently exist near recorded domestic groundwater wells that may be targeted for further water-quality monitoring.																	0027-8424					DEC 12	2017	114	50					13138	13143		10.1073/pnas.1701682114								WOS:000417806200049	29180405

On one hand, bacteria present in the untreated water may help in its purification through biodegradation of the contaminants. On the other hand, some bacteria may be human pathogens and pose a threat to consumers. The present study investigated bacterial communities using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and their functions were predicted using PICRUSt in a treatment system, including the biofilms on sand filters and biological activated carbon (BAC) filters, in 4 months. In addition, quantitative analyses of specific bacterial populations were performed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The bacterial community composition of post-ozonation effluent, BAC effluent and disinfected water varied with sampling time. However, the bacterial community structures at other treatment steps were relatively stable, despite great variations of source water quality, resulting in stable treatment performance. Illumina MiSeq sequencing illustrated that Proteobacteria was dominant bacterial phylum. Chlorine disinfection significantly influenced the microbial community structure, while other treatment processes were synergetic. Bacterial communities in water and biofilms were distinct, and distinctions of bacterial communities also existed between different biofilms. By contrast, the functional composition of biofilms on different filters were similar. Some functional genes related to pollutant degradation were found widely distributed throughout the treatment processes. The distributions of Mycobacterium spp. and Legionella spp. in water and biofilms were revealed by realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Most bacteria, including potential pathogens, could be effectively removed by chlorine disinfection. However, some bacteria presented great resistance to chlorine. qPCRs showed that Mycobacterium spp. could not be effectively removed by chlorine. These resistant bacteria and, especially potential pathogens should receive more attention. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that turbidity, ammonia nitrogen and total organic carbon (TOG) exerted significant effects on community profiles. Overall, this study provides insight into variations of microbial communities in the treatment processes and aids the optimization of drinking water treatment plant design and operation for public health.																	1664-302X					DEC 12	2017	8								2465	10.3389/fmicb.2017.02465								WOS:000417699500001	29312177

Aerial Herbicide Spray to Control Invasive Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes): Water Quality Concerns Fronting Fish Occupying a Tropical Floodplain Wetland	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is an aquatic weed degrading tropical floodplains everywhere. On the Burdekin flood-plain, northern Australia, it is widespread and contributes to poor water quality, specifically hypoxia which contributes to voluminous wetland fish kills each summer. Removing weeds have focused on applying herbicides using aerial spraying, though restoration success is not monitored. Here, we investigated four aerial spray applications scheduled between November 2013 (Year 1, November 2013 to November 2014) and November 2015 (Year 2, November 2014 to November 2015) in Lochinvah wetland (35 ha wetland, Burdekin floodplain). Using high-frequency (20 min) loggers, dissolved oxygen (DO%) was tracked, which revealed that concentrations were similar before and several weeks after a spray application (independent t test, p > 0.01, except spray application 2, p = 0.06). More interestingly, aquatic weed coverage was low (5% of wetland) during Year 1 and DO had a typical diurnal cycle (20% to 130%). In contrast, low wetland flushing in Year 2 and high weed coverage (80% coverage) combined to increase DO hypoxia exposure risks for fish, with nearly 100% of the logging time failing acute and chronic values known for local fish. The Year 2 weed cover also increased water temperature exposure risk (twofold increase), which was unexpected and which means that fish probably could access cool, deeper, water refugia more frequently compared with Year 1. Controlling aquatic weeds using aerial spraying seems to have minimal risk for fish when cover is low; however, the proliferation of aquatic weeds and spraying has deleterious impact on available oxygen for fish.																	1940-0829					DEC 11	2017	10						1	10		10.1177/1940082917741592								WOS:000422705700001

Response of water temperatures and stratification to changing climate in three lakes with different morphometry	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Water temperatures and stratification are important drivers for ecological and water quality processes within lake systems, and changes in these with increases in air temperature and changes to wind speeds may have significant ecological consequences. To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (19112014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes.

This study aims to evaluated methods for assessing water quality, water availability, emptying of sanitation facilities, menstrual hygiene management and the acceptability of water quality testing in households which are key to monitoring SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2 on drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and emerging issues. Methods As part of a MICS field test, we interviewed 429 households and 267 women age 15-49 in Stann Creek, Belize in a split-sample experiment. In a concurrent qualitative component, we conducted focus groups with interviewers and cognitive interviews with respondents during and immediately following questionnaire administration in the field to explore their question comprehension and response processes. Findings About 88% of respondents agreed to water quality testing but also desired test results, given the potential implications for their own health. Escherichia coli was present in 36% of drinking water collected at the source, and in 47% of samples consumed in the household. Both questions on water availability necessitated probing by interviewers. About one quarter of households reported emptying of pit latrines and septic tanks, though one-quarter could not provide an answer to the question. Asking questions on menstrual hygiene was acceptable to respondents, but required some clarification and probing. Conclusions In the context of Belize, this study confirmed the feasibility of collecting information on the availability and quality of drinking water, emptying of sanitation facilities and menstrual hygiene in a multi-purpose household survey, indicating specific areas to improve question formulation and field protocols. Improvements have been incorporated into the latest round of MICS surveys which will be a major source of national data for monitoring of SDG targets for drinking water, sanitation and hygiene and emerging issues for WASH sector programming.																	1932-6203					DEC 7	2017	12	12							e0189089	10.1371/journal.pone.0189089								WOS:000417337800069	29216244

Here, we present a proof-of-concept study of a "lab in the field" called the "River Lab" (RL), based on the idea of permanently installing a suite of laboratory instruments in the field next to a river. Housed in a small shed, this set of instruments performs analyses at a frequency of one every 40 min for major dissolved species (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- )through continuous sampling and filtration of the river water using automated ion chromatographs. The RL was deployed in the Orgeval Critical Zone Observatory, France for over a year of continuous analyses. Results show that the RL is able to capture long-term fine chemical variations with no drift and a precision significantly better than conventionally achieved in the laboratory (up to +/- 0.5% for all major species for over a day and up to 1.7% over 2 months). The RL is able to capture the abrupt changes in dissolved species concentrations during a typical 6-day rain event, as well as daily oscillations during a hydrological low-flow period of summer drought. Using the measured signals as a benchmark, we numerically assess the effects of a lower sampling frequency (typical of conventional field sampling campaigns) and of a lower precision (typically reached in the laboratory) on the hydrochemical signal. The highresolution, high-precision measurements made possible by the RL open new perspectives for understanding critical zone hydro-bio-geochemical cycles. Finally, the RL also offers a solution for management agencies to monitor water quality in quasi-real time.

Recent developments in sensing methods for eutrophying nutrients with a focus on automation for environmental applications	ANALYST												The demand for autonomous sensors for unattended, continuous nutrient monitoring in water is rapidly growing with the increasing need for more frequent and widespread environmental pollution monitoring. Legislative bodies, local authorities and industries all require frequent water quality monitoring, however, this is time and labour intensive, and an expensive undertaking. Autonomous sensors allow for frequent, unattended data collection. While this solves the time and labour intensive aspects of water monitoring, sensors can be very expensive. Development of low-cost sensors is essential to realise the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). However there is much work yet to be done in this field. This article reviews current literature on the research and development efforts towards deployable autonomous sensors for phosphorus (in the form of phosphate) and nitrogen (in the form of nitrate), with a focus on analytical performance and cost considerations. Additionally, some recent sensing approaches that could be automated in the future are included, along with an overview of approaches to monitoring both nutrients. These approaches are compared with standard laboratory methods and also with commercially available sensors for both phosphate and nitrate. Application of nutrient sensors in agriculture is discussed as an example of how sensor networks can provide improvements in decision making.					regan, fiona/0000-0002-8273-9970												0003-2654	1364-5528				DEC 7	2017	142	23					4355	4372		10.1039/c7an00840f								WOS:000415866200002	28765839

The Effect of the 2015 Earthquake on the Bacterial Community Compositions in Water in Nepal	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												We conducted a study to examine the effect of seasonal variations and the disruptive effects of the 2015 Nepal earthquake on microbial communities associated with drinking water sources. We first characterized the microbial communities of water samples in two Nepali regions (Kathmandu and Jhapa) to understand the stability of microbial communities in water samples collected in 2014. We analyzed additional water samples from the same sources collected from May to August 2015, allowing the comparison of samples from dry-to-dry season and from dry-to-monsoon seasons. Emphasis was placed on microbes responsible for maintaining the geobiochemical characteristics of water (e.g., ammonia-oxidizing and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria) and opportunistic pathogens often found in water (Acinetobacter). When examining samples from Jhapa, we identified that most geobiochemical microbe populations remained similar. When examining samples from Kathmandu, the abundance of microbial genera responsible for maintaining the geobiochemical characteristics of water increased immediately after the earthquake and decreased 8 months later (December 2015). In addition, microbial source tracking was used to monitor human fecal contamination and revealed deteriorated water quality in some specific sampling sites in Kathmandu post-earthquake. This study highlights a disruption of the environmental microbiome after an earthquake and the restoration of these microbial communities as a function of time and sanitation practices.																	1664-302X					DEC 6	2017	8								2380	10.3389/fmicb.2017.02380								WOS:000417141300001	29270153

To this end, the present study investigates the complementarity of a citizen science programme to agency monitoring of water quality. The Environment Agency (EA) is the governmental public body responsible for, among other duties, managing and monitoring water quality and water resources in England. FreshWater Watch (FWW) is a global citizen science project that supports community monitoring of freshwater quality. FWW and EA data were assessed for their spatio-temporal complementarity by comparing the geographical and seasonal coverage of nitrate (N-NO3) sampling across the River Thames catchment by the respective campaigns between spring 2013 and winter 2015. The analysis reveals that FWW citizen science-collected data complements EA data by filling in both gaps in the spatial and temporal coverage as well as gaps in waterbody type and size. In addition, partial spatio-temporal overlap in sampling efforts by the two actors is discovered, but EA sampling is found to be more consistent than FWW sampling. Statistical analyses indicate that regardless of broader geographical overlap in sampling effort, FWW sampling sites are associated with a lower stream order and water bodies of smaller surface areas than EA sampling sites. FWW also samples more still-water body sites than the EA. As a possible result of such differences in sampling tendencies, nitrate concentrations, a measure of water quality, are lower for FWW sites than EA sites. These findings strongly indicate that citizen science has clear potential to complement agency monitoring efforts by generating information on freshwater ecosystems that would otherwise be under reported.

Fluorescence and Quenching Assessment (EEM-PARAFAC) of de Facto Potable Reuse in the Neuse River, North Carolina, United States	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The Neuse River, North Carolina, U.S., exemplifies a typical de facto potable reuse scenario, where drinking water sources are located downstream of treated wastewater effluent discharges. The study results imply that planned potable water reuse, whether in an indirect or direct potable reuse scenario, might provide better control over water quality than the status quo conditions. Using fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) measurements, anthropo-genic influence of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) discharge was observed in samples near the location of drinking water treatment plant (WTP) intakes, eight or more miles downstream of the WWTP, implying that anthropogenic compounds were not fully removed or degraded by natural processes in this reach of the river. PARAllel FACtor (PARAFAC) analysis supported a two-component model of humic-like and nonhumic-like dissolved organic matter (DOM). A nonmodeled anthropogenic feature was also indicated. Significantly, the quenched fluorescence of humic-like DOM (static and/or dynamic quenching) by nonhumic-like DOM-previously demonstrated for probe molecules but first reported here in a natural/anthropogenic-influenced system-offers exciting insight into studies of humic/nonhumic interactions with important implications for pollutant fate and transport, sensing applications, and water treatment. A molecular spectroscopic explanation for dual fluorescing peaks in amino acids and humic substances is postulated.

Recreating the shading effects of ship wake induced turbidity to test acclimation responses in the seagrass Thalassia hemprichii	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Elevated sediment delivery and resuspension in coastal waters from human activities such as shipping can have detrimental effects on seagrass health by limiting light penetration. Managing seagrasses requires knowledge of their light acclamatory abilities so guidelines for coastal activities (e.g. ship movements) that influence sediment dynamics can be created. Guidelines typically focus on ensuring that seagrasses are able to meet their minimal light requirements (MLR). MLRs can be achieved by different light regimes, but it remains unknown whether a chronically low yet stable light regime is less or more detrimental than a highly variable regime with periods of extreme low to no light. To test this, we compared the physiological and morphological responses of Thalassia hemprichii among three light regimes: an open control (30-40% ambient light), a shaded control with (11-15% ambient light), and a fluctuating shade (4-30% ambient light). The MLR for the T. hemprichii we studied was lower (4-10% ambient light) than previous reports (mean = 18%) illustrating enhanced light acclimation in Singapore's chronically turbid waters. Seagrass shoots in the shaded control, however, exhibited significantly more morphological stress symptoms, with reduced shoot growth and lower below ground biomass. These data suggest that for seagrass exposed to periods of acute light stress, energetic costs associated with photo-acclimation to more variable light regimes can be offset If the plant can meet its daily light requirements during periods of high light. Management of seagrass beds should incorporate regular light monitoring and move towards an adaptive feedback-based approach to ensure the long-term viability of these vulnerable ecosystems.

Umbrellas can work under water: Using threatened species as indicator and management surrogates can improve coastal conservation	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Species surrogates, the use of particular species to index habitat condition or to represent ecological assemblages are commonly identified in many ecosystems, but are less tested, and therefore less employed in estuaries. Estuaries provide important ecosystem goods (e.g. harvestable species) and services (e.g. carbon processing, coastal armouring), but require protection from multiple human activities, meaning that finding surrogates for estuarine condition or faunal assemblages is a significant knowledge gap. In this study, we test the efficacy of the threatened estuary ray Hemitrygon fluviorum, as a suitable indicator of ecosystem condition and management umbrella surrogate species for conservation prioritisation and monitoring purposes within estuaries. We surveyed fish assemblages and ray presence at ten sites within each of 22 estuaries in southeast Queensland, Australia, using one hour deployments of baited video arrays. We then tested for correlations between ray presence, a series of environmental variables considered important to ecosystem management within estuaries (i.e. testing rays as indicator species), and the co-occurring fish species (i.e. testing rays as umbrella species). Estuary rays function as both umbrella species and ecological indicators of habitat status in subtropical Australian estuaries. As umbrellas, ray occurrence concords with elevated species richness. As ecological indicators, ray distribution concords with habitats of good water quality (especially low turbidity) and more natural vegetation remaining in the catchment. These results highlight the potential for other threatened aquatic vertebrates that are both readily detectable and that are reliable proxies for ecosystems status to be become useful management tools in estuaries. The protection of such large, threatened species in coastal seascapes allows managers to address multiple targets for conservation, especially; (1) protecting species of conservation concern; (2) maintaining diversity; and (3) protecting optimal habitats by better placing reserves.

Using the agricultural environment to select better surrogates for foodborne pathogens associated with fresh produce	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY												Despite continuing efforts to reduce foodborne pathogen contamination of fresh produce, significant outbreaks continue to occur. Identification of appropriate surrogates for foodborne pathogens facilitates relevant research to identify reservoirs and amplifiers of these contaminants in production and processing environments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify environmental Escherichia coli isolates from manures (poultry, swine and dairy) and surface water sources with properties similar to those of the produce associated foodborne pathogens E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium. The most similar environmental E. coli isolates were from poultry (n = 3) and surface water (n = 1) sources. The best environmental E. coll surrogates had cell surface characteristics (zeta potential, hydrophobicity and exopolysaccharide composition) that were similar (i.e., within 15%) to those of S. Typhimurium and/or formed biofilms more often when grown in low nutrient media prepared from lettuce lysates (24%) than when grown on high nutrient broth (7%). The rate of attachment of environmental isolates to lettuce leaves was also similar to that of S. Typhimurium. In contrast, E. coli O157:H7, a commonly used E. coli quality control strain and swine isolates behaved similarly; all were in the lowest 10% of isolates for biofilm formation and leaf attachment. These data suggest that the environment may provide a valuable resource for selection of surrogates for foodborne pathogens.																	0168-1605	1879-3460				DEC 4	2017	262						80	88		10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2017.09.017								WOS:000414886100012	28968533

Water quality assessment in a Caribbean saltwater wetland	INGENIERIA UC												The La Bocaina Lagoon is a saltwater wetland of the Caribbean Sea, it is located in the San Esteban National Park, its hydrographic space is divided into two zones: coastal and deep, located in the Bay of Patanemo, place of great tourist affluence. The lagoon has presented notorious physical changes in its waters, as a result of the misuse and management of the man of said resource. The goal was to evaluate the water quality with the purpose of providing a physicochemical and microbiological support to the National Institute of Parks. Physicochemical and microbiological parameters were determined. When comparing this results obtained with the permissible limits established in the current legal regulations, it was found that the dissolved oxygen, the sedimentable solids, total coliforms and fats, oils and hydrocarbons are outside the permissible ranges. Later, the percentage estimation of the water quality index of the lagoon was carried out, with the purpose of defining its current condition in terms of quality, the evaluation of the impact of the lagoon.																	1316-6832					DEC	2017	24	3					417	427										WOS:000434998300016

For this purpose, the water quality index, WQI, is determined by measuring the following parameters: pH, temperature, turbidity, fecal coliforms, dissolved oxygen, total phosphates and suspended solids, calculating the index and determining the water quality. The results indicate that, during the sampling period, before entering the city, the two bodies of water have a WQI above 80 (the range is between 0 (worst) and 100 (best)) indicating that it is good quality water and can be used for human consumption, but when passing through the city, the index decreases rapidly (to below 50 in some cases), which indicates that its quality is between bad and moderate. It is proposed to continue the study on the quality of these and the other two rivers that pass through the city, that the competent government agencies implement an environmental education campaign within the community, and eventually construct a wastewater treatment plant.																	1316-6832					DEC	2017	24	3					428	432										WOS:000434998300017

Monitoring water quality and quantity is essential as the groundwater is the most important drinkable and agricultural water source in Iran. Traditional groundwater evaluation methods are expensive and time consuming. Newly developed spatial interpolation method is an accurate and non-expensive method which needs fewer samples comparing to tradition methods. The main goal of this study is to choose the best spatial interpolation methods from geostatistical and deterministic interpolation for zoning (locating) of some water quality parameters in Najafabad plain. Several Spatial methods such as. were applied to study TDS, SAR, pH, cl and hco3. The accuracy and efficiency of studied methods were evaluated applying RMSE and MBE. Results showed that simple kiriging is suitable for zoning cl, hco3, TDS and Ec, IDW is more suitable for pH and ordinary kiriging is best method for zoning SAR. Finally the best spatial interpolation method was applied to develop quality parameter zoning maps.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				DEC	2017	3	4					1441	1448		10.1007/s40808-017-0355-3								WOS:000432245800017

Seven (7) water samples were collected which consist of three (3) hand dug wells and four (4) from different river locations beside the dumpsite. Ten (10) soil samples were collected at B horizon in and away from the dumpsite at a random interval. Ten (10) vertical electrical resistivity (VES) stations were established using schlumberger configuration with half-current electrode spacing that ranged from 1 to 150 m while dipole-dipole profiling was carried-out along four (4) profiles. The physico-chemical result shows that the total dissolved solid (TDS) of the three well samples ranges between 785 and 21,600 mg/L. While the TDS for the river samples was between 2030 and 2050 mg/L, both the upper and lower limit of the TDS were above the Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ 2007) and World Health Organization (WHO 2008) maximum permissible standard. The electrical conductivity (EC) of both well and river samples ranges from 1200 to 3650 mu/cm and 34,200 to 34,350 mu/cm respectively was also above the maximum permissible standard. The elemental concentration of Pb, Fe, Cd and K in the soil samples located within the dumpsite are higher than those of the control point which indicate pollution. The VES interpreted result delineated three subsurface layers comprising, the topsoil, weathered layer and fresh basement. While the dipole-dipole results shows that the topsoil and weathered layer has been virtually merged with characteristic low resistivity of <5 Om, which is attributed to leachate infiltration in and around the zones of the dumpsite. The extent of leachate migration was estimated to be >25 m. The leachate seeped to the bottom in vertical motion as seen in the dumpsite. This could be as a result of the relative permeability of the overburden, possible linear features and the downward sloping of the bedrock topography towards the dumpsite. At the southern part of the dumpsite, the leachate is inferred to migrate laterally, which could imply that the neighboring rocks are relatively porous and permeable. This migration is considered slow because there was no trace of contamination 200 m away from the dumpsite. It could be concluded that the soil and water in the vicinity of the investigated dumpsite has been polluted.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				DEC	2017	3	4					1543	1555		10.1007/s40808-017-0381-1								WOS:000432245800025

The tourism industry increased very fast, followed by the increasing of the hotels and the development of infrastructure. Walkthrough survey showed that most of the hotels which are located in the coastal area along the east south, south, and south west of Denpasar city, use the ground water through deep wells to support the daily operational. Excessive exploitation of water resources through deep wells a long the coastal area can lead the seawater intrusion. Therefore, it is needed to assess and evaluate the water capacity and quality of deep wells in Denpasar regency. Pumping test was done on 15 deep wells spreading in four areas, north, east, south, and west of Denpasar with 70 m to 200 m of debt. The result showed that 5 point of wells (33%) was in a good design and development (well loss value <0.5); 2 points (13.4%) suffered minor damage (well loss value between 0.5-1); 5 points (33.33%) suffered heavy damage with some blockage (well loss values between 1-4). The rest of 3 points was experienced heavy damaged and difficult to be restored (well loss values >4). Optimum discharge (0 opt.) between 11.16 to 100.8 m(3)/hour or 3.1 to 28.00 Itr/sec (moderate to high potential aquifer) with efficiency values between 50.80%-94.50%. Meanwhile, the results of water quality testing on all 15 points of wells indicate that some parameters of the water quality were from threshold limit. In conclusion, the capacity of aquifer in Denpasar City still in the medium-large category; however the quality of the water needs serious attention to minimize the effect on health and environment.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				DEC	2017	23	12					12161	12167		10.1166/asl.2017.10593								WOS:000431770900111

Considering the size of Madura's waters, adequate spatial and temporal accuracies, the usage of satellite image data is the right technique. One of the significant parameters of water quality is chlorophyll-a (beside TSS and CDOM), so that observation of the concentration of the parameter in water area is important. In this study, we used in situ data, i.e., concentrations of chlorophyll-a and spectra (resampled base on Landsat 8 channel) recorded in Madura's waters to build a model algorithm, which connects reflectance and chlorophyll-a. Next, atmospherically corrected reflectance of Landsat 8 data was used to map the spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a using the model algorithm which had been formulated. The research result shows that the average concentration of chlorophyll-a in satellite images and in situ is 1,197-1,171, so it is concluded that the waters of Madura Strait has high chlorophyll-a content because it is in the range of 1-1,5 mg/L.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				DEC	2017	23	12					12333	12335		10.1166/asl.2017.10633								WOS:000431770900151

Hence, it is important to develop an eco-friendly and cost effective technology to treat the tannery effluent wastewater. Our present investigation on integrated approach of electrochemical oxidation (EO) of tannery effluent (TE) using RuO2-IrO2-TiO2 anode and titanium mesh electrode as cathode and followed by the biodegradation process (BP) of the treated EO effluent. Various parameters viz., sodium chloride concentration (NaCl) (1-5 g/L) and current density (10-30 mA/cm(2) ) are optimized. The agro waste peanut hull (PH) and rice hull (RH) are utilized as carbon source for biodegradation of tannery effluent. A maximum of 87% decolorization is observed at 5 g/L of NaCl concentration and 30 mA/cm(2) of current density after 135 min of EO treatment. The EO treated TE is further treated by BP with Pseudomonas stutzeri MN1, Acinetobacter baumannii MN3 and mixed consortia of MN1 and MN3. The 97% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 96% of Cr(VI) reduction was observed after 72 h of BP with mixed consortia and rice hull as carbon source. Thus, the integrated approach of EO with BP can be implied for complete a decolorization and degradation of tannery effluent.																	2214-7144					DEC	2017	20						22	28		10.1016/j.jwpe.2017.09.008								WOS:000431411700003

This paper aims to quantify P loss from tilled soils under different rainfall patterns in a Phaeozems-dominated agricultural watershed. Eleven rainfall events were monitored at three experimental sites growing corns with conventional till, conservational till, and no-till during a growing season from July to August in 2013. Mean event mean concentration of dissolved phosphorus was 0.130, 0.213 and 0.614 mg L-1 and mean particulate phosphorus transfer rate was 103.502, 33.359 and 27.127 g ha(-1) hr(-1), respectively for three tillage practices. Results showed that less tillage practices could significantly reduce sediment runoff and PP loss, accompanied with a moderate reduction of runoff yield. While the proportion of PP has been cut down, the proportion of DP could account for the majority. Hydrological factors, including antecedent soil moisture and rainfall variables, could exert various effects on DP, PP and sediment losses under different tillage conditions. Further, the results of this study imply that the soil P loss management and water quality protection in black soil region of Northeast China should take consideration of diverse effects of tillage on phosphorus loss and the dynamics of P between different forms.																	1064-2293	1556-195X				DEC	2017	50	12					1494	1505		10.1134/S1064229317130075								WOS:000426253400016

Hydrology and water quality of isolated wetlands: Stormflow changes along two episodic flowpaths	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												The Dougherty Plain in southwest Georgia is a flat, karstic, depressional-landscape dominated by irrigated and dry-land agriculture devoted to row-crops and pasture with interspersed wetlands and forests. Stormwater runoff rarely discharges into perennial rivers and streams, except during large storms that induce hydrologic connectivity between fields, wetlands, and streams (event return period is less than one per year). We report the hydrologic and water-quality effects of a 173-mm rainfall event that generated three weeks (Feb 15 to Mar 9, 2014) of continuous flows through and between three normally isolated wetlands. A suite of water-quality parameters (physical, nutrients, and pathogen indicators) was monitored daily from offsite (agricultural) and onsite (forested) sources at two sites along one flowpath and five sites along a second at the Joseph W Jones Ecologic Research Center at Ichauway. Decreasing sediment, nutrient, and pathogen concentrations were observed as water moved across the forested landscapes with embedded wetlands. Two physical parameters (specific conductance and turbidity) were strongly-to-moderately correlated (r > 0.8, 0.5, respectively) with laboratory-measured parameters (e.g., nutrients, suspended solids, pathogens), which suggest their utility for routine stormwater monitoring and prioritizing sample collection for laboratory analyses at this site.																	2214-5818					DEC	2017	14						23	36		10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.10.001								WOS:000426118300003

Study focus: Groundwaters have been sampled along a transect. Based on environmental tracers (REEs, Br, B, delta B-11, Sr, Sr-87/Sr-86) aquifer vulnerability and sustainability issues are identified. New hydrological insights for the region: For sites near to aquifer outcrop, REE and Sr signatures (and relatively light delta C-13) trace possible vertical recharge from flood basalts directly overlying the GAS. This highlights aquifer vulnerability where confined by fewer basalts and/or having cross-cutting fractures. C-14 activities for these waters, however, suggest the impact of this recharge is significantly delayed in reaching the GAS. Anthropogenic sources for boron are not currently encountered; delta B-11 highlights feldspar dissolution, isotopically lighter signatures in the deepest sampled GAS waters resulting from pH/hydrochemical speciation changes down-gradient. Br/Cl signatures (and heavier delta O-18, delta H-2) in these latter samples appear to reflect a past climatic signature emplaced under more arid conditions; carbon isotope systematics (delta C-13, C-14) support that these represent fossil waters, and care must be taken in their water resources management in regard to sustainability of abstraction. delta O-18, delta S-34 (sulfate) signatures confirm hydrological arguments that waters leak out of the base of the GAS aquifer in this locality rather than underlying formations with poorer water quality potentially mixing in, although other deep GAS waters in the region do show this inter-aquifer mixing.																	2214-5818					DEC	2017	14						130	149		10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.10.006								WOS:000426118300010

Potable water security assessment - a review on monitoring, modelling and optimization techniques, applied to water distribution networks	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The paper tries to investigate some of the most important issues that need to be addressed to provide an integrated system for potable water security, in developed countries. It can be understood that in developing countries both supplied water quantity and quality are important for water security. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, "water security is defined as prevention and protection against contamination and terrorism." Water quality safeguarding has been addressed by many researchers during the last decades trying to define ways to ensure water of proper quality for the public. As unexpected contamination events may occur in water distribution systems, early warning systems providing the water managers with enough time to act effectively need to be developed. These systems should include interconnected: (a) monitoring tools to monitor in real time at least the most crucial water quality characteristics; (b) modelling tools to simulate the transport of any harmful contaminant and calculate the variations of its concentration; and (c) optimization tools to define the optimal locations and density of the monitoring sensors and disinfection stations. The drinking water supply system addressed in this paper consists of the supply system after the water treatment plant and until the consumers' taps, with special emphasis on the water distribution system. Drinking water security is addressed in cases other than normal operating conditions. Specifically, the paper examines contamination phenomena due to operational failures (e.g., during the disinfection process), natural disasters, pollution accidents and malicious actions. Contamination phenomena due to other factors, such as lead contamination are not included in this paper. It reviews the literature on monitoring, modelling and optimization techniques used in water distribution systems while at the same time proposes an integrated approach consisting of risk assessment methods and the use of "simheuristics" to deal with drinking water security.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC	2017	99						18	26		10.5004/dwt.2017.21784								WOS:000425242300004

Development of a novel two-stage powdered activated carbon-dynamic membrane filtration (PAC-DMF) system for direct physicochemical wastewater treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Due to the issues of high energy consumption, high carbon emissions, and low resource and energy recovery, there is an urgent need to develop new paradigms for simultaneous wastewater treatment and resource utilization using physicochemical processes rather than conventional biological means. Recently, direct membrane filtration of municipal wastewater using ultrafiltration/microfiltration technology was proposed and showed satisfactory performance, with high membrane costs and fast membrane fouling as the main limitations. In this study, a novel two-stage powdered activated carbon-dynamic membrane filtration (PAC-DMF) system was developed using PAC as a carrier to enhance DM formation and organic pollutant retention. The particle size and dosage of PAC, strategy for operating the continuous reactor in the first stage, and selection of the PAC particle size in the second stage were investigated. The effluent from the first stage was found to have a stable water quality, with turbidity in the range of 50-70 NTU. Efficient retention of organic materials was also achieved with a retention rate of 74%-82%, and the COD content in the concentrate was above 3,000 mg/L in the cycle filtration experiment. In the second stage, further enhancement of water quality and organics retention were observed, as evidenced by the low effluent COD (<70 mg/L) and turbidity (5-20 NTU). Meanwhile, the effluent that was rich in nitrogen and phosphorus was suitable for agricultural irrigation or gardening. The results indicated that the developed two-stage PAC-DMF system could be a highly promising alternative to the conventional wastewater treatment process.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC	2017	99						299	308		10.5004/dwt.2017.21750								WOS:000425242300038

Economic development has led to negative impacts on the environment and the health of populations. Several methods have been developed to limit the concentrations and a load of effluents in the natural environment. Lakes, reservoirs and closed bays are particularly sensitive to contaminant inputs. Their hydrodynamics promote sedimentation and lead to slow mixing of the effluent in the medium. In this context, the present study was concerned with the environmental objectives of discharges (EOD) of the Protuil manufacturing (metal production) in a salted and protected area of the Fetzara Lake. This method permits the calculation of concentrations and loads of contaminants potentially discharged into an aquatic environment without the compromise of water quality. The calculation of EOD for heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) has shown a significant overcoming of these toxic contaminants threatening the ecosystem integrity and/or the environment.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC	2017	99						338	343		10.5004/dwt.2017.21749								WOS:000425242300043

Factors shaping species richness and biodiversity of riverine macroinvertebrate assemblages at the local and regional scale	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												The biodiversity and species richness of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages are under the strong pressure of environmental variables compounded with geographical and historical processes. Numerous studies that have investigated biodiversity and assemblage stability have shown the importance of choosing proper methodologies and paradigms. Consequently, the use of diversity measures and the partitioning of biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales are of particular significance. Within habitats, only those species whose preferences remain within a tolerable range of the variability of abiotic factors are able to survive. The structure of biocoenosis at the local scale is determined mainly by current velocity/discharge, granulometry of the inorganic bottom substrate, quantity and quality of particulate organic matter, as well as water quality variables. Dispersion plays a key role in shaping regional diversity gradients, which supports the permanent inflow of individuals and their exchange between riverine basins. However, dispersion is also one of the basic aspects of the saturation/non-saturation of local communities with species from the regional species pool; a respective concept tries to determine how, why and to what degree local species richness is dependent on regional species richness.																	1585-8553	1588-2756				DEC	2017	18	3					227	236		10.1556/168.2017.18.3.1								WOS:000424882900001

Assessment of anthropogenic, seasonal and aquatic vegetation effects on the contamination level of oxbows	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												The contamination level of oxbows depends on both natural and anthropogenic effects. The aim of our study was to identify those abiotic and biotic factors that determine the contamination level of oxbows. The effect of anthropogenic activities, seasonality, and vegetation types was studied on the contamination level of surface water of oxbows. The following chemical variables were measured: suspended solid, ammonium, nitrate, chlorophyll-a, Al, Ba, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sr and Zn from eight oxbows from 2013 summer to 2014 autumn in the Upper Tisza region in Eastern Hungary. Three of the studied oxbows were protected, four oxbows were used for fishing and one oxbow was contaminated with wastewater. Our findings revealed that anthropogenic activities had remarkable effect on the contamination level of oxbows. Seasonality also influenced the contamination level, except the concentration of suspended solid, chlorophyll-a and manganese. Significant differences were found among vegetation types for the concentration of suspended solids, aluminium, iron, manganese and lead. The high level of iron concentration was not explained by the anthropogenic activities, suggesting that the quality of oxbows depends on both natural and anthropogenic effects.																	1585-8553	1588-2756				DEC	2017	18	3					237	243		10.1556/168.2017.18.3.2								WOS:000424882900002

Effects of combined calcium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide on drinking water quality in Qatar and disinfection by-products formation	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Chlorite, chlorate, bromate and trihalo methanes (THMs) are included in WHO guidelines for drinking water quality. This study examined dosing different chlorine concentrations as calcium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)(2)) to water containing chlorine dioxide to evaluate the control of water quality in storage and the distribution system in Qatar with emphasis on chlorite, chlorate, bromate, pH and other parameters. Seven water samples were collected from the Ras Laffan-Q Power desalination plant outlet in amber bottles having a chlorine dioxide concentration of 0.3 mg/L in 1 liter. The bottles were spiked with Ca(ClO)(2) in sequence to give concentration of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 mg/L as free chlorine. The mixtures were stored for 7 days at 25 degrees C in the dark then heated to 45 degrees C for two days more, and analyzed daily for physical and chemical parameters. A total of 312 sub-samples were analyzed for chlorite, chlorate, bromate, bromide, chloride, nitrate, nitrite, sulfate, THMs, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, and chlorine and chlorine dioxide residuals. Chlorite concentration reductions were observed from the first day forward as 59, 65, 68, 94, 100, and 100%, and 17.4, 22.1, 39.2, 63.9, 66.0, 68.9% (from 0.157 to 0.049 mg/L) respectively based on observed means for seven days the commensurate respective chlorate concentrations increases were 196, 344, 516, 602, 703, 787% (from 0.035 to 0.313 mg/L) based on observed mean values for seven days. These data were statistically analyzed by multivariate regression. There were no significant changes in THMs concentrations and the reductions in chlorite and increases in chlorate concentration are chlorine dosage dependent. No bromate formation was observed. Chlorine dioxide levels decrease as the free chlorine residual levels increased. This study demonstrates that hypochlorite/chlorine dioxide can be used as an operational tool to control the chlorite levels, and slow the disappearance of the chlorine dioxide over time during distribution, that is usually faster than chlorine disappearance. The original chlorine dioxide dosage will determine the ultimate chlorate concentration.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC	2017	100						333	339		10.5004/dwt.2017.21895								WOS:000425243300037

This is a unique, humid Mediterranean area with a number of important and protected wetland habitats and is a ornithological, ichthyology, and botanical reserve. By measuring the physico-chemical parameters at 20 locations, the water quality was determined with special attention to the occurrence of salinity. Increasing salinity of the Neretva water was found, owing to inflow reduction groundwater of the river Trebisnjica and the uncontrolled deepening of the Neretva riverbed. During a one-year monitoring period, field tests were conducted of significant maritime impacts on water quality. The physical parameters were the measured temperature, conductivity, electrical resistance, salinity, chemical quantity of dissolved oxygen (expressed as a percentage, mg L-1), the oxygen pressure in water, and the pH value.

To assess the efficiency of furrow irrigation, a 4-ha plot (87 furrows) cultivated with sugarcane was evaluated in Khuzestan Province. The quantities of inflow, outflow runoff, soil moisture before irrigation, depth of root development and depth of water infiltration were measured and thus the values of water use efficiency, uniformity coefficient, and distribution uniformity were determined for the selected plot. Using Geographical Information System, in ArcView, the irrigation efficiency of its levels were analyzed using two furrow irrigation methods: open and closed-end. The results showed that the irrigation efficiency, uniformity coefficient and distribution uniformity for the open-end than the closed-end method. The prevention of deep infiltration losses (approximately 30% lower than for closed-end) and allowing outflow of end runoff, and depending on water quality, the riffle can be considered ideal for irrigating other surfaces.																	2476-3055					DEC	2017	3	12					1278	1287		10.28991/cej-030957								WOS:000424521400009						
J	Cichon, M				Cichon, Malgorzata			Changing values of lake ecosystem services as a result of bacteriological contamination on Lake Trzesiecko and Lake Wielimie, Poland	ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDIES												Lake ecosystems, on the one hand, are affected by tourism, and on the other by development for tourism. Lake ecosystem services include: water with its self-cleaning processes, air with climate control processes, as well as flora and fauna. Utilisation of services leads to interventions in the structure of ecosystems and their processes. Only to a certain extent, this is specific to each type of environmental interference, remains within the limits of ecosystem resilience and does not lead to its degradation. One of the threats is bacteriological contamination, for which the most reliable sanitation indicator is Escherichia coli. In lake water quality studies it is assumed that the lakeshore cannot be a source of bacteria. It has been hypothesised that the problem of bacterial contamination can be serious for the places that do not have any infrastructure, especially sanitation. Consequently, the purpose of the study was to determine the extent to which lakeshore sanitation, in particular the level of bacteriological contamination, has an impact on the value of services provided by the selected lake ecosystems (Lake Trzesiecko and Lake Wielimie - Szczecinek Lake District). Five selected services related to lake ecosystems are: water, control over the spread of contagious diseases, aesthetic values, tourism and recreation, as well as the hydrological cycle with its self-cleaning function. Services, as well as the criteria adopted for evaluation, allow us to conclude that the services provided by the lake ecosystems are suitable to fulfill a recreation function. However, the inclusion of quality criteria for sanitary status has shown that the value of system services has dropped by as much as 50%. Value changes are visible primarily for water and aesthetic qualities. Such a significant decrease in the value of services clearly indicates the importance of the sanitary conditions of lakes and their appropriate infrastructure. In view of the valuation proposals, there is a problem of uncertainty of valuation of ecosystem services.																	2354-0079					DEC	2017	5	4					87	94		10.1515/environ-2017-0024								WOS:000424548900009

In order to evaluate its effect, the hydrogeological parameters including groundwater quality and major dissolved components were investigated. The water quality was measured four times in the field, and 74 of 163 samples that showed the high conductivity value of more than 500 mu S/cm and the influence of seawater on the groundwater were analyzed by Cl-/HCO3- molar ratio. The results showed that, 40 samples out of 74 were found to have a value of 2.8 or more, indicating severe and very severe effects. According to the type of groundwater quality, the ratio of samples belonging to Na-Cl type, which is considered to be influenced by the direct seawater, is 35.3% for bedrock groundwater and 52.5% for weathered zone and alluvial groundwater. In the evolution stage of groundwater due to seawater infiltration, the type of Ca-Cl prior to the Na-Cl type is 44.1% in bedrock groundwater and 45% in weathered zone and alluvial groundwater. The effect of sea water on the aquifer is likely to be influenced by distance from the shore, pumped water, and tide.																	1225-6692	2287-4518				DEC	2017	38	7					570	580		10.5467/JKESS.2017.38.7.570								WOS:000424527800010

Simultaneous corrosion control and water quality improvement in water distribution systems	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												The effects of different dosages of sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium orthophosphate on corrosion inhibition and water quality in two model water distribution systems, and the corrosion inhibition mechanism on pipe walls were investigated. Results show that adding sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium orthophosphate can not only provide a remedy for the damaged cement coating surface, but improve water quality by reducing hardness, turbidity and total iron in cement-coated water distribution systems. The surface exposed to sodium hexametaphosphate was covered by a discontinuous glass-like film, while the other was covered by some phosphate crystals and a thin film. The glass-like film sequestered Ca, Fe and Al on its surface, where calcium hexametaphosphate could be in complex with Fe2O3 or Al2O3 to form the film, while orthophosphate crystals and the thin film were related to Fe and Ca, FePO4 and Ca-3(PO4)(2) formed and deposited on the surface composing the thin film.																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					790	796		10.2166/wpt.2017.084								WOS:000424141200004

This paper presents the design and preliminary field results from a network of low-cost mobile robots called NUSwan, a system aimed at addressing this issue. NUSwan robots can autonomously traverse a reservoir to provide real-time water quality data over the Internet, and allow users to modify the sampling missions interactively based on their interpretation of the data. The quality of measurements generated is comparable to that obtained from standard manual sampling. Moreover, the system incurs little logistics overhead while allowing higher monitoring frequency and spatial coverage. We present an example to show NUSwan's capability in detecting the emergence of water quality hotspots. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential of using data collected from a short mission carried out by NUSwan to rapidly assess the relationship between water quality indicators.																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					806	817		10.2166/wpt.2017.089								WOS:000424141200006

In this study, six water samples were taken from points along the Maroon River in order to evaluate its quality. The concentrations of Cl-, SO42-, HCO3-, CO32-, NO3-, K+, Mg2+, Na+, and Ca2+, as well as pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) were measured. The results were compared with the WHO (World Health Organization) drinking water guidelines and the FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization of United Nations) standard for irrigation water. The values of EC, TDS, Ca2+, Cl- and SO42- in two samples, and that of Mg2+ in one sample from downstream exceed WHO recommended limits. The K+, Na+ and NO3- concentrations are below the WHO limits. The dominant water facies is bicarbonate-calcium (HCO3-Ca). A Schoeller diagram shows that the water samples are of 'Good' and 'Intermediate' classes, while a Wilcox diagram reveals that the water is in classes C2S1, C3S3 and C3S2 - i.e., 'Good' or 'Intermediate' - for agricultural purposes. The water quality indices %Na, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR) and Kelly's ratio (KR), also indicate that the water is suitable for irrigation. In terms of EC, the water samples are of 'Good' and 'Permissible' quality. Geochemical investigations show that the water chemistry is influenced by evaporation, dissolution of evaporitic minerals, ion exchange and human activities.																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					818	831		10.2166/wpt.2017.088								WOS:000424141200007

Visualization of water quality data is an important part of the monitoring and analysis of water quality. Because water quality data have geographic features, their visualization can be realized using maps, which not only provide intuitive visualization, but also reflect the relationship between water quality and geographical position. For this study, the heat map provided by Google Maps was used for water quality data visualization. However, as the amount of data increases, the computational efficiency of traditional development models cannot meet the computing task needs quickly. Effective storage, extraction and analysis of large water data sets becomes a problem that needs urgent solution. Hadoop is an open source software framework running on computer clusters that can store and process large data sets efficiently, and it was used in this study to store and process water quality data. Through reasonable analysis and experiment, an efficient and convenient information platform can be provided for water quality monitoring.																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					882	893		10.2166/wpt.2017.093								WOS:000424141200012

Monitoring of surface water is essential to know the current status of water quality and maintain it at certain desirable level. In this study surface water quality of Amingaon has been analysed. Amingaon is a locality in North Guwahati (Assam, India). In last few decades' the locality has undergone rapid and uncontrolled development activities which have a detrimental impact on its ecology and environment. Samples were collected from 12 lakes and analysed for 24 parameters namely temperature (T), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity (Tur), total suspended solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids (TDS), total alkalinity (TA), total hardness (TH), chloride ion (Cl-), fluoride (F-), sulphate (SO42-), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), dissolved oxygen (DO) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), nitrate (NO3-) total phosphorus (TP) and available phosphorus (AP). Multivariate statistical techniques were used for the assessment of water quality. Cluster analysis (CA) was used for classification of water quality parameters and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the sources of pollution. CA grouped all the water quality parameters in three cluster. PCA resulted in six useful components which explained 90.54% of the total variance. Based on overall study it was concluded that the sources of pollution of lakes were the use of fertilizers, storm water runoff, land development and domestic waste water discharge. Trophic state of lakes was also evaluated using Carlson's Trophic State Index (TSI).																	1751-231X					DEC	2017	12	4					997	1008		10.2166/wpt.2017.107								WOS:000424141200024

In order to address these problems, an experiment was conducted to optimize the stocking weight for carp polyculture ponds in Tanore Upazila of Rajshahi district, Bangladesh. Three different stocking weights were tested under three treatments (T-1: 25 +/- 0.12 g; T-2: 50 +/- 0.15 g; and T-3: 100 +/- 0.19 g), each with three replications. Fish growing period (July-December), carp species (Catla catla, Hypopthalmichthys molitrix, Aristichthis nobilis, Labeo rohita and Cirrhinus mrigala), stocking density (7,410 individuals/ha), lime and ash treatment, fertilization and feeding were same for all the treatments. Water quality (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, transparency, pH and alkalinity) and fish growth parameters were monitored monthly. Mean values of water quality parameters were found within the suitable range for fish culture. Treatment T-3 varied more significantly (P<0.05) than that of other treatments for the mean values of final weight, weight gain, specific growth rate, survival rate and yield of fish. Net benefit of carp polyculture was also found the highest in treatment T-3. Use of higher stocking weight can be a suitable option for carp polyculture in ponds under drought prone Barind area.																	2311-729X	2311-3111				DEC	2017	5	3					519	524		10.17017/jfish.v5i3.2017.300								WOS:000424097300002

LNG Regasification Terminals: The Role of Geography and Meteorology on Technology Choices	ENERGIES												Liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects are regulated by host countries, but policy and regulation should depend on geography and meteorology. Without considering the role of geography and meteorology, sub-optimal design choices can result, leading to energy conversion efficiency and capital investment decisions that are less than ideal. A key step in LNG is regasification, which transforms LNG back from liquid to the gaseous state and requires substantial heat input. This study investigated different LNG regasification technologies used around the world and benchmarked location and meteorology-related factors, such as seawater temperatures, ambient air temperatures, wind speeds and relative humidity. Seawater vaporizers are used for more than 95% of locations subject to water quality. Ambient air conditions are relatively better for South America, India, Spain and other Asian countries (Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand) and provide a much cleaner regasification technology option for natural and forced draft systems and air-based intermediate fluid vaporizers. On a global basis, cold energy utilization currently represents <1% of the total potential, but this approach could deliver nearly 12 Gigawatt (GW) per annum. Overall, climate change is expected to have a positive financial impact on the LNG regasification industry, but the improvement could be unevenly distributed.

Therefore, maintaining drinking water quality is increasingly important. In this paper, the authors present the influence of human activities on the River Somes (Romania). It has been studied mainly as water quality indices. Within the Somes-Tisa basin, the authors identified 41 potentially polluting industrial sources in the following fields of activity: mining (decantation ponds, mining dumps) and urban and industrial waste management. Thus, the authors analysed the best pollution parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen consumption, ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, total nitrogen, chromium, calcium, and magnesium. As a result of effected analyses, it can be observed a charge of nitrites and chlorides, and the presence of pollution phenomenon is showed by the high values of nitrites and biochemical oxygen consumption. Analyses were carried out over three years, 2014-2016. Quality classes increased from 2014 to 2016 because pollution decreased due to the lack of connection of the households to the waste water system in 2013-2014. Research analyses show that the water from the River Somes tends to maintain its quality; however, surface waters tend to be polluted and they are slightly influenced by human activities.																	2285-5718	2286-0126				DEC	2017	6	2					178	182										WOS:000423885500025

Groundwater contaminants passing through the biowall are treated within the biowall or immediately downgradient of the biowall. Biowalls designed and constructed for the treatment of chlorinated solvents typically contain either a solid and/or liquid source of organic carbon to promote contaminant degradation by enhanced anaerobic reductive dechlorination. Common solid organicmaterials in biowalls include wood mulch or similar waste plant material, and common liquid organic materials are vegetable oil (possibly emulsified) or other long-chain fatty acids. Such biowalls then develop anaerobic conditions in the constructed biowall volume, and potentially downgradient, as dissolved oxygen originally present in the aquifer is consumed. This groundwater condition can lead to the appearance of sulfide if groundwater influent to the biowall contains moderate to high sulfate concentrations. Other researchers have presented evidence for groundwater conditions downgradient of a biowall or a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) that are altered in relation to groundwater quality, besides the desired effect of contaminant degradation or removal by precipitation. The objective of this work was to investigate with modeling the changes in downgradient groundwater species chemistry as a result of a constructed biowall. This was accomplished with a chemical species model to predict levels of sulfate and sulfide present in groundwater in close downgradient proximity to the biowall. The results indicate that downgradient chemical changes could impact a surface water body to which groundwater discharges. The model described could be enhanced by incorporating additional design variables that should be considered in biowall feasibility assessments.																	1051-5658	1520-6831				WIN	2017	28	1					55	61		10.1002/rem.21542								WOS:000423925600006						
J	Mao, YC; Qi, H; Ping, P; Li, XF				Mao, Yingchi; Qi, Hai; Ping, Ping; Li, Xiaofang			Contamination Event Detection with Multivariate Time-Series Data in Agricultural Water Monitoring	SENSORS												Time series data of multiple water quality parameters are obtained from the water sensor networks deployed in the agricultural water supply network. The accurate and efficient detection and warning of contamination events to prevent pollution from spreading is one of the most important issues when pollution occurs. In order to comprehensively reduce the event detection deviation, a spatial-temporal-based event detection approach with multivariate time-series data for water quality monitoring (M-STED) was proposed. The M-STED approach includes three parts. The first part is that M-STED adopts a Rule K algorithm to select backbone nodes as the nodes in the CDS, and forward the sensed data of multiple water parameters. The second part is to determine the state of each backbone node with back propagation neural network models and the sequential Bayesian analysis in the current timestamp. The third part is to establish a spatial model with Bayesian networks to estimate the state of the backbones in the next timestamp and trace the "outlier" node to its neighborhoods to detect a contamination event. The experimental results indicate that the average detection rate is more than 80% with M-STED and the false detection rate is lower than 9%, respectively. The M-STED approach can improve the rate of detection by about 40% and reduce the false alarm rate by about 45%, compared with the event detection with a single water parameter algorithm, S-STED. Moreover, the proposed M-STED can exhibit better performance in terms of detection delay and scalability.																	1424-8220					DEC	2017	17	12							2806	10.3390/s17122806								WOS:000423285800106	29207535

The area between the Koycegiz Lake and the sea is covered with four small lakes and numerous canals. The Dalyan Channel network connects lake to the Mediterranean Sea is one of the most important reproduction areas for Mediterranean Sea turtles. The objectives of the present study are to evaluate the influence of channel traffic and Koycegiz Lake on the water quality of Dalyan Channel by evaluating historical water quality data from 2007 to 2011 at three monitoring sites; two located at Dalyan Channel and one in Koycegiz Lake. Specific objectives are to perform trend analysis for; (i) concentration trends; (ii) load estimation (mass of pollutants delivered); (iii) TN: TP Ratio (trophic status trends); (iv) TSI (eutrophication trends); and (v) the WQI (environmental quality trends) for Koycegiz Lake. Results showed that TSI (trophic state index) values of both SD (secchi depth) and TP (total phosphate) remained within the range of eutrophic category for the lake from 2007 to 2011. The calculated TN/TP ratios suggest that Koycegiz Lake can be considered to be P limited with a few exceptions. The lake has poor water quality index (POOR WQI) between 2007 and 2011. This is mainly due to land-based fish farm located on Yuvarlakcay Creek which born within the Koycegiz-Dalyan SEPA and drains directly into Koycegiz Lake. In addition to change in water quality class of the creek before and after fish farming, TP concentration incidence also increased after fish farming from 2008 to 2011. This study also revealed that activities like touristic boat trips performed in Dalyan Channel didn't significantly affect the water quality class of channel in terms of NO2-N, TP concentrations and the number of total coliforms.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				DEC	2017	16	12					2755	2765										WOS:000423792300010

Flooding is one particularly deadly example of its amplifying and expanding effect on public health. This systematic review considered evidence linking green building strategies in the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (R) (LEED) Rating System with the potential to reduce negative health outcomes following exposure to urban flooding events. Queries evaluated links between LEED credit requirements and risk of exposure to urban flooding, environmental determinants of health, co-benefits to public health outcomes, and co-benefits to built environment outcomes. Public health co-benefits to leveraging green building design to enhance flooding resilience included: improving the interface between humans and wildlife and reducing the risk of waterborne disease, flood-related morbidity and mortality, and psychological harm. We conclude that collaborations among the public health, climate change, civil society, and green building sectors to enhance community resilience to urban flooding could benefit population health.

Environmental Factors Correlated with Culturable Enterococci Concentrations in Tropical Recreational Waters: A Case Study in Escambron Beach, San Juan, Puerto Rico	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Enterococci concentration variability at Escambron Beach, San Juan, Puerto Rico, was examined in the context of environmental conditions observed during 2005-2015. Satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), turbidity, direct normal irradiance, and dew point were combined with local precipitation, winds, and mean sea level (MSL) observations in a stepwise multiple regression analyses (Akaike Information Criteria model selection). Precipitation, MSL, irradiance, SST, and turbidity explained 20% of the variation in observed enterococci concentrations based upon these analyses. Changes in these parameters preceded increases in enterococci concentrations by 24 h up to 11 days, particularly during positive anomalies of turbidity, SST, and 480-960 mm of accumulated (4 days) precipitation, which relates to bacterial ecology. Weaker, yet still significant, increases in enterococci concentrations were also observed during positive dew point anomalies. Enterococci concentrations decreased with elevated irradiance and MSL anomalies. Unsafe enterococci concentrations per US EPA recreational water quality guidelines occurred when 4-day cumulative precipitation ranged 481-960 mm; irradiance < 667 W.m(2); daily average turbidity anomaly > 0.005 sr(-1);SST anomaly > 0.8 degrees C; and 3-day average MSL anomaly < -18.8 cm. This case study shows that satellite-derived environmental data can be used to inform future water quality studies and protect human health.

Comprehensive performance evaluations were carried out for hydrological and nutrient simulation using the HSPF model in the Xitiaoxi watershed in China. Streamflow simulation was calibrated from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2007 and then validated from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010 using daily observed data, and nutrient simulation was calibrated and validated using monthly observed data during the period from July 2009 to July 2010. These results of model performance evaluation showed that the streamflows were well simulated over the study period. The determination coefficient (R-2) was 0.87, 0.77 and 0.63, and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (Ens) was 0.82, 0.76 and 0.65 for the streamflow simulation in annual, monthly and daily time-steps, respectively. Although limited to monthly observed data, satisfactory performance was still achieved during the quantitative evaluation for nutrients. The R-2 was 0.73, 0.82 and 0.92, and the Ens was 0.67, 0.74 and 0.86 for nitrate, ammonium and orthophosphate simulation, respectively. Some issues may affect the application of HSPF were also discussed, such as input data quality, parameter values, etc. Overall, the HSPF model can be successfully used to describe streamflow and nutrients transport in the mesoscale watershed located in the East Asian monsoon climate area. This study is expected to serve as a comprehensive and systematic documentation of understanding the HSPF model for wide application and avoiding possible misuses.

This study investigated 168 small-scale pig farms and 29 example pig farms in Yujiang County of China to examine current and potential impacts of pig wastes on soil, water and crop qualities in the hilly red soil region, China. The results indicated that the small-scale pig farms produced considerable annual yields of wastes, with medians of 216, 333 and 773 ton yr(-1) per pig farm for manure, urine and washing wastewater, respectively, which has had significant impact on surface water quality. Taking NH4+-N, total nitrogen (TN) or total phosphorus (TP) as a criterion to judge water quality, the proportions of Class III and below Class III waters in the local surface waters were 66.2%, 78.7% and 72.5%. The well water (shallow groundwater) quality near these pig farms met the water quality standards by a wide margin. The annual output of pollutants from pig farms was the most important factor correlated with the nutrients and heavy metals in soils, and the relationship can be described by a linear equation. The impact on croplands was marked by the excessive accumulation of available phosphorus and heavy metals such as Cu and Zn. For crop safety, the over-limit ratio of Zn in vegetable samples reached 60%, other heavy metals in vegetable and rice samples tested met the food safety standard at present.																	1660-4601					DEC	2017	14	12							1524	10.3390/ijerph14121524								WOS:000423699400087	29211053

Evaluating the chronic effects of nitrate on the health and performance of post-smolt Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in freshwater recirculation aquaculture systems	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												Commercial production of Atlantic salmon smolts, post-smolts, and market-size fish using land-based recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) is expanding. RAS generally provide a nutrient-rich environment in which nitrate accumulates as an end-product of nitrification. An 8-month study was conducted to compare the long-term effects of "high" (99 +/- 1 mg/L NO3-N) versus "low" nitrate-nitrogen (10.0 +/- 0.3 mg/L NO3-N) on the health and performance of post-smolt Atlantic salmon cultured in replicate freshwater RAS. Equal numbers of salmon with an initial mean weight of 102 +/- 1 g were stocked into six 9.5 m(3) RAS. Three RAS were maintained with high NO3-N via continuous dosing of sodium nitrate and three RAS were maintained with low NO3-N resulting solely from nitrification. An average daily water exchange rate equivalent to 60% of the system volume limited the accumulation of water quality parameters other than nitrate. Atlantic salmon performance metrics (e.g. weight, length, condition factor, thermal growth coefficient, and feed conversion ratio) were not affected by 100 mg/L NO3-N and cumulative survival was > 99% for both treatments. No important differences were noted between treatments for whole blood gas, plasma chemistry, tissue histopathology, or fin quality parameters suggesting that fish health was unaffected by nitrate concentration. Abnormal swimming behaviors indicative of stress or reduced welfare were not observed. This research suggests that nitrate-nitrogen concentrations <= 100 mg/L do not affect post-smolt Atlantic salmon health or performance under the described conditions.																	0144-8609	1873-5614				DEC	2017	79						1	8		10.1016/j.aquaeng.2017.08.003								WOS:000423647100001

Whether ozonation impacts waterborne hormone levels in RAS has likewise not been fully evaluated. To this end, a controlled 3-month study was conducted in 6 replicated RAS containing a mixture of sexually mature and immature Atlantic salmon Salmo salar to determine whether ozone, as typically applied in RAS to improve water quality, is associated with a reduction in waterborne hormones. Post-smolt Atlantic salmon (1253 +/- 15 g) were stocked into each RAS; 109 of 264 fish placed in each system were sexually mature males, and 5 were mature females. Water ozonation, controlled using an ORP set-point of 290-300 mV, was applied with the pure oxygen feed gas within the low-head oxygenators of 3 randomly selected RAS, while the remaining 3 RAS did not receive ozone. The RAS hydraulic retention time was 6.9 +/- 0.3 days. Study fish were raised under these conditions for 12 weeks; during weeks 10 and 12, triplicate water samples were collected from the following locations in each RAS: i) culture tank, ii) makeup water, iii) pre-biofilter, iv) post-biofilter, and v) post-gas conditioning. Concentrations of 3 waterborne hormones - testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), and estradiol (17 beta-estradiol) - were quantified using enzyme immunoassays (EIA). Estradiol was significantly reduced by ozonation; testosterone and 11-KT were also reduced by ozonation, although these reductions were not observed across all sampling locations and events. Testosterone and 11-KT concentrations, however, were significantly reduced following water passage through the biofilters of both ozonated and non-ozonated RAS. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for ozone to be used in RAS as a means of preventing the accumulation of steroid hormones. Further research is required to assess whether reducing hormones in this manner impacts precocious sexual maturation in RAS-produced Atlantic salmon.																	0144-8609	1873-5614				DEC	2017	79						9	16		10.1016/j.aquaeng.2017.08.004								WOS:000423647100002

In aquaculture, since Hydrodynamic Vortex Separator (HDVS) is able to control flocs concentration effectively, the Recirculating Biofloc Technology (RBFT) has been gradually acknowledged (Zhu et al., 2016). In order to operate RBFT system at maximum performance, the removal efficiency of HDVS at different Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) must be fully predictable. The aim of this work is to investigate the relationship between separation efficiency and HRT of HDVS applied in RBFT system, through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. For this, a three-dimensional unsteady transient model was developed to simulate the hydrodynamics in HDVS based on the commercial software Workbenching 17.0. A Two Fluid Model (TFM) using kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) has been developed to describe the dense solid-liquid (flocs-water) flow field of HDVS in RBFT system. Additionally, the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with Reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM) are solved by use of the finite volume method based on the SIMPLE pressure correction algorithm in the computational domain. Finally, pilot-scale studies were conducted to evaluate the accuracy and precision of simulation models applied. The results indicate that the flocs removal efficiency of HDVS obtained from tests were less than that from the simulation results at three different HRTs. But it decreased with the decline of HRT both for experiment and simulation. Additionally, the CFD model proposed can enhance the fundamental understanding of the effects of HRT on separation efficiency and at the same time, probably coupled with physical experiment whenever necessary, offer a more reliable way for optimum control of HDVS under varying conditions. Based on the simulation results, the flocs management in RBFT system is briefly discussed.																	0144-8609	1873-5614				DEC	2017	79						24	34		10.1016/j.aquaeng.2017.08.002								WOS:000423647100004

Landscape indicators of groundwater nitrate concentrations: an approach for trans-border aquifer monitoring	ECOSPHERE												Groundwater is the primary source of nearly half the freshwater used in drinking and cooking worldwide. Excess nitrate contamination of groundwater is a growing health concern, particularly in regions of intensive agriculture. Monitoring the world's nearly 500 transboundary aquifer bodies is complicated by the complexities associated with multi-jurisdictional governance, disparities in data collection, and inconsistencies in geospatial data among countries. In a region where elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations are linked to overlying land use practices and land cover, we develop landscape indicators characterizing likely sources and examine their correspondence with groundwater nitrate concentrations. We evaluate an aquifer spanning the United States and Canada (the Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer) and ask two primary questions: Are nitrate concentrations in the aquifer changing over time? How well do landscape indicators help explain patterns of groundwater nitrate concentrations? To answer our first question, a time series (2005-2013) of groundwater nitrate concentrations was examined for 15 shallow wells using Mann-Kendall trend analysis tests. Nitrate concentrations in nine of the fifteen monitoring wells decreased while two increased over time. To answer our second question, a seamless harmonized cross-border land cover mosaic was created using available U.S. and Canadian land use and land cover data. Landscape indicators such as crop type (proportion of raspberries, forage, and pasture, etc.) were measured in terrestrial zones of influence (of varying sized radii which incorporated groundwater flow direction) surrounding each well. Backward stepwise regression was used to identify parsimonious models of landscape indicators which explain nitrate concentrations in the United States and Canada. The proportions of different berry types (e.g., blueberries and raspberries, and mixed berries), forage/pasture, and area of renovations explained 21-72% of the variance in groundwater nitrate concentrations, depending on zonal scale, direction, and/or jurisdiction. As very few studies have quantitatively linked groundwater nitrate concentrations to land use, land cover, or land use practices, our work provides an important transportable approach that is highly relevant to other regions facing similar management challenges.																	2150-8925					DEC	2017	8	12							e02047	10.1002/ecs2.2047								WOS:000423423200020

Chad			Suitability of Soil Erosion Models for the Evaluation of Bladed Skid Trail BMPs in the Southern Appalachians	FORESTS												This project measured soil erosion rates from bladed skid trails in the mountains of Virginia following a timber harvest, and compared measured erosion to four erosion model predictions produced by Universal Soil Loss Equation-Forest (USLE-Forest), Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, v.2 (RUSLE2), Water Erosion Prediction Project-Road (WEPP-Road) using default files, and WEPP-Road using modified files in order to assess the utility of the models for these conditions. Skid trails were segregated into six blocks where each block had similar trail slopes and soils. Each block contained four skid trail closure treatments: (1) bare soil (Control); (2) residual limbs and tops (Slash); (3) grass seed (Seed); and (4) fertilizer, seed, and straw mulch (Mulch). All treatments had waterbars, the minimum trail closure best management practice (BMP), to provide upslope and downslope borders of experimental units. Site cover characteristics on each experimental unit were collected quarterly as input parameters for erosion models. The suitability of soil erosion models were evaluated based upon statistical summaries, linear relationships with measured erosion rates, Nash-Sutcliffe Model Efficiency, and a nonparametric analysis. Treatments were measured to have erosion rates of 15.2 tonnes ha(-1) year(-1) (Control), 5.9 tonnes ha(-1) year(-1) (Seed), 1.1 tonnes ha(-1) year(-1) (Mulch), and 0.8 tonnes ha(-1) year(-1) (Slash). It was determined that WEPP-Road: Modified (p-value = 0.643) and USLE-Forest (p-value = 0.307) were the most suitable models given their accuracy; however USLE-Forest may be better for making management decisions given its practicality.

Anthropogenic Phosphorus Inputs to a River Basin and Their Impacts on Phosphorus Fluxes Along Its Upstream-Downstream Continuum	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The increasing trend in riverine phosphorus (P) loads resulting from anthropogenic inputs has gained wide attention because of the well-known role of P in eutrophication. So far, however, there is still limited scientific understanding of anthropogenic P inputs and their impacts on riverine flux in river reaches along the upstream-to-downstream continuum. Here we investigated P budgets in a series of nested watersheds draining into Hongze Lake of China and developed an empirical function to describe the relationship between anthropogenic inputs and riverine P fluxes. Our results indicated that there are obvious gradients regarding P budgets in response to changes in human activities. Fertilizer application and food and feed P import was always the dominant source of P inputs in all sections, followed by nonfood P. Further interpretation using the model revealed the processes of P loading to the lake. About 2%-9% of anthropogenic P inputs are transported from the various sections into the corresponding tributaries of the river systems, depending upon local precipitation rates. Of this amount, around 41%-95% is delivered to the main stem of the Huai River after in-stream attenuation in its tributaries. Ultimately, 55%-86% of the P loads delivered to different locations of the main stem are transported into the receiving lake of the downstream, due to additional losses in the main stem. An integrated P management strategy that considers the gradients of P loss along the upstream-to-downstream continuum is required to assess and optimize P management to protect the region's freshwater resource.					zhang, wangshou/0000-0001-9473-4555												2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2017	122	12					3273	3287		10.1002/2017JG004004								WOS:000423221300011

As such, we describe here research concerning the use of multifunctional nanomaterials combining magnetic and plasmonic components. These nanomaterials have been prepared by decorating magnetite nanoparticles (MNP) with colloidal gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) of distinct particle size distributions. Several analytical conditions were investigated in order to optimize the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) detection of penicillin G (PG) dissolved in water. In particular, the dependence of the SERS signal by using distinct sized Au NPs adsorbed at the MNP was investigated. Additionally, microscopic methods, including Raman confocal microscopy, were employed to characterize the SERS substrates and then to qualitatively detect penicillin G using such substrates. For example, magnetic-plasmonic nanocomposites can be employed for magnetically concentrate analyte molecules and their removal from solution.

We investigate the hydrologic impacts of 122 ARs that occurred in the Salt and Verde river basins in northeastern Arizona during the cold seasons from 1979 to 2009. We focus on the relationship between precipitation, snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture, and extreme flooding. During the cold season (October through March) ARs contribute an average of 25%/29% of total seasonal precipitation for the Salt/Verde river basins, respectively. However, they contribute disproportionately to total heavy precipitation and account for 64%/72% of extreme total daily precipitation (exceeding the 98th percentile). Excess precipitation during AR occurrences contributes to snow accumulation; on the other hand, warmer than normal temperatures during AR landfallings are linked to rain-on-snow processes, an increase in the basins' area contributing to runoff generation, and higher melting lines. Although not all AR events are linked to extreme flooding in the basins, they do account for larger runoff coefficients. On average, ARs generate 43% of the annual maximum flows for the period studied, with 25% of the events exceeding the 10 year return period. Our analysis shows that the devastating 1993 flooding event in the region was caused by AR events. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity on the hydrology of inland semiarid regions: ARs are critical for water resources, but they can also lead to extreme flooding that affects infrastructure and human activities. Plain Language Summary Within the Salt and Verde River basins in the semiarid northeastern Arizona, natural ecosystems and humans compete for over-allocated water resources. The basins are highly dependent on winter precipitation for ecosystem functioning, water supply, fire suppression, and in the case of extreme events, for water quality, flood control and dam safety. Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are narrow corridors of concentrated water vapor that bring copious amount of rainfall from the Pacific into the region and contribute to its hydrology by increasing snow pack and replenishing soil moisture in the basins. ARs are also responsible for extreme precipitation and streamflow events, such as the 1993 flooding event, which caused human casualties and economic losses. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity on the hydrology of inland semiarid regions: ARs are critical for maintaining natural ecosystem health, but they can also lead to extreme flooding that affects infrastructure and human activities.

Respondents are asked to rate eight photographs that depict varying algae conditions. Our initial results show that Utah resident preferences for benthic algae levels are quite similar to those of Montana residents, thus replicating the Montana study. For the full Utah sample, though, Cronbach's a indicated poor internal consistency in rating the photographs, so a "monotonicity rule'' was used to identify respondents providing monotonic preferences with respect to chlorophyll a densities. Simple graphical analyses are combined with ordered probit analysis to determine the maximum desirable density of chlorophyll a (Chl a). Our analysis indicates that Chl a levels in excess of 150 mg Chl a/m(2) are undesirable, but the regression model suggests that those with strictly monotonic preferences were far more likely favor a more stringent standard. Plain Language Summary Excess nutrients in water can cause eutrophication, a potentially undesirable condition that fosters the growth of nuisance algae. Unlike many other water quality problems, excess algae are easily discerned by those who recreate at streams, rivers, and lakes. EPA has recently tasked state water quality agencies with establishing a numeric criterion for excess nutrients. Some agencies have used public opinion surveys to gauge aesthetic preferences for algae when developing a chlorophyll a-based criterion. This approach implicitly assumes that (1) chlorophyll a densities closely correspond to the quantity and type of benthic algae and (2) preferences for algae are strictly monotonic, i.e., less algae are preferred to more algae. We scientifically replicate a Montana study and find that preferences of Utah residents demonstrate a remarkable similarity to those of Montana residents. However, responses for a significant proportion of the sample were not monotonic. Hence, the water quality criterion implied by survey data may be sensitive to the assumption of monotonicity. Multiple preferred criteria may emerge, each differing according to how researchers treat the monotonicity assumption. We find that respondents whose preferences for chlorophyll a are strongly monotonic are more likely to favor a more stringent criterion.

Estimating Discharge and Nonpoint Source Nitrate Loading to Streams From Three End-Member Pathways Using High-Frequency Water Quality Data	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The myriad hydrologic and biogeochemical processes taking place in watersheds occurring across space and time are integrated and reflected in the quantity and quality of water in streams and rivers. Collection of high-frequency water quality data with sensors in surface waters provides new opportunities to disentangle these processes and quantify sources and transport of water and solutes in the coupled groundwater-surface water system. A new approach for separating the streamflow hydrograph into three components was developed and coupled with high-frequency nitrate data to estimate time-variable nitrate loads from chemically dilute quick flow, chemically concentrated quick flow, and slowflow groundwater end-member pathways for periods of up to 2 years in a groundwater-dominated and a quick-flow-dominated stream in central Wisconsin, using only streamflow and in-stream water quality data. The dilute and concentrated quick flow end-members were distinguished using high-frequency specific conductance data. Results indicate that dilute quick flow contributed less than 5% of the nitrate load at both sites, whereas 8968% of the nitrate load at the groundwater-dominated stream was from slowflow groundwater, and 84625% of the nitrate load at the quick-flow-dominated stream was from concentrated quick flow. Concentrated quick flow nitrate concentrations varied seasonally at both sites, with peak concentrations in the winter that were 2-3 times greater than minimum concentrations during the growing season. Application of this approach provides an opportunity to assess stream vulnerability to nonpoint source nitrate loading and expected stream responses to current or changing conditions and practices in watersheds. Plain Language Summary The input of nutrients, such as nitrogen, to streams has been identified as contributing to the classification of the ecological condition of 42% of wadeable streams in the United States as "poor.'' Elevated nutrients increase the costs of drinking water treatment, and reduction of nutrient loading is necessary for compliance with environmental regulations in many watersheds. Effective mitigation of the impacts of nutrients on stream ecosystems requires an understanding of where nutrients are coming from; for example, in runoff from farm fields or in groundwater. However, when nutrients are delivered to streams from many different parts of a watershed it is difficult to determine how much of the nutrient load measured in a stream is from a given location. We used water quality data measured at 15 min intervals for a period of 2 years in two streams in central Wisconsin to estimate the amount of nitrogen loading to streams from runoff and different parts of the groundwater system. The approach presented here provides an opportunity to assess stream vulnerability to nutrient loading and expected stream responses to current or changing conditions and practices in watersheds.

Sensitivity of Catchment Transit Times to Rainfall Variability Under Present and Future Climates	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hydrologists have a relatively good understanding of how rainfall variability shapes the catchment hydrograph, a reflection of the celerity of hydraulic head propagation. Much less is known about the influence of rainfall variability on catchment transit times, a reflection of water velocities that control solute transport. This work uses catchment-scale lumped parameter models to decompose the relationship between rainfall variability and an important metric of transit times, the time-varying fraction of young water (<90 days old) in streams (FYW). A coupled rainfall-runoff model and rank StorAge Selection (rSAS) transit time model were calibrated to extensive hydrometric and environmental tracer data from neighboring headwater catchments in Plynlimon, Wales from 1999 to 2008. At both sites, the mean annual FYW increased more than 13 percentage points from the driest to the wettest year. Yearly mean rainfall explained most between-year variation, but certain signatures of rainfall pattern were also associated with higher FYW including: more clustered storms, more negatively skewed storms, and higher covariance between daily rainfall and discharge. We show that these signatures are symptomatic of an "inverse storage effect'' that may be common among watersheds. Looking to the future, changes in rainfall due to projected climate change caused an up to 19 percentage point increase in simulated mean winter FYW and similarly large decreases in the mean summer FYW. Thus, climate change could seasonally alter the ages of water in streams at these sites, with concomitant impacts on water quality. Plain Language Summary Scientists use information about the age of water in streams to help diagnose the source of water and what pollution it may carry. Most stream water originates from rain, and its "age'' is the time that has passed since it fell from the sky. "Old'' water tends to seep into the stream from deep underground where it has been stored and filtered for years or even decades. "Young'' water, on the other hand, comes from recent storms and tends to carry pollution from the land surface directly into streams. This study used stream data and computer simulations to understand how the amount of young water in streams changes in response to wet and dry periods at two small streams in Plynlimon, Wales. We show that the proportion of young water is much higher during wet periods and can be surprisingly sensitive to the rainfall pattern. We also show that changes in rainfall due to climate change could significantly increase the proportion of young stream water in winter and decrease it in summer. We conclude that changes in rainfall under present and future climate conditions can significantly alter the age of water in streams and, in turn, the pollution it carries.

In order to ensure that these goals will be achieved the provider of the MWSN must define some parameters that characterize the Service Level Agreement that occurs between MWSN provider and the MWSN customer. This paper addresses a solution behind an efficient and effective Service Level Agreement (SLA) design and implementation related to a Monitoring Wireless Sensor Network (MSN) and applies the SLA in the case of water resources management. The characteristics of the SLA in place between the MWSN provider and the MWSN customer must be defined by taking into consideration various parameters that are particular to the MWSN such as routing algorithms, recovery from failure, monitoring and reporting aspects. An appropriate definition of a SLA contract helps identify the responsibilities of both the provider and customer of the Monitoring Wireless Sensor Network (MSN) and makes the interaction between the provider and customer easier.																	1220-1766					DEC	2017	26	4					379	386		10.24846/v26i4y201701								WOS:000423249900002

Enhanced Denitrification Bioreactors Hold Promise for Mid-Atlantic Ditch Drainage	AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL LETTERS												There is strong interest in adapting denitrifying bioreactors to mid-Atlantic drainage systems to help address Chesapeake Bay water quality goals. Three ditch drainage-oriented bioreactors were constructed in 2015 in Maryland to evaluate site-specific design and installation concerns and nitrate (NO3-N) removal. All three bioreactor types removed NO3-N, as measured by load and/or concentration reduction, showing promise for denitrifying bioreactors in the mid-Atlantic's low gradient Coastal Plain landscape. The ditch diversion bioreactor (25% NO3-N load reduction; 0.97 g NO3-N removed m(-3) d(-1)) and the sawdust denitrification wall adjacent to a ditch (> 90% NO3-N concentration reduction; 1.9-2.9 g NO3-N removed m(-3) d(-1)) had removal rates within range of the literature. The in-ditch bioreactor averaged 65% NO3-N concentration reduction, but sedimentation is expected to be one of the biggest challenges. A robust water balance is critical for future assessment of bioreactors' contribution to water quality improvement in low gradient mid-Atlantic landscapes.																	2471-9625					DEC	2017	2	1							UNSP 170032	10.2134/ael2017.09.0032								WOS:000422884100023

Linking Soil Phosphorus to Dissolved Phosphorus Losses in the Midwest	AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL LETTERS												Harmful and nuisance algal blooms resulting from excess phosphorus (P) have placed agriculture in the spotlight of the water quality debate. Sixty-eight site years of P loading data (combined surface runoff and tile flow) from 36 fields in Ohio were used to see if a soil test P (STP) concentration could be identified that allowed P application while still meeting recommended loss thresholds. Regression analysis revealed that P application to soils with STP concentration in the "critical level" range would result in P losses above the recommended Annex 4 thresholds. In addition, fertilizer application increased the risk of dissolved reactive P (DRP) loss as compared to years in which fertilizer was not applied. We determined that STP was a good screening method to identify fields that are at risk for greater P loss, but STP alone was not a good predictor of DRP loss, suggesting that a more holistic approach that includes upland management, edge-of-field practices, and in-stream approaches will be required to decrease DRP loading.																	2471-9625					DEC	2017	2	1							UNSP 170004	10.2134/ael2017.02.0004								WOS:000422884100008

Nutrient Concentrations in Big Creek Correlate to Regional Watershed Land Use	AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL LETTERS												Nutrient concentrations in several streams of the Boston and Ozark Mountains region of Arkansas, including the Buffalo National River and its tributaries, have garnered tremendous interest. In particular, Big Creek has been the center of attention within the Buffalo River watershed because of a permitted concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO). The objectives of this paper were to put nutrient concentrations of Big Creek into the context of the stream nutrient and watershed land-use relationship and develop a framework to evaluate regional land-use impacts on regional water quality. Nutrient concentrations in streams draining the Boston and Ozark Mountains region were related to the intensity of watershed land use. Concentrations in Big Creek were similar to other watersheds in the ecoregion with similar land use, suggesting limited impact of the CAFO on Big Creek at the present time. However, this does not preclude future impacts, and longer-term monitoring continues.																	2471-9625					DEC	2017	2	1							UNSP 170027	10.2134/ael2017.08.0027								WOS:000422884100020

GRACE Detected Rise of Groundwater in the Sahelian Niger River Basin	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												West African regions along the Niger River experience climate and land cover changes that affect hydrological processes and therewith the distribution of fresh water resources (WR). This study provides an investigation of long-term changes in terrestrial water storages (TWS) of the Niger River basin and its subregions by analyzing a decade of satellite gravity data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. The location of large trends in TWS maps of differently processed GRACE solutions points to rising groundwater stocks. Soil moisture data from a global land surface model allow separating the effect of significantly increasing amount of WR from that of TWS variations. Surface water variations from a global water storage model validated with observations from altimetry data were applied to estimate the groundwater component in WR. For the whole Niger, a rise in groundwater stocks is estimated to be 9361km(3) between January 2003 and December 2013. A careful analysis of uncertainties in all data sets supports the significance of the groundwater rise. Our results confirm previous observations of rising water tables, indicating that effects of land cover changes on groundwater storage are relevant on basin scales. Areas with rising water storage are stocking a comfortable backup to mitigate possible future droughts and to deliver water to remote areas. This has implications for Niger water management strategies. Increasing groundwater recharges may be accompanied by reduction in water quality. This study helps to inform authority's decision to mitigate its negative impacts on local communities.																	2169-9313	2169-9356				DEC	2017	122	12					10459	10477		10.1002/2017JB014845								WOS:000423129200029

Historical and temporal trends of climatic parameters in North East India	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Accessing temporal trend of different meteorological parameters is essential for understanding the local climate changing pattern of a region. Quantitative estimates of the effect of climate change helps in understanding, planning, and management of water resources systems. In this study, monthly meteorological data were collected from 30 stations of north-east (NE) India for 1971-2010 and nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test and Sen slope were employed for detection and quantification of significant temporal trends, respectively. An ESRI ArcGIS toolbar "ArcTrends" was used for the above mentioned tasks. The results obtained for rainfall were of mixed nature and both increasing and decreasing significant trends were found for different stations in different months. Most of the negative trends were found in the months of July-August (monsoon), whereas, more stations showed positive trends in April-May (pre-monsoon), and October-November (post-monsoon), indicating inter-seasonal shifting of rainfall without much change in the annual total. Number of rainy days was found to have positive trends in March-May (pre-monsoon) and negative trends in September-December. Except some positive trends during June-December in Manipur and Meghalaya, there were no significant trends in maximum temperature. In some stations, minimum temperature was found to have significant increasing trends throughout the year indicating a general rising trend in NE India. Some major towns like Guwahati, Imphal, Agartala and Kailashshahar showed significant positive trends in mean temperature, mostly during June-December. Mean relative humidity was, in general, found to be significantly increasing, especially during February-March. In some stations, wind speed was found to have significant negative trends throughout the year, with Agartala being the most affected.

Performances of two membrane systems were evaluated in two different full-scale conventional water treatment plants in Istanbul. Low-pressure UF membranes were combined after settling and filtration units of Buyukcekmece and Emirli water treatment plants. Low-pressure UF systems were operated under vacuum and pressure conditions. The experimental results indicated that combining UF systems enhanced drinking water quality with respect to turbidity, TOC and UV254 removal. In all cases, vacuum-driven UF membranes provided higher treatment performance and low energy consumption comparing to pressure-driven system.

A total of nine stations were selected in the reservoir. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids (TSS) were studied. The results showed that the water was warmer at 0.5 m depth. As the depth increased, temperature in the reservoir decreased in the range of 4.40 degrees C to 7.35 degrees C from 0.5 to 20 m depth. The concentration of DO dropped to zero at 4-6 m depth leading to anoxic level. pH at 0.5 m depth ranged from 6.40 to 7.20 and they were significantly higher (p< 0.05) than those at 10 and 20 m. Chlorophyll-a at 0.5 m were in the range of 4.61 to 20.50 mg/L, relatively higher compared to 10 m and 20 m depths. The results obtained indicates that impoundment of Murum River generally caused water quality deterioration. In addition, this could be due to anthropogenic activities such as plantation and logging activities that are still going on within the catchment during the impoundment. Therefore, further continuous monitoring and investigation is required to determine the long-term water quality condition and identify factors that influence water quality in Murum Reservoir.																	0126-6039					DEC	2017	46	12					2367	2374		10.17576/jsm-2017-4612-13								WOS:000422856900013

Water Quality Index (WQI), descriptive statistics, Hurst exponent, fractal dimension and predictability index were estimated for each water parameter. WQI results showed that majority of samples fall in moderate category during 2005-2013, but monitoring site four falls under severe category (water unfit for domestic use). Brownian time series behaviour (a true random walk nature) exists between calcium (Ca2+) and electric conductivity (EC); magnesium (Mg2+) with EC; sodium (Na+) with EC; sulphate (SO42-) with EC; total dissolved solids (TDS) with chloride (Cl-) during pre-(2005-2013) and post-(2006-2013) monsoon season. These parameters have a closer value of Hurst exponent (H) with Brownian time series behaviour condition (H = 0.5). The result of times series analysis of water quality data shows a persistent behaviour (a positive autocorrelation) that has played a role between Cl-and Mg2+, Cl-and Ca2+, TDS and Na+, TDS and SO42-, TDS and Ca2+ in pre- and post-monsoon time series because of the higher value of H (> 1). Whereas an anti-persistent behaviour (or negative autocorrelation) was found between Cl-and EC, TDS and EC during pre-and post-monsoon due to low value of H. The work outline shows that the groundwater of few areas needs treatment before direct consumption, and it also needs to be protected from contamination.

We found that changes in ambient nutrient concentrations and temperature influenced different phytoplankton groups, which tended to have different N uptake strategies. The preferred N-source by Cyanobacteria was NH4+ while Dinophyceae and other groups seemed adapted to also take up NO3-, possibly due to competition. Potential uptake rates (maximum of 8.5 mu M-N hr(-1) for NH4+ and 1.3 mu M-N hr(-1) for NO3-) were high in comparison to previous reports from temperate freshwater or marine systems, likely due to elevated algal biomass and temperature. When normalized to biomass as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), specific uptake rates varied between 0.01-3.4 mu mol-N mu gChl-a(-1) day(-1) for NH4+ and <0.01-0.8 mu mol-N mu gChl-a(-1) day(-1) for NO3- and were comparable to those reported for other eutrophic and hypereutrophic aquatic systems. In addition, higher temperatures favored Cyanobacteria (e.g., Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Microcystis aeruginosa), while a more diverse community was found during colder months. Results highlight how high loading of reduced forms of nitrogen and high temperatures can exacerbate harmful Cyanobacteria blooms in tropical reservoirs and be a concern for drinking water quality.

The importance and widespread use of petroleum products and the threats posed by these products on surface water resources in Iran necessitates the access to numerical hydrodynamic and water quality simulation models with appropriate capabilities. Simulation the fate and transport of VOC in both flowing and standing water bodies is a fairly complex problem. In this research, CE-QUAL-W2 model is modified to simulate the fate and transport of VOC [i.e., Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), benzene] in standing and flowing water bodies. The performance of the modified CE-QUAL-W2 model is evaluated in a MTBE pollution spill at Khalife-Tarkhan river along the headwaters of Gheshlagh reservoir, Kordestan, Iran. The results show the modified CE-QUAL-W2 model's capability to depict the spatial and temporal variation of MTBE in comparison with recorded data from MTBE spill event of Gheshlagh reservoir. Based on the simulation results of modified CE-QUAL-W2 model, reservoir cleanup time in different meteorological and hydrological scenarios is evaluated. The results show Gheshlagh reservoir cleanup time reduced in scenarios that included air temperature reduction, wind speed increasing, and high inflow condition.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	23							803	10.1007/s12665-017-7108-5								WOS:000418850500003

Groundwater vulnerability mapping for a sub-catchment of the Rio La Venta watershed, Chiapas, Mexico	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Karst systems are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation and pollution due to their high hydraulic conductivity and points of rapid infiltration that allow quick influx of runoff and pollutants into the aquifer. The sustainability of non-contaminated groundwater in these systems is imperative for both humans and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. An important practice in managing groundwater sustainability involves assessing aquifer vulnerability. This study created the first groundwater vulnerability map (GVM) for a sub-catchment of the Rio La Venta watershed in Chiapas, Mexico, using an adaptation of the hazard-pathway-target method. This project also conducted the first tracer study in the Rio la Venta watershed to establish connectivity between the catchment and the Rio La Venta Canyon. Finally, this study evaluated the results of the GVM through a sensitivity analysis. Results of the GVM clearly demarcate areas of very high, high, moderate, and low vulnerability within the study area most of which being classified as low vulnerability. The zones of high vulnerability were successfully validated through two dye tracer tests that measured rapid groundwater flow velocities. With the limited resources available to land managers in this area, a problem common in many developing countries, tools that quickly and inexpensively highlight areas that require special protection to help maintain or improve water quality in their watersheds have great utility. Conveying this information to land managers and policymakers can lead to potential changes in current land use practices and allow for the reallocation of resources in support of reducing future negative human-landscape interactions.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	23							797	10.1007/s12665-017-7113-8								WOS:000418850500004

The majority of the population uses groundwater from shallow, rudimentary dug wells and also surface water from the Mapunda River, which crosses the city. The city has very poor systems for collecting domestic sewage and household wastes. The majority of domestic sewage is dumped directly into the Mapunda River or in pit latrines. In this study, the surface water quality and groundwater quality were assessed. In surface water, the low oxygen contents are related to the high temperature (T) in the warm rainy season and with high contents of oxygen-consuming organic pollution and nutrients, as shown by PCA, in both seasons. Anoxic conditions, with negative ORP values (-55.7 mV), are caused by oxygen-consuming organic pollution, added with low flow regime during the dry, cold season. The very low ecological quality of the surface water is also indicated by the high contents of -PO4 and -Cl-t (up to 2.00 and 0.44 mg L-1, respectively). The phosphate contamination is higher in the warm rainy season, due to higher run-off and higher T, as expressed by PCA, both in river water and groundwater. Most groundwater sampling points are contaminated with nitrate (contents up to 132 mg L-1). The pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), alkalinity, -Clt and K, determined in the surface water reflect the anthropic contribution to the river water. The variations in water bulk parameters (T, TDS, alkalinity, ORP, DO) and chemical species are indicative of pollution by diffuse sources (N-species, phosphates). The PCA shows that non-point sources such as the free discharge of household wastewater, intense laundering in the river, agriculture and animal grazing are the main contributors to low water quality, associated with seasonality and low contents of dissolved oxygen due to its consumption by organic matter. The multivariate analysis allows the evaluation of the changes in water quality, in fast-growing cities where the climate has a clear seasonality.

However, performance data for these facilities are generally lacking, particularly at the field scale. This study investigated the runoff quantity regulation and pollutant removal performance of bioswale and rain garden systems from 2014 to 2017. A performance assessment of these facilities demonstrated that anti-seepage rain garden, bioswale-A, and bioswale-B effectively retained inflow volumes by the filter media, reducing runoff volumes by 54.08, 98.25, and 77.65%, respectively, on average, with only two events of overflowing. According to the water quality data in 24 rainfall events, the main pollutant indexes for the new city include total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand, and the median values for their respective effluent event median concentrations were 1.29 and 40.13 mg/L for anti-seepage rain garden and 1.68 and 74.00 mg/L for bioswale-B systems. The mean values of pollutant removal of the three bioretention systems, except for infiltration rain garden, were 39.8-59.73% (median = 54.32%), 61.06-72.66% (median = 73.47%), and 76.67%-88.16% (median = 80.64%). Meanwhile, outflow volume of water was found to be most influenced by inflow volumes for the bioswales and anti-seepage rain garden. Mass removals were higher than concentrations owing to water volume attenuation. Based on the data of monitored pollution loads, this study estimated the annual pollutant load removal as 75.45 and 90.7% for anti-seepage rain garden and bioswale-B according to the percent of monitoring rainfall depth in total annual precipitation. This study also established the target pollutant service life model on the basis of accumulated annual load and media adsorption capacity. The results of this study will contribute to a greater understanding of the treatment performance of bioretention systems, assisting in the design, operation, and maintenance of them.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				DEC	2017	228	12							468	10.1007/s11270-017-3636-6								WOS:000419533000005

Tracking the Limnoecological History of Lake Hiidenvesi (Southern Finland) Using the Paleolimnological Approach	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												We examined a sediment record from Lake Hiidenvesi in southern Finland using paleolimnological methods to trace its limnoecological history. In our record, beginning from the 1940s, chironomid (Diptera) assemblages shifted from typical boreal taxa towards mesotrophic community assemblages at similar to 1960-1980 CE being finally replaced by eutrophic taxa from the 1990s onward. The diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages reflected relatively nutrient rich conditions throughout the record showing a further increase in eutrophic taxa from the 1970s onward. A chironomid-based reconstruction of late-winter hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions suggested anoxic conditions already in the 1950s, probably reflecting increased inlake production due to allochthonous nutrient inputs and related increase in biological oxygen consumption. However, the reconstruction also indicated large variability in long-term oxygen conditions that appear typical for the basin. With regard to nutrient status, chironomid- and diatom-based reconstructions of total phosphorus (TP) showed a similar trend throughout the record, although, chironomids indicated a more straightforward eutrophication process in the benthic habitat and seemed to reflect the intensified human activities in the catchment more strongly than diatoms. The DO and TP reconstructions were mostly similar in trends compared to the measured data available since the 1970s/1980s. However, the increase in TP during the most recent years in both reconstructions was not visible in the monitored data. The results of our multiproxy study emphasize the significance of including both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic systems in water quality assessments and provide important long-term limnoecological information that will be useful in the future when setting targets for restoration.

Spatial differences in mesozooplankton seasonality were recognized, both within and between estuaries, related to differences between sites in hydrodynamic features and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment that drive phytoplankton biomass seasonal cycles. The within estuary seasonal differences in mesozooplankton community were mainly shown through seaward time-advances in the seasonal peak from summer to spring along the salinity gradient, linked to differences in phytoplankton availability during the summer, in turn, related to nutrient availability. These differences were most marked in the estuary of Urdaibai, where zooplankton seasonal pattern at 35 salinity (high tidal flushing) resembled that of shelf waters, while at 35 of the estuary of Bilbao zooplankton showed an estuarine seasonal pattern due to the influence of the estuarine plume. Cirripede larvae contributed most to the mesozooplankton seasonal variability, except at the outer estuary of Bilbao, where cladocerans and fish eggs and larvae were the major contributors, and the inner estuary of Urdaibai, where gastropod larvae contributed most. Total mesozooplankton increased at 30 salinity of the estuary of Bilbao and 35 salinity of the estuary of Urdaibai. Interannual variability of mesozooplankton at the lowest salinity of the estuary of Bilbao was mainly accounted for by copepods due to the introduction of non indigenous species during estuarine rehabilitation from intense pollution. However, bivalve larvae and gastropod larvae showed the highest contributions at 35 salinity of the estuary of Urdaibai. At the rest of sites, the opposite interannual trends of polychaete larvae and hydromedusae generally made the highest contribution.

Freshwater inflow from watershed management is affecting this region and has deeply modified the salinity gradient. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were used to trace specific sources of organic matter and the influence of these sources of carbon on the diet of the eastern oyster in the Greater Everglades. Oysters, as well as particulate organic matter (POM) and benthic microalgae (BMA) were sampled in three bays at three different stations from upstream to downstream during both wet and dry seasons. Significant salinity differences were observed in all estuaries between summer (wet) and winter (dry) seasons and were linked to freshwater inputs into the bays. Temperature followed a typical seasonal trend. Oysters were enriched in delta N-15 compared with POM and BMA, and similarly or slightly enriched in delta C-13 for both seasons. Lighter delta C-13 values in the upper stations in the estuaries suggest input of organic matter from terrestrial sources. Stable isotopes showed that oysters fed more on POM than on BMA. Condition index of oysters varied between stations and seasons in the three estuaries. Because the quality of organic matter consumed by oysters ultimately impacts the health of the oyster, changes in water quality and quantity of freshwater entering estuaries will have implications for future management of the habitat for this ecologically and economically important species.

J	Jung, HB				Jung, Hun Bok			Nutrients and Heavy Metals Contamination in an Urban Estuary of Northern New Jersey	GEOSCIENCES												The Newark Bay Estuary in northern New Jersey contains one of the largest urban wetland complexes in the United States, but the majority of the wetlands and habitats have been lost due to urbanization and industrialization. Field and laboratory research was conducted to understand the impacts of human activities on the biogeochemistry of nutrients and heavy metals in the urban estuary. Concentrations of dissolved nutrients such as nitrate, ammonia, and phosphate were higher in the Hackensack River than in the Passaic River or the Newark Bay, while the Hackensack River was more deficient in dissolved oxygen. Sediment oxygen demand and mobilization of nutrients were higher in sediments with higher organic matter content as a result of microbial decomposition of organic matter. Heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn) and organic matter were more enriched in finer sediment grains such as silt and clay. There were positive correlations among heavy metals as well as organic matter in sediments. The results suggest that fine grained sediments, which can be readily suspended and transported during tidal cycles, may play a significant role in biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and heavy metals in the urban estuary. It appears that the current sources of nutrients and heavy metals in the water and sediment of the Newark Bay Estuary are mainly domestic effluents from sewage treatment plants during non-storm periods as well as combined sewer overflows during storm events, but further research including more frequent and pervasive water and sediment quality monitoring during dry and wet periods is needed.

All studied treatments were found to be effective in decolorization of the effluents under study. Fenton treatment followed by A. niger showed excellent potential for the maximum decolorization of the synthetic and industrial effluents under study. The effectiveness of sequential treatment was evaluated by water quality parameters such as total organic carbon (TOC), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) before and after each treatment. The results indicated that A. niger is an effective candidate for detoxification of textile wastewaters.																	1420-3049					DEC	2017	22	12							2244	10.3390/molecules22122244								WOS:000419242400208

The coupled models can serve to derive more knowledge on the water temperature impact on lake ecosystems. For this purpose, we used a physically-based hydrodynamic model coupled with a transport model to examine the spatial and temporal behavior and primary causal factors of water temperature within the floodplain of Poyang Lake that is representative of shallow and large lakes in China. Model performance is assessed through comparison with field observations and remote sensing data. The daily water temperature variations within Poyang Lake were reproduced reasonably well by the hydrodynamic model, with the root mean square errors of 1.5-1.9 degrees C. The modeling results indicate that the water temperature exhibits distinct spatial and temporal variability. The mean seasonal water temperatures vary substantially from 29.1 degrees C in summer to 7.7 degrees C in winter, with the highest value in August and the lowest value in January. Although the degree of spatial variability differed considerably between seasons, the water temperature generally decreases from the shallow floodplains to the main flow channels of the lake. As expected, the lake water temperature is primarily affected by the air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and the inflow temperature, whereas other factors such as cloud cover, relative humidity, precipitation, evaporation and lake topography may play a complementary role in influencing temperature. The current work presents a first attempt to use a coupled model approach, which is therefore a useful tool to investigate the water temperature behavior and its major causal factors for a large floodplain lake system. It would have implications for improving the understanding of Poyang Lake water temperature and supporting planning and management of the lake, its water quality and ecosystem functioning.

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) dynamics has a significant impact on inland water ecology and water resource management. In-situ data in this region are scarce and, consequently, the environmental factors triggering SPM variability are yet to be understood. This study addresses these issues using remote sensing optical data. Turbidity and SPM of the Agoufou Lake in Sahelian Mali were measured from October 2014 to present, providing a large range of `values (SPM ranging from 106 to 4178 mg/L). These data are compared to satellite reflectance from Landsat (ETM+, OLI) and MODIS (MOD09GQ, MYD09GQ). For each of these sensors, a spectral band in the near infrared region is found to be well suited to retrieve turbidity and SPM, up to very high values (R-2 = 0.70) seldom addressed by remote sensing studies. The satellite estimates are then employed to assess the SPM dynamics in the main lakes and ponds of the Gourma region and its links to environmental and anthropogenic factors. The main SPM seasonal peak is observed in the rainy season (June to September) in relation to precipitation and sediment transport. A second important peak occurs during the dry season, highlighting the importance of resuspension mechanisms in maintaining high values of SPM. Three different periods are observed: first, a relatively low winds period in the early dry season, when SPM decreases rapidly due to deposition; then, a period of wind-driven resuspension in JanuaryMarch; and lastly, an SPM deposition period in April-May, when the monsoon replaces the winter trade wind. Overall, a significant increase of 27% in SPM values is observed between 2000 and 2016 in the Agoufou Lake. The significant spatio-temporal variability in SPM revealed by this study highlights the importance of high resolution optical sensors for continuous monitoring of water quality in these poorly instrumented regions.

Theoretical and methodological challenges exist in assessing ecological risk of watershed ecosystem that is imposed by natural changes or human activities. To fill this research gap, this research proposes an interdisciplinary and quantitative methodology based on some techniques such as the Procedure for Ecological Tiered Assessment of Risk (PETAR), the Entropy, and the Celluar Automata Markov (CA-Markov). We focused on six vulnerable environmental variables, namely land-use change, water quantity, water quality, gross domestic product (GDP), environmental pollutants, and soil erosion in the Huai River watershed in the Henan Province in order to build multi-dimensional quantitative method. Further, the Coupling Coordination Degree Model is constructed, and the threshold index is also addressed to reflect the limitation of ecological risk. Our results show that the spatio-temperal distribution of the eco-environmental quality has greatly varied across this study area during different time spans. Natural eco-environmental quality has moderately degraded in 70% of this study area (mainly agricultural region), at a prefectural level from 2000 to 2010, and has slightly improved over the agricultural region (<170 m above sea level) during 2010-2015. However, when considering negative stressors from human social system on the natural ecosystem, the extent and distribution of the ecological risk varied across the whole area during 2000-2015. The results show that there was almost 90.40% of this region under the ecological risk, with varying extents over the study time, e.g., Kaifeng, Shangqiu, Xuchang, and Xinyang, with a moderate deterioration in the eco-environmental quality, and Zhengzhou with a slight deterioration in the eco-environmental quality.

J	Romero, JMP; Hallett, SH; Jude, S				Romero, Juan Manuel Ponce; Hallett, Stephen H.; Jude, Simon			Leveraging Big Data Tools and Technologies: Addressing the Challenges of the Water Quality Sector	SUSTAINABILITY												The water utility sector is subject to stringent legislation, seeking to address both the evolution of practices within the chemical/pharmaceutical industry, and the safeguarding of environmental protection, and which is informed by stakeholder views. Growing public environmental awareness is balanced by fair apportionment of liability within-sector. This highly complex and dynamic context poses challenges for water utilities seeking to manage the diverse chemicals arising from disparate sources reaching Wastewater Treatment Plants, including residential, commercial, and industrial points of origin, and diffuse sources including agricultural and hard surface water run-off. Effluents contain broad ranges of organic and inorganic compounds, herbicides, pesticides, phosphorus, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals of emerging concern. These potential pollutants can be in dissolved form, or arise in association with organic matter, the associated risks posing significant environmental challenges. This paper examines how the adoption of new Big Data tools and computational technologies can offer great advantage to the water utility sector in addressing this challenge. Big Data approaches facilitate improved understanding and insight of these challenges, by industry, regulator, and public alike. We discuss how Big Data approaches can be used to improve the outputs of tools currently in use by the water industry, such as SAGIS (Source Apportionment GIS system), helping to reveal new relationships between chemicals, the environment, and human health, and in turn provide better understanding of contaminants in wastewater (origin, pathways, and persistence). We highlight how the sector can draw upon Big Data tools to add value to legacy datasets, such as the Chemicals Investigation Programme in the UK, combined with contemporary data sources, extending the lifespan of data, focusing monitoring strategies, and helping users adapt and plan more efficiently. Despite the relative maturity of the Big Data technology and adoption in many wider sectors, uptake within the water utility sector remains limited to date. By contrast with the extensive range of applications of Big Data in in other sectors, highlight is drawn to how improvements are required to achieve the full potential of this technology in the water utility industry.

To mitigate this problem, we designed 2 sets (southern and northern) of land-based and farm-scale sequential integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems in order to reduce water pollution and to diversify and optimize aquaculture products in coastal southern Taiwan. In each system, the 1st pond cultivated milkfish as the main aquaculture product, the 2nd pond cultivated Portuguese oysters as the product to reduce suspended particles, and the 3rd pond cultivated the seaweed Gracilaria sp. as feed and to absorb nutrients. Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) were added to the southern system in order to reduce nutrients. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare performance parameters of the compartments and the overall IMTA systems preliminarily. Our results showed that the southern system with the addition of PSB had lower PO4-3-P, slightly higher turbidity, and higher brown algal biomass than the northern system. In the southern system, PO4-3-P and cyanobacteria levels were lowest at the end of the seaweed pond. In the northern system, NO2--N and phytoplankton levels were lowest at the end of the seaweed pond. Turbidity was reduced in the oyster pond and further reduced in the Gracilaria pond in both systems. The high seaweed yield in the northern system indicated substantial nutrient absorption. Advantages and limitations in terms of water purification and aquaculture production of these IMTA systems are evaluated in the present paper.																	2071-1050					DEC	2017	9	12							UNSP 2173	10.3390/su9122173								WOS:000419231500022

To date, few numerical models are able to simulate hydrological processes at catchment scale at a reasonable time scale to describe flash events with accurate details. Considering a similar to 810 km(2) Mediterranean river coastal basin (southwestern France) as a study case, the objective of the present study was to assess the ability of the sub-daily module of the lumped Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to simulate discharge (1) time-continuously, by testing two sub-basin delineation schemes, two catchment sizes, and two output time-steps; and (2) at flood time-scale, by comparing the performances of SWAT to the performances of the event-based fully distributed MARINE model when simulating flash flood events. We showed that there was no benefit of decreasing the size of the minimum drainage area (e.g., from similar to 15 km(2) down to similar to 1 km(2)) when delineating sub-basins in SWAT. We also showed that both the MARINE and SWAT models were equally able to reproduce peak discharge, flood timing and volume, and that they were both limited by rainfall and soil data. Hence, the SWAT model appears to be a reliable modelling tool to predict discharge over long periods of time in large flash-flood-prone basins.				sauvage, sabine/P-1742-2015	sauvage, sabine/0000-0002-6360-1036; Roux, Helene/0000-0001-7076-5015; Boithias, Laurie/0000-0003-3414-7329												2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							929	10.3390/w9120929								WOS:000419225500024

This reservoir controls the high part of Capibaribe river basin, area affected several actions that can compromise the reservoir water quality such as disposal of domestic sewage, industrial wastewater and agriculture with use of fertilizers. This study aimed to identify the factors that lead to water quality of the Jucazinho reservoir using a database containing information of nine years of reservoir water quality monitoring in line with a multivariate statistical technique known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To use this technique, it was selected two components which determine the quality of the reservoir water. The first principal component, ranging from an annual basis, explained the relationship between the development of cyanobacteria, the concentration of dissolved solids and electrical conductivity, comparing it with the variation in the dam volume, total phosphorus levels and turbidity. The second principal component, ranging from a mensal basis, explained the photosynthetic activity performed by cyanobacteria confronting with the variation in the dam volume. It observed the relationship between water quality parameters with rainfall, featuring an annual and seasonal pattern that can be used as reference to behaviour studies of this reservoir.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							955	10.3390/w9120955								WOS:000419225500049

More specifically, this work is comprised of: (i) analysis of Chl-a and trophic dynamics; (ii) characterization of CDOM; (iii) estimation of Chl-a and CDOM from OLI/Landsat-8 and RapidEye imagery. The monitoring lasted 20 months within a multi-year drought, which contributed to water-quality deterioration. Chl-a and trophic state analysis showed a highly eutrophic status for the perennial reservoir during the entire study period, while the non-perennial reservoirs ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic, with changes associated with the first events of the rainy season. CDOM characterization suggests that the perennial reservoir is mostly influenced by autochthonous sources, while allochthonous sources dominate the non-perennial ones. Spectral-group classification assigned the perennial reservoir as a CDOM-moderate and highly eutrophic reservoir, whereas the non-perennial ones were assigned as CDOM-rich and oligotrophic-dystrophic reservoirs. The remote sensing initiative was partially successful: the Chl-a was best modelled using RapidEye for the perennial one; whereas CDOM performed best with Landsat-8 for non-perennial reservoirs. This investigation showed potential for retrieving water quality parameters in dry areas with small reservoirs.				de Araujo, Jose Carlos/J-9629-2012; Foerster, Saskia/D-3881-2011	de Araujo, Jose Carlos/0000-0002-2649-151X; Foerster, Saskia/0000-0001-7752-7394												2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							913	10.3390/w9120913								WOS:000419225500008

Quantifying Effectiveness of Streambank Stabilization Practices on Cedar River, Nebraska	WATER												Excessive sediment is a major pollutant to surface waters worldwide. In some watersheds, streambanks are a significant source of this sediment, leading to the expenditure of billions of dollars in stabilization projects. Although costly streambank stabilization projects have been implemented worldwide, long-term monitoring to quantify their success is lacking. There is a critical need to document the long-term success of streambank restoration projects. The objectives of this research were to (1) quantify streambank retreat before and after the stabilization of 18 streambanks on the Cedar River in North Central Nebraska, USA; (2) assess the impact of a large flood event; and (3) determine the most cost-efficient stabilization practice. The stabilized streambanks included jetties (10), rock-toe protection (1), slope reduction/gravel bank (1), a retaining wall (1), rock vanes (2), and tree revetments (3). Streambank retreat and accumulation were quantified using aerial images from 1993 to 2016. Though streambank retreat has been significant throughout the study period, a breached dam in 2010 caused major flooding and streambank erosion on the Cedar River. This large-scale flood enabled us to quantify the effect of one extreme event and evaluate the effectiveness of the stabilized streambanks. With a 70% success rate, jetties were the most cost-efficient practice and yielded the most deposition. If minimal risk is unacceptable, a more costly yet immobile practice such as a gravel bank or retaining wall is recommended.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							930	10.3390/w9120930								WOS:000419225500025						
J	Dinka, MO				Dinka, Megersa Olumana			Delineating the Drainage Structure and Sources of Groundwater Flux for Lake Basaka, Central Rift Valley Region of Ethiopia	WATER												As opposed to most of the other closed basin type rift valley lakes in Ethiopia, Lake Basaka is found to be expanding at an alarming rate. Different studies indicated that the expansion of the lake is challenging the socio-economics and environment of the region significantly. This study result and previous reports indicated that the lake's expansion is mostly due to the increased groundwater (GW) flux to the lake. GW flux accounts for about 56% of the total inflow in recent periods (post 2000) and is found to be the dominant factor for the hydrodynamics and existence of the lake. The analysis of the drainage network for the area indicates the existence of a huge recharge area on the western and upstream side of the catchment. This catchment has no surface outlet; hence most of the incoming surface runoff recharges the GW system. The recharge area is the main source of GW flux to the lake. In addition to this, the likely sources/causes of GW flux to the lake could be: (i) an increase of GW recharge following the establishment of irrigation schemes in the region; (ii) subsurface inflow from far away due to rift system influence, and (iii) lake neotectonism. Overall, the lake's expansion has damaging effect to the region, owing to its poor water quality; hence the identification of the real causes of GW flux and mitigation measures are very important for sustainable lake management. Therefore a comprehensive and detailed investigation of the parameters related to GW flux and the interaction of the lake with the GW system of the area is highly recommended.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							797	10.3390/w9120797								WOS:000419225500001

Impact of Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Rainfall Inputs on Integrated Catchment Dissolved Oxygen Simulations	WATER												Integrated Catchment Modelling aims to simulate jointly urban drainage systems, wastewater treatment plant and rivers. The effect of rainfall input uncertainties in the modelling of individual urban drainage systems has been discussed in several studies already. However, this influence changes when simultaneously simulating several urban drainage subsystems and their impact on receiving water quality. This study investigates the effect of the characteristics of rainfall inputs on a large-scale integrated catchment simulator for dissolved oxygen predictions in the River Dommel (The Netherlands). Rainfall products were generated with varying time-aggregation (10, 30 and 60 min) deriving from different sources of data with increasing spatial information: (1) Homogeneous rainfall from a single rain gauge; (2) block kriging from 13 rain gauges; (3) averaged C-Band radar estimation and (4) kriging with external drift combining radar and rain gauge data with change of spatial support. The influence of the different rainfall inputs was observed at combined sewer overflows (CSO) and dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics in the river. Comparison of the simulations with river monitoring data showed a low sensitivity to temporal aggregation of rainfall inputs and a relevant impact of the spatial scale with a link to the storm characteristics to CSO and DO concentration in the receiving water.

J	Rahman, A				Rahman, Ataur			Recent Advances in Modelling and Implementation of Rainwater Harvesting Systems towards Sustainable Development	WATER												Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is perhaps the most ancient practice to meet water supply needs. It has received renewed attention since the 1970s as a productive water source, water savings and conservation means, and sustainable development tool. In RWH, it is important to know how much water can be harvested at a given location from a given catchment size, whether the harvested water meets the intended water quality, whether the RWH system is economically viable and whether the state regulations favor the RWH. Furthermore, the selected RWH system should be suitable to local rainfall and field conditions, downstream impacts, and socio-economic and cultural characteristics. In this regard, this paper provides an overview of the special issue on Rainwater Harvesting: Quantity, Quality, Economics and State Regulations. The selected papers cover a wide range of issues that are relevant to RWH such as regionalization of design curves, use of spatial technology, urban agriculture, arid-region water supply, multi criteria analysis and application of artificial neural networks.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							959	10.3390/w9120959								WOS:000419225500053

However, studies on the response of mixed algal cultures and associated water quality parameters to ultrasound are limited. In this lab-scale sonication, the removal of cyanobacteria at a pre-set frequency of 200 kHz on mixed algae suspensions collected from a eutrophic lake was investigated. The caution (17.5 mu g/L) and outbreak (1450 mu g/L) alert levels in terms of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations of the initial samples were each sonicated for 10, 15, and 20 min, and then kept in an incubator. Fifteen minutes of sonication resulted in best removal efficiency of 0.94 and 0.77, at an ultrasonic dose of 30 kWh/m(3) at the outbreak and caution level concentrations, respectively. Immediately after 15 min sonication, and after standing in the incubator for a day, chlorophyll-a removal efficiencies of 0.28 and 0.90 were achieved in the outbreak level, respectively, and the matching removal efficiencies for the caution level were 0.23 and 0.64. Even though the removal was substantial in both cases, the final 147 mu g/L chlorophyll-a concentration of the outbreak, which is itself still in the outbreak level range, shows that ultrasonication is not effective to satisfactorily remove algae from a concentrated suspension. Total dissolved nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand were reduced, overall, due to sonication. However, total dissolved phosphorus of the concentrated level was increased during the treatment. Although sonication needs further replicated experimental testing in whole-lake systems, our results show that 200 kHz sonication was able to reduce chlorophyll-a concentrations in small-scale laboratory tests.																	2073-4441					DEC	2017	9	12							915	10.3390/w9120915								WOS:000419225500010

Despite intensive research on possible hydrological responses in those regions to a warmer environment, our knowledge on erosion and sediment yield induced by the climate change in high-latitude headwaters is still limited. In this study, we estimated suspended sediment yields from 2021 to 2050 in a typical headwater area of far Northeast China to elucidate potential impacts of future climate change on surface runoff and erosion in higher latitude regions. We first parameterized the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) using historical measurements to estimate runoff from the river basin. The model performed well in both the calibration (2006-2011) and the validation (2012-2014) periods, with an R-2 of 0.85 and 0.88 and a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.7 and 0.73, respectively. We also utilized historical measurements on sediment yields from the period 2006-2014 to develop a runoff-sediment yield rating curve, and the rating curve obtained an excellent goodness of fit (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.001). We then applied the calibrated SWAT model to two climate change projections, also known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), for the period from 2021 to 2050 to obtain future runoff estimates. These runoff estimates were then used to predict future sediment yield by using the developed runoff-sediment yield rating curve. Our study found a significant increase of annual sediment yield (p < 0.05) for both climate change projections (RCP4.5 = 237%; RCP8.5 = 133%) in this, China's high-latitude region. The increases of sediment yield were prevalent in summer and autumn, varying from 102-299% between the two RCPs scenarios. Precipitation was the dominated factor that determined the variation of runoff and sediment yield. A warming climate could bring more snowmelt-induced spring runoff and longer rainy days in autumn, hence leading to higher erosion. These findings demonstrate that under the changing climate, soils in this high-latitude headwater area would be eroded twice to three times that of the baseline period (1981-2010), indicating a potential risk to the downstream water quality and reservoir management.

An integrated approach for assessment of groundwater quality in and around uranium mineralized zone, Gogi region, Karnataka, India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Assessment of groundwater quality is an important aspect of water security, which is the key to ensure sustainable development. The objective of the study is to bring out an integrated approach for assessment of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes. Gogi region, Karnataka, India was chosen as the study area due to the effect of the presence of medium-grade uranium deposits. An integrated approach including the concentration of major ions, trace elements and uranium was employed to investigate the quality of groundwater. Totally, 367 groundwater samples were collected periodically from 52 wells distributes over the Gogi region and the parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3(-), Zn, Pb, Cu, and uranium of groundwater were analysed. Spatial distribution maps of various chemical constituents were prepared using geographic information system and its temporal variation was plotted in box and whisker plot. The analytical data were compared with Bureau of Indian Standards and World Health Organisation standards to determine drinking water quality and parameters such as salinity hazard, alkalinity hazard and percent sodium were estimated to assess the irrigation quality. Multivariate statistical analysis by cluster analysis was also performed which results in two groups consisting of wells with unsuitable water for drinking purposes. Groundwater in about 15% of the sampling wells were found to be unsuitable for domestic purpose based on TDS and about 17% were unsuitable based on uranium concentration. Finally, integration of spatial variation in TDS and uranium reveals that about 25% of the wells were unsuitable for domestic purposes. It is suggested that such an integrated approach needs to be formulated considering major ions, trace elements and radioactive elements for proper assessment of water quality. Implementation of managed aquifer recharge structures in the study area is suggested since it would potentially reduce the concentration of ions.

Global warming and other environmental changes have favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk, and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1 degrees C) and a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85%), as well as independent effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild among invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate and fish communities have shifted from large-sized organisms with low fecundity to prolific, small-sized organisms, with early maturity, as a response to increased predation pressure.

Evaluation of the natural coagulant Moringa oleifera as a pretreatment for SODIS in contaminated turbid water	SOLAR ENERGY												Solar Disinfection of water (SODIS) is a treatment method that traditionally exposes low turbidity water filled in clear bottles to direct sunlight up to 6 h. Typically, water should have turbidity lower than 30 NTU before solar exposure; however turbidities of water sources in communities vary and can reach higher than 200 NTU. In order to reduce turbidity, flocculating agents like Moringa oleifera (Moringa) may be used. In this study we assess the efficacy of Moringa to clear turbid water as a pretreatment for SODIS. We initially evaluate two preparations powdered seeds and an aqueous filtrate of the seeds, to determine if these can benefit SODIS in turbid, E. coli contaminated water (Experiment 1). We show that powdered Moringa seeds reduce turbidity best and that SODIS treatment of highly turbid water was effective regardless of reduced turbidity. Overnight, however; a bio-active sludge layer formed. We then determined if 24 h Moringa pretreatment and decanting, can maintain water quality over an extended period (Experiment 2). After 24 h Moringa treatment showed a 2.1 log reduction in E. coli, increasing following SODIS (6-log) E. coli without nightly recovery or sludge formation. Untreated turbid controls showed SODIS disinfection after 6 h direct sunlight; however, nightly regrowth and sludge layer formation occurred by 48 h. These results suggest that SODIS is capable of inactivating bacteria in highly turbid water at 6 h; however, active biofilm sludge layers formed by 48 h. We conclude that, for longer term water storage, we find a combination of Moringa seed powder pretreatment prior to SODIS to be optimal.

River temperature modelling: A review of process-based approaches and future directions	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												River temperature has a major influence on biophysical processes in lotic environments. River temperature is expected to increase due to climate change, with potentially adverse consequences for water quality and ecosystems. Consequently, a better understanding of the drivers of river temperature space-time variability is important for developing adaptation strategies. However, existing river temperature archives are often of low resolution or short timespans, and the analysis of patterns or trends can therefore be difficult. In light of these limitations, researchers have increasingly used models to generate river temperature estimates suitable for addressing fundamental and applied questions in river science. Of these models, process-based approaches are well suited to helping improve knowledge of the mechanisms controlling river temperature, because of their ability to explore the energy (and water) fluxes responsible for temperature patterns. While process-based modelling approaches can often be more data intensive than their statistical counterparts, they offer significant advantages with regard to simulating the impacts of projected land-use or climate change, and can provide valuable insights for informing the development of statistical models at larger scales. However, a wide range of process-based river temperature models exist, and choosing the most appropriate model for a given investigation requires careful consideration. In this paper, we review the foundations of process-based river temperature modelling and critically evaluate the features and functionality of existing models with a view to helping river scientists better understand their utility. In conclusion, we discuss key considerations and limitations of currently available process-based models and advocate directions for future research. We hope that this review will enable river researchers and managers to make informed decisions regarding model selection and spur the continued refinement of process-based temperature models for addressing fundamental and applied questions in the river sciences.

We evaluated the insect community in streams impacted by agriculture and mining, and determined how these activities affected the community. We studied six streams in Caldas (Colombia), two with mining and two with agriculture impact. We collected the insects using a Surber net with three replicates per substrate (fine sediment, stones, and litter). In total, 12 502 aquatic insects were collected. The most representative genera were Baetodes, Simulium, and Cricotopus (57.7 %). Streams with agricultural activity had lower aquatic insects diversity than mining impact (F-2,(309) = 21.82, p = 0.001). The agriculture areas presented a structure dominated by Simulium and Cricotopus (Diptera, pollution-tolerant morphospecies). Baetodes dominated in stones substrate, Cricotopus in sediment, and Simulium and Cricotopus dominated in litter (F-2,F-309 = 2.84, p = 0.001). Therefore, both factors (impact and substrate type) are being important in determining the diversity of aquatic insects. Our results suggested that agricultural activity has a higher impact on the diversity of aquatic insects, which may be associated with the loss of riparian vegetation.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				DEC	2017	65	4					1635	1659										WOS:000418999900031

Crop water stress is difficult to measure in real-time, but can be computed using agricultural system models. In this study, an irrigation scheduling method and its facilitate software based on RZWQM2 model (Root Zone Water Quality Model) predicted crop water stress were developed and evaluated. The timing of irrigation was based on the occurrence of model-simulated water stress, while the depth of irrigation was based on the fraction of the soil moisture deficit (K) needed to replenish the soil water content (0) at any given time to field capacity (theta(fc)), Le., from gamma(to), theta(to) theta(to) + K (theta(fc)-theta(to)). The predicted water stress for different K values was tested based on RZWQM2 scenarios calibrated against data collected in a drip-irrigated corn (Zea mays L.) field near Greeley, Colorado, USA between 2008 and 2010, and in a sprinkler irrigated soybean [Glycine max (L.)

For the Colorado site, the simulated full irrigation (K = 1) using this newly developed water stress-based irrigation approach saved 30.5%, 17.3% and 7.1% in total irrigation depth in successive years, whereas higher frequency with 60-90% of full irrigation at each event (0.6 <= K <= 0.9) provided water savings of as much as 35%, 30%, and 16%, respectively. The water stress-based irrigation scheme showed that crop yield was not affected, with a negligible change about 0.03-3.81% decrease. These water savings were a result of the water stress-based irrigation regime maintaining sufficient water to meet crop root water uptake requirements without constantly fully rehydrating the soil, thereby minimizing evaporation from the soil surface and soil water storage after grain filling. For the Mississippi site, this newly developed water stress-based irrigation software could improve crop yield by 291 kg ha(-1) though consume 3.43 cm more water than field irrigation regime. Similarly, high frequency irrigation (lower K) under water stress-based regime resulted in higher water use efficiency. This study suggested that the water stress-based irrigation scheme could save water use and maintain crop yield in semi-arid region, while in humid region it could increase crop yield while consume more water. Further work is needed to install this system in an irrigated field and test its performance under different climate and soil conditions.

Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have been widely used to develop numerous semiempirical models all over the world. In this paper, many of these models perform satisfactorily either in a single water body or in many similar turbid water environments, however, their performance drops when data from oligo-to-eutrophic environments are used to monitor all reservoirs simultaneously. Most of them tend to overestimate TSMat low concentration. Two separate model calibrations were used to monitor the spatio-temporal variability of TSM in two oligo-to-eutrophic reservoirs, Nova Avanhandava (Nav) and Barra Bonita (BB), situated in the cascade system of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The exponential model using MODIS band 1 yielded the best accuracy for BB (RMSE = 3.66 mg/L) and MODIS band 1 based linear model showed the best performance for Nav (RMSE = 0.37 mg/L). The distribution of TSM in Nav showed comparatively low and homogenous concentrations for the entire reservoir but the magnitude doubled for a period between May and October. The same seasonal variability occurred in BB showing increased TSM trend in October compared to May, but the spatial variability was not homogeneous because of the runoff from Piracicaba River, which is the main contributor of TSM. Rainfall associated runoff and land use and land cover were the principal factors for TSM variability.

Uncertainties and applications of satellite-derived coastal water quality products	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent and forthcoming launches of a plethora of ocean color radiometry sensors, coupled with increasingly adopted free and open data policies are expected to boost usage of satellite ocean color data and drive the demand to use these data in a quantitative and routine manner. Here we review factors that introduce uncertainties to various satellite-derived water quality products and recommend approaches to minimize the uncertainty of a specific product. We show that the regression relationships between remote-sensing reflectance and water turbidity (in terms of nephelometric units) established for different regions tend to converge and therefore it is plausible to develop a global satellite water turbidity product derived using a single algorithm. In contrast, solutions to derive suspended particulate matter concentration are much less generalizable; in one case it might be more accurate to estimate this parameter based on satellite-derived particulate backscattering coefficient, whereas in another the nonagal particulate absorption coefficient might be a better proxy. Regarding satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration, known to be subject to large uncertainties in coastal waters, studies summarized here clearly indicate that the accuracy of classical reflectance band-ratio algorithms depends largely on the contribution of phytoplankton to total light absorption coefficient as well as the degree of correlation between phytoplankton and the dominant nonalgal contributions. Our review also indicates that currently available satellite-derived water quality products are restricted to optically significant materials, whereas many users are interested in toxins, nutrients, pollutants, and pathogens. Presently, proxies or indicators for these constituents are inconsistently (and often incorrectly) developed and applied. Progress in this general direction will remain slow unless, (i) optical oceanographers and environmental scientists start collaborating more closely and make optical and environmental measurements in parallel, (ii) more efforts are devoted to identifying optical, ecological, and environmental forerunners of autochthonous water quality issues (e.g., onsite growth of pathogens), and, (iii) environmental processes associated with the source, transport, and transformation of allochthonous issues (e.g., transport of nutrients) are better understood. Accompanying these challenges, the need still exists to conduct fundamental research in satellite ocean color radiometry, including development of more robust atmospheric correction methods as well as inverse models for coastal regions where optical properties of both aerosols and hydrosols are complex.

The Chari, 1200 km long, is Chad's major water source. Municipal sewage, industrial wastewater discharge, and seasonal run-off from agriculture are regularly fed into the river. Several trace metals such as Cu, Zn, Fe, Ni, Cr, Mn, and Cd, were measured in different sampling stations located along the Chari River at N'Djamena in different campaigns from 2008 to 2010. Overall, manganese, zinc, chromium, and copper concentration levels were mainly in the range of the permissible limits prescribed byWHOguidelines (WHO 2011). Nickel, iron, and cadmium concentrations were still high. This preliminary study allowed us to identify the magnitude of toxic pollutants, which are responsible for Chari River water contamination in the study area. This study revealed that urgent measures must be taken to protect the local people from health problems resulting from high concentrations of heavy metals.					clement, yohann/0000-0002-9852-2856; Lanteri, Pierre/0000-0002-8244-9834												2305-6304					DEC	2017	5	4							26	10.3390/toxics5040026								WOS:000419073100004						
J	Churro, C; Azevedo, J; Vasconcelos, V; Silva, A				Churro, Catarina; Azevedo, Joana; Vasconcelos, Vitor; Silva, Alexandra			Detection of a Planktothrix agardhii Bloom in Portuguese Marine Coastal Waters	TOXINS												Cyanobacteria blooms are frequent in freshwaters and are responsible for water quality deterioration and human intoxication. Although, not a new phenomenon, concern exists on the increasing persistence, scale, and toxicity of these blooms. There is evidence, in recent years, of the transfer of these toxins from inland to marine waters through freshwater outflow. However, the true impact of these blooms in marine habitats has been overlooked. In the present work, we describe the detection of Planktothrix agardhii, which is a common microcystin producer, in the Portuguese marine coastal waters nearby a river outfall in an area used for shellfish harvesting and recreational activities. P. agardhii was first observed in November of 2016 in seawater samples that are in the scope of the national shellfish monitoring system. This occurrence was followed closely between November and December of 2016 by a weekly sampling of mussels and water from the sea pier and adjacent river mouth with salinity ranging from 35 to 3. High cell densities were found in the water from both sea pier and river outfall, reaching concentrations of 4,960,608 cellsL(-1) and 6810.3 x 10(6) cellsL(-1) respectively. Cultures were also established with success from the environment and microplate salinity growth assays showed that the isolates grew at salinity 10. HPLC-PDA analysis of total microcystin content in mussel tissue, water biomass, and P. agardhii cultures did not retrieve a positive result. In addition, microcystin related genes were not detected in the water nor cultures. So, the P. agardhii present in the environment was probably a non-toxic strain. This is, to our knowledge, the first report on a P. agardhii bloom reaching the sea and points to the relevance to also monitoring freshwater harmful phytoplankton and related toxins in seafood harvesting and recreational coastal areas, particularly under the influence of river plumes.

Detecting Eutrophication Symptoms in a Subtropical Semi-Arid Coastal Lagoon by Means of Three Different Methods	WETLANDS												Excess supply of nutrients of anthropogenic origin is one of the main drivers of global change that is affecting the ecological function and provision of ecosystem services by coastal wetlands. This study examines the response of a subtropical semi-arid coastal lagoon to anthropogenic nutrient input, through the use and comparison of eutrophication indices and models, and compares the usefulness of such methods to identify eutrophication symptoms. The Lobos Lagoon is located on the eastern coast of the Gulf of California and receives agricultural and urban wastewater discharges. To identify potential eutrophication symptoms, the Trophic IndeX (TRIX), the Arid Zone Coastal Water Quality Index (AZCI) along with the Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status (ASSETS) model were used. Lobos Lagoon was found to have good environmental condition; however eutrophication symptoms were identified in the zone where untreated urban and agricultural wastewaters are discharged. Results obtained using the three methods were consistent and, thus, their performance can be considered as good and complementary, and can be used to evaluate the extent of eutrophication in subtropical semi-arid coastal lagoons.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2017	37	6					1105	1118		10.1007/s13157-017-0944-y								WOS:000419197800010

Comparative ecological transcriptomics and the contribution of gene expression to the evolutionary potential of a threatened fish	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Understanding whether small populations with low genetic diversity can respond to rapid environmental change via phenotypic plasticity is an outstanding research question in biology. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has recently provided the opportunity to examine variation in gene expression, a surrogate for phenotypic variation, in nonmodel species. We used a comparative RNA-seq approach to assess expression variation within and among adaptively divergent populations of a threatened freshwater fish, Nannoperca australis, found across a steep hydroclimatic gradient in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. These populations evolved under contrasting selective environments (e.g., dry/hot lowland; wet/cold upland) and represent opposite ends of the species' spectrum of genetic diversity and population size. We tested the hypothesis that environmental variation among isolated populations has driven the evolution of divergent expression at ecologically important genes using differential expression (DE) analysis and an ANOVA-based comparative phylogenetic expression variance and evolution model framework based on 27,425 de novo assembled transcripts. Additionally, we tested whether gene expression variance within populations was correlated with levels of standing genetic diversity. We identified 290 DE candidate transcripts, 33 transcripts with evidence for high expression plasticity, and 50 candidates for divergent selection on gene expression after accounting for phylogenetic structure. Variance in gene expression appeared unrelated to levels of genetic diversity. Functional annotation of the candidate transcripts revealed that variation in water quality is an important factor influencing expression variation for N. australis. Our findings suggest that gene expression variation can contribute to the evolutionary potential of small populations.

J	McDowell, RW				McDowell, R. W.			Does variable rate irrigation decrease nutrient leaching losses from grazed dairy farming?	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT												The irrigation of grazed dairy pastures can be highly profitable, but can lead to the enhanced leaching of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and impairment of freshwater quality. A six-year study was conducted to determine whether the use of variable rate irrigation (VRI), compared to uniform rate irrigation (URI), could decrease N and P leaching losses from a 143-ha area under intensively grazed dairy cattle that had been partly hydrologically isolated by the installation of artificial drainage pipes. Median concentrations in drainage of NH4-N, NO3-N and total N were enriched after passing through the irrigated area under both URI and VRI. However, median concentrations of N species and filterable reactive P and total P in drainage downstream of the irrigated area were much less under three years of VRI than under three years of URI. After accounting for potential differences in flow, annual load estimates of N and P species at the downstream site under VRI were about 80-85% less than that lost under URI. Wider adoption of VRI technology could therefore decrease farm leaching losses and nutrient concentrations in receiving waterbodies compared to areas with widespread URI or flood irrigation.																	0266-0032	1475-2743				DEC	2017	33	4					530	537		10.1111/sum.12363								WOS:000418422500003

Accordingly, the monitoring of the groundwater quality based on different tools and methods becomes a necessity. The aim of this study was to apply several approaches to assess the water quality and to define the main hydrochemical process which affect groundwater of the Maritime Djeffara shallow aquifer. In addition to the hydrochemical approach, two multivariate statistical analyses, hierarchical clusters analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were carried out to identify the natural and the anthropogenic processes affecting groundwater chemistry. Hydrochemical approach, based on 47 analyzed groundwater samples, shows that most of samples present a sulfate to mixed chloride, with sodi-potassic tendency facies. According to their chemically composition, the HCA revealed three different groups (C1, C2 and C3) according to their electrical conductivity (EC) values: C1 (average EC = 4500 mu S/cm), C2 (average EC = 7040 mu S/cm) and C3 (average EC = 9767 mu S/cm). Furthermore, PCA results show two principal factors account 84.05% of the total variance: (1) F1 represents the natural component, and (2) F2 symbolizes the anthropic component. Moreover, the groundwater quality map of the Maritime Djeffara shows three categories: suitable, doubtful and unsuitable water for irrigation. These different results should be taken to protect water resources in arid and semiarid regions, especially at the alluvial coastal regions. Also, they help to make a suitable planning to manage and protect the groundwater resources.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							821	10.1007/s12665-017-7168-6								WOS:000418851700018

Combined hydrochemical, isotopic, and multivariate statistics techniques to assess the effects of discharges from a uranium mine on water quality in neighboring streams	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Caldas Uranium Mine (CUM), located on the Pocos de Caldas Plateau in the southeastern region of Brazil, is presently undergoing a decommissioning process. The aim of the present investigation is to identify and characterize the effects of acid mine drainage (AMD) originating from the CUM on surface water quality. To achieve these aims, sampling stations were located at two AMD sources: the retention pond at the foot of waste rock pile#4 (WRP#4) and the settling pond that receives effluents from the tailings dam (TD). Ten additional sampling stations were located along watercourses in the vicinity, both downstream and upstream of the mine. Sampling was performed during the rainy and dry seasons in 2010 and 2011. The water analysis detected significant changes in pH, electrical conductivity, F-, Cd, U, Zn, Al, Mn, As, Ca, -SO4 2-, Pb, U-238, Ra-226, Pb-210, Th-232, Ra-228, and Mo in waters downstream of both pond discharge sites. It was demonstrated that the disequilibrium between Ra-226 and U-238 can be used to trace the extent of AMD impacts in nearby streams. Variations in O-18 and H-2 enabled the flow of mining-impacted water to be traced from the ponds to nearby streams. Multivariate analysis yielded a three-factor model: Factor 1 was interpreted as being associated with AMD (from WRP# 4) and Factor 2 with a Ca-Mo relationship associated with the chemical constitution of the ore and with the treatment of tailings wastes in the area (from TD); Factor 3 was interpreted as being associated with the natural influence of geogenic processes on water quality in the area. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for recommending appropriate remedial actions during mine decommissioning.

This study aimed to assess NPS pollution loads of organic matter, nutrients, bacteria and heavy metals in four river catchments associated with different types of land use in Southern Brazil. Cluster analysis was used to identify similarities between basins and main component analysis (PCA) to identify the main variables that characterize diffuse pollution in each basin. The use and occupation of the soil were determinant in the formation of the clusters. The basins with rural characteristics formed one group, whereas the basin with urban characteristic generated another group. PCA suggests that changes in the water quality of the catchments in this study can be explained by organic pollutants and farming activities. The Rancho do Amaral catchment, with 55.8% of native forest, displayed the lowest NPS pollution load for all tested parameters. The Alto da Colina catchment, with the largest urban area and largest agricultural land use (50%), showed the highest NPS for all variables in the study, even though it has the smallest area. The differences in pollutant loads can be attributed to the intense degradation processes associated with anthropic activities, such as urbanization, agricultural activity and the discharge of effluents, which are different for each catchment.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							833	10.1007/s12665-017-7111-x								WOS:000418851700005

Potential use of low-cost data loggers for groundwater temperature in a regulatory program for public water supply: impact of measurement frequency at a karst spring	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A simple low-cost procedure for data collection and evaluation was developed to investigate the utility of continuous data loggers and the impact of measurement frequency on a water-quality monitoring method for use in a regulatory program for public water supply and groundwater under the direct influence of surface water (GWUDI). Data loggers were utilized to continuously measure groundwater temperature, descriptive statistics and the coefficient of variation to demonstrate rapid and significant variations. Temperature data were collected from a karst spring located in the Great Valley section of Pennsylvania and reported on daily and 15-min measurement frequencies. In response to five summer rain events, thermographs constructed with the 15-min measurements indicated rapid large-magnitude temperature variations. The average magnitude of change across the five events was 5.3 degrees C, but the shifts operated on quick timescales; thus, variations were not captured when data were reported on the daily frequency. This resulted in a distorted evaluation on how significant the groundwater temperature variations were, because results were dependent on measurement frequency. The average coefficient of variation percentage for the 15-min datasets was 12%, compared to 3% for the dataset of daily measurements. These findings could have important implications to a public water-supply regulatory program, because the regulatory definition for GWUDI includes those groundwater sources that display rapid and significant variations in water quality. Without high-frequency measurements, one alarming result could be that GWUDI sources, particularly those located in fast-acting hydrogeologic settings, are misevaluated when maximum or minimum water-quality variations are not included in the evaluation. Advancement in science and technology has resulted in data loggers for groundwater temperature that are economical, robust, and easy to install. Thus, their application in regulatory programs should no longer be underutilized, especially in karst spring settings where source construction deficiencies and focused recharge features can result in rain-induced rapid infiltration and waterquality variations on the minute-to-hour timescale.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				DEC	2017	76	24							813	10.1007/s12665-017-7164-x								WOS:000418851700014						
J	Lu, M; Hu, YT; Gao, Y; Wang, XP				Lu Meng; Hu Ying-tian; Gao Ya; Wang Xiao-ping			Novel Spectral COD Measurement Method Based on Identification of Water Samples	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												Chemical oxygen demand (COD) is one of the important indicators of water quality. The COD measurement method based on UV/Vis absorption spectra has been widely used because of its advantages of high speed, real time results, void of reagents, and pollution-free. Different functional groups have different characteristic absorption spectra. In the application of the method to water samples with a stable solution, high COD measurement accuracy can be achieved by building a precise "UV/Vis Absorbance(Auv)-COD" computational model. However, when the method is used for water samples with variable components, the measurement precision is low, limiting its applicability. This study proposes a new method based on dynamic identification of water sample type. The LM-BP neural network algorithm is used for the identification of water samples in this paper. And the morphology characteristics of the absorption spectra were used as the input parameters of water sample identification models. In the application of COD measurement, the water sample's absorption spectra have a time correlation. Based on the foundation laid by traditional spectrum identification techniques, the algorithm was optimized in accordance with the characteristics of COD measurement. The concept of historical data queue and historical identification factor was introduced into LM-BP artificial neural network and forms the cascaded network structure. Experiments show that the method exhibited better robustness and higher accuracy than traditional algorithms, because the cascaded network is relatively more able to adapt the characteristics of the COD measurement. The test yielded a 98% identification accuracy rate, which can provide a technical guarantee for the application of spectral COD measurement in a complex environment. In this paper, the sensor structure and the proposed algorithm are simple as well, which can be used in the portable instrument with limited resource. The UV/Vis-COD measurement method based on the water sample identification algorithm can achieve improved accuracy compared to the traditional method, which calculates all water sample types with the same computational model. The proposed method is expected to solve the problem that traditional UV/Vis-COD measurement methods face regarding difficulties adapting when applied to complex environments while still achieving high COD measurement accuracy.																	1000-0593					DEC	2017	37	12					3797	3802		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2017)12-3797-06								WOS:000418728900026

The traditional monitoring technology for eutrophication is laborious and time-consuming, so it is difficult to realize the real-time and on-site monitoring and then rapid evaluate the eutrophication degree. Based on the investigation of chromophoric dissolved organic matter(CDOM) and other environmental parameters in Xiamen Bay in February, May, August and from October to November 2009, the feasibility of using CDOM optical properties to retrieve eutrophication parameters (COD, TN and TP) in coastal environment was evaluated. CDOM showed large spatial and seasonal changes in Xiamen Bay, with the highest CDOM abundance occurring in the Jiulong River Estuary. The terrestrial input and phytoplankton production were the main sources of CDOM in Xiamen Bay. The empirical formula to estimate the CDOM abundance in seawater was then established by using the salinity and chlorophyll-a data. The correlation coefficient of this empirical formula was 0.96 and the relative errors between fitted values and measured values for CDOM of different survey stations were (11. 1% 0.71%. There were high correlations between CDOM absorption coefficient and fluorescence components with chemical oxygen demand(COD), total nitrogen(TN), total phosphorus (TP) in all seasons, with the highest correlations in spring and summer, and the lowest in winter. Combined with the above results, instead of the data including COD, TN and TP got only through manual samplings and laboratory analysis, the data of salinity and chlorophyll a could be provided by water quality automatic monitoring system and CDOM data got by above empirical formula, so it is possible to realize the rapid monitoring and evaluation for the degree of coastal eutrophication by using in situ buoy system with CDOM sensor.																	1000-0593					DEC	2017	37	12					3803	3808		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2017)12-3803-06								WOS:000418728900027

However, adsorption is one of the most expensive unit processes used in treatment and renewal of water. This is due to the high cost of granular active carbon and the necessity of its frequent exchange or regeneration.

This study aims to analyze concentration changes in ammonia and nitrate in shrimp farm wastewater by applying biofloc technology combined with Effective Microorganisms 4 (EM4). It also aims to determine the optimum concentration of EM4 for reducing ammonia and nitrate concentrations. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out for 30 days using three 40x25x30 cm(3) treatment tanks. Each tank was equipped with a 7 l/min aerator, a 30-watt lamp, 15 liters of fresh water, 20 young shrimp, and EM4 concentrations of 3 ml/l, 5 ml/l, and 7 ml/l, respectively. At the end of the observation period, water parameters were recorded, such as dissolved oxygen (DO) range of 4.11 to 4.48 mg/L, pH range of 7.7-8.4, and temperature range of 29.1-30.7 degrees C. Nutrient levels had declined, with the maximum removal of ammonia from the 3 ml/l, 5 ml/l, and 7 ml/l EM4 concentration tanks of 74.1%, 84.2%, and 88.9%, respectively and for nitrates of 68.4%, 72.6%, and 83.7%, respectively. Ammonia and nitrate concentrations were reduced to about 0.634 mg/l and 1.261 mg/l, respectively. Dosage of EM4 of 7 ml/l was considered to be the optimum concentration for reducing ammonia and nitrate concentration. It can be concluded that the combination of biofloc technology and EM4 is successful in removing ammonia and nitrate waste from shrimp farm wastewater and in maintaining nutrients and water quality at safe levels. This combination therefore has the potential to be used for water recycling in shrimp aquaculture.																	2086-9614	2087-2100				DEC	2017	8	6					1021	1030		10.14716/ijtech.v8i6.685								WOS:000418737000006

This study aims to identify enablers of, barriers to, and opportunities for early adopters of water recycling in the business sector of the Greater Jakarta region of Indonesia, and to highlight the possibilities of its wider implementation in order to reduce water stress. Semi-structured interviews, desk reviews, and observations were conducted with eight enterprises. Most respondents demonstrated that their main purpose for recycling water is to reduce costs. Recycled water was mostly used where there are minimal possibilities of direct contact with people to reduce the impact of social barriers. While the absence of a clear legal framework was identified as another barrier to water recycling implementation, this can also serve as an enabler. The decrease in raw water quality makes water recycling a cost-effective solution. Considering all findings, water recycling in Indonesia has great potential to be more widely applied and to be supported by related stakeholders.																	2086-9614	2087-2100				DEC	2017	8	6					1031	1039		10.14716/ijtech.v8i6.743								WOS:000418737000007

Carbon Sequestration in Organic and Conventional Corn Production System	PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE												Global warming brought about by increasing concentration of green house gases (GHG) in the atmosphere, particularly that of CO2, is a major concern due to its impact on climate change. The intensity and frequency of typhoons, drought and flooding increased due to the change in climate and these have a negative impact on crop productivity and food security. Alternative farming practices that can potentially reduce CO2 emission and optimize the efficiency of plant and soil carbon sequestration is therefore necessary. Thus, this experiment was conducted to determine and compare the potential contribution of organic and conventional corn production systems on carbon sequestration based on plant biomass and soil organic carbon accumulation. The field experiment was conducted at the Central Experiment Station, Pili Drive, UP Los Banos, College Laguna from June to September 2012 for the wet season experiment, and from February to May 2013 for the dry season experiment. Four fertilizer treatments and two corn cultivars served as mainplot and subplot, respectively, and were laid out in split-plot in RCBD with three replications. The cultivars evaluated were USM Var 10, a high yielding open pollinated variety and Crystal, a farmer-selected open-pollinated cultivar. Fertilizer treatments were control, inorganic fertilizer (138 kg N from urea), and organic fertilizer in the form of vermicompost. The rate of vermicompost used during the wet season was 8 t ha(-1) while during the dry season 8 and 10 t ha(-1) was used. Data on root and shoot biomass and organic carbon content, soil organic carbon, and bulk density were monitored at 30 and 60 days after sowing during the wet season and until 90 days after sowing during the dry season. Plant carbon (C) sequestration was calculated based on root and shoot biomass and on the carbon content of the plant tissues. Soil C sequestration was calculated based on soil organic carbon content, soil depth and bulk density. For both wet and dry season experiments, the use of inorganic fertilizer contributed to highest total plant C sequestration. Between the two cultivars, USM Var 10, a high yielding open-pollinated variety, contributed more to C sequestration. Soil C sequestration was likewise highest using inorganic fertilizer, but values did not differ during the wet and dry season. The total carbon sequestration using inorganic fertilizer was undeniably much greater than using vermicompost. However, considering the adverse environmental impacts of inorganic fertilizer, (i.e. CO2 emission during its manufacture, transport, and use; deterioration of soil and water quality; and impact on human) this may reduce its C sequestration potential.																	0115-463X					DEC	2017	42	3					11	18										WOS:000418729200002

Success of agriculture in Pakistan relies heavily on groundwater because of reduced surface water supplies and rainfalls. The current study was conducted to assess the spatio-temporal quality of groundwater in the Lower Chenab Canal (LCC) east area with emphasis on characterizing groundwater quality zones for irrigation applications. Groundwater samples from 289 observation wells were collected and chemically analyzed. A geostatistical approach using kriging interpolation was applied to express spatial variation and minimize estimation error in data. Three water quality parameters, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), and residual sodium carbonate (RSC), were utilized to develop groundwater quality maps for two seasons including pre-monsoon and post-monsoon. To describe the spatial autocorrelation, suitable semivariogram models were identified and cross validated. The exponential model gave the best results for EC and RSC, whereas the spherical model was found to be the best fit for SAR. The overlay analysis was performed to create composite water quality maps according to which 40% LCC area is showing good groundwater quality for irrigation, 49% is exhibiting marginal quality, and 10% unsuitable during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Groundwater quality is 100% good for Sultanpur irrigation subdivision, and only 3.75% is good for Paccadala subdivision. The results of the study may provide guidelines for the planners/policy makers to devise area-specific strategies for sustainable groundwater use.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				DEC	2017	10	23							510	10.1007/s12517-017-3280-x								WOS:000417834100006

Exploration of potential groundwater resources at Thuwal area, north of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, using remote sensing data analysis and geophysical survey	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The study uses the applications of remote sensing in analyzing the main topographic features of the study area. The digital elevation model derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) satellite is used to devise spillway torrents and their tributaries of the different drainage basins in the study area. The digital rainfall data recorded by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) climate research satellite is used to determine places with the highest rainfall within the different drainage basins in the area. Other satellite data (e.g. Landsat-8) are used in identifying and studying the various geological structures in the study area, which intersect the spillway torrents. Such areas may allow seizure of large quantities of water as potential, close to the surface, groundwater (Quaternary) aquifer. Areas of potential hydrological traps have been identified and marked for further geophysical (geoelectrical) surveys. The geophysical studies helped in identifying the shallow geological structures and the thickness of the subsurface sediments. It also assists in determining the size of the groundwater aquifer and the water quality within these aquifers. The study showed a decline of freshwater aquifer in Quaternary sediments. The Tertiary groundwater aquifer is the most prevalent, where this appears normal saline aquifer. All the aquifers within the study area are being recharged from Quaternary sediments by rainwater. The cumulative annual precipitation rate increases in the South-East of the study area, specifically over Wadi Khulais and significantly drops to lower rainfall rates in the rest of the region. Running water permeates the Quaternary sediments, which in turn infiltrates and recharges the Tertiary aquifer. The salinity of the latter depends mostly on the nature of its constituent rocky material.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				DEC	2017	10	23							509	10.1007/s12517-017-3295-3								WOS:000417834100009						
J	Gurevin, C; Erturk, A; Albay, M				Gurevin, Cenk; Erturk, Ali; Albay, Meric			Predicting the effects of sediment based internal nutrient loads on eutrophication in Kucukcekmece Lagoon for rehabilitation planning	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												In deep stratified coastal lagoons, hypoxic waters that result from phytoplankton decomposition in the stratified bottom waters are often associated with eutrophication. Decomposing biomass reaches the bottom sediments and enriches them with nutrients and organic matter. Nutrients trapped in sediments are released with time and promote excessive phytoplankton growth in the surface water. Because eutrophication in lentic ecosystems progresses in a self-fuelling cycle, outflow is the only available process for exporting excess nutrients to recover from eutrophication. Thus, rehabilitation of eutrophic coastal lagoons that have limited seawater interactions is a long term process. The importance of nutrient release from sediments on eutrophication and the delay effect of internal nutrient loading on the rehabilitation of a eutrophic coastal lagoon with limited seawater exchange were analysed in this study. An ecological model that couples the water column and the sediment diagenesis processes, was developed for water quality management purposes. Our findings indicate that the recovery of the Lagoon from eutrophication will be taken decades even in the absence of external nutrient loading. Therefore, we suggest applying rehabilitation strategies that control the nutrient fluxes from sediments for a faster recovery from heavily eutrophic conditions. Land-based nutrient sources must also be controlled because they feed water column and the bottom sediments with nutrients.

J	Cavus, I; Kalin, L; Kara, F				Cavus, Ilkim; Kalin, Latif; Kara, Ferhat			Impacts of urban headwater disturbances on downstream sediment loading where streamside management zones for forest harvesting activities are present downstream	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH												Watershed disturbances caused by land use/land cover (LU/LC) change, intensive forestry practices, and other forms of watershed disturbance are known to negatively affect water quality, if best management practices (BMPs) are not present. Disturbances near or around headwaters where BMPs are absent or are inadequate may impact downstream water quality and stream ecology regardless of the presence of downstream BMPs. In this study, the recovery of two small forest-dominated watersheds (W-w and E-w) in Auburn, Alabama, USA, was monitored 6-years after a partial clearcut was done. The streamside management zone (SMZ) in W-w was also partially harvested shortly after the partial clearcut to improve its sediment trapping effectiveness over the long-term. The hydrology and sediment transport in these watersheds were expected to stabilize over this period, however, new disturbances in the headwaters of both watersheds changed the watershed dynamics. Streamflow and sediment load were examined over a 15-month period from February 2014 to May 2015. The clearcut in W-w and E-,(w) and the partially harvested SMZ in W-w seemed to have recovered; however, substantial amount of sediment load were measured across all monitoring sites in both watersheds as a result of upstream disturbances. This study emphasizes the necessity of watershed management as a whole, and the importance of BMP applications within the entire watershed. It also highlights the fact that watershed management and BMP implementation is a dynamic process, thus, strategies and techniques need to be continuously adapted in response to environmental changes.

In the paper the methodology of determining the risk associated with threat to technical infrastructure was considered. The concept was studied on the basis of real operational data from the water treatment plant. The probability of exceeding the individual parameters for WTPI is slightly larger than for WTPII, which means that this water treatment process may cause lack of chemical stability in the water supply network. Operators should anticipate in the process of designing water distribution system, using proper materials, as to ensure an adequate level of safety from the water source to the water recipient. It should be noted that it is necessary to adjust the material of internal installation of water supply networks to the parameters of the water. At present, there are no correlations between the designing step and water parameters. It was concluded that to protect the water supply infrastructure, which belongs to critical infrastructure, water company should put more emphasis on distribution of stable water that has not potentially corrosion properties. Some suggestions were made for the protection of WDS and to ensure safety of system functioning and long-term usability of water pipes.																	2083-4772	2083-4810				DEC	2017	43	4					3	12		10.1515/aep-2017-0043								WOS:000418438200001

Septic systems contribute to nutrient pollution and harmful algal blooms in the St. Lucie Estuary, Southeast Florida, USA	HARMFUL ALGAE												Nutrient enrichment is a significant global-scale driver of change in coastal waters, contributing to an array of problems in coastal ecosystems. The St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) in southeast Florida has received national attention as a result of its poor water quality (elevated nutrient concentrations and fecal bacteria counts), recurring toxic Microcystis aeruginosa blooms, and its proximity to the northern boundary of tropical coral species in the United States. The SLE has an artificially large watershed comprised of a network of drainage canals, one of which (C-44) is used to lower the water level in Lake Okeechobee. Public attention has primarily been directed at nutrient inputs originating from the lake, but recent concern over the importance of local watershed impacts prompted a one-year watershed study designed to investigate the interactions between on-site sewage treatment and disposal systems (OSTDS or septic systems), groundwaters, and surface waters in the SLE and nearshore reefs. Results provided multiple lines of evidence of OSTDS contamination of the SLE and its watershed: 1) dissolved nutrients in groundwaters and surface waters were most concentrated adjacent to two older (pre-1978) residential communities and the primary canals, and 2) sucralose was present in groundwater at residential sites (up to 32.0 mu g/L) and adjacent surface waters (up to 5.5 mu g/L), and 3) delta N-15 values in surface water (+7.5 parts per thousand), macroalgae (+4.4 parts per thousand) and phytoplankton (+5.0 parts per thousand) were within the published range (>+3 parts per thousand) for sewage N and similar to values in OSTDS-contaminated groundwaters. Measured 815N values in M. aeruginosa became increasingly enriched during transport from the C-44 canal (similar to 5.8 parts per thousand) into the mid estuary (similar to 8.0 parts per thousand), indicating uptake and growth on sewage N sources within the urbanized estuary. Consequently, there is a need to reduce N and P loading, as well as fecal loading, from the SLE watershed via septic-to-sewer conversion projects and to minimize the frequency and intensity of the releases from Lake Okeechobee to the SLE via additional water storage north of the lake. These enhancements would improve water quality in both the SLE and Lake Okeechobee, reduce the occurrence of toxic harmful algal blooms in the linked systems, and improve overall ecosystem health in the SLE and downstream reefs.

Developing a parallel program, however, is a difficult task that requires special and expensive processing resources. Motivated by the potential benefits of parallelization, this paper develops a load-balanced parallel architecture on OpenMP to improve on an in-house serial two-dimensional water quality simulation model to a parallel application named PARATUNA-WQ. Analysis of the performance of speedup is discussed to justify the use of parallel architecture in water quality simulation model. Speedup achieved by PARATUNA-WQ is close to the maximum theoretical speedup predicted by the Amdahl Law. Further enhancement for application to very large computational domain consisting of 25 million computational nodes is possible by integrating MPI architecture into the framework of OpenMP, the result of which will be reported in a subsequent paper.

Disappearing Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and Declining Water Quality in Lake Mattamuskeet	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Major threats to aquatic systems such as shallow lakes can include declining water quality, the loss of macrophyte beds, and the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. Often, these changes go unnoticed until a shift from a clear, oligotrophic system dominated by macrophyte beds to a turbid, eutrophic system dominated by phytoplankton and associated harmful algal blooms has occurred. Lake Mattamuskeet, which mostly lies within the boundary of Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge, North Carolina, is a shallow lake that has recently experienced a reduction in water clarity and macrophyte beds, also referred to as submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and an increase in nutrients, phytoplankton, harmful algal blooms, and cyanotoxin production. At Lake Mattamuskeet, SAV coverage and water clarity declined between the 1980s and 2015. During the same time, significantly increasing trends in nitrogen, phosphorus, turbidity, suspended sediments, chlorophyll a, and pH occurred. Current water-quality conditions (20122015) are not conducive to SAV survival and, in some cases, do not meet North Carolina water-quality standards for the protection of aquatic life. Water clarity declines appear to predate the SAV die-offs on the east side. Moving forward, SAV will serve as a primary indicator for lake health; and lake monitoring, research, and management efforts will focus on the restoration of aquatic grasses and water quality at Lake Mattamuskeet.																	1944-687X					DEC	2017	8	2					401	417		10.3996/082016-JFWM-068								WOS:000418056300006

Understanding and Finding Solutions to the Problem of Sedimentation in the National Wildlife Refuge System	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) is a collection of public lands maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for migratory birds and other wildlife. Wetlands on individual National Wildlife Refuges (Refuges) may be at risk of increased sedimentation because of land use and water management practices. Increased sedimentation can reduce wetland habitat quality by altering hydrologic function, degrading water quality, and inhibiting growth of vegetation and invertebrates. On Refuges negatively affected by increased sedimentation, managers have to address complex questions about how to best remediate and mitigate the negative effects. The best way to account for these complexities is often not clear. On other Refuges, managers may not know whether sedimentation is a problem. Decision makers in the Refuge System may need to allocate resources to studying which Refuges could be at risk. Such analyses would help them understand where to direct support for managing increased sedimentation. In this paper, we summarize a case study demonstrating the use of decision-analytic tools in the development of a sedimentation management plan for Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge, Minnesota. Using what we learned from that process, we surveyed other Refuges in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Region 3 (an area encompassing the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin) and Region 6 (an area encompassing the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) about whether they experience sediment-related impacts to management. Our results show that cases of management being negatively affected by increased sedimentation are not isolated. We suggest that the Refuge System conduct a comprehensive and systematic assessment of increased sedimentation among Refuges to understand the importance of sedimentation in context with other management problems that Refuges face. The results of such an assessment could guide how the Refuge System allocates resources to studying and managing widespread stressors.																	1944-687X					DEC	2017	8	2					648	660		10.3996/012016-JFWM-004								WOS:000418056300025

Influence of Lake Surface Area and Total Phosphorus on Annual Bluegill Growth in Small Impoundments of Central Georgia	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The relationships between environmental variables and the growth rates of fishes are important and rapidly expanding topics in fisheries ecology. We used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the influence of lake surface area and total phosphorus on the age-specific growth rates of Lepomis macrochirus (Bluegill) in 6 small impoundments in central Georgia. We used model averaging to create composite models and determine the relative importance of the variables within each model. Results indicated that surface area was the most important factor in the models predicting growth of Bluegills aged 1-4 years; total phosphorus was also an important predictor for the same age-classes. These results suggest that managers can use water quality and lake morphometry variables to create predictive models specific to their waterbody or region to help develop lake-specific management plans that select for and optimize local-level habitat factors for enhancing Bluegill growth.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				DEC	2017	16	4					546	566										WOS:000418425800006

The Effect of Beaver Ponds on Water Quality in Rural Coastal Plain Streams	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We compared water-quality effects of 13 beaver ponds on adjacent free-flowing control reaches in the Coastal Plain of rural North Carolina. We measured concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and suspended sediment (SS) upstream and downstream of paired ponds and control reaches. Nitrate and SS concentrations decreased, ammonium concentrations increased, and SRP concentrations were unaffected downstream of the ponds and relative to the control reaches. The pond effect on nitrate concentration was a reduction of 112 +/- 55 mu g-N/L (19%) compared to a control-reach-influenced reduction of 28 +/- 17 mu g-N/L. The pond effect on ammonium concentration was an increase of 9.47 +/- 10.9 mu g-N/L (59%) compared to the control-reach-influenced reduction of 1.49 +/- 1.37 mu g-N/L. The pond effect on SS concentration was a decrease of 3.41 +/- 1.68 mg/L (40%) compared to a control-reach-influenced increase of 0.56 +/- 0.27 mg/L. Ponds on lower-order streams reduced nitrate concentrations by greater amounts compared to those in higher-order streams. Older ponds reduced SS concentrations by greater amounts compared to younger ponds. The findings of this study indicate that beaver ponds provide water-quality benefits to rural Coastal Plain streams by reducing concentrations of nitrate and suspended sediment.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				DEC	2017	16	4					584	602										WOS:000418425800008

Hydro-sedimentary Dynamics of a Drained Agricultural Headwater Catchment: A Nested Monitoring Approach	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Soil erosion and sediment transfer are extensive in lowland agricultural catchments. In these environments, high-frequency datasets of both water discharge and suspended sediment concentrations are often lacking. In particular, the impact of tile drainage networks on sediment fluxes in these catchments is poorly understood. Our research quantified sediment fluxes between 2013 and 2016 at five nested stations including a tile drain outlet across a small (25-km(2)) agricultural catchment (located in the Loire River basin, France) representative of lowland cultivated environments of the middle part of this basin. Sediment fluxes varied from 1 to 38 t km(-2) yr(-1) across the monitored subcatchments. Most of sediment fluxes (79 +/- 9%) were measured during flood events (n = 44), mostly occurring in winter (75%) and spring (20%). Seasonality controlled most of the variations of sediment fluxes. Sediment transfers in tile drains occurred episodically. Flows were measured during 11.4% of the monitoring time. A mean time lag of 80 min was recorded between the peak discharge at the drain outlet and the downstream river station. At the event scale, sediment fluxes exported from the tile drain varied between 1.1 x 10(-4) and 2.5 t km(-2) and remained of the same order of magnitude as those measured at the downstream river station, although the latter were on average 53% lower. Results suggest significant storage of sediment material in the river channel and its export during the most intense flood events. Our research emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring of water and sediment transfers in agricultural catchments equipped with tile drains.																	1539-1663					DEC	2017	16	12								10.2136/vzj2017.05.0113								WOS:000418354300006						
J	Hairsine, PB				Hairsine, Peter B.			Review: Sediment-Related Controls on the Health of the Great Barrier Reef	VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL												Linking terrestrial soil erosion to the degradation of marine ecosystems relies on a long chain of evidence. Here, this chain of evidence is reviewed for Australia's Great Barrier Reef and its catchments. Excessive sediment delivery to the marine environment is one component of an interlinked group of stressors that include coral bleaching, damage by storms, and plagues of crown-of-thorns starfish. Sediment and the pollutants they carry are one of the drivers of marine ecosystem decline and adversely impact recovery following disturbance by other stressors. Significantly, a portion of the N species carried by fine sediment in the freshwater system is released in the marine environment, thereby perturbing marine ecology. Available controls on sediment and pollutant delivery are hillslope erosion rates, gully and streambank erosion rates, sediment deposition rates in sediment sinks including footslopes, floodplains, and water reservoirs, and the application rates of pesticides and fertilizers. By reducing sediment fluxes through the combined strategies of erosion control and deposition enhancement, near- and offshore impacts can be reduced. Gully and streambank erosion are more significant sources of fine sediment than hillslope erosion. Fertilizer and non-fertilizer N and pesticides carried by sediment play an important role in coral reef degradation. A graphic summary of the spatial configuration the sources and sinks is provided to guide the prioritization of interventions. The scale of intervention required to achieve the desired marine outcome is so large that a combined voluntary and regulatory approach is needed.																	1539-1663					DEC	2017	16	12								10.2136/vzj2017.05.0115								WOS:000418354300002

Spatial and Temporal Variation of Water Quality in the Bertam Catchment, Cameron Highlands, Malaysia	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The spatio-temporal variability of water quality associated with anthropogenic activities was studied for the Bertam River and its main tributaries within the Bertam Catchment, Cameron Highlands, Malaysia. A number of physico-chemical parameters of collected samples were analyzed to evaluate their spatio-temporal variability. Nonparametric statistical analysis showed significant temporal and spatial differences (p<0.05) in most of the parameters across the catchment. Parameters except dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand displayed higher values in rainy season. The higher concentration of total suspended solids was caused by massive soil erosion and sedimentation. Seasonal variations in contaminant concentrations are largely affected by precipitation and anthropogenic influences. Untreated domestic wastewater discharge as well as agricultural runoff significantly influenced the water quality. Poor agricultural practices and development activities at slope areas also affected the water quality within the catchment. The analytical results provided a basis for protection of river environments and ecological restoration in mountainous Bertam Catchment.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				DEC 1	2017	89	12					2088	2102		10.2175/106143017X14839994522740								WOS:000418398800004	28087920

EFFICIENCY OF TEMPORARY STORAGE OF GEOTHERMAL WATERS IN A LAKE SYSTEM: MONITORING THE CHANGES OF WATER QUALITY AND BACTERIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURES	ACTA MICROBIOLOGICA ET IMMUNOLOGICA HUNGARICA												Disposal of used geothermal waters in Hungary often means temporary storage in reservoir lakes to reduce temperature and improve water quality. In this study, the physical and chemical properties and changes in the bacterial community structure of a reservoir lake system in southeast region of Hungary were monitored and compared through 2 years, respectively. The values of biological oxygen demand, concentrations of ammonium ion, total inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorous, and total phenol decreased, whereas oxygen saturation, total organic nitrogen, pH, and conductivity increased during the storage period. Bacterial community structure of water and sediment samples was compared by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) following the amplification of the 16S rRNA gene. According to the DGGE patterns, greater seasonal than spatial differences of bacterial communities were revealed in both water and sediment of the lakes. Representatives of the genera Arthrospira and Anabaenopsis (cyanobacteria) were identified as permanent and dominant members of the bacterial communities.

J	Sam, K; Coulon, F; Prpich, G				Sam, Kabari; Coulon, Frederic; Prpich, George			Use of stakeholder engagement to support policy transfer: A case of contaminated land management in Nigeria	ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT												Transfer of environmental policy from one country to another without consideration for the contextual differences (e.g. socio-cultural, economic) between the countries can be a barrier that prevents adoption, or limits the implementation and effectiveness of that policy. In this study, we investigate the socio-cultural preferences of stakeholders in the Niger Delta to understand how different stakeholder groups value socio-cultural differences. We used a modified, mixed-methods stakeholder engagement approach to capture this information, combining stakeholder workshops and interviews. Community groups, regulators, experts in contaminated land management, and oil exploration operators participated in this study, and our results revealed a general consensus concerning the ranked priority of issues. Top issues included water quality, soil quality for agriculture, food production, and human health and wellbeing. Despite this consensus, differences in how stakeholder groups arrived at their rankings might pose a challenge for policy makers. Other potential barriers to effective policy transfer identified in this study include political and cultural differences, regulatory structure, and corruption. In sum, this study provides insights about the socio-cultural preferences of stakeholders from the Niger Delta; information that could be used by policy makers to contextualise contaminated land management policy transfer.

Reports on health concerns and possible migration of chemicals from the plastic material into the water have driven the current investigation. This study aims to address the extent of antimony (Sb) leaching from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottles subject to temperature variations (24-50 degrees C) due to Qatar's hot climate and improper storage conditions. A representative basket including 66 different imported and locally produced water bottles was considered. The concentrations of Sb in bottled water ranged from 0.168 to 2.263 mu g/L at 24 degrees C and from 0.240 to 6.110 mu g/L at 50 degrees C. Antimony concentrations in PET bottles at 24 degrees C was significantly lower than those at 50 degrees C (p = 0.0142), indicating that the temperature was a principal factor affecting the release of Sb from the plastic into the water. Although the detected Sb amounts were below the guidelines endorsed by WHO and Qatar (standard 5 mu g/L) at 24 degrees C, the concentration measured at 50 degrees C was higher than the recommended WHO values (6.11 mu g/L).																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2017	189	12							631	10.1007/s10661-017-6342-3								WOS:000418244300014	29129001

Such rivers are often under heavy demand for water supply and other services, such as effluent dilution. The present study examines four consecutive years (2006-2009) of water quality-monitoring data divided by season (rainy and dry) just before the Goiana River enters its estuary. The environmental variables are largely controlled by rainfall patterns. The water temperatures are consistently above 25 degrees C, which impairs dissolved oxygen levels (3.1 to 6.7 mg L-1) and may suggest eutrophication. By contrast, biochemical oxygen demand, percentage O-2 saturation and total phosphorous (which are eutrophication indicators) do not show non-compliant levels, according to local legislation. Although the monitoring stations surround a municipal centre, the estuary is downstream from this area, the main uses of which are artisanal fisheries, nature conservation, leisure and aquaculture. Therefore, continuous monitoring and long-term analysis of the resulting water quality are important.

Trace-metal contamination in the glacierized Rio Santa watershed, Peru	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The objective of this research is to characterize the variability of trace metals in the Rio Santa watershed based on synoptic sampling applied at a large scale. To that end, we propose a combination of methods based on the collection of water, suspended sediments, and riverbed sediments at different points of the watershed within a very limited period. Forty points within the Rio Santa watershed were sampled between June 21 and July 8, 2013. Forty water samples, 36 suspended sediments, and 34 riverbed sediments were analyzed for seven trace metals. The results, which were normalized using the USEPA guideline for water and sediments, show that the Rio Santa water exhibits Mn concentrations higher than the guideline at more than 50% of the sampling points. As is the second highest contaminating element in the water, with approximately 10% of the samples containing concentrations above the guideline. Sediments collected in the Rio Santa riverbed were heavily contaminated by at least four of the tested elements at nearly 85% of the sample points, with As presenting the highest normalized concentration, at more than ten times the guideline. As, Cd, Fe, Pb, and Zn present similar concentration trends in the sediment all along the Rio Santa. The findings indicate that care should be taken in using the Rio Santa water and sediments for purposes that could affect the health of humans or the ecosystem. The situation is worse in some tributaries in the southern part of the watershed that host both active and abandoned mines and ore-processing plants.

The ten studied lakes of the three regions differ in size, geology, shading, connection with the river and the level of anthropogenic impact. The following hypotheses were tested: (1) The water chemistry of fluvial lakes significantly differs in different floodplains. In the central Elbe River floodplain, there are the highest values of conductivity and concentrations of organic matter and nutrients. Fluvial lakes of the Svratka River floodplain show the lowest level of these parameters, and fluvial lakes of the upper Luznice River have levels intermediate between the two previous regions. (2) The chemistry of fluvial lakes that have contact with the river through surface connection is significantly influenced by the river. (3) The structure of zooplankton differs in different lakes due to the geographical distance between locations, their different altitude and water chemistry. The PCA analysis of selected parameters of the water chemistry revealed a close relationship of locations in the central Elbe River floodplain on the one side and close relationship of the locations in the upper Luznice River and Svratka River on the other. However, the amount of organic matter, nitrogen (with the exception of nitrates) and phosphorus was independent of the region. The relationship between the extent of the lake-river connection and the water chemistry was not significant. The hypothesis that the zooplankton differ in different lakes was not proved-the species composition was similar in all the lakes.

The result showed that farmland and urban land were determined as the source of the pollutants, while forestland and grassland were identified as the sink of the pollutants. The temporal differences of relationships between land use types and concentrations of dissolved trace metals mainly due to the discrepancy of rainfall characteristics. Land use type close to river was a better indicator for the effectiveness of concentrations of trace metals, especially at scale of 0-200 m. Forestland and grassland on lower slopes greatly affected the water quality, and the former had no significant or weak influences on higher slopes. Urban land had the greater positive correlations with concentrations of dissolved trace metals on higher slopes, which are mainly due to frequent mining activity. Further analysis suggested that the buffer zones with low slope needed to be seriously taken into consideration for effective land use management in similar basin.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2017	189	12							633	10.1007/s10661-017-6356-x								WOS:000418244300026	29134327					
J	Banerjee, G; Ray, AK				Banerjee, Goutam; Ray, Arun Kumar			The advancement of probiotics research and its application in fish farming industries	RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE												Fish are always susceptible to a variety of lethal diseases caused by different types of bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic agents. The unscientific management practises such as, over feeding, high stock densities and destructive fishing techniques increase the probability of disease symptoms in aquaculture industries. According to Food and Agriculture Association (FAO), each and every year several countries such as China, India, Norway, Indonesia, etc. face a huge loss in aquaculture production due to mainly bacterial and viral diseases. The use of antibiotics is a common practise in fish farming sectors to control the disease outbreak. However, the antibiotics are not long term friend because it creates selective pressure for emergence of drug resistant bacteria. Probiotics are live microorganisms that confer several beneficial effects to host (enhances immunity, helps in digestion, protects from pathogens, improves water quality, promotes growth and reproduction) and can be used as an alternative of antibiotics. In recent year, a wide range of bacteria have reported as potential probiotics candidates in fish farming sectors, however, Lactobacillus sp. and Bacillus sp. gain special attention due to their high antagonistic activities, extracellular enzyme production and availability. In this present review, we have summarized the recent advancement in aquaculture probiotics research and its impact on fish health, nutrition, immunity, reproduction and water quality.

J	Humphrey, CP; Iverson, G; O'Driscoll, M				Humphrey, Charles P., Jr.; Iverson, Guy; O'Driscoll, Michael			Nitrogen Treatment Efficiency of a Large Onsite Wastewater System in Relation to Water Table Dynamics	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												The objective of this study is to determine if the nitrogen treatment efficiency of a large onsite wastewater system (OSW) in the coastal plain of North Carolina is influenced by changes in the elevation of the water table. Groundwater readings including depth to water, pH, temperature, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen are recorded eight times over a 15-month period (May 2013-August 2014) encompassing typically "wet" (two sampling events) and "dry" (three sampling events) seasons, and a water table fluctuation of 1.7 m. Groundwater from piezometers (n = 7) near the OSW and septic tank effluent samples are collected for analyses of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) during each field visit to determine if the TDN treatment efficiency is influenced by the water table elevation. The treatment efficiency of the OSW is directly correlated with wastewater strength (r = 0.882; p = 0.004) and inversely correlated to water table elevation (r = -0.754; p = 0.031). The TDN treatment efficiency at this site decreases with increases in water table elevation, and groundwater TDN concentrations beneath the OSW are typically higher when wastewater concentrations of TDN are higher. Sea level rise and climate change are projected to increase groundwater levels and therefore may have negative effects on water quality adjacent to OSW. Ensuring that OSW are installed with the maximum practical vertical separation to groundwater and setback distances to surface waters, designed with long trenches and oriented perpendicular to the dominant groundwater flow direction will help to maximize TDN treatment.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				DEC	2017	45	12							1700551	10.1002/clen.201700551								WOS:000417491100004

Decomposing the Bulk Electrical Conductivity of Streamflow To Recover Individual Solute Concentrations at High Frequency	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												The ability to evaluate stream hydrochemistry is often constrained by the capacity to sample streamwater at an adequate frequency. While technology is no longer a limiting factor, costs and sample management can still be a barrier to high-resolution water quality instrumentation. We propose a new framework for investigating the electrical conductivity (EC) of streamwater, which can be measured continuously through inexpensive sensors. We show that EC embeds information about individual ion content that can be isolated to retrieve solute concentrations at high resolution. The essence of the approach is the decomposition of the EC signal into its "harmonics", i.e., the specific contributions of the major ions that conduct current in water. The ion contribution is used to explore water quality patterns and to develop algorithms that reconstruct solute concentrations starting from EC during periods where solute measurements are not available. The approach is validated on a hydrochemical data set from Plynlimon, Wales, showing that improved estimates of high-frequency solute dynamics can easily be achieved. Our results support the installation of EC probes to complement water quality campaigns and suggest that the potential of EC measurements in rivers is currently far from being fully exploited.

Conceptual modelling of E. coli in urban stormwater drains, creeks and rivers	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Accurate estimation of faecal microorganism levels in water systems, such as stormwater drains, creeks and rivers, is needed for appropriate assessment of impacts on receiving water bodies and the risks to human health. The underlying hypothesis for this work is that a single conceptual model (the MicroOrganism Prediction in Urban Stormwater model-i.e. MOPUS) can adequately simulate microbial dynamics over a variety of water systems and wide range of scales; something which has not been previously tested. Additionally, the application of radar precipitation data for improvement of the model performance at these scales via more accurate areal averaged rainfall intensities was tested. Six comprehensive Escherichia coli (E. coli) datasets collected from five catchments in south-eastern Australia and one catchment in Raleigh, USA, were used to calibrate the model. The MOPUS rainfall runoff model performed well at all scales (Nash-Sutcliffe E for instantaneous flow rates between 0.70 and 0.93). Sensitivity analysis showed that wet weather urban stormwater flows can be modelled with only three of the five rainfall runoff model parameters: routing coefficient (K), effective imperviousness (IMP) and time of concentration (TOC). The model's performance for representing instantaneous E. coli fluctuations ranged from 0.17 to 0.45 in catchments drained via pipe or open creek, and was the highest for a large riverine catchment (0.64); performing similarly, if not better, than other microbial models in literature. The model could also capture the variability in event mean concentrations (E = 0.17-0.57) and event loads (E = 0.32-0.97) at all scales. Application of weather radar-derived rainfall inputs caused lower overall performance compared to using gauged rainfall inputs in representing both flow and E. coli levels in urban drain catchments, with the performance improving with increasing catchment size and being comparable to the models that use gauged rainfall inputs at the large riverine catchment. These results demonstrate the potential of the MOPUS model and its ability to be applied to a wide range of catchment scales, including large riverine systems.

J	Nukazawa, K; Kihara, K; Suzuki, Y				Nukazawa, Kei; Kihara, Kousuke; Suzuki, Yoshihiro			Negligible contribution of reservoir dams to organic and inorganic transport in the lower Mimi River, Japan	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Rivers fulfill an essential ecological role by forming networks for material transport from upland forests to coastal areas. The way in which dams affect the organic and inorganic cycles in such systems is not well understood. Herein, we investigated the longitudinal profiles of the various components of the water chemistry across three cascade dams in Japan: the Yamasubaru Dam, Saigou Dam, and Ohuchibaru Dam, which are situated along the sediment-productive Mimi River in different flow conditions. We analyzed the following water quality components: suspended solids (SS), turbidity, total iron (TFe), dissolved iron (DFe), total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), humic substance (HS), and major ionic components (Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3-, and SO42-) in the downstream channels of the three dams during the low-intermediate-flow and high-flow events from 2012 to 2014. We estimated hourly loads of each component using hourly turbidity data and discharge data (i.e., L-Q model) separately, and the results are integrated to estimate the annual fluxes. The annual fluxes between the methods were compared to verify predictability of the conventional L-Q models. Annual flux of TOC, TN, DFe, and HS estimated by the turbidity displayed similar values, whereas the flux of SS, TFe, and TP tended to increase downstream of the dams. Among the dams, estimated flux proportions for TP and TFe were higher during high-flow events (74%-94%). Considering geographic conditions (e.g., absence of major tributary between the dams), the result implies that accumulated TP and TFe in the reservoirs may be flushed and transported downstream with SS over the short height dams during flood events. Assuming this process, the reservoir dams probably make only a fractional contribution to the organic and inorganic transport in the catchment studied. The percent flux errors for SS, TFe, and TP fluxes ranged from -7.2% to -97% (except for the TP flux in 2013), which highlights the risk of underestimating these components when using an L-Q model.

Vadose zone processes delay groundwater nitrate reduction response to BMP implementation as observed in paired cultivated vs. uncultivated potato rotation fields	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Nitrate leaching from crop production contributes to groundwater contamination and subsequent eutrophication of the receiving surface water. A study was conducted in a 7-ha potato-grain-forages rotation field in Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada during 2011-2016 to link potato rotation practices and groundwater quality. The field consists of fine sandy loam soil and is underlain by 7-9 m of glacial till, which overlies the regional fractured "red-bed" sandstone aquifer. The water table is generally located in overburden close to the bedrock interface. Field treatments included one field zone taken out of production in 2011 with the remaining zones kept under a conventional potato rotation. Agronomy data including crop tissue, soil, and tile-drain water quality were collected. Hydrogeology data including multilevel monitoring of groundwater nitrate and hydraulic head and data from rock coring for nitrate distribution in overburden and bedrock matrix were also collected. A significant amount of nitrate leached below the soil profile after potato plant kill (referred to as topkill) in 2011, most of it from fertilizer N. A high level of nitrate was also detected in the till vadose zone through coring in December 2012 and through multilevel groundwater sampling from January to May 2014 in both cultivated and uncultivated field zones. Groundwater nitrate concentrations increased for about 2.5 years after the overlying potato field was removed from production. Pressure-driven uniform flow processes dominate water and nitrate transport in the vadose zone, producing an apparently instant water table response but a delayed groundwater quality response to nitrate leaching events. These data suggest that the uniform flow dominated vadose zone in agricultural landscapes can cause the accumulation of a significant amount of nitrate originated from previous farming activities, and the long travel time of this legacy nitrate in the vadose zone can result in substantially delayed responses of groundwater quality to field management adjustments. The delayed effects should also apply to the transport of other contaminants. This study also suggests that management practices should be optimized to reduce soil nitrate build-up during the non-growing season (when plant N uptake is diminishing and the soil contains excessive moisture, for example, after the potato harvest period in PEI) in order to protect groundwater quality.

However, the factors behind increased hypolimnetic anoxia in lakes and reservoirs are often diverse and may involve processes at different spatial and temporal scales. Here, we evaluate the combined effects of different anthropogenic pressures on the oxygen dynamics and water chemistry of Lake Enol, an emblematic mountain lake in Picas de Europa National Park (NW Spain). A multidisciplinary study conducted over a period of four years (2013-2016) indicates that the extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia has increased dramatically in recent years. The extent and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia is typical of meso-eutrophic systems, in contrast with the internal productivity of the lake, which remains oligo-mesotrophic and phosphorus-limited. This apparent contradiction is ascribed to the combination of different external pressures in the catchment, which have increased the input of allochthonous organic matter in recent times through enhanced erosion and sediment transport. The most important among these pressures appears to be cattle grazing, which affects not only the import of carbon and nutrients, but also the lake microbiology. The contribution of clear-cutting, runoff channelling, and tourism is comparatively less significant. The cumulative effects of these local human impacts are not only affecting the lake metabolism, but also the import of sulfate, nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen, and metals (Zn). However, these local factors alone cannot explain entirely the observed oxygen deficit. Climatic factors (e.g., warmer and drier spring and autumn seasons) are also reducing oxygen levels in deep waters through a longer and increasingly steep thermal stratification. Global warming may indirectly increase anoxia in many other mountain lakes in the near future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These rivers are inhabited by unionid freshwater mussels, which are used for oviposition by the endangered Itasenpara bitterling (Acheilognathus longipinnis). Water samples were collected every month between March 2011 and February 2012. Changes in bacterioplankton community structures were analysed using an approach that did not require cultivating the bacteria and involved PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The bacterioplankton community structures in the two rivers were similar in all seasons except winter. The bacterial sequences identified were dominated by typical freshwater Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, and beta-Proteobacteria bacterioplankton.

The bacterioplankton community structures were affected by biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll-a concentration, water depth, and water temperature.

However, it's necessary to determine whether regional nutrient criteria can be defined in stream ecosystems with a poor ecological status. A database of periphytic diatom samples was collected in July and August 2011 and 2012. In total 172 samples were included in the database with matching environmental variables. Here, percentile estimates, nonparametric change-point analysis (nCPA) and Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) were conducted to detect the reference conditions and ecological thresholds along a total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) gradient and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) for the development of nutrient criteria in the streams of the Lake Dianchi basin. The results highlighted the possibility of establishing regional criteria for nutrient concentrations, which we recommended to be no more than 1.39 mg L-1 for TN, 0.04 mg L-1 for TP and 0.17 mg L-1 for NH3-N to prevent nuisance growths of tolerant taxa, and 0.38 mg L-1 for TN, 0.02 mg L-1 for TP and 0.02 mg L-1 for NH3-N to maintain high quality waters in streams. Additionally, the influence of excessive background nutrient enrichment on the threshold response, and the ecological interaction with other stressors (HQI, etc.) in the nutrient dynamic process need to be considered to establish the eventual nutrient criteria, regardless of which technique is applied.

J	Hossain, SZ; Mumford, KG; Rutter, A				Hossain, S. Zubair; Mumford, Kevin G.; Rutter, Allison			Laboratory study of mass transfer from diluted bitumen trapped in gravel	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Diluted bitumen (dilbit) spilled to rivers has the potential to sink and become trapped in coarse bed sediments. Hyporheic flow through the river bed can then lead to the dissolution of hydrocarbons from this trapped oil, and subsequent risks to water quality and aquatic life. It is important to understand the concentrations of dissolved hydrocarbons in water, relative to aqueous solubility, that may result from mass transfer under these conditions, particularly under conditions where coarse sediments lead to faster hyporheic flow that could promote rate-limited mass transfer conditions. In this study, the dissolution of dilbit (Cold Lake Blend) trapped in gravel was measured using one-dimensional columns at flow rates representative of fast hyporheic flow. Dissolved concentrations in the column effluent were found to be less than 20% of effective solubility (equilibrium) concentrations and decreased with increasing flow rate, indicative of rate-limited conditions. These results show that risks posed by the contamination of gravel-bedded rivers by trapped dilbit may be lower, but persist for a longer period of time, than those estimated assuming dissolution at concentrations near solubility limits.																	2050-7887	2050-7895				DEC	2017	19	12					1583	1593		10.1039/c7em00457e								WOS:000418094400012	29199292

The waters are proved not to be saturated with respect to the primary (hydrothermal) minerals. The saturation of certain water samples with uranophane suggests that this mineral is of secondary genesis. The ascent of highly mineralized deep waters shall result in the dissolution of minerals whose concentrations are near the saturation ones. To maintain the ecological standards of the discharged waters, they should be diluted and/or purified by adsorbing dissolved U on a reducing reactive barrier.

Due to the strong and size-dependent adsorption capability of soil particles to radio-nuclides, a better understanding of erosion and transport of soil particles and identification of erosion prone areas within watersheds are significant for contaminant management. For this purpose, we simulated soil erosion and transport in a partially forested catchment for multiple particle size classes. Critical erosion areas were identified by the spatial distribution of net soil erosion. Comparisons between simulated and measured suspended solids concentration at multiple locations throughout the catchment demonstrated successful model performance. For the period Mar. 12, 2011 through Dec. 31, 2014, model results indicated that 5500 tonnes of clay, 52000 tonnes of silt, and 22000 tonnes of sand are transported from the catchment. The results showed that soil erosion in the middle part of the catchment is greater mainly because of steep slopes and large fraction of agricultural lands. These simulations suggest that soil decontamination of erosion-prone agricultural lands in the mid- catchment areas would be effective in reducing radiocesium migration with soil particles.																	1570-6443	1876-4444				DEC	2017	17						18	29		10.1016/j.jher.2017.09.003								WOS:000418105600003

Periphyton colonization and successional trajectories are particularly debatable processes when different kinds of substrates are considered. In our field experiment, we deployed four kinds of artificial substrates (two inorganic ones - glass and ceramic, and two organic ones - willow and yew wooden tiles) for the development of periphyton in an urban reservoir referred to as Lake Savsko (Belgrade, Serbia). We comparatively investigated the structure, colonization process, diversity and successional trajectories of periphyton. We also assessed the relationship between the dynamics of algae growth forms (ecological groups) on different substrates and selected abiotic limnological factors. Our objective was to determine whether the type of substrate affects periphyton characteristics at various levels and whether an artificial substrate potentially affects the bioindication capacity of ecological groups. We concluded that all substrates behave similarly at the level of structure and colonization phases, but when considering diversity and successional trajectories, the substrate specificity was demonstrated. Our results suggest that communities developed on inert substrates (glass and ceramic) could provide more realistic insight into complex environmental changes.

The scale problem in tackling diffuse water pollution from agriculture: Insights from the Avon Demonstration Test Catchment programme in England	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					National Meeting of the British-Hydrological-Society (BHS)	JUL, 2016	Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, ENGLAND	British Hydrol Soc	Loughborough Univ			Mitigation of diffuse water pollution from agriculture is of concern in the United Kingdom, so that freshwater quality can be improved in line with environmental objectives. Targeted on-farm mitigation is necessary for controlling sources of pollution to rivers; a positive impact must also be delivered at the subcatchment and catchment scales before good ecological status can be achieved. A farm on the River Sem in the Hampshire Avon Demonstration Test Catchment was selected for monitoring due to its degraded farmyard, track, and drainage ditch, which was targeted by the Demonstration Test Catchment programme for improvement using a treatment train of interventions. The river was monitored before and after, upstream and downstream, of the potential sources of pollution and subsequent mitigation, both locally at farm scale, and downstream at the subcatchment scale. Sediment was obtained from the riverbed using a conventional disturbance technique, and source samples were collected from across the subcatchment. Samples were analysed for geochemistry, mineral magnetism, and environmental radionuclide activity using the <63-m fraction, before sediment source fingerprinting was conducted to apportion sources. Source tracing revealed that, although the degraded farm track was experiencing channelized flow and erosion in the pre-mitigation period, it was not a major sediment source even at farm scale. Repeat source apportionment during the pre- and post-mitigation periods showed that the targeted treatment train did not result in statistically significant decreases in predicted contributions from the farm track sources at either scale. Sediment sources must be determined at a range of spatial scales to support effective mitigation.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				DEC	2017	33	10			SI		1527	1538		10.1002/rra.3222								WOS:000417916000003

Assessing the Mechanistic Basis for Fine Sediment Biomonitoring: Inconsistencies among the Literature, Traits and Indices	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					National Meeting of the British-Hydrological-Society (BHS)	JUL, 2016	Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, ENGLAND	British Hydrol Soc	Loughborough Univ			Classification of species sensitivity for biomonitoring has been approached under two different frameworks, using either empirical data or expert opinion. Two tools for fine sediment (i.e. clogging and colmation) biomonitoring in the UK tend towards these contrasting approaches. The Proportion of Sediment-sensitive Invertebrates (PSI) index was developed using expert judgement. Empirical weightings were subsequently added at genus or species (EPSI) and mixed (EPSImixed) taxonomic levels, but scores remain constrained by the original categories. In contrast, the Combined Fine Sediment Index, composed of separate taxon scores along organic matter and total fine sediment gradients, was developed using a purely empirical approach. We tested the mechanistic bases for these indices by relating taxon scores to species traits. We compared the results with those for the well-established Whalley Hawkes Paisley Trigg index of organic pollution. After controlling for varying sample sizes, Whalley Hawkes Paisley Trigg could be better predicted by a linear combination of all available traits (mean R-2=0.92) than any of the fine sediment indices (0.68<mean R-2<0.76). When only traits expected to respond to fine sediment were offered as independent variables, the goodness of fit was substantially reduced for all fine sediment indices (0.27<mean R-2<0.46). Our findings demonstrate the lack of integration between the literature on macroinvertebrate responses to fine sediment, the available trait data and taxon scores. Refinement of the trait database is recommended to build on the valuable work performed to date. As the UK has taken the lead in embedding fine sediment into routine biomonitoring programmes, these findings have important international implications. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, several communities have banned fracking because of unresolved concerns about the impact of this process on human health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking, we analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to mothers living at different distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and after fracking was initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for negative health effects of in utero exposure to fracking sites within 3 km of a mother's residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in utero exposure within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts include a greater incidence of low-birth weight babies as well as significant declines in average birth weight and in several other measures of infant health. There is little evidence for health effects at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking are highly local. Informal estimates suggest that about 29,000 of the nearly 4 million annual U.S. births occur within 1 km of an active fracking site and that these births therefore may be at higher risk of poor birth outcomes.																	2375-2548					DEC	2017	3	12							e1603021	10.1126/sciadv.1603021								WOS:000418003100002	29242825

Traditional aquarium systems which mainly utilized a nitrification of nitrifying bacteria attached to the surface of massive artificial filter material are difficult to maintain the oligotrophic conditions necessary for coral aquaculture. This study investigated the removal effects of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (ammonia and nitrate) by live rock (LR), a key component in the "Berlin system" coral aquarium. The expression levels of bacterial functional genes, AOA3, amoA and nosZ, were measured on the exterior and interior of LR. The nitrifying and denitrifying bacterial abundance on LR was quantified and the nitrogen nutrient regulatory effects of LR were evaluated. The results demonstrated that LR mainly removed ammonium (NH4 (+)) from the water with a mean efficiency of 0.141 mg/(kg center dot h), while the removal of nitrate (NO3 (-)) was not significant. Bacterial diversity analysis showed that ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were the most common bacteria on LR, which accounted for 0.5%-1.4% of the total bacterial population, followed by denitrifying bacteria, which accounted for 0.2% of the total population, and the ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were the least common type (< 0.01%). The low abundance of denitrifying bacteria may be responsible for the poor nitrate (NO3 (-)) removal of LR. Thus, other biological filtration methods are needed in coral aquaria to control nitrates generated from nitrification or biological metabolism.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				DEC	2017	36	12					87	94		10.1007/s13131-017-1092-1								WOS:000417883300011

Characterization of the effects of binary metal mixtures on short-term uptake of Cd, Pb, and Zn by rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for individual metals improve our ability to regulate metals in the aquatic environment by considering the effects of water quality parameters (ionic composition, pH, DOC) on metal bioavailability. However, in natural aquatic systems, organisms are often simultaneously exposed to multiple metals and these interactions are not currently considered in BLMs or most environmental regulations, Recently, several different mixture BLMs (mBLMs) have been developed to begin assessing this issue. Some of these models assume competitive interactions between all metals, while others assume only metals with similar modes of action (e.g., Na+ or Ca2+ antagonists) will competitively interact. In this study, we used standard in vivo 3-h gill metal binding assays to characterize the uptake of Cd, Pb, and Zn individually and in binary mixtures with Ag, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, and Zn across a range of concentrations that encompassed the 96-h LC50 for each metal. Inhibition of Cd, Pb, and Zn uptake at the gill by introduction of a second metal was consistent with mode of action in some cases, but not others. Further, contrary to expectations, inhibition was always either non-competitive or could not be defined statistically. We also observed one example of stimulated metal uptake (Ni stimulated Zn uptake). Consistent with our previous experiments on Ag, Cu, and Ni, these studies suggest that current mBLM frameworks will need revision to better reflect the mechanisms underlying metal mixture interactions.																	0166-445X	1879-1514				DEC	2017	193						217	227		10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.10.015								WOS:000417658800024	29100104

The present work aims to assess the degree to which common annual periodic behavior is present (1994-2010) in the meteorological parameters (global radiation, air temperature, cloud cover), streamflow; and five primary nutrients (e.g. total phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen) as possible indicators of ecosystem vulnerability in four different ecosystems using wavelet coherence analysis. The cascade system is located in the mouth of a shallow river where the water flows through a eutrophic pond then a disturbed/undisturbed macrophyte covered wetland reaching a large shallow lake. The results highlight the differing abilities of the elements of the cascade of ecosystems to follow seasonality. The changes in water quality (nutrient cycle) in the eutrophic pond most closely mirror meteorological seasonality. The vulnerability of the wetland ecosystem was expressed by its decreased capacity to follow seasonal changes due to high algae loads and additional inflows. Moreover, the wetland proved to be weak and unstable regarding phosphorus and nitrogen retention. With the successful application of wavelet coherence analysis to the "black-box" cascade system the study sets an example for the implications of the method in such combined or stand-alone natural/partially-constructed ecosystems.

An emerging public concern on lake eutrophication has heightened the need to assess and predict the trophic status in floodplain lakes, particularly for those with high spatial heterogeneity. In this study, combined multivariate statistical techniques and random forests model were used to characterize the water quality and trophic status of Poyang Lake. By classifying and characterizing seasonal water samples comprising 11 water quality parameters collected from 13 sampling sites in Poyang Lake between 2008 and 2014, the dataset was divided into the central and northern lake groups, which corresponded to lentic and lotic regions in Poyang Lake, respectively. The spatial water quality variations and underlying patterns were investigated by performing discriminant analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). Lastly, random forests (RF) were used to predict the chlorophyll a (Chl-a) variations of the central and northern lakes. The PCA results indicated that the water quality of the central and northern areas of the lake was controlled by different environmental variables and underlying pollutant sources. The RF model outperformed the artificial neural network and linear regression and was robust with strong predictive capabilities. It was determined that the most important predictors of the Chl-a variations in the northern lake were water temperature (T) and water level, whereas transparency, T, and water level were the most efficient predictors in the central lake. The RF model can also be applied to trophic prediction in other large lakes with considerable spatial variations. This study will have implications on water quality management and eutrophication prevention in floodplain lakes with high spatial heterogeneity.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						74	83		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.033								WOS:000417551800008

It was recently selected as a reference river for a pilot biomonitoring assessment within the European Union-China River Basin Management Programme. As the outcome of the project, a pilot multimetric index (MMI-CS) was developed for future assessment of the ecological status of the Chishui River basin. In this study, eight core metrics were selected and used to build the multimetric system. These metrics included the total number of taxa (TotalTax), the number of taxa of sprawlers (SprwlTax), the number of intolerant taxa (IntolTax), the Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI), the percentage of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Plecoptera (EPTPct), the number of Ephemeroptera taxa (EphemTax), the percentage of collectors (ClictPct) and the average score per taxon (ASPT). Five ecological status ratings ("Excellent", "Good", "Fair", "Poor" and "Very Poor") were established. The results of the evaluation showed that the index was reasonable and effective. The results of the assessment showed that sites with higher ecological status were distributed mainly in the upper and middle reaches of the region and that sites with lower ecological status were centrally distributed in the lower reaches. Moreover, the index should be refined and validated using additional datasets obtained in different seasons in the future for routine bioassessment within the framework of sustainable management.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						84	95		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.015								WOS:000417551800009

The objectives of this study were to; 1) create baseline farm-level sustainability indices for smallholder shrimp farms in Sri Lanka using both content-based and system-based frameworks adapted from agriculture; 2) determine whether arranging indicators within both content- and system-based sustainability frameworks would provide additional insight into relative farm sustainability (rather than using just one framework); and 3) seek differences between the North Western Province (NWP) and the Eastern Province (EP) in sustainability index, subindex, or indicator scores that might be used to create province-specific policies and education programs designed to potentially improve sustainable practices at the farm level. Since little has been published on the development of practical indicators and evaluation of farm-level sustainability in aquaculture, this study adapted two types of frameworks used for measuring sustainability in agriculture: content- and system-based. Using both frameworks, along with expert opinion, indicators of farm level sustainability were developed into a questionnaire and measured on 225 farms in two provinces of Sri Lanka. Indicators primarily included modifiable practices that farmers could influence to improve the chances of their farms' survival. The farm indicators were normalized using "min-max" normalization, where scores of zero and one were assigned for the least and most sustainable options, respectively. Farm indicators in each province were then aggregated into sub-indices as well an overall aggregated sustainability index score. Similar themes were gleaned from both the content-based and system-based sustainability frameworks, and there was no significant difference between mean overall sustainability scores for the two different frameworks. Farms in the NWP scored significantly higher on the overall sustainability indices of both models despite the NWP's history of severe disease outbreaks while the EP farms had no disease. Possible reasons for this difference were explored with an in-depth analysis of sub-indices as well as individual indicators. An overall aggregated sustainability index score was a useful baseline measure for monitoring changes in sustainability over time; however, its use was limited when attempting to identify gaps in sustainable management practices and provide practical information for farmers and stakeholders to improve farm-level sustainability. It was important to evaluate individual indicators in addition to sub-indices and overall index scores when making recommendations or identifying gaps in sustainable practices at the farm level.

J	Camargo, JA				Camargo, Julio A.			Multimetric assessment of macroinvertebrate responses to mitigation measures in a dammed and polluted river of Central Spain	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In this research, structural and functional responses of benthic macroinvertebrates to mitigation measures (carried out in the dammed and polluted Duraton River, Central Spain, during the 1990s and 2000s) were examined by comparing physicochemical and biological data from the summer of 1987 with data from the summer of 2014. Mitigation measures resulted in significant increases in dissolved oxygen concentrations, as well as in significant reductions of fluoride (F-) pollution and short-term flow fluctuations. The macrobenthic community responded positively to improvements in river environmental conditions, exhibiting significant increases in abundance (total density, total biomass and EPT density) and diversity (total family richness and EPT richness) at impacted sampling sites. Furthermore, the presence of relatively sensitive benthic macro invertebrates after mitigation measures (as indicated by increased values of BMWQ biotic indices) also was the main cause for observed reductions in the environmental impact caused by disturbance points (as indicated by decreased values of the El index), and for the observed recovering of the trophic structure of the macrobenthic community, with macroinvertebrate scrapers as the functional feeding group most favored. These macro invertebrate responses to mitigation measures were more marked at sampling sites that initially were more impacted (i.e., nearest to disturbance points), and less apparent at the sampling site that initially was less impacted (i.e., farthest to disturbance points). Within the hydropsychid assemblage, improvements in river environmental conditions clearly favored the presence of Hydropsyche pellucidula and Cheumatopsyche lepida at the expense of the other hydropsychid species. In spite of all monitored environmental improvements and macroinvertebrate positive responses, the need for additional mitigation measures was evident, particularly to reduce high turbidity levels and sedimentation of fine inorganic matter negatively affecting benthic macro invertebrates downstream from the industrial effluent. Overall, it is concluded that the multimetric approach is an effective technique to assess macroinvertebrate responses to mitigation measures in river ecosystems.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						356	367		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.08.027								WOS:000417551800035

Excavation of wells and exploiting water resources of aquifers have long been known as ordinary solutions to supply water demands for drinking, agricultural and industrial purposes. In many agricultural areas such as the above mentioned region, extraction wells have been utilized for both drinking and agricultural consumptions, while measures taken for water quality monitoring and protecting public health are seriously limited. On the other hand, most of the shared extraction wells in the region used for drinking purpose have been located near the agricultural lands and they are highly under the risk of getting polluted by Agricultural pesticides. The current paper firstly intends to demonstrate the results obtained from Drinking water Quality Index (DWQI) as well as Irrigation Water Quality Index (IWQI) and secondly determines probable conflicts that may be aroused in ranking of water wells using these two methods Subsequently, Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques such as Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA), Compromise Programing (CP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) were employed to decrease effects of the conflicts. It was clarified that MCDMs, to some extent, alleviated contradictions in wells' ranks determined by DWQI/IWQI-and authenticated this procedure as an appropriate method for water quality ranking in agricultural societies.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						368	379		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.08.017								WOS:000417551800036

Building a potential wetland restoration indicator for the contiguous United States	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Wetlands provide key functions in the landscape from improving water quality, to regulating flows, to providing wildlife habitat. Over half of the wetlands in the contiguous United States (CONUS) have been converted to agricultural and urban land uses. However, over the last several decades, research has shown the benefits of wetlands to hydrologic, chemical, biological processes, spurring the. creation of government programs and private initiatives to restore wetlands. Initiatives tend to focus on individual wetland creation, yet the greatest benefits are achieved when strategic restoration planning occurs across a watershed or multiple watersheds. For watershed-level wetland restoration planning to occur, informative data layers on potential wetland areas are needed. We created an indicator of potential wetland areas (PWA), using nationally available datasets to identify characteristics that could support wetland ecosystems, including: poorly drained soils and low-relief landscape positions as indicated by a derived topographic data layer. We compared our PWA with the National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) from 11 states throughout the CONUS to evaluate their alignment. The state-level percentage of NWI-designated wetlands directly overlapping the PWA ranged from 39 to 95%. When we included NWI that was immediately adjacent to the overlapping NWI, our range of correspondence to NWI ranged from 60 to 99%. Wetland restoration is more likely on certain landscapes (e.g., agriculture) than others due to the lack of substantive infrastructure and the potential for the restoration of hydrology; therefore, we combined the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) with the PWA to identify potentially restorable wetlands on agricultural land (PRW-Ag). The PRW-Ag identified a total of over 46 million ha with the potential to support wetlands. The largest concentrations of PRW-Ag occurred in the glaciated corn belt of the upper Mississippi River from Ohio to the Dakotas and in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. The PRW-Ag layer could assist land managers in identifying sites that may qualify for enrollment in conservation programs, where planners can coordinate restoration efforts, or where decision makers can target resources to optimize the services provided across a watershed or multiple watersheds.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC	2017	83						463	473		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.026								WOS:000417551800044	29706804

The porous, fissured, and soluble nature of the underlying karst bedrock (primarily dolomite and limestone) leads to the formation of underground drainage systems. Karst conduit networks dominate this system, and rainfall takes a crucial role on water cycle at China karst area. Nitrogen loss from the karst system is of particular concern, with regard to nutrient use efficiency as well as water quality, as much of the karst system, including steeply sloping terrain, is used for intensive agriculture. We use simulated rainfall experiments to determine the relationship between rainfall and nitrogen loss at typical karst slope land and then estimate nitrogen loss from the karst soil. The results show that both surface runoff and subsurface runoff have a significant linear correlation with rainfall at all studied sites. Subsurface runoff is larger than surface runoff at two karst sites, while the opposite is true at the non-karst site. Exponential function satisfactorily described the correlation between rainfall and nitrogen concentrations in runoff. Nitrates accounted for 60%-95% of the dissolved nitrogen loss (DN, an index of N-loss in this research). The estimated annual N-loss load varies between 1.05 and 1.67 Tg N/year in the whole karst regions of China from 1961 to 2014. Approximately, 90% of the N-loss load occurred during the wet season, and 90% of that passed through the subsurface. Understanding the processes and estimating N-loss is highly valuable in determining long-term soil security and sustainability in karst regions.

J	Blaise, C; Gagne, F; Burgeot, T				Blaise, Christian; Gagne, Francois; Burgeot, Thierry			Three simple biomarkers useful in conducting water quality assessments with bivalve mollusks	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												While biomarkers are undeniably key tools in aquatic ecotoxicology to measure adverse effects linked to contamination events, their application is often inhibited by monetary constraints negating the possibility of having access to dedicated equipment, special wares, and/or expensive reagents. To offset this bottleneck, we propose three simple physiological biomarkers, quantifiable in bivalves, that are free of cost considerations and that can provide basic knowledge on animal health and water quality. Indeed, condition index (CI), growth index (GI), and SOS response (air-time survival) comprise measurements straightforward enough to perform by any laboratory or science body on the planet. Long-term monitoring or screening studies can be carried out with these biomarkers and they are able to provide robust information notably after exposure of bivalves to either singular or multiple agents of contamination. By highlighting examples of data generated in aquatic studies conducted in Eastern Canada under both laboratory and field situations with different species of marine and freshwater mollusks, we establish the suitability of these biomarkers for assessing environmental contamination. Their relationships with other biomarkers are also shown which further corroborate their value as reliable indicators of ecosystem health.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	36			SI		27662	27669		10.1007/s11356-016-6908-6								WOS:000417874400005

Untreated AMD can contaminate surface and groundwater and pose severe ecological risk. Both active and passive methods have been developed for AMD treatment consisting of abiotic and biological techniques. Abiotic techniques are expensive and can create large amounts of secondary wastes. Passive biological treatment mainly consists of aerobic or anaerobic constructed wetlands. While aerobic wetlands are economical, they are not effective if the pH of the AMD is < 5. Anaerobic wetlands use organic-rich substrates to provide carbon source to iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The efficiency of these systems declines overtime and requires continuous maintenance. Our objective is to develop an alternative, low-cost, and sustainable floating wetland treatment (FWT) system for AMD for the abandoned Tab-Simco coal mining site in Illinois using vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides). Tab-Simco AMD is highly acidic, with mean pH value of 2.64, and contains high levels of sulfate and metals. A greenhouse study was performed for a 30-day period in order to screen and optimize the necessary parameters to design a FWT system. Water quality and plant growth parameters were continuously monitored. Results show significant SO4 (2-) removal, resulting in increased pH, particularly at higher planting densities. Vetiver also helped in metal removal; high amounts of Fe, Zn, and Cu were removed, with relatively lower amounts of Pb, Al, and Ni. Iron plaque formation on the root was observed, which increased metal stabilization in root and lowered root to shoot metal translocation. Vetiver was tolerant of AMD, showing minimal change in biomass and plant growth. Results obtained are encouraging, and a large scale mesocosm study is now in progress, as the next step to develop the vetiver-based system for AMD treatment.

In this regard, both observed and forecasted time series are incorporated as input variables of the models when applied for more than one lead time. Secondly, least-square ensemble models employing multiple wavelet-ANN models are developed to increase the performance of the single model. For this purpose, different wavelet families are linked with the ANN model and performance of each model is evaluated using error measures. The Skagit River near Mount Vernon in Washington county is selected as the case study. The daily flow discharge and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the current day are considered as input variables to predict suspended sediment concentration in the next day. For more lead times, the input structure is updated by adding the forecast of SSC in the previous time step. Results of this study demonstrate that incorporating both observed and predicted variables in the input structure improves performance of conventional models in which those only employ observed time series as input variables. Moreover, ensemble model developed for each lead time outperforms the best single wavelet-ANN model which indicates superiority of the ensemble model over the other one. Findings of this study reveal that acceptable forecasts of daily suspended sediment concentration up to 3 days in advance can be achieved using the proposed methodology.

Total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and total suspended matter (TSM) are important indexes of water quality and important factors influencing eutrophication and algal blooms. In this study, remote sensing was used to monitor these indexes to investigate the effects of river discharge on the estuary of Taihu Lake by the largest inflow river which is Chendong River using a total of 136 Geostationary Ocean Color Images (GOCI). In situ datasets collected during the four cruise experiments on Taihu Lake between 2011 and 2015 were used to develop the TP, Chl-a, and TSM inversion models based on simple empirical algorithms: 154 points for TP (mg/L), 114 for Chl-a (mu g/L), and 181 for TSM (mg/L). The spatial and temporal changes of the concentration of the three parameters in the Chendong River estuary were analyzed by combining the GOCI data, the flow of the Chendong River, and meteorological data throughout the year in 2014. The several key findings are as follows: (1) In summer and autumn, TP, Chl-a, and TSM contents were significantly higher than in winter and spring. TP and Chl-a have a few similar distribution characteristics. And organic suspended matter in summer was the main reason for the increase of the TSM concentration. (2) The severe surface erosion in the rivers cannot be ignored; the high erodibility is an important factor in the increase of TP and TSM concentrations in the estuary. The concentration of the water quality parameter showed exponential decay with distance from the shore. The concentration decreased slowly after 12 km and then remained essentially constant. (3) TP content in the Chendong River estuary decreased under steady flow inputs and dramatically increased when the flow became large. The increase in Chl-a content was linked to higher levels of TP and good weather conditions after the rain event. Higher flow rates mainly play a dilution role for the Chl-a concentration. Erosion of the surface soil via rainfall is a major source of TSM to the estuary. This paper firstly analyzes tempo-spatial dynamics of water quality and its response to river flow in estuary of Taihu Lake, helps to further understand the impact of river input on lake water quality, and is important for lake eutrophication.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	36			SI		28079	28101		10.1007/s11356-017-0305-7								WOS:000417874400045	28994019

A stochastic methodology using Monte Carlo simulations is proposed for assessing annual pollutant load, as well as the associated uncertainties, from a few event sampling campaigns and/or continuous turbidity measurements (representative of the total suspended solids concentration (TSS)). Indeed, in the latter case, the proposed method takes into account the correlation between pollutants and TSS. The developed method was applied to data acquired within the French research project "INOGEV" (innovations for a sustainable management of urban water) at the outlet of three urban catchments drained by separate storm sewers. Ten or so event sampling campaigns for a large range of pollutants (46 pollutants and 2 conventional water quality parameters: TSS and total organic carbon (TOC)) are combined with hundreds of rainfall events for which, at least one among three continuously monitored parameters (rainfall intensity, flow rate, and turbidity) is available. Results obtained for the three catchments show that the annual pollutant loads can be estimated with uncertainties ranging from 10 to 60%, and the added value of turbidity monitoring for lowering the uncertainty is demonstrated. A low inter-annual and inter-site variability of pollutant loads, for many of studied pollutants, is observed with respect to the estimated uncertainties, and can be explained mainly by annual precipitation.					gasperi, Johnny/0000-0003-4083-9698; Moilleron, Regis/0000-0001-8876-7123												0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	36			SI		28205	28219		10.1007/s11356-017-0384-5								WOS:000417874400055

Source water switch may cause physiochemical and microbiological de-stabilization of pipe material, biofilms, and loose deposits in drinking water distribution system (DWDS). Great sulfate alteration during source water switch had been deemed as the main cause of a red water case that occurred in a northern China city. To ascertain the relationship between water quality changing and bacterial communities of biofilms in DWDS and possible bacteria risk in a red water case, water quality changing experiments in simulated DWDSs were conducted for approximately 2 years. Twenty-five corrosion scale samples and eight water samples collected from pipe harvest sites or during experimental periods were analyzed for their bacterial community composition by 454-pyrosequencing technology. Taxonomy results together with redundancy analysis (RDA) or canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis all indicated that bacterial community of samples with groundwater (GW) or surface water (SW) supply history and their variations under high sulfate water were rather different owing to different water source histories and the original pipe scale characteristics. Potential opportunistic pathogens: Burkholderia, Escherichia-Shigella, Mycobacterium, Serratia, Ralstonia, Novosphingobium, Flavobacterium, Sphingomonas, and Sphingopyxis were observed in scale or water samples.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	36			SI		28220	28238		10.1007/s11356-017-0370-y								WOS:000417874400056	29022243

Mercury bioavailability, transformations, and effects on freshwater biofilms	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Mercury (Hg) compounds represent an important risk to aquatic ecosystems because of their persistence, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification potential. In the present review, we critically examine state-of-the-art studies on the interactions of Hg compounds with freshwater biofilms, with an emphasis on Hg accumulation, transformations, and effects. Freshwater biofilms contain both primary producers (e.g., algae) and decomposers (e.g., bacteria and fungi), which contribute to both aquatic food webs and the microbial loop. Hence they play a central role in shallow water and streams, and also contribute to Hg trophic transfer through their consumption. Both inorganic and methylated mercury compounds accumulate in biofilms, which could transform them mainly by methylation, demethylation, and reduction. Accumulated Hg compounds could induce diverse metabolic and physiological perturbations in the microorganisms embedded in the biofilm matrix and affect their community composition. The bioavailability of Hg compounds, their transformations, and their effects depend on their concentrations and speciation, ambient water characteristics, biofilm matrix composition, and microorganism-specific characteristics. The basic processes governing the interactions of Hg compounds with biofilm constituents are understudied. The development of novel conceptual and methodological approaches allowing an understanding of the chemo- and biodynamic aspects is necessary to improve the knowledge on Hg cycling in shallow water as well as to enable improved use of freshwater biofilms as potential indicators of water quality and to support better informed risk assessment.

J	Heritier, L; Duval, D; Galinier, R; Meistertzheim, AL; Verneau, O				Heritier, Laurent; Duval, David; Galinier, Richard; Meistertzheim, Anne-Leila; Verneau, Olivier			Oxidative stress induced by glyphosate-based herbicide on freshwater turtles	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Freshwater ecosystems face very strong anthropogenic pressures, among which overexploitation, habitat degradation, flow modification, species invasion, and water pollution lead to growing threats on biodiversity. Urbanization through wastewater treatment, industry through the release of inorganic and organic chemicals, and agriculture through the use of pesticides and herbicides are the main factors involved in water pollution. In France, more precisely in the Pyrenees-Orientales department, the poor quality of the watercourses is attributable overall to the use of glyphosate-based herbicides in agricultural activities. Because these chemicals can impact individuals, populations, and biodiversity, we investigated, under experimental conditions, the physiological response of animals facing abiotic contaminants. We selected as a model, juveniles of the freshwater turtle Trachemys scripta elegans. We measured the gene expression and activity of the catalase and superoxide dismutase enzymes as well as the levels of lipid peroxidation, which are all oxidative stress biomarkers, in turtles challenged with high concentrations of glyphosate-based herbicides, on the one hand, and with degraded waters collected from a local watercourse, on the other. We also measured the acetylcholinesterase activity across the same animals. We showed through variations in gene expression and enzyme activity that a glyphosate commercial formulation induced a stress in turtles. A similar outcome was obtained when turtles faced degraded waters. The results indicated that the poor quality of regional waters could be a real threat for animal health. Because turtles are globally less sensitive to contaminants than amphibians, which are lacking in the degraded waters of the Pyrenees-Orientales department, they could constitute an excellent model to follow the evolution of water quality through the study of oxidative stress biomarkers.

A shoreline divided: Twelve-year water quality and land cover trends in Lake Ontario coastal wetlands	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water quality in Great Lakes coastal wetlands has been studied for decades, but few studies look at water quality changes in multiple sites over many years and relate that to land cover. In this study, water quality at 22 sites in two regions along the north shore of Lake Ontario (Bay of Quinte in the east and Durham Region in the west) was compared over a period of 12 years (2003-2014) and related to land cover data from two time periods (1999-2002 and 2009-2011) at four spatial scales; 500 m, 1000 m, 2000 m wetland buffers, and the quaternary watershed. Water Quality Index (WQI) scores significantly increased over time in both regions, and turbidity and pH both significantly decreased over time in both regions. Land cover data showed regional differences between east and west, with the western sites having higher percentage of urban land at all scales. There were significant relationships between land cover (% Natural and % Urban) and WQI score at several scales, but the relationships were strongest at the watershed scale. We found that sites in the western region showed a greater amount of change in land cover between the two time periods, compared to the eastern sites. The results of this study provide some key insights on the impact of urbanization on Great Lakes coastal wetlands, and on how they can be managed in the future.

The contribution of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) to silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) DNA loads in the Chicago Area Waterway System	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Waterfowl and colonial waterbirds can have significant impacts on water quality in lakes and reservoirs by depositing feces that contribute to nitrogen and phosphorus loads. Piscivorous birds can also contribute the DNA of prey species to a water body. Here, we develop and apply a loading model to estimate the number of silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) DNA target marker copies that are potentially deposited by nesting double crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). The model assumes a conservative breeding population estimate ranging between 6000 and 8000 cormorants distributed among three large colonies in the Chicago metropolitan area. The model also assumes that cormorants are distributing feces randomly throughout the CAWS in proportion to the amount of time spent at each location. Results show that cormorants may be contributing 2.6 to 113 target marker copies/m(2)/day if birds are spending 22% of their time on open water and 6.4 to 291 target marker copies/m2/day if birds are spending 56% of their time on open water. Over the entire CAWS, cormorants may contribute tens of millions to billions of silver carp DNA copies each day. These target marker loads may be contributing to positive detections of silver carp environmental DNA (eDNA) in the CAWS. This study does not address other potential sources of silver carp genetic material in the CAWS, including live fish, and provides no indication as to whether or not the loads attributed to cormorants are large or small in relation to these other potential sources.

Spatiotemporal variation of bacterial water quality and the relationship with pasture land cover	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Pathogens are a major cause of water quality impairment and public health concern world-wide. In the United States, each state is tasked with developing water quality standards (WQS) to protect the designated use(s) of waterbodies. Several streams in the Illinois River Watershed in northwest Arkansas are currently listed as impaired due to elevated levels of pathogens. Our objective was to evaluate Escherichia coli (E. coli) numbers at 29 stream sites, compare these numbers to the applicable WQS, and investigate the relationship between E. coli numbers and land cover variables. E. coli numbers in samples collected at most sites were within allowable limits, although there were several instances of violations of the WQS. Violations were variable from year to year at some sites, and elevated levels of E. coli were spatially localized during baseflow. Violations also were positively related to pasture land cover in the drainage area, and particularly within the riparian buffer area. This relationship was non-linear, or threshold based, where there was a significant increase in the mean E. coli exceedances when riparian pasture land cover was greater than approximately 50%. These results can be used to identify specific stream reaches where E. coli numbers might be elevated and the implementation of best management practices can be geographically targeted.																	1477-8920					DEC	2017	15	6					839	848		10.2166/wh.2017.101								WOS:000417269400001	29215349

Notwithstanding the health implications, viral diversity and abundance is an indicator of water quality declination in the environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of viruses (bacteriophage and enteric viruses) in a highly polluted, anthropogenicinfluenced river system over a 6-month period at five sampling points. Cytopathic-based tissue culture assays revealed that the isolated viruses were infectious when tested on Hep-G2, HEK293 and Vero cells. While transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the majority of the viruses were bacteriophages, a number of presumptive enteric virus families were visualized, some of which include Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Polyomaviridae and Reoviridae. Finally, primer specific nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR)/reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) coupled with BLAST analysis identified human adenovirus, polyomavirus and hepatitis A and C virus genomes in river water samples. Taken together, the complexity of both bacteriophage and enteric virus populations in the river has potential health implications. Finally, a systematic integrated risk assessment and management plan to identify and minimize sources of faecal contamination is the most effective way of ensuring water safety and should be established in all future guidelines.																	1477-8920					DEC	2017	15	6					966	981		10.2166/wh.2017.066								WOS:000417269400012	29215360

Learning from open-ended failure descriptions in the WPDx dataset	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												Despite the explosion of geospatial data collected on water points, there have been relatively few efforts to date to use these data to understand the correlates and potential causes of water point breakdowns. We add to this literature by coding open-ended responses around functionality status in the open-access WPDx (Water Point Data Exchange) database. We code responses into 41 different categories of functionality problems for 244,075 water points from 25 countries in Africa, Asia and Central America, though we narrow our analysis to 41,716 points in six countries. We find that descriptions of technical breakdowns or problems are most common, though concerns about water resources and water quality feature prominently. We also find that 7% of records in our analysis subset spontaneously mention concerns over vandalism or theft, something which has received relatively little attention in the sector. Information on user financial contributions is mostly omitted by uploaders to WPDx, but we find that users are not contributing at all in 40% of the 96,651 water points with these data. Our results should be interpreted cautiously considering the obvious selection and subjectivity concerns, but the analysis highlights the potential benefits of coordinating an augmented data collection standard.																	2043-9083					DEC	2017	7	4					535	545		10.2166/washdev.2017.022								WOS:000417972100001						
J	Walter, CT; Kooy, M; Prabaharyaka, I				Walter, Carolin Tina; Kooy, Michelle; Prabaharyaka, Indrawan			The role of bottled drinking water in achieving SDG 6.1: an analysis of affordability and equity from Jakarta, Indonesia	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												Bottled water serves an increasingly large percentage of urban poor populations in lower-income countries, yet receives little attention within international development research and policy. This study investigates the impact of packaged drinking water (refill water) on affordability and equity of drinking water access by the urban poor under SDG 6.1, comparing refill water cost and consumption across socioeconomic quintiles drawn from two sub-districts of Jakarta, Indonesia. Analysis of a customer survey (n = 80) and in-depth interviews with 12 small-scale refill water providers reveals the significance of water quality, convenience, and reliability of water in defining affordable water access. Lower-income households perceive refill water to be the most affordable, safe drinking water source available to them, despite representing the second highest per unit cost source. Piped water is considered more expensive despite its low per unit volume cost, because of total costs associated with guaranteeing its reliability and quality. We suggest that the combined costs of securing domestic and drinking water for poorer households need to be considered for future approaches targeting the provision of inclusive water access under SDG 6.1 in Indonesia. Packaged water needs to be taken into account in the strategies designed to increase access, and measurements of affordability and equity of access.																	2043-9083					DEC	2017	7	4					642	650		10.2166/washdev.2017.046								WOS:000417972100011						
J	Dao, AD; Nguyen, DC; Han, MY				Anh Dzung Dao; Duc Canh Nguyen; Han, Moo Young			Design and operation of a rainwater for drinking (RFD) project in a rural area: case study at Cukhe Elementary School, Vietnam	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												Since 2014, awell-designed rainwater for drinking (RFD) project has been successfully operating at Cukhe Elementary School, near Hanoi, Vietnam. During that time, daily rainfall data, water consumption, water quality and questionnaires to the community were prepared. Several concerns over the design and operation of RFD projects, such as lack of sufficient rainfall data, water quality concerns, and public acceptance, are identified and overcome. Modeled results from using observed daily rainfall data, and using a simplified method from insufficient monthly data, are compared. The simplified method using insufficient rainfall data is acceptable for design within the error range of 0-11%. Rainwater quality after the use of the point of use treatment device proved that a well-designed rainwater harvesting (RWH) system ensures safe drinking water, which complies with WHO and Vietnam drinking water quality standards (VDWQS) guidelines. The people of the community liked the RFD system because of the satisfactory water quality and the economic benefits of not needing to purchase bottled water. The success of the RFD project at the Cukhe Elementary School proved the potential of promoting rainwater as drinking water in rural areas in developing countries, where a safe drinking water supply is a challenge, and should be promoted as an important means to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6.																	2043-9083					DEC	2017	7	4					651	658		10.2166/washdev.2017.055								WOS:000417972100012						
J	He, MB; Chen, C; Guo, C; Wang, S; Chang, HQ; Liu, BC				He, Meibo; Chen, Chen; Guo, Can; Wang, Shuai; Chang, Haiqing; Liu, Baicang			Optimization of aeration conditions in the hybrid process of coagulation-ultrafiltration with air sparging	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												To optimize the aeration conditions in the hybrid process of coagulation-ultrafiltration with air sparging, a series of air flow rates under continuous and intermittent sparging were investigated. The water quality characteristics that surrounded membranes, bubble characteristics, fouling resistances, and energy consumption under different aeration conditions were analyzed. The results showed that increasing air flow rates generated more bubbles with a wider size distribution (i.e., more favorable hydrodynamic conditions). The turbidity and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) of the water that surrounded membranes were reduced as the air sparging kept flocs away from membranes. Thus, the membrane fouling was effectively mitigated by increasing air flow rates despite aeration modes. For a given air flow rate, less fouling was obtained under continuous sparging than the intermittent mode. With respect to intermittent sparging, the mode of 40-min aeration per hour more effectively alleviated membrane fouling than the mode of 30-min aeration per hour. Weighing the energy consumption and membrane fouling, optimum air flow rates under continuous mode were between 15 and 30 mL/min, and the optimal aeration condition for intermittent mode was set at the air flow rate of 30 mL/min under the mode of 40-min aeration per hour.

J	Zhang, ZC				Zhang, Zhenchao			Treatment of oilfield wastewater by combined process of micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation and coagulation	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In this study, a combined process was developed that included micro-electrolysis, Fenton oxidation and coagulation to treat oilfield fracturing wastewater. Micro-electrolysis and Fenton oxidation were applied to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD) organic load and to enhance organic components gradability, respectively. Orthogonal experiment were employed to investigate the influence factors of micro-electrolysis and Fenton oxidation on COD removal efficiency. For micro-electrolysis, the optimum conditions were: pH, 3; iron-carbon dosage, 50 mg/L; mass ratio of iron-carbon, 2: 3; reaction time, 60 min. For Fenton oxidation, a total reaction time of 90 min, a H2O2 dosage of 12 mg/L, with a H2O2/Fe2+ mole ratio of 30, pH of 3 were selected to achieve optimum oxidation. The optimum conditions in coagulation process: pH, cationic polyacrylamide dosage, mixing speed and time is 4.3, 2 mg/L, 150 rpm and 30 s, respectively. In the continuous treatment process under optimized conditions, the COD of oily wastewater fell 56.95%, 46.23%, 30.67%, respectively, from last stage and the total COD removal efficiency reached 83.94% (from 4,314 to 693 mg/L). In the overall treatment process under optimized conditions, the COD of oily wastewater was reduced from 4,314 to 637 mg/L, and the COD removal efficiency reached 85.23%. The contribution of each stage is 68.45% (micro-electrolysis), 24.07% (Fenton oxidation), 7.48% (coagulation), respectively. Microelectrolysis is the uppermost influencing process on COD removal. Compared with the COD removal efficiency of three processes on raw wastewater under optimized conditions: the COD removal efficiency of single micro-electrolysis, single Fenton oxidation, single coagulation is 58.34%, 44.88% and 39.72%, respectively. Experiments proved the effect of combined process is marvelous and the overall water quality of the final effluent could meet the class III national wastewater discharge standard of petrochemical industry of China (GB8978-1996).																	0273-1223	1996-9732				DEC	2017	76	12					3278	3288		10.2166/wst.2017.486								WOS:000417838300012	29236007

Spatio-temporal variations of water quality in Nova Ponte Reservoir, Araguari River Basin, Brazil	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Multivariate techniques, like cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA), were used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of surface water quality in a large neotropical hydroelectric reservoir (Nova Ponte Reservoir). The dataset, obtained during the period of 1995-2011 from the Energy Company of Minas Gerais State (CEMIG), contains 14 parameters surveyed quarterly in 14 sites, at different depths. The CA grouped the 14 sites in three main groups: lotic sites, half of the photic zone sites and bottom sites. Statistical tests showed that only three parameters (total dissolved solids, nitrate and chemical oxygen demand) have no significant difference between cluster groups. The PCA results showed temporal changes of the water quality in all groups, illustrating modifications to the importance of the parameters over time. PCA also revealed the major causes of water deterioration from 1995 to 2005 were related to agricultural and livestock activities. Currently, the water quality parameters related to organic pollution are also highlighted. Generally, this study shows that possible optimization of the monitoring network should consider temporal variation of water quality parameters.																	1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1507	1514		10.2166/ws.2017.055								WOS:000417947000002						
J	Wu, SF; Zhang, X; She, DX				Wu, Shaofei; Zhang, Xiang; She, Dunxian			Joint occurrence of water quality indexes in relation to river streamflow in the heavily polluted Huai River Basin, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Effective joint management of water quantity and quality of rivers requires a good understanding of the interrelationships between these variables. This study aims to quantitatively evaluate the impact of river streamflow on the joint occurrence of water quality variables in the heavily polluted Huai River Basin (HRB). Using data from three representative stations, joint distributions were set up for two key water quality indexes, CODMn and NH3-N, for three different streamflow scenarios: low, medium and high streamflows, and the joint probabilities of different water quality combinations were calculated. The results showed that there was a significant negative relationship between streamflow and the water quality index, while the water quality indexes were significantly positively correlated. In general, the higher the river streamflow, the lower the joint probability of water quality variables under the three scenarios in each station. It is concluded that, in both the main stream and the tributary, high streamflow scenarios do help to improve the joint probability of water quality combination under a higher water quality grade, compared with a decrease under a lower quality grade. This study is expected to provide scientific references for water quality management and implementation of water pollution prevention in the HRB.				she, dunxian/B-4667-2018	she, dunxian/0000-0003-4660-3301												1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1602	1615		10.2166/ws.2017.046								WOS:000417947000011

Simulation of multiple water source ecological replenishment for Chagan Lake based on coupled hydrodynamic and water quality models	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Chagan Lake serves as an irrigation storage reservoir for the Qianguo Irrigation Area and an important ecological barrier in western Jilin. The coupled TUFLOW-FV and Aquatic Ecodynamic (AED2) models were used to simulate the hydrodynamic and water quality of Chagan Lake, and propose the water diversion scheme that could improve the water quality to reach Grade III and maintain the ecological water level. The simulation results showed a satisfactory agreement with observations. The total carrying loads of NH3-N, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for Chagan Lake were 1,147.6, 3,686.2 and 100.8 t from May to October. The range of the minimum amounts of water diversion to keep the water quality as Grade III and maintain the maximum ecological water level of 131.5 m for TN, TP were separately [32.60, 49.84, 57.19, 63.70, 70.91], [117.25, 135.26, 168.17, 190.65, 218.32] million m(3) and the corresponding reduction amounts of farmland drainage for TN, TP were separately [4.03, 0, 0, 0, 0], [73.08, 61.88, 50.23, 40.94, 31.98] million m(3) under the rainfall guarantee rates of 10%, 20%, 50%, 75%, 90%, respectively.

J	Yan, Y; Carter, M; Mercer, A				Yan, Y.; Carter, M.; Mercer, A.			Simulation of NOM events in pilot plant evaluation of DAF/Ozone/BAC for drinking water treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Pilot plant testing is invaluable for ascertaining the robustness of water treatment processes against raw water quality events such as turbidity and colour spikes, whether it be for stress testing of an existing process or designing of a new process. Unfortunately, the natural occurrence of such events (particularly colour) can be difficult to predict and commercial humic materials generally fail to closely match the indigenous natural organic matter (NOM) present in the raw water. Therefore, it is highly desirable to be able to simulate NOM event conditions. This paper describes a simple brewing method that we developed and used in our recent pilot plant evaluation of a proposed DAF/Ozone/BAC process for drinking water treatment. Using this method we successfully prepared, by using fallen leaves etc. collected from the local catchment area, large quantities of a concentrated NOM stock solution with its specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), when diluted, very close to the median SUVA of historical NOM events. The brewed solution showed broadly similar NOM characteristics to those of the raw water encountered during the pilot investigation period in terms of molecular weight distribution and fractionation. The coagulation behaviour was also examined for the spiked and non-spiked raw water.																	1606-9749					DEC	2017	17	6					1793	1800		10.2166/ws.2017.086								WOS:000417947000029						
J	Cao, QQ; Song, Y; Zhang, YR; Wang, RQ; Liu, J				Cao, Qingqing; Song, Ying; Zhang, Yiran; Wang, Renqing; Liu, Jian			Risk analysis on heavy metal contamination in sediments of rivers flowing into Nansi Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In order to understand the risk of heavy metals in sediments of the rivers flowing into Nansi Lake, 36 surface sediments were sampled from six rivers and seven heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, As, Pb, and Cd) were determined. Potential ecological risk index (RI) of the six rivers showed significant differences: Xinxue River, Jiehe River, and Guangfu River were at medium potential risk, whereas the risk of Chengguo River was the lowest. Jiehe River, Xuesha River, and Jiangji River were meeting the medium potential risk at river mouths. Geo-accumulation index (I (geo)) of the seven heavy metals revealed that the contamination of Cu and Cd was more serious than most other metals in the studied areas, whereas Cr in most sites of our study was not polluted. Moreover, correlation cluster analysis demonstrated that the contamination of Cu, Ni, and Zn in six rivers was mainly caused by local emissions, whereas that of As, Pb, and Cd might come from the external inputs in different forms. Consequently, the contamination of Cu and Cd and the potential risk in Xinxue River, Jiehe River, and Guangfu River as well as the local emissions should be given more attention to safeguard the water quality of Nansi Lake and the East Route Project of South to North Water Transfer.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	35					26910	26918		10.1007/s11356-015-4655-8								WOS:000417545800004

In this study, we aimed (i) to study the processes by which water quality might affect freshwater mussels in situ and (ii) to provide insights into the ecotoxicological significance of water pollution to natural populations in order to provide necessary information to enhance conservation strategies. M. margaritifera specimens were sampled in two close sites located upstream or downstream from an illegal dumping site. The renal transcriptome of these animals was assembled and gene transcription determined by RNA-seq. Correlations between transcription levels of each single transcript and the bioaccumulation of nine trace metals, age (estimated by sclerochronology), and condition index were determined in order to identify genes likely to respond to a specific factor. Amongst the studied metals, Cr, Zn, Cd, and Ni were the main factors correlated with transcription levels, with effects on translation, apoptosis, immune response, response to stimulus, and transport pathways. However, the main factor explaining changes in gene transcription appeared to be the age of individuals with a negative correlation with the transcription of retrotransposon-related genes. To investigate this effect further, mussels were classified into three age classes. In young, middle-aged and old animals, transcription levels were mainly explained by Cu, Zn and age, respectively. This suggests differences in the molecular responses of this species to metals during its lifetime that must be better assessed in future ecotoxicology studies.

This societal change is a consequence of a national drive toward economic prosperity. However, accelerated urban development resulting from rapid population migration from rural to urban lands has led to high levels of untreated sewage entering aquatic ecosystems directly. Consequently, many of these regions have been identified as hot spots of riverine nitrogen (N) pollution because of the increasing level of urban point-source discharge. In order to address this concern, we assessed effects of urban development on ammonia-nitrogen (AN) loads using a panel data regression model. The model, expressed as an exponential function of anthropogenic N inputs multiplied by a power function of streamflow, was applied to 20 subwatersheds of the Huai River Basin for the years 2003-2010. The results indicated that this model can account for 81% of the variation in annual AN fluxes over space and time. Application of this model to three scenarios of urban development and sewage treatment (termed urbanization priority, sustainable development, and environmental priority) suggests that future N pollution will inevitably deteriorate if current urban environmental management and investment are not significantly improved. Stronger support for environmental management is very critical to alleviate N pollution and improve water quality. More effort should focus on improving sewage treatment and the N removal rate of the current sewage system in light of the increasing degree of urbanization.					zhang, wangshou/0000-0001-9473-4555												0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	35					27201	27214		10.1007/s11356-017-0322-6								WOS:000417545800026

The present study quantifies exposure and health risk for the Ecuadorian population from the ingestion of arsenic in white rice. Estimated exposure is correlated with published data on tap water quality and biomarkers of exposure for the population of two towns in the metropolitan area of Quito. Estimated daily intake (EDI) of arsenic for infants living in urban areas of Ecuador is around four times that of European infants, being equal for those livings in rural areas. EDI for the population as a whole is almost twice that of Europe, but between a half and a third of that of Brazil, Bangladesh, and India. Estimated excess lifetime risk (ELTR) for adults is 3 per 10,000, while for infants varies between 10 per 10,000 in rural areas and 20 per 10,000 in urban areas. Future research on arsenic impacts on human health in Ecuador should consider in particular poor populations living in regions where environmental arsenic concentrations are highest, including cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiologic studies.

At the end of the experiment, several representative emitters were sampled to investigate the clogging mechanism through measuring the dry weight of biofilm substances (DW) and analysing the mineral constituents of clogging solids and the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of attached biofilm. The plain emitters demonstrated significantly better anti-clogging performance than the labyrinth emitters. For sewage application, the ions added increased the EPS and DW compared with sewage without ions added. Moreover, clogging in the labyrinth emitters increased with an increasing ion complex and concentration. Different irrigation water qualities produced similar mineral constituents of clogging solids: quartz, Ca+Mg carbonate, silicate, and iron oxide. However, the clogging risk and inducing mechanism varied with the types of ion added. Fe2+ promoted production of microorganisms and precipitation of solid particles, increasing the risk of biochemical clogging, while Ca2+ mainly caused chemical precipitation. A complex of Fe2+ and Ca2+ increased the risk of biochemical clogging under sewage application, while it caused chemical clogging for groundwater application. Therefore, the strategies for protecting emitter clogging should be developed through comprehensively considering water quality and emitter type used.

N application rates ranging from 0 to 180kg ha(-1) were tested, applying either secondary sewage effluent (SW) or groundwater (GW). Increasing the N application rate from 120 to 180kg ha(-1) did not significantly increase N uptake but substantially enhanced the apparent N loss (ANL) and nitrate leaching. Compared with GW irrigation, SW irrigation increased N uptake by 8% and soil residual N by 9% on average, whereas the ANL increased by 18%, suggesting that the detrimental impacts of SW irrigation may outweigh the benefits. The ANL values were enhanced mostly with increasing N application rates, followed by increasing initial soil N and nitrogen contained in irrigation water (irrigation N). Additionally, the ranking of factors increasing the leaching of nitrate was fertilizer N, deep percolation, irrigation N and initial soil N. Thus, SW irrigation combined with a high N application rate amplified the ANL and nitrate leaching losses. This study recommends N application rates ranging from 116 to 132kg ha(-1) to minimize the N losses when maize is irrigated with SW under drip irrigation in the North China Plain.

However, there is concern about the accumulation of salt from sewage effluent in soil. Experiments were conducted for 3 years in a greenhouse to investigate the effects of water quality on salt accumulation in soil and on sap flow for drip-irrigated tomato. The types of irrigation water used in the experiments included secondary sewage effluent, groundwater, and blended water that was obtained by mixing the secondary sewage effluent and the groundwater in equal volumes. The results demonstrated that soil bulk electrical conductivity (ECb) increased with irrigation rates, and sewage application produced a more rapid increase than did blended water and groundwater treatments. Irrigation throughout the growing season could produce a 21-44% increase in salt content from its initial values to values at harvest, and salt accumulation occurred mainly at the 30-45 cm depth of soil. Sewage irrigation was likely to decrease sap flow but increased tomato yield and improved fruit quality parameters excluding ascorbic acid compared with groundwater irrigation. These results suggest that secondary sewage application using drip irrigation increases salt accumulation in the root zone, and depresses crop transpiration to some extent, but does not have a negative influence on tomato yield and fruit quality.

J	Qiu, ZJ; Li, JS; Zhao, WX				Qiu, Zhenjie; Li, Jiusheng; Zhao, Weixia			Effect of Applying Sewage Effluent with Subsurface Drip Irrigation on Soil Enzyme Activities during the Maize Growing Season	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												Subsurface drip irrigation is an appropriate method when using sewage effluent for crop irrigation, but its resultant heterogeneous distribution of water and nutrients in the soil may affect enzyme activities (EAs). Field experiments were designed, with three lateral depths at 0, 15, and 30cm beneath the soil surface and three irrigation levels of 70, 100, and 130% of evapotranspiration, to investigate the effects of lateral depth, irrigation level, and water quality on the EAs of alkaline phosphatase, urease, and invertase in soil. Over 2years, a greater lateral depth noticeably enhanced EAs in deeper soils, while EAs at a shallow lateral depth were higher in topsoil. Compared to lateral depth, the effects of irrigation level on EAs were unstable in both years. The correlations between urease activities and NO3-N content indicated that the character of urease activities in soil N cycling was initially facilitating N mineralization and was subsequently converted to facilitate N uptake and immobilization during the maize growing seasons. Additionally, the EAs with both sewage effluent and groundwater irrigation at harvest, were generally higher than EAs measured prior to sowing. Furthermore, the sewage effluent irrigation imposed no negative effects on nutrient exchange and ecosystem functions in the soil. Our study recommends subsurface drip irrigation as a promising method for applying sewage effluent.

Hydrodynamic modeling along the southern tip of India: A special emphasis on Kanyakumari coast	JOURNAL OF OCEAN ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE												Hydrodynamic models are important to many coastal engineering designs and application, especially addressing sediment and water quality. In this study, MIKE 21 two-dimensional (2D) hydrodynamic model based on the flexible mesh (FM) technique was used to simulate the surface currents forced by tides and winds in Kanyakumari coast. The model results of the tidal level along shore and cross shore currents are agreed well with measured data in Kanyakumari coast. The major components of tides and currents are analyzed by harmonic analysis methods. Root mean square error (RMSE) values for the measured and model tides (0.017 m and 0.079 m) and currents (0.025 m/s and 0.009 m/s) during the northeast (NE) and southwest (SW) monsoon period are calculated. A series of scenario runs for NE and SW monsoon season are used to understand the regional circulation. The model result shows that the Kanyakumari coast is dominated by tides and surface currents flow, which are influenced by the seasonal reversal wind pattern.

Thus, it is an essential study to investigate factors affecting groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking uses. In this paper, the entropy theory, multivariate statistics, spatial autocorrelation index, and geostatistics are applied to characterize groundwater quality and its spatial variability in the Sylhet district of Bangladesh. A total of 91samples have been collected from wells (e.g., shallow, intermediate, and deep tube wells at 15-300-m depth) from the study area. The results show that NO3-, then SO42-, and As are the most contributed parameters influencing the groundwater quality according to the entropy theory. The principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation coefficient also confirm the results of the entropy theory. However, Na+ has the highest spatial autocorrelation and the most entropy, thus affecting the groundwater quality. Based on the entropy-weighted water quality index (EWQI) and groundwater quality index (GWQI) classifications, it is observed that 60.45 and 53.86% of water samples are classified as having an excellent to good qualities, while the remaining samples vary from medium to extremely poor quality domains for drinking purposes. Furthermore, the EWQI classification provides the more reasonable results than GWQIs due to its simplicity, accuracy, and ignoring of artificial weight. A Gaussian semivariogram model has been chosen to the best fit model, and groundwater quality indices have a weak spatial dependence, suggesting that both geogenic and anthropogenic factors play a pivotal role in spatial heterogeneity of groundwater quality oscillations.

Previous studies have mostly concentrated on evaluating the impacts of climate change on non-point source pollution in agricultural watersheds. Few studies have assessed the impacts of climate change on the water quality of river basins with complex point and non-point pollution sources. In view of the gap, this paper aims to establish a framework for stochastic assessment of the sensitivity of water quality to future climate change in a river basin with complex pollution sources. A sub-daily soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model was developed to simulate the discharge, transport, and transformation of nitrogen from multiple point and non-point pollution sources in the upper Huai River basin of China. A weather generator was used to produce 50 years of synthetic daily weather data series for all 25 combinations of precipitation (changes by -10, 0, 10, 20, and 30%) and temperature change (increases by 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 degrees C) scenarios. The generated daily rainfall series was disaggregated into the hourly scale and then used to drive the subdaily SWAT model to simulate the nitrogen cycle under different climate change scenarios. Our results in the study region have indicated that (1) both total nitrogen (TN) loads and concentrations are insensitive to temperature change; (2) TN loads are highly sensitive to precipitation change, while TN concentrations are moderately sensitive; (3) the impacts of climate change on TN concentrations are more spatiotemporally variable than its impacts on TN loads; and (4) wide distributions of TN loads and TN concentrations under individual climate change scenario illustrate the important role of climatic variability in affecting water quality conditions. In summary, the large variability in SWAT simulation results within and between each climate change scenario highlights the uncertainty of the impacts of climate change and the need to incorporate extreme conditions in managing water environment and developing climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	34					26545	26561		10.1007/s11356-017-0257-y								WOS:000417372600033	28952024

The results showed that contents of heavy metals had great temporal and spatial heterogeneity among studied reservoirs. Zn, Pb, and As presented significant enrichment ratio in reservoirs of Dou Shui (DS) and Feng Tang (FT), as well as Ti in reservoirs of DZ and GT. The content of Cd in reservoir of FT reservoirs was characterized with high health risk with the significantly highest value of 52.43 mg/kg. Furthermore, Pb was identified with high health risk in reservoirs of SFM, Ouyang Hai (OYH), FT, and DS, and As was in OYH and ZX. Multivariate statistical analysis suggested high consistency in the variations of Cr, Ni, and Cu; moreover, Cd, Zn, and Pb were characterized with great homogeneity in their sources. In addition, agricultural activities might exert less effect on variations of heavy metals in studied reservoirs, considered that there was a weak relationship between heavy metals and nutrients. These results could improve our understanding of the spatial variations of heavy metals and their potential sources in reservoirs in this ecologically fragile region.

Although covers containing geomembranes such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE) exhibit the attributes to be highly effective, there are few, if any, published studies monitoring their performance at full-scale WRPs. In 2011, a HDPE cover was installed over the Scotchtown Summit WRP in Nova Scotia, Canada, and extensive field performance monitoring was conducted over the next five years. A range of parameters within the atmosphere, cover, waste rock, groundwater and surface water, were monitored and integrated into a comprehensive hydrogeochemical conceptual model to assess (i) atmospheric ingress to the waste rock, (ii) waste rock acidity and depletion and (iii) evolution of groundwater and surface water quality. Results demonstrate that the cover is effective and meeting site closure objectives. Depletion in oxygen influx resulted in slower sulphide oxidation and AMD generation, while a significant reduction in water influx (i. e. 512 to 50 mm/year) resulted in diminished AMD release. Consistent improvements in groundwater quality (decrease in sulphate and metals; increase in pH) beneath and downgradient of the WRP were observed. Protection and/or significant improvement in surface water quality was evident in all surrounding watercourses due to the improved groundwater plume and elimination of contaminated runoff over previously exposed waste rock. A variably saturated flow and contaminant transport model is currently being developed to predict long-term cover system performance.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				DEC	2017	24	34					26744	26762		10.1007/s11356-017-0288-4								WOS:000417372600049						
J	Davraz, A; Aksever, F; Afsin, M				Davraz, Aysen; Aksever, Fatma; Afsin, Mustafa			Assessment of stream water chemistry and impact of geothermal fluid in the up-Buyuk Menderes Basin, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The discharge of geothermal fluid into the natural water environment may lead to serious damages. In this study, the impact of geothermal waste water on surface water has been investigated in the up-Buyuk Menderes River, Turkey. Thermal return water from district heating and from thermal bath in the Sandikli region were the most important source of major solutes and trace elements to the up-Buyuk Menderes River and tributaries. The thermal contribution causes a drastic increase in Na, SO4 ions, EC, and temperature of surface waters. The concentrations of As, Al, B, Fe, Cr, Li, S, P, Pb, U, Mn, and Zn are increasing dramatically downstream of thermal water inputs in the Kufi Creek tributary. In addition to natural thermal water inputs, water quality was impacted by anthropogenic trace and major element inputs from surface waters. The increased of some trace elements (Al, As, B, Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, P, U) in surface water are related to anthropogenic activities such as agricultural activities, sewage effluents, and stockyards in the study area. Additionally, surface water quality of the up-Buyuk Menderes River and tributaries was evaluated according to standards given by the Environmental Protection Agency of both Turkey and USA. Our study demonstrates the influence of thermal water inputs on water quality of surface waters.

These have a complex of values like food storage, water quality maintenance, livelihood and support species diversity, etc. Wetlands inventory is the pre-requisite process for conservation and management practices. The study makes an attempt to delineate wetlands and prepare inventory for turbidity and aquatic vegetation in Lower Barpani sub-watersheds (Assam), India. The study utilized Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) data during pre-and post-monsoon seasons, 2014. Wetlands during pre-and post-monsoon were delineated using supervised classification and threshold method. Wetland inventory for turbidity and aquatic vegetation was prepared during pre-and post-monsoon seasons. Single-band turbidity retrieval algorithm and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to assess the level of turbidity and aquatic vegetation in GIS environment. The study revealed that the variation in the extent of water logged wetlands in sub-watersheds was due to water spread variation during pre-and post-monsoon seasons. All the sub-watersheds were characterized by medium turbidity which was attributed to sediments and silts brought with runoff in wetlands. Aquatic vegetation showed variation in its distribution across subwatersheds. High vegetation indicated high turbidity and presence of nutrients. The study shows usefulness of remote sensing data in mapping and characterization of wetlands for preparing inventory and monitoring seasonal variation.

However, during the winter season, large parts of the Great Lakes are often covered by ice, which can cause significant uncertainties in satellite-measured water quality products. Although some developed radiance-based ice-detection algorithms for satellite ocean color data processing can eliminate most of the ice pixels in a region, there are still some significant errors due to misidentification of ice-contaminated pixels, particularly for the thin ice-covered regions. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the ice-detection methods for satellite ocean color data processing in the Great Lakes. In this paper, impacts of ice contamination on satellite-derived ocean color products in the Great Lakes are investigated, and a refined regional ice-detection algorithm which is based on the radiance spectra and normalized water-leaving radiance at the wavelength of 551 nm, nLw(551), is developed and assessed for satellite ocean color data processing in the Great Lakes. Results show that this proposed ice-detection method can reasonably identify ice-contaminated pixels, including those in very thin ice-covered regions, and provide accurate satellite ocean color products for the winter season in the Great Lakes.

Spatial and temporal replicability of meteoric and in situ Be-10 concentrations in fluvial sediment	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Cosmogenic isotopes, short-lived radionuclides, elemental concentrations and thermochronometric indicators are measured in river sand to quantify erosion rates and trace sediment sources, and/or infer erosional processes. Interpretations of detrital sediment analyses are often based on the rarely tested assumption of time-invariant tracer concentration. A better understanding of when and where this assumption breaks down and what sampling strategies minimize temporal and small-scale spatial variance will improve science done using detrital river sediment. Here, we present new and previously published spatial and temporal replicates measured for in situ and meteoric Be-10 (Be-10(i) and Be-10(m), respectively). Our new data include 113 replicate pairs, taken from agricultural and/or tectonically active watersheds in China months to millennia apart and spatial replicates taken up to 2 km apart on the same day. The mean percentage difference is 10% (-122% to 150%) for both systems considered together; the mode is close to 0% for both systems; and 36% of pairs of samples replicate within our analytical accuracy at 2 sigma. We find that Be-10(i) replicates better than Be-10(m) (p < 0.01). Be-10(i) replicability is worse in steeper basins, suggesting that stochastic processes (i.e. landslides) affect reproducibility. Be-10(m) replicability is worse in larger basins, suggesting non-conservative behavior of Be-10(m) as sediment moves downstream. Our results are consistent with the few previously published replicate studies. Considering all replicate data in a wide range of landscapes, in areas with deep erosional processes, replicability is poor; in other areas, replicability is good. This suggests that, in steep, tectonically active, and/or agricultural landscapes, individual detrital sediment measurements do not represent upstream rates as well as larger populations of samples. To ensure that measurements are representative of the upstream watershed, our data suggest that samples be amalgamated either over time or from several places close by in the same channel.

Designing a watershed scorecard as a performance evaluation tool for Ur River watershed, Tikamgarh District, Madhya Pradesh	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												The study is an attempt to design a watershed scorecard by identifying and evaluating selected set of indicators, such as surface water quality, ground water quality, soil condition, agriculture condition, and forest condition, which accurately reflect the health of the watershed. Ur River Watershed in Tikamgarh District, Madhya Pradesh was taken as a case study to assess the watershed health. Evaluation was done by calculating different indices for the selected set of indicators and comparing them with the National standards and guidelines. Based on the performance of each indicator, the grades were assigned to the indicators which helped in designing the watershed scorecard. The results revealed that within the watershed, the forest and soil conditions need a considerable plan for improvement in order to maintain the ecosystem whereas the surface water quality, groundwater quality and the agricultural conditions requires protection as well as enhancement in certain areas.

Simulation of Daily Flow Pathways, Tile-Drain Nitrate Concentrations, and Soil-Nitrogen Dynamics Using SWAT	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Tile drainage significantly alters flow and nutrient pathways and reliable simulation at this scale is needed for effective planning of nutrient reduction strategies. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been widely utilized for prediction of flow and nutrient loads, but few applications have evaluated the model's ability to simulate pathway-specific flow components or nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations in tile-drained watersheds at the daily time step. The objectives of this study were to develop and calibrate SWAT models for small, tile-drained watersheds, evaluate model performance for simulation of flow components and NO3-N concentration at daily intervals, and evaluate simulated soil-nitrogen dynamics. Model evaluation revealed that it is possible to meet accepted performance criteria for simulation of monthly total flow, subsurface flow (SSF), and NO3-N loads while obtaining daily surface runoff (SURQ), SSF, and NO3-N concentrations that are not satisfactory. This limits model utility for simulating best management practices (BMPs) and compliance with water quality standards. Although SWAT simulates the soil N-cycle and most predicted fluxes were within ranges reported in agronomic studies, improvements to algorithms for soil-N processes are needed. Variability in N fluxes is extreme and better parameterization and constraint, through use of more detailed agronomic data, would also improve NO3-N simulation in SWAT.

Evaluation of Existing and Modified Wetland Equations in the SWAT Model	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The ability to accurately simulate flow and nutrient removal in treatment wetlands within an agricultural, watershed-scale model is needed to develop effective plans for meeting nutrient reduction goals associated with protection of drinking water supplies and reduction of the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone. The objectives of this study were to incorporate new equations for wetland hydrology and nutrient removal in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), compare model performance using original and improved equations, and evaluate the ramifications of errors in watershed and tile drain simulation on prediction of NO3-N dynamics in wetlands. The modified equations produced Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of 0.88 to 0.99 for daily NO3-N load predictions, and percent bias values generally less than 6%. However, statistical improvement over the original equations was marginal and both old and new equations provided accurate simulations. The new equations reduce the model's dependence on detailed monitoring data and hydrologic calibration. Additionally, the modified equations increase SWAT's versatility by incorporating a weir equationand an irreducible nutrient concentration and temperature coefficient. Model improvements enhance the utility of SWAT for simulating flow and nutrients in wetlands and other impoundments, although performance is limited by the accuracy of inflow and NO3-N predictions from the contributing watershed.

To explore this balance, we developed a multi-objective decision support system for allocating BMP type and placement by coupling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool with a nondominated sorted genetic algorithm that minimizes total phosphorus (TP) yields from agricultural hydrologic response units (HRUs) and costs, while using stakeholder BMP familiarity as a constraint; conventional tillage, no tillage, nutrient management, riparian buffers, and contour cropping were explored. Using constraints representing current conditions, the optimization resulted in 59.6 to 81.0% reduction in agricultural TP yield from HRUs at costs ranging between US $0.8 and US $5.3 million. The constrained optimization tended to select mostly single BMPs or at most two BMPs for a given HRU due to these BMPs having higher acceptability to stakeholders. In contrast, the unconstrained case, representing full familiarity, selected 2- and 3-BMP applications. There was little difference in costs between the constrained and unconstrained cases below an 80% TP yield reduction; however, significant differences were found at larger reductions, supporting the value of stakeholder education and extension efforts.

We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to investigate how natural gas development could impact streamflow and sediment, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) loadings in the upper Delaware River Basin (DRB), a relatively undeveloped watershed of 7,950km(2) that lies above the Marcellus Shale formation. If gas development was permitted, our projections show the DRB could experience development of over 600 well pads to extract natural gas at build out, which, with supporting infrastructure (roads, gathering pipelines), could convert over 5,000ha from existing land uses in the study area. In subbasins with development activity we found sediment, TN, and TP yields could increase by an average of 15, 0.08, and 0.03kg/ha/yr, respectively (an increase of 2, 3, and 15%, respectively) for each one percent of subbasin land area converted into natural gas infrastructure. At the study area outlet on the Delaware River at Port Jervis, New York, we found increases in the annual average streamflow and sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads of up to 0.01, 0.2, 0.2, and 1%, respectively, for a rapid development year, and 0.08, 1.3, 2.0, and 11%, respectively, for the full development scenario.

We quantify ecosystem services of bioenergy-based land use change and estimate the potential changes of ecosystem services due to climate change projections. We considered 17 bioenergy-based scenarios with Miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn stover as candidate bioenergy feedstock. Soil and Water Assessment Tool simulations of biomass/grain yield, hydrology, and water quality were used to quantify ecosystem services freshwater provision (FWPI), food (FPI) and fuel provision, erosion regulation (ERI), and flood regulation (FRI). Nine climate projections from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-3 were used to quantify the potential climate change variability. Overall, ecosystem services of heavily row cropped Wildcat Creek watershed were lower than St. Joseph River watershed which had more forested and perennial pasture lands. The provision of ecosystem services for both study watersheds were improved with bioenergy production scenarios. Miscanthus in marginal lands of Wildcat Creek (9% of total area) increased FWPI by 27% and ERI by 14% and decreased FPI by 12% from the baseline. For St. Joseph watershed, Miscanthus in marginal lands (18% of total area) improved FWPI by 87% and ERI by 23% while decreasing FPI by 46%.

Assessment of Bioenergy Cropping Scenarios for the Boone River Watershed in North Central Iowa, United States	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Several biofuel cropping scenarios were evaluated with an improved version of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) as part of the CenUSA Bioenergy consortium for the Boone River Watershed (BRW), which drains about 2,370km(2) in north central Iowa. The adoption of corn stover removal, switchgrass, and/or Miscanthus biofuel cropping systems was simulated to assess the impact of cellulosic biofuel production on pollutant losses. The stover removal results indicate removal of 20 or 50% of corn stover in the BRW would have negligible effects on streamflow and relatively minor or negligible effects on sediment and nutrient losses, even on higher sloped cropland. Complete cropland conversion into switchgrass or Miscanthus, resulted in reductions of streamflow, sediment, nitrate, and other pollutants ranging between 23-99%. The predicted nitrate reductions due to Miscanthus adoption were over two times greater compared to switchgrass, with the largest impacts occurring for tile-drained cropland. Targeting of switchgrass or Miscanthus on cropland 2% slope or 7% slope revealed a disproportionate amount of sediment and sediment-bound nutrient reductions could be obtained by protecting these relatively small areas of higher sloped cropland. Overall, the results indicate that all biofuel cropping systems could be effectively implemented in the BRW, with the most robust approach being corn stover removal adopted on tile-drained cropland in combination with a perennial biofuel crop on higher sloped landscapes.

To address the water quality implications of increased biofuel production, biofuel scenarios were tested with a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model revision featuring improved biofuel crop representation. Scenarios included corn stover removal and the inclusion of two perennial bioenergy crops, switchgrass and Miscanthus, grown on marginal lands (slopes >2% and erosion rates >2 t/ha) and nonmarginal lands. The SWAT model estimates show water quality is not very sensitive to stover removal. The perennial bioenergy crops reduce simulated sediment, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) yields by up to 60%. Simulated sediment and P reductions in marginal lands were generally twice that occurring in the nonmarginal lands. The highest unit area reductions of N occurred in the less sloping tile-drained lands. Productivity showed corn grain yield was independent from stover removal, while yields of the two perennial bioenergy crops were similar in the marginal and nonmarginal lands. The results suggest planning for biofuel production in the Corn Belt could include the removal of stover in productive corn areas, and the planting of perennial bioenergy crops in marginal land and in low-sloped tile-drained areas characterized by high N pollution.

Assessing Parameter Uncertainty of a Semi-Distributed Hydrology Model for a Shallow Aquifer Dominated Environmental System	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This paper examines the performance of a semi-distributed hydrology model (i.e., Soil and Water Assessment Tool [SWAT]) using Sequential Uncertainty FItting (SUFI-2), generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE), parameter solution (ParaSol), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). We applied SWAT to the Waccamaw watershed, a shallow aquifer dominated Coastal Plain watershed in the Southeastern United States (U.S.). The model was calibrated (2003-2005) and validated (2006-2007) at two U.S. Geological Survey gaging stations, using significant parameters related to surface hydrology, hydrogeology, hydraulics, and physical properties. SWAT performed best during intervals with wet and normal antecedent conditions with varying sensitivity to effluent channel shape and characteristics. In addition, the calibration of all algorithms depended mostly on Manning's n-value for the tributary channels as the surface friction resistance factor to generate runoff. SUFI-2 and PSO simulated the same relative probability distribution tails to those observed at an upstream outlet, while all methods (except ParaSol) exhibited longer tails at a downstream outlet. The ParaSol model exhibited large skewness suggesting a global search algorithm was less capable of characterizing parameter uncertainty. Our findings provide insights regarding parameter sensitivity and uncertainty as well as modeling diagnostic analysis that can improve hydrologic theory and prediction in complex watersheds.

The elemental composition of sediments was measured through X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra. The occurrence and densities of OPs and amoeba hosts (i.e., Legionella spp. and L. pneumophila, Mycobacterium spp., P. aeruginosa, V. vermiformis, Acanthamoeba spp.) were determined using genus- or species-specific qPCR assays. Microbial community analysis was performed using next generation sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform. Mycobacterium spp. were most frequently detected in the sediments and water samples (88% and 88%), followed by Legionella spp. (50% and 50%), Acanthamoeba spp. (63% and 13%), V. vermiformis (50% and 25%), and P. aeruginosa (0 and 50%) by qPCR method. Comamonadaceae (22.8%), Sphingomonadaceae (10.3%), and Oxalobacteraceae (10.1%) were the most dominant families by sequencing method. Microbial communities in water samples were mostly separated with those in sediment samples, suggesting differences of communities between two matrices even in the same location. There were associations of OPs with microbial communities. Both OPs and microbial community structures were positively associated with some elements (Al and K) in sediments mainly from pipe material corrosions. Opportunistic pathogens presented in both water and sediments, and the latter could act as a reservoir of microbial contamination. There appears to be an association between potential opportunistic pathogens and microbial community structures. These microbial communities may be influenced by constituents within storage tank sediments. The results imply that compositions of microbial community and elements may influence and indicate microbial water quality and pipeline corrosion, and that these constituents may be important for optimal storage tank management within a distribution system.																	2076-0817					DEC	2017	6	4							54	10.3390/pathogens6040054								WOS:000417347700010	29072631

However, the installation of these systems is outpacing the research regarding the comparative effectiveness of specific design features. Monitoring is a required component of many stormwater regulatory programs, and can provide vital feedback to designers and engineers, lower costs, and determine long-term effectiveness and maintenance requirements, yet very few bioretention systems are monitored. For professionals that are interested in performance assessment, there are very few descriptions of monitoring infrastructure for small drainage areas that are detailed enough to replicate during new bioretention construction projects. This research describes the innovative infrastructure used at the University of Vermont (UVM) Bioretention Laboratory to accurately measure pollutant mass load reduction by roadside bioretention systems. The inflow and outflow monitoring infrastructure designs are provided in enough detail to be adapted and/or replicated in other field settings. The steps taken to integrate the infrastructure into new construction are also provided. Ninety degree v-notch and compound weirs were installed at the inflow and outflow of eight bioretention systems, respectively. Differential pressure transducers related water height to flow rate. A time-based discrete sampling methodology was tested and found to adequately sample multiple points throughout the inflow and outflow hydrographs. This allowed for the comparison of pollutant mass removal among different bioretention designs on an equal volume basis.

J	Pacheco, CHA; Neto, IEL				Pacheco, Carlos H. A.; Lima Neto, Iran E.			Effect of Artificial Circulation on the Removal Kinetics of Cyanobacteria in a Hypereutrophic Shallow Lake	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This study consisted of two parts. First, pre-aeration tests were conducted to assess the space-time variability of water quality in a shallow lake. Chlorophyll-a concentration and cyanobacteria cell density varied from 40 to 80 mu g L-1 and 0.5-2.0 x 10(6) cells/mL, respectively. In the second and major part of the study, aeration tests were carried out to investigate the influence of artificial circulation on the flow hydrodynamics and water quality. Comparison of the measurements taken inside and outside the bubble plumes showed that artificial circulation promotes a faster decay of chlorophyll-a concentration over time. First-order kinetics fitted well the time-variation of depth-averaged chlorophyll-a, cyanobacteria, and pheophytin-a. The net reduction rate of chlorophyll-a and cyanobacteria could be described as a function of a dimensionless parameter beta that controls bubble plume hydrodynamics or, alternatively, as a function of the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy epsilon. This net reduction rate of chlorophyll-a could also be linearly related to the net growth rate of pheophytin-a. This suggests that algal removal was caused mainly by cellular death. Finally, the relationships obtained in this study were used to predict the impact of artificial circulation on algal removal in water-supply reservoirs.

Water quality index (WQI) describes several water quality variables at a certain aquatic environment and time. Classically, WQI is commonly computed using the traditional methods which involved lengthy computation, consume timing and occasionally associated with accidental errors during subindex calculation. Thus, providing an accurate prediction model for WQI is highly required. Recently, the artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been examined for similar prediction applications and exhibited a remarkable ability to capture the nonlinearity pattern between predictors and predictand. In the current research, two different ANN algorithms, namely radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) and back propagation neural networks models, have been applied to examine and mimic the relationship of WQI with the water quality variables in a tropical environment (Malaysia). The input variables categorized into two different architectures and have been inspected. In addition, comprehensive analysis for the performance evaluation and the sensitivity analysis of the variables have been conducted. The results achieved are positively promising with high performance accuracy belonging to RBFNN model for both scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed approach offers an effective alternative to compute and predict WQI, to the fact that WQI manual calculation methods involved lengthy computations, transformations, use of various subindex formulae for each value of the constituent water quality variables, and consuming time.

Good performance was achieved with a hydraulic loading rate of 0.1 m(3)/m(2).d, indicating that the effluent water quality could meet the primary grade A values as put forth by the 'Cities Sewage Treatment Plant Pollutant Discharge Standard' (GB18918-2002). In addition, the results of three inflow total phosphorus (TP) concentrations (5 mg L-1, 15 mg L-1, and 30 mg L-1) indicated that high-levels of phosphorus were more advantageous in regards to improving the activity of denitrifying bacteria in soil and strengthening the effect of nitrogen removal, suggesting that the effluent total nitrogen (TN) concentration could meet the primary grade A standard (TN <= 15 mg L-1). It was further observed that soil depth was less crucial when inflow TP concentrations were higher. Therefore, the results indicated that inflow phosphorus concentrations could greatly influence nitrogen migration and transformation in deep subsurface wastewater infiltration systems.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				DEC	2017	76	11					3086	3093		10.2166/wst.2017.483								WOS:000417163700021	29210694

We conducted a series of experiments on L. victorianus aiming at producing juveniles for both human consumption and stock enhancement. A total of 79 broodstock (mean body weight=227.06g) were collected from the wild; packed at 200, 300, and 500g/L; and transported by road for 7h. All fish survived during transportation whereas dissolved oxygen decreased and total ammonia nitrogen increased significantly after transport. Females produced 46,702-86,712 eggs (mean=68,189 +/- 2397) and fecundity was highly correlated with the fish body size (R-2=0.96). Only males re-spawned in captivity while females did not. At 28 C, females spawned 11-12h after pairing with males. Larvae can either be fed with formulated diet or natural zooplankton. Juveniles (mean length=36.7mm; mean body weight=0.46g) can be packed as high as 60 fish/L and transported by road for 12h with low mortality (2.7-10.3%). These results show that captive breeding of L. victorianus can be a good strategy to produce juveniles to boost wild population as well as a source of seeds for culture.

Riparian and microhabitat factors determine the structure of the EPT community in Andean headwater rivers of Ecuador	ECOHYDROLOGY												This research was conducted in the high-Andean basin of the Zhurucay River in southern Ecuador. In 4 river reaches, 19 sampling campaigns were conducted per reach spread over a period of 35months. The biotic samples were selected in the periods with greatest flow stability. Parallel to each sampling, 37 environmental variables grouped into 3 factors (riparian corridor, hydromorphology, and water quality) were recorded. The study aimed to analyse during periods of stable flow the influence of these environmental factors on the structure and density of the EPT community (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) in a quasi-pristine aquatic ecosystem. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the Froude number, gravel type, and width/depth ratio are the most relevant hydromorphological variables explaining variations in EPT density. Xiphocentronidae, Contulma, and Helicopsyche were observed to have a relationship with the order of the river, while Ochrotrichia, Nectopsyche, and Phylloicus varied with the type of riparian vegetation. Phylloicus, Ochrotrichia, and Nectopsyche were common in lentic sites, while the proportion of gravel and the width/depth ratio restricted the genus Helicopsyche. The only relevant water quality factor was the total phosphorus, which was related with 2 taxa. In conclusion, although macroinvertebrates are currently employed in water quality studies, riparian vegetation and hydromorphological factors are determinant for their communities in pristine Andean rivers. Such factors are therefore crucial in the study of environmental flows and the assessment of the ecological integrity.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				DEC	2017	10	8							UNSP e1894	10.1002/eco.1894								WOS:000417099800009

Ecosystem services mapping for detection of bundles, synergies and trade-offs: Examples from two Norwegian municipalities	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												The main objective of this work was to analyse how increased harvesting for bioenergy production might affect other Ecosystem Services (ES) in two Norwegian municipalities (Ringsaker and Voss). The aim was to identify locations where synergies or conflicts between ES could be expected. The spatial distribution of eight different ES (3 provision, 3 regulation and 2 cultural services) was modelled using information provided by land use spatial databases and additional data sources. Model parameters were set by integrating existing research and expert knowledge. Maps showing the level of provision of ES were analysed using a moving window to analyse scale dependence in the spatial distribution of ES provision. Map algebra was then used to identify areas providing multiple ES, thus defining the most important areas on which to focus the management of both synergies and trade-offs. Finally, specific 'binary bundles' maps, where bioenergy provision was compared with each of the other ES, were developed. The methodology proved its utility to assess the compatibility of bioenergy uses with other services. This straightforward approach is readily replicable in other regions and can be used as a decision support tool for planning and designing provision areas, and to ensure sustainable forest management approaches.

However, the literature reveals no systematic analysis of the possible social welfare losses due to the cost of both quantity depletion and quality deterioration. This paper therefore investigates the long run welfare cost of using groundwater for agriculture by including both quantity depletion and quality deterioration costs simultaneously. This is achieved through an empirical study of onion farmers in Sri Lanka who use groundwater for their cultivation. A significant social welfare loss is found in terms of both groundwater quantity and quality deterioration costs and which is likely to increase over the long run. This is shown to have important long run implications for land use management. (C) 2017 Department of Forest Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Umea. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Water assessment using ultra-weak bioluminescence	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY												In this paper a method to evaluate the presence of microorganisms of the coliform group in water samples using the ultra-weak bioluminescence (UWB) is proposed. A series of UWB measurements and optical density measurements from cultures of both a set of standard E. coli strain samples, and a set of water samples from a river near Curitiba City in Brazil were performed. All samples were previously incubated at 37 degrees C for 11 h in nutritive medium before the temporal UWB emission profiles data were acquired for a period of 24 h inside a dark chamber of an especially implemented instrumentation capable of doing photon counting measurements. For the optical density measurements, a spectrophotometer was used to acquire the growth kinetics of those cultures for a period of 13 h, and the results compared to the UWB profiles. Periodic time-components analysis of the UWB data from both the set of standard E. coli samples and the set of the river's water samples were performed and compared to each other. The results have shown that the UWB temporal profiles resemble in some way the growth kinetics curve and the periodic time-components analysis is an effective way to discriminate between contaminated and non-contaminated samples, therefore the method may be viable for detecting coliforms in water samples in less time than usual methods.																	1011-1344					DEC	2017	177						39	43		10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2017.10.014								WOS:000416881900006	29049939

Of particular significance for lakes are severe storms that can influence biogeochemical processes and biological communities by disrupting the vertical thermal structure during periods of stratification. An exceptional storm passing over northern Germany in July 2011 provided an opportunity to assess the consequences and underlying mechanisms of such extreme events on the interplay between the physics and ecological characteristics of a deep, nutrient-poor lake. Wind speeds were among the most extreme on record. A suite of variables measured throughout the event consistently indicates that a cascade of processes pushed the clear-water lake into an exceptionally turbid state. Specifically, thermocline deepening by the storm-entrained cyanobacteria of a deep chlorophyll maximum located at about 8 m depth into the surface mixed layer. Released from light limitation, intense photosynthesis of the cyanobacteria boosted primary production, increased algal biomass, raised the pH and thus induced massive calcite precipitation to a level never observed within three decades of lake monitoring. As a consequence, water transparency dropped from 6.5 to 2.1 m, the minimum on record for 40 years, and the euphotic zone shrank by about 8 m for several weeks. These results show that cyanobacterial blooms not only are promoted by climate warming, but can also be triggered by extreme storms. Clear-water lakes developing a deep chlorophyll maximum appear to be particularly at risk in the future, if such events become more intense or frequent.

The Influence of Legacy P on Lake Water Quality in a Midwestern Agricultural Watershed	ECOSYSTEMS												Decades of fertilizer and manure applications have led to a buildup of phosphorus (P) in agricultural soils and sediments, commonly referred to as legacy P. Legacy P can provide a long-term source of P to surface waters where it causes eutrophication. Using a suite of numerical models, we investigated the influence of legacy P on water quality in the Yahara Watershed of southern Wisconsin, USA. The suite included Agro-IBIS, a terrestrial ecosystem model; THMB, a hydrologic and nutrient routing model; and the Yahara Water Quality Model which estimates water quality indicators in the Yahara chain of lakes. Using five alternative scenarios of antecedent P storage (legacy P) in soils and channels under historical climate conditions, we simulated outcomes of P yield from the landscape, lake P loading, and three lake water quality indicators. Legacy P had a significant effect on lake loads and water quality. Across the five scenarios for Lake Mendota, the largest and most upstream lake, average P yield (kg ha(-1)) varied by -41 to +22%, P load (kg y(-1)) by -35 to +14%, summer total P (TP) concentration (mg l(-1)) by -25 to +12%, Secchi depth (m) by -7 to +3%, and the probability of hypereutrophy by -67 to +34%, relative to baseline conditions. The minimum storage scenario showed that a 35% reduction in present-day loads to Lake Mendota corresponded with a 25% reduction in summer TP and smaller reductions in the downstream lakes. Water quality was more vulnerable to heavy rainfall events at higher amounts of P storage and less so at lower amounts. Increases in heavy precipitation are expected with climate change; therefore, water quality could be protected by decreasing P reserves.

Perpetual Phosphorus Cycling: Eutrophication Amplifies Biological Control on Internal Phosphorus Loading in Agricultural Reservoirs	ECOSYSTEMS												Nearly half of US lakes are impaired, primarily resulting from excessive nutrients and resultant eutrophication. The stability and recycling of sediment P results in differing degrees of internal P loading, which can alter lake water quality. In this study, we asked: (1) What are the underlying mechanisms controlling internal loading (net release) and retention of P? and (2) How does trophic state, specifically a hypereutrophic condition, affect internal P loading in agricultural reservoirs? We show that shifts in internal P loading are related to trophic-level indicators, including total P (TP) and chl-a concentrations. All study reservoirs were classified as hypereutrophic, and we grouped them as "less eutrophic" or "more eutrophic" based on TP and chl-a concentrations. In less eutrophic lakes, chemical variables (for example, oxygen) and sediment iron-bound P primarily controlled internal P loading under anaerobic conditions. However, in the more eutrophic lakes, biological variables, including phytoplankton biomass (as indicated by chl-a concentrations) and extracellular enzyme activity, drove internal P loading or reduced P retention under aerobic conditions. Biologically controlled aerobic internal P cycling was related to higher sediment organic P pools being broken down by enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, we theorize that as lakes become hypereutrophic, biological mechanisms begin to amplify internal P release by acting under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, thus creating a perpetual cycle of internal P loading. Thus, the role of biological processes and oxygen availability should be considered in water quality management strategies aimed at alleviating eutrophication in lakes.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2017	20	8					1483	1493		10.1007/s10021-017-0126-z								WOS:000417063300007

Drinking water quality was assigned to all Danish households using spatial methods, and the related uncertainty due to sampling density was identified. Nitrate was used as an example contaminant. From 1978, 98% of all Danish households were geocoded with their precise location, yielding a total of 69 million evaluated household-years. Households supplied by a private well (4% of all household-years) were identified; the remaining majority was supplied by public waterworks. Water supply areas were connected to the Jupiter geodatabase to estimate drinking water quality at publicly supplied households. For privately supplied households, the exposure estimate had a substantially higher uncertainty, with 52% of household-years never being sampled, compared with 1% of publicly supplied household-years. For the 18% of all household-years with no nitrate samples, concentrations were estimated by interpolation and an uncertainty score based on the closest nitrate measurement was introduced. While nitrate was used as an example contaminant, the proposed approach is generic and can be used for all monitored drinking water parameters, after preprocessing and validation of the specific data and assumptions.

The Effects of Emotions on Stated Preferences for Environmental Goods	ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS												A substantial literature in behavioural science and psychology shows that emotions affect human choices and values. This paper investigates whether such emotional impacts are also present in stated choice experiments for environmental goods. If this were so, it would introduce an additional element of context dependence to the welfare measures derived from such methods, and would be at odds with the rational choice model underlying welfare economics. A laboratory experiment using three different emotion treatments was combined with a stated preference choice experiment concerned with changes in coastal water quality and fish populations in New Zealand. No statistically significant effects of changes in emotional state on estimated preference parameters, willingness to pay or the randomness of choices were found. The paper concludes by questioning, why such a contrast exists with empirical findings in behavioural science.

J	Artell, J; Huhtala, A				Artell, Janne; Huhtala, Anni			What Are the Benefits of the Water Framework Directive? Lessons Learned for Policy Design from Preference Revelation	ENVIRONMENTAL & RESOURCE ECONOMICS												The Water Framework Directive (WFD) seeks to achieve good ecological status of surface waters across the European Union by 2027. The WFD guidelines explicitly recognize the economics of water management by providing exceptions to water areas with disproportionately high restoration costs. This calls indirectly for estimations of benefits lost due to non-attainment. We employ a hedonic property pricing approach on waterfront recreational properties to estimate the welfare impacts of attaining the good ecological status described by the WFD. The empirical challenge is that the quality measure proposed by the WFD specifically denotes ecological quality, whereas economically measurable water quality values are heavily dependent on recreation impacts. Intuitively, the choice of water quality measure should have an effect on estimating the value of water quality. Our data provide a unique chance to compare three alternative indicators of water quality: (1) a usability-based index, (2) subjectively reported measure and (3) the ecological status determined by the WFD. We find that an improvement in water quality is associated with a statistically significant, non-linear change in recreational property values. We show how the ecological status compares with the other two indicators, and discuss the justifiability of using revealed preference methods when the valued good is defined purely on the basis of ecological criteria.

An integrated water management, which takes into account the most important present and future pollution sources, had not yet been established for the Thi Vai catchment before the beginning of the BMBF project EWATEC-COAST, coordinated by the TU Braunschweig. The primary objective of this project was, therefore, to develop a model-based management system for sustainable water and environmental protection of the Thi Vai catchment. For such a system, monitoring data are an essential basis for assessing the current state of rivers in the catchment, for identifying the existing processes and pollution sources and for calibrating and validating the model-based management system. Based on the existing historical water quality data, which were collected quarterly within the governmental monitoring program, an evaluation of the spatial and especially temporal dynamics of water quality was not possible. For this reason, a separate monitoring program of water quantity and quality was initiated at the beginning of the project. At 7 monitoring stations along the Thi Vai estuary and its important tributaries, water quantity was measurery 10 minutes and lasted from March 2013 to September 2014 (19 months). Due to financial reasons, the monitoring of water quality had a duration of 11 months (from March 2013 to January 2014). At the same stations, water quality was measured once a week. Investigated water quality parameters aed evre water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, total nitrogen, dissolved phosphate, total phosphorus, iron and total suspended solids. In this paper, the spatial and temporal variability of the collected data is examined. The data show the strong influence of the tide on the Thi Vai estuary. While the areal rainfall divides the hydrological regime of the inflows into low-water and high-water phases, the Thi Vai estuary is mainly influenced by the tide. The water quality data show a pollution of the inflows with ammonium, nitrite, TSS and iron. For the Thi Vai estuary, the low oxygen contents and the very high nitrite concentrations are the main water quality problems. In addition, data from this monitoring are compared with data from the past in order to understand the development of the water quality of the estuary.																	1439-1783					DEC	2017	61	6					370	382		10.5675/HyWa_2017,6_1								WOS:000416850700002

Although the catchment is a prominent pollution source for the Thi Vai Estuary, it was ignored by the local authorities up to now. Within the BMBF research project EWATEC-COAST a coupled model system was developed. It consists of an eco-hydrological catchment model and a hydrodynamic water quality model for the tidal main river. The eco-hydrological model, which was calibrated with data collected in the project, is in the focus of this contribution. Water and substance balances of the catchment were simulated for an extended historical time period with the calibrated eco-hydrological model PANTA RHEI-WQ using available meteorological long-term series. It was demonstrated that today the catchment is a primary source of pollution for the Thi Vai Estuary, delivering higher substance loads than the adjacent industrial zones. It was also shown, that the upper part of the Thi Vai is the current pollution hot spot. Approximately 55 % of the substance load from the catchment and approx. 35 % of the substance load from the industrial zones are entering the Thi Vai in that area. Furthermore the impact of climate change (2046 to 2065) on the water quantity and quality was quantified and was compared to a combined scenario, which accounts for a progressive development of the anthropogenic pollution in addition to climate change. It was demonstrated, that, under the given boundary conditions, the anthropogenic impact on water quantity and quality is stronger than the impact of climate change on its own. It was also shown, that the combined scenario of climate change and anthropogenic development can lead to an amplification of negative effects.

J	Zeunert, S; Lorenz, M; Nguyen, HQ; Meon, G				Zeunert, Stephanie; Lorenz, Malte; Hong Quan Nguyen; Meon, Guenter			Model-based analysis of the impacts of climate change and ongoing anthropogenic developments on the water quality of the tropical Thi Vai estuary	HYDROLOGIE UND WASSERBEWIRTSCHAFTUNG												Due to untreated discharges from numerous anthropogenic sources, the Thi Vai estuary, situated in South Vietnam, has been heavily polluted during the past years. The effects of climate change and a further increase in pollution, as a result of the rapid development of industry, population and agriculture in the catchment, were quantified for the water quantity and quality of the estuary in the framework of the BMBF project EWATEC-COAST. The joint German-Vietnamese project was coordinated by the TU Braunschweig. As part of an integrated management system, a hydrodynamic water quality model (Delft3D) was setup for the Thi Vai estuary. The model was closely linked to the eco-hydrological model PANTA RHEI-WQ, which provides time series for the upstream inflow boundary conditions. Data from a monitoring program initiated in the project were used to calibrate the hydrodynamics and the water quality. For the hydrodynamic calibration of water level and discharge in the estuary good results were obtained, which are confirmed by high correlation coefficients. The calibration of the water quality posed a bigger challenge due to the lack of data and several uncertainties. However, taking into account the mentioned uncertainties, the model showed adequate representations of the measured data. The calibrated model was used to estimate the impact of climate change and associated sea level rise as well as the impact of a progressive development of industry, population and a change in land use in the catchment on the water quantity and quality of the estuary. Considering the sole influence of climate change, the results generally show slightly reduced substance concentrations in the estuary. This is partly due to the increased dilution volume caused by the increase in sea level and to the increased temperature-dependent process rates of organic degradation and nitrification. At the same time, it has to be considered that both processes require oxygen, which leads to a drop in oxygen concentrations in the estuary. When considering the combined climate and development scenario, which takes into account climate change as well as a progressive development of population, industry and a change in land use, the partly positive effects on the water quality of the estuary are negated. Especially in the upper reaches of the estuary, increasing substance concentrations and a further decrease in oxygen contents are indicated. The results show, that for the long-term improvement of the water quality of the Thi Vai estuary a sustainable water quality management is necessary.

Often, decision makers are lacking well-developed planning criteria as well as model-based integrated planning tools for an integrated and sustainable water resources management. Within the research project EWATEC-COAST in the frame of the funding initiative CLIENT of the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), an initial basic version of a GIS-based management system (WAMS.bas) was developed in close cooperation with Vietnamese institutions and authorities. It integrates collected data and results of all sub-projects and supplies the processed data to the user. At present, the system can be used as a planning tool. It was developed in close cooperation with university institutions and the local environmental agency of the affected provinces as main users. It gives the Vietnamese planners and stakeholders a holistic view into the project results and allows them to use the system for decision making, for example for restrictions to industrial zones. The data, maps and processed results of the monitoring and modeling of the sub-projects are stored within the data base. In this way, an overall picture is created of the hydrology, ecohydrology, hydrodynamics and water quality within the Thi Vai area. Furthermore, the influence of climate and anthropogenic change on the water quantity and quality can be examined. The data from the monitoring and the results of the coupled modeling stored in the management system serve as a basis for decision making processes with the main goal of improving the water quality of the estuary. Presently, the basic version, WAMS. bas, is used by the responsible governmental environmental agency. Upon request of the agency, it is planned to expand the basic version regarding planning alternatives and process routines and extend the system to other catchments. Furthermore, the system will be developed further to an operational version integrating online water quality data. The final aim will be to apply the expanded future system for the daily water resources management, but also for disaster early warning related to water pollution and storm surges.

Aeration was conducted by pumping epilimnetic water through the thermocline to the hypolimnion without breaking the thermal stratification. The model used time transient equation based on Navier-Stokes equation. The model was fitted to the vertical temperature distribution and environmental parameters (wind, air temperature, and solar radiation) before the onset of aeration, and the model was used to predict the vertical temperature distribution 3 and 15 days after the onset of aeration (1 August and 22 August). The difference between the modelled and observed temperature was on average 0.6 A degrees C. The average percentage model error was 4.0% on 1 August and 3.7% on 22 August. In the epilimnion, model accuracy depended on the difference between the observed temperature and boundary conditions. In the hypolimnion, the model residual decreased with increasing depth. On 1 August, the model predicted a homogenous temperature profile in the hypolimnion, while the observed temperature decreased moderately from the thermocline to the bottom. This was because the effect of sediment was not included in the model. On 22 August, the modelled and observed temperatures near the bottom were identical demonstrating that the heat transfer by the aerator masked the effect of sediment and that exclusion of sediment heat from the model does not cause considerable error unless very short-term effects of aeration are studied. In all, the model successfully described the effects of the aerator on the lake's temperature profile. The results confirmed the validity of the applied computational fluid dynamic in artificial aeration; based on the simulated results, the effect of aeration can be predicted.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4169	4176		10.1007/s13201-017-0577-6								WOS:000416833900001

To investigate the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater and its suitability, twenty samples were collected from the shallow tubewells of study area having screen depth 21-54 m. The water quality assessment has been carried out by evaluating the physicochemical parameters such as temperature, pH, EC, TDS and major ions i.e., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), HCO3 (-). Results found that, the water is slightly alkaline and brackish in nature. The trends of cations and anions are Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and Cl- > HCO3 (-) > SO4 (2-) > NO3 (-), respectively and Na-Cl-HCO3 is the dominant groundwater type. The analyzed samples were also characterized with different indices, diagram and permissible limit i.e., electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride content (Cl), soluble sodium percentage (SSP), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), Kelley's ratio (KR), Wilcox diagram and USSL diagram, and results showed that groundwater are not suitable for drinking and irrigational use. The factors responsible for the geochemical characterization were also attempted by using standard plot and it was found that mixing of seawater with entrapped water plays a significant role in the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4219	4236		10.1007/s13201-017-0533-5								WOS:000416833900005

In total, 34 groundwater samples were analyzed for major elements (Tp, pH, EC, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), NO2 (-), NH4 (+), H2PO4 (-), CO3, and HCO3 (-)) and trace metal (Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, and Zn) content. The results show that the pH values range between 6.7 and 8.9, electrical conductivity ranges between 740 and 7340 A mu S/cm, and nitrate content ranges between 1.7 and 212 mg/l. Hydrochemical facies represented using a Piper diagram indicate an Na-K-Cl type water. All the trace metal concentrations are within the admissible standard range except for Cd. The bacteriological analysis showed that the majority of groundwater samples are contaminated. Generally, the content of total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci ranged from 0 to 140, 0 to 125, and 0 to 108 CFU/100 ml, respectively. The samples are grouped according to three factors. Factor 1 shows strong positive loadings of EC, Mg, Cl, Na and K with 51.91% of total variance (TV); factor 2 shows strong negative loadings of NO3, SO4 and Ca with 17.98% of TV; and factor 3 shows strong negative loading of HCO3 with 15.56 of TV. We conclude that the quality of this groundwater is suitable for irrigation and domestic use (cleaning house, ect).

The extensive mining of the area has resulted in disruption of the groundwater availability in terms of both quantity and quality. This has led to a drinking water crisis, especially during the pre-monsoon period in the West Bokaro coalfield area. The characterization of the hydrogeological system and the artificial recharging of the aquifers might help to better manage the problem of the groundwater-level depletion. For this purpose, seven important hydrogeological factors (water depth, slope, drainage, soil, infiltration, lithology, and landuse) have been considered to define the most suitable locations for artificial groundwater recharging in the mining area. Different thematic maps were prepared from existing maps and data sets, remote-sensing images, and field investigations for identification of the most suitable locations for artificial recharge. Thematic layers for these parameters were prepared, classified, weighted, and integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) environment by means of fuzzy logic. The results of the study indicate that about 29 and 31% of the area are very suitable and suitable for recharging purposes in the West Bokaro coalfield. However, the rest of the area is moderate to unsuitable for recharging due to the ongoing mining and related activities in the study area. The groundwater recharging map of the study area was validated with measured electrical conductivity (EC) values in the groundwater, and it indicated that validation can be accepted for the identification of groundwater recharging sites. These findings are providing useful information for the proper planning and sustainable management of the groundwater resources in the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4513	4524		10.1007/s13201-017-0603-8								WOS:000416833900027

The analyzed data revealed that iron and zinc metals were found to be the most abundant metals in the river Godavari and its tributaries. Iron (Fe) recorded the highest, while cadmium (Cd) had the least concentration. Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, iron and zinc metals are within the acceptable limit of BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) 1050 (2012) Specification for drinking water, pp 1-5). The analysis of Godavari river and its tributary's water samples reveals that the water is contaminated at selected points which are not suitable for drinking. Nickel and Copper concentration is above acceptable limit and other metal concentration is within the acceptable limit. Comprehensive study of the results reveals that out of 18 water quality stations monitored, water samples collected at 7 water quality stations are found to be within the permissible limit for all purposes. While Rajegaon, Tekra, Nandgaon, P. G. Bridge, Bhatpalli, Kumhari, Pauni, Hivra, Ashti, Bamini, and Jagda stations were beyond the desirable limit due to presence of copper and nickel metals. The contents of copper metal ions were higher at some water quality stations on Wunna river (Nandgaon); Wardha river (Hivra) and Wainganga river (Kumhari, Pauni, Ashti) during Feb. 2012, while nickel concentration during Feb. 2012, June 2012, March 2013 and Aug. 2013 at some water quality stations on rivers Bagh, Indravati, Pranhita, Wunna, Penganga, Peddavagu, Wainganga and Wardha. It can be concluded that rapid population growth and industrialization have brought about resource degradation and a decline in environmental quality.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4539	4548		10.1007/s13201-017-0607-4								WOS:000416833900029

A total of 24 water samples were collected and analyzed for physico-chemical parameters, and the abundance of cation and anion concentrations was in the following order: Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ = Cl- > HCO3 (-) > SO4 (2-). Correlation matrix shows that the basic ionic chemistry is influenced by Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl-, and also suggests that the samples contain Na+-Cl-, Ca2+-Cl- an,d mixed Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl- types of water. HCO3 (-), SO4 (2-), and F- association is less than that of other parameters due to poor or less available of bearing minerals. PCA extracted six components, which are accountable for the data composition explaining 81% of the total variance of the data set and allowed to set the selected parameters according to regular features as well as to evaluate the frequency of each group on the overall variation in water quality. Cluster analysis results show that groundwater quality does not vary extensively as a function of seasons, but shows two main clusters.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4633	4649		10.1007/s13201-017-0627-0								WOS:000416833900036

Assessment of hydro-geochemistry and groundwater quality of Rajshahi City in Bangladesh	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The study was carried out to understand the hydro-geochemistry and ground water quality in the Rajshahi City of Bangladesh. A total of 240 groundwater samples were collected in 2 years, i.e., 2009 and 2010 covering the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Aquifer soil samples were collected from 30 locations during the monsoon in 2000. All the samples were analyzed for various physicochemical parameters according to standard methods of analysis, these includes pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, and total alkalinity, major cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe2+, major anions such as HCO3 (-), NO3 (-), Cl-, and SO4 (2-) and heavy metals such as Mn, Zn, Cu, As, Cd and Pb. The results illustrated that the groundwater was slightly acidic to neutral in nature, total hardness observed in all samples fall under the hard to a very hard category. The bicarbonate and calcium concentration in the groundwater exceeded the permissible limits may be due to the dissolution of calcite. The concentration of calcium, iron, manganese, arsenic and lead were far above the permissible limit in most of the shallow tube well samples. The study found that the major hydrochemical facies was identified to be calcium-bicarbonate-type (CaHCO3). A higher concentration of metals including Fe, Mn, As and Pb was found indicating various health hazards. The rock-water interaction was the major geochemical process controlling the chemistry of groundwater in the study area.

Water with desirable quality is necessary for human life. Therefore, knowledge of water quality and its temporal changes is of particular importance in sustainable management of water resources. In this study, available data during 20 years from two hydrometry stations located in the way of Horroud River in Lorestan province were used and analyzed using Aq.QA software. Piper, Schoeller, Stiff, and Wilcox diagram were drawn and Mann-Kendal test was used for determining data trend. According to Wilcox diagram, water of this river in both stations is placed in c(2)s(1) class which is good for agricultural purposes, and according to Schoeller diagram, there is no restrict for drinking purposes. Results of Man-Kendal test show increasing trend for colorine, EC, TDS while decreasing trend for potassium in Kakareza station. On the other hand in Dehnu station, positive trend was seen in calcium and colorine while negative trend for sulfate and potassium. For other variables, no specific trend was found.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4725	4733		10.1007/s13201-017-0635-0								WOS:000416833900043

A total 57 representative groundwater samples from different bore wells and hand pumps were collected during pre-monsoon. Samples were analyzed for various physiochemical parameters including fluoride. GIS technique is adopted to prepare DEM and spatial distribution map of fluoride to represent fluoride concentration in the study area. Results obtained from analysis with GIS mapping reveal that fluoride in the study is mainly attributed to geogenic source.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4735	4742		10.1007/s13201-017-0636-z								WOS:000416833900044

A total of sixteen physico-chemical parameters including temperature, hardness, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, calcium, magnesium, chlorides, nitrates, sulphates and phosphates were recorded during 2014 and 2015 between June and August in ice-free period. The mean values of pH ranged from 6.85 to 7.10; water temperature fluctuated from 0.1 to 0.3 A degrees C; dissolved oxygen varied from 5.90 to 6.0 mg.L-1; free CO2 varied from 8.40 to 8.60 mg.L-1; total dissolved solids varied from 88.0 to 89.5 mg.L-1; calcium from 7.88 to 7.95 mg.L-1; magnesium from 0.53 to 0.66 mg.L-1. All the physico-chemical values were within the prescribed WHO/BIS limit for drinking water. Water Quality Index (WQI) calculated based on these parameters also revealed the excellent quality of lake water.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				DEC	2017	7	8					4757	4764		10.1007/s13201-017-0638-x								WOS:000416833900046

Despite human dependence on river systems, anthropogenic activities severely degrade water quality. The main aim of this study was to assess the river health of Ngamo River using diatom and macroinvertebrate community structure based on multivariate analyses and community metrics. Ammonia, pH, salinity, total phosphorus and temperature were found to be significantly different among the study seasons. The diatom and macroinvertebrate taxa richness increased downstream suggesting an improvement in water as we moved away from the pollution point sources. Canonical correspondence analyses identified nutrients (total nitrogen and reactive phosphorus) as important variables structuring diatom and macroinvertebrate community. The community metrics and diversity indices for both bioindicators highlighted that the water quality of the river system was very poor. These findings indicate that both methods can be used for water quality assessments, e.g. sewage and agricultural pollution, and they show high potential for use during water quality monitoring programmes in other regions.

High sedimentary oxygen consumption indicates that sewage input from small islands drives benthic community shifts on overfished reefs	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Small-island coral reef ecosystems are usually closely coupled to the activities of human inhabitants. Ahus Island (Papua New Guinea) is an isolated Pacific island with a rapidly growing population, heavy reliance on marine resources and limited infrastructure. We hypothesized that untreated sewage was driving distinct benthic assemblages around Ahus and neighbouring uninhabited Onetah. At sites with varying proximities to beach toilets, fore-reef herbivorous fish biomass and benthic composition were measured alongside reef-flat sedimentary oxygen consumption (SOC); a high SOC rate reflects high organic input into coastal waters, thus serving as a potential indicator of sewage input. Fish biomass was low (17.1-20.1 g m(-2)), but consistent between sites. However, cyanobacteria dominated the fore-reef closest to toilets (62 +/- 3%) with highest reef-flat SOC, whereas hard corals dominated furthest away (63 +/- 1%), where SOC was lowest. To our knowledge, this is the first study that used SOC to detect local differences in sewage pollution. The results indicate that whilst corals can maintain their dominance on overfished reefs, additional sewage stress may drive pronounced benthic shifts, highlighting the urgency to improve small-island waste management.

Flooding drives a macroinvertebrate biomass boom in ephemeral floodplain wetlands	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Despite broad recognition of the importance of the Flood Pulse Concept to large river ecology, few studies have provided empirical evidence to support a number of its arguments. We compared and contrasted the responses of water quality, nutrients, and the macroinvertebrates of ephemeral and permanent wetlands to a 22-wk managed inundation. We hypothesized that inundation of ephemeral wetlands would mobilize higher concentrations of nutrients from floodplain sediments and C from organic matter, which would, in turn, fuel greater abundance and biomass of aquatic macroinvertebrates than in permanent wetlands. The response of ephemeral wetlands to flooding contrasted very strongly with that of permanent wetlands. Freshly inundated ephemeral wetlands had significantly higher dissolved nutrient and organic C concentrations than permanent wetlands and supported different aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. Macroinvertebrate diversity was higher in permanent wetlands, but ephemeral wetlands supported much greater macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass. Differences between macroinvertebrate communities in ephemeral and reference wetlands were driven primarily by Chironomidae. Chironomus tepperi was the dominant taxon among ephemeral wetlands, both numerically and by biomass. Early-colonizing Coleoptera contributed strongly to taxonomic richness among ephemeral wetlands. Analysis of functional feeding groups (FFGs) indicated that ephemeral wetlands contained a higher proportion of detritus-feeding collector-gatherers compared to permanent wetlands, suggesting an increased reliance on heterotrophic energy pathways. We showed that a managed flood pulse can mobilize latent terrestrial energy sources within ephemeral floodplain wetlands and support a boom of aquatic invertebrate biomass, with important implications for both terrestrial and aquatic food webs.

The invertebrates that inhabit them, and zooplankton specifically, play important roles in these wetlands. We compared the ability of taxon- and size-based analyses of the zooplankton community to predict the influence of environmental variables. We sampled environmental variables and zooplankton at 7 Mediterranean wetlands in the Iberian Peninsula (southern Spain) monthly along 1 hydroperiod cycle (2009-2010). We used 3 arrays for classifying the zooplankton community: 1) species occurring in >5% of the samples, 2) coarse-level taxa easily identified by a nonexpert (large branchiopods, small branchiopods, calanoid copepods, cyclopoid copepods, and harpacticoid copepods), and 3) 4 body-size classes (<1, 1-2.5, 2.5-10, and >10 mm in length). We used permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to test our hypotheses. Communities differed significantly among wetlands, and body size (55.8% of explained variance) was more useful than taxonomic composition (common taxa: 24.4%, coarse-level taxa: 26.5% of explained variance) for rapid assessment of the influence of the environmental variables on zooplankton community in temporary wetlands.

J	Turner, RE				Turner, R. Eugene			The mineral sediment loading of the modern Mississippi River Delta: what is the restoration baseline?	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												A restoration baseline for river deltas establishes a framework for achieving goals that can be thwarted by choosing an improper historical background. The problem addressed here is identify the size of the modern Mississippi River delta that restoration should use as that baseline. The sediment loading to the Mississippi River main stem delta fluctuated over the last 160 years with a consequential dependent plasticity in delta size. A visual time series of the delta size is presented, and the area: sediment loading ratio is calculated. This ratio ranged from 1.8 to 3.9 km(2) per Mmt sediment y(-1) during the pre-European colonization of the watershed in the 1800s, a maximum size in the 1930s, and then lower after soil conservation and dam construction decades later. This land building rate is similar to the 1.3 to 3.7 km(2) per Mmt sediment y(-1) for the Wax Lake and Atchafalaya sub-deltas located to the west, which receives some of the Mississippi River sediment and water from the main channel below St. Francisville, LA. The significance to restoration of delta land lost since the 1930s is that the baseline for the 1930s was conditioned on previous sediment loading that has since declined. Most sediment is trapped in the delta, and so the existing situation is close to a zero-sum land balance. The restoration potential should be based on the delta land area that could be built from the current sediment loading, not from those of the era during peak agricultural expansion and soil erosion in the watershed. Sediment diversions upstream will, therefore, deplete sediment supply downstream where delta land will be lost. The choice of which baseline is used can be seen as a choice between unrealistic perceptions that leads to unachievable goals and agency failures, or, the realism of a delta size limited by current sediment loading.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					867	872		10.1007/s11852-017-0547-z								WOS:000416870600012

Estimation of potential zones for offshore mariculture in the Indian Sea using geographical information system as a management tool	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												Coastal mariculture is now facing tremendous pressures, especially from the anthropogenic activities, variable environment, and multi-user conflict. Hence, offshore mariculture is envisioned to enhance the production by promoting the commercial farming (floating cages) of cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and other fin fishes. Essential environmental parameters for mariculture have been selected and converted into thematic layers using Geographical Information System (GIS) tool. Weights of relative importance were assigned to each layer and integrated together through overlay analysis to provide a final model suggesting possible offshore floating marine fish cage deployment sites. In the present study, it is estimated that from 368,009 km(2) area within 100 m depth of Indian Exclusive Economic Zone available for mariculture activities, about 161,188 km(2) area is appropriate for deploying cages. There are 76,396 km(2) of highly suitable and approximately 84,792 km(2) of suitable areas available for mariculture in India including Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. Analysis of variance (ANOVA-one way) showed significant (p < 0.05) spatial variation for sea surface current, total suspended matter, and chlorophyll-a. This study is an attempt to integrate the weighing criteria and GIS to derive a suitable criterion for deployment of floating cages in the offshore environment, which could serve as a model for similar cases, particularly in the maritime nations for sustainable mariculture.

The in-situ data of water nutrient concentration was collected during the period 2002-2010 by COMAPS from the coastal waters of Gujarat and Maharashtra for the development of algorithms as a part of the application of remote sensing for biochemical cycling in the ocean. Multiple regression analysis was used to develop models for the nutrients and suspended sediments and the results showed the strong correlation between the water nutrients under study and suspended sediment variables with the remote sensing data, having the validated R-2 value of 0.7472 (Total Nitrogen),0.8744 (Total Phosphorus) and 0.971 (Suspended Sediment) respectively in marine waters. The models helped understand the seasonal variability and were also applied to one of the latest sensor VIIRS, which came up with the same results as those derived from MODIS. Thus the models can be used for the real time monitoring of water quality and for the development of an alert system using remote sensing data from both MODIS and VIIRS sensor systems.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					917	927		10.1007/s11852-017-0561-1								WOS:000416870600017

Evaluation of water quality is normally based on time consuming and expensive in situ measurements. Remotely sensed data is an efficient alternative for field monitoring because of its spatial and temporal coverage. In this study, remote sensing imagery combined with in situ measurements of water quality were used to estimate an empirical relationship between water surface reflectance and water quality parameters including water turbidity and Total Suspended Sediment (TSS). Surface reflectance values is obtained from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite. The empirical equations were derived from data over summers 2011-13 and show high correlation coefficients of equal to 0.83 and 0.87 for TSS and turbidity respectively. The validity of the proposed equations was tested for summer 2014 data. The NRMSE for prediction of measured data by the proposed equations are 0.36 and 0.3 for TSS and turbidity. Remotely sensed data was also used to produce water quality maps to improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of Fox River turbid plume. The proposed approach can be extended to other coastal regions of Great Lakes and provide a framework to study pollution transportation in coastal areas.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				DEC	2017	21	6					939	950		10.1007/s11852-017-0564-y								WOS:000416870600019

Although riverbeds are known to attenuate nitrate, it is not known if large woody debris (LWD) can increase this ecosystem service through enhanced hyporheic exchange and streambed residence time. Over a year, we monitored the surface water and pore water chemistry at 200 points along a similar to 50 m reach of a lowland sandy stream with three natural LWD structures. We directly injected N-15-nitrate at 108 locations within the top 1.5 m of the streambed to quantify in situ denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia, which, on average, contributed 85, 10 and 5% of total nitrate reduction, respectively. Total nitrate reducing activity ranged from 0 to 16 A mu M h(-1) and was highest in the top 30 cm of the stream bed. Depth, ambient nitrate and water residence time explained 44% of the observed variation in nitrate reduction; fastest rates were associated with slow flow and shallow depths. In autumn, when the river was in spate, nitrate reduction (in situ and laboratory measures) was enhanced around the LWD compared with non-woody areas, but this was not seen in the spring and summer. Overall, there was no significant effect of LWD on nitrate reduction rates in surrounding streambed sediments, but higher pore water nitrate concentrations and shorter residence times, close to LWD, indicated enhanced delivery of surface water into the streambed under high flow. When hyporheic exchange is too strong, overall nitrate reduction is inhibited due to short flow-paths and associated high oxygen concentrations.

Findings of this study would help in preventing wasteful use of water and would address the management and operational issues in coastal shrimp aquaculture.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				DEC	2017	25	6					2161	2176		10.1007/s10499-017-0181-7								WOS:000415623900015

This study, conducted from January to December 2014, in and around a cage fish farm located in Monastir Bay (eastern coast of Tunisia), investigated the hypothesis that cage fish farming would affect the water column quality and plankton communities. Phytoplankton diversity in addition to 13 physico-chemical parameters and chlorophyll-a were all investigated at 11 experimental stations located inside and around the farm. A total of 106 phytoplankton taxa were identified at genus and/or species level, and assigned to two major (dinoflagellates and diatoms) and four minor (cyanobacteria, euglenophyceae, coccolithophorides, and dictyophyceae) groups, with a remarkable predominance of heterotrophic and mixotrophic species, in particular among dinoflagellates taxa, highlighting a top-down model of phytoplankton regulation. Across seasons, a high Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') was recorded. Further, we have demonstrated that nutrients were the most important factors contributing to differences in species abundance, as revealed by N/P and Si/Pi ratios that were factors most affecting phytoplankton distribution. Our findings revealed that fish farming aquaculture became an additional source of nutrients in the bay. In some stations, nutrient loading has little or no trophic impact, while, at others, there is evidence that nutrients are assimilated by primary producers. Our study provides a rich information platform for conservation strategies of the bay of Monastir.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				DEC	2017	25	6					2275	2292		10.1007/s10499-017-0187-1								WOS:000415623900022

The results suggested that almost 60% of these water bodies were supersaturated with CO2 with respect to atmosphere, and the collected reservoirs samples exhibited higher mean pCO(2) than lakes. The mean pCO(2) in fresh water lakes was about 3.5 times of the value in saline lakes. The lakes and reservoirs were divided into five groups (Inner Mongolia -Xinjiang plateau region, Tibetan Plateau region, Northeastern plain and mountainous region, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau region, and Eastern plain region). The Yunnan- Guizhou Plateau region showed the highest pCO(2) compared with other regions, most likely due to the typical karst landforms, karst processes may promote aqueous CO2 concentration, and karstification has a significant effect on the capture of atmospheric CO2. Inner Mongolia -Xinjiang plateau and Tibetan Plateau region reserviors showed negative CO2 flux to atmosphere, other waters in this study all supersaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. A which We analyzed the relationship between pCO(2) and environmental variables, and results showed that some indicators had correlations with pCO(2) in individual region such as total phosphorus, dissolved organic matter, and total suspended solids, but the relationship could not be observed with all surveyed waters. This indicated that it might be much more effective in a smaller regional scale than the broadened scale when the environmental factors were used as the predictor of pCO(2) in lakes. Therefore, the common algorithm that extrapolates CO2 concentration or emission flux from the study region to a wider scale might not be accurate because of the changes in the environmental and water quality conditions.

A randomized complete block design was used to determine water quality changes resulting from converting plots previously cultivated in corn to SRWC willow (Salix. spp) adjacent to a stream in Storrs, CT. Both overland flow and ground water samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Additionally, overland flow was analyzed for suspended solids concentration (SSC) and ground water samples were analyzed for nitrate + nitrite (NO2+NO3-N). Lower (p = 0.05) concentrations of TN (41%) and TP (53%) were observed in overland flow from willow plots than from corn plots. Shallow ground water concentrations at the edge of willow plots were lower in TN (56%) and NO3+NO2-N (64%), but 35% higher in TP, than at the edge of corn plots. SSC was also lower (71%) in overland flow associated with willow compared to corn. The treatment had no effect on the depth or volume of overland flow or mass export. The changes in concentrations resulting from conversion of corn to SRWC in a riparian buffer are similar to those observed in restored and established buffers.																	0961-9534	1873-2909				DEC	2017	107						370	375		10.1016/j.biombioe.2017.10.020								WOS:000414963600042

WQI was calculated using 14 physico-chemical parameters while HPI determination used nine heavy metals like As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn. WQI revealed that Kanjli wetland contained medium quality water (irrigation and aquatic life). Cr, Cd and Co exceeded desirable limits of World Health Organization (WHO, Guidelines for drinking-water quality, World Health Organization, Geneva, 2011) and Indian drinking water standard (2012) during all the three seasons (monsoon, post monsoon and winter). HPI values from all sites exceeded critical pollution index value of 100 during monsoon season. Few sites were unsuitable for normal fish life as per ATI. The study recommends planned spatial, temporal and periodic monitoring of wetland using WQI and HPI to sustain good water quality (drinking, irrigation and aquatic life).																	0007-4861	1432-0800				DEC	2017	99	6					735	742		10.1007/s00128-017-2194-3								WOS:000416178800014	29038941

Their potential use as biomonitoring for water quality assessment is well-known. In this study, we present the mitogenome of M. daxingana, which is 15,524 bp in length and consists of 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs and a partial control region (719 bp). All genes have the similar locations and strands with that of other published stoneflies. The nucleotide composition is biased toward A and T, with 68.1% of A + T content. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that M. daxingana is closely related to Mesocapnia arizonensis and Apteroperla tikumana. Both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses showed strong support for a monophyletic Capniidae, and other five stonefly family formed a monophyletic group.																	1877-7252	1877-7260				DEC	2017	9	4					639	642		10.1007/s12686-017-0745-x								WOS:000415188400028

In search of an alternative organic fertilizer for fish culture, the nutrient potential of HU was evaluated. Fries of Indian carps and larvae of freshwater prawn were reared for 120 days under six conditions: (a) aerated and (b) non-aerated fresh HU (0.01%), (c) cattle manure (CM; 1.8 kg tank(-1)), mixed treatment with CM and HU under (d) iso-phosphorus and (e) iso-nitrogenous condition and (f) control. Monitoring of water quality and biological parameters revealed that total fish yield was the highest in CM (621.5 g tank(-1)) followed by mixed treatments under iso-nitrogenous (428 g tank(-1)) and iso-phosphorus (333 g tank(-1)) conditions, aerated HU (321 g tank(-1)) and HU (319 g tank(-1)). The gross primary productivity (GPP) in HU was satisfactory (601.8 mg C m(-2) h(-1)) and superior to all but CM treatment. The abundance of heterotrophic bacteria (HB) was highest in CM and lowest in HU. Both GPP and HB population were correlated positively with fish yield per tank. Although pH in all treatments remained high (pH 8.4-8.9), no ammonia toxicity was observed. No E. coli infestation in any fish muscle was encountered. The concentrations of cadmium and lead in fish muscle were within respective safe level. The study established that high fertilizer potential of HU could be exploited as an alternative organic fertilizer or as a candidate to be blended with cattle manure.

Evaluation of the water quality of the upper reaches of the main Southern Brazil river (Iguacu river) through in situ exposure of the native siluriform Rhamdia quelen in cages	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Increase in industrial growth, urban and agricultural pollution, with consequent impacts on aquatic ecosystems are a major focus of research worldwide. Still, not many studies assess the impacts of contamination through in situ studies, using native species, also considering the influence of seasonality on their responses. This study aimed to evaluate the water quality of the basin of the Upper Iguacu River, the main source of water supply to Curitiba, a major capital of Southern Brazil, and its Metropolitan area. Several biomarkers were evaluated after in situ exposure of the native catfish Rhamdia queien inside cages for 7 days. Ten study sites were chosen along the basin, based on a diffuse gradient of contamination, corresponding to regions upstream, downstream, and within "great Curitiba". In each site, fish were exposed in Summer and Winter. The complex mixture of contaminants of this hydrographic basin generated mortality, and ion-, osmoregulatory and respiratory disturbances in the catfish as, for example, reduction of plasma osmolality and ionic concentrations, increased hematocrit levels and gill water content, altered branchial and renal activities of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, as well as raised levels of plasma cortisol and glucose. Biomarkers were mostly altered in fish exposed in Great Curitiba and immediately downstream. There was a notable influence of season on the responses of the jundia. A multivariate redundancy analysis revealed that the best environmental variables explained 30% of the variation in biomarkers after controlling for spatial autocorrelation. Thus, this approach and the chosen parameters can be satisfactorily used to evaluate contamination environments with complex mixtures of contaminants, in other urban basins as well.

J	Chen, LB; Yang, ZF; Liu, HF				Chen, Libin; Yang, Zhifeng; Liu, Haifei			Sensitivity analysis for the total nitrogen pollution of the Danjiangkou Reservoir based on a 3-D water quality model	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE												Inter-basin water transfers containing a great deal of nitrogen are great threats to human health, biodiversity, and air and water quality in the recipient area. Danjiangkou Reservoir, the source reservoir for China's South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project, suffers from total nitrogen pollution and threatens the water transfer to a number of metropolises including the capital, Beijing. To locate the main source of nitrogen pollution into the reservoir, especially near the Taocha canal head, where the intake of water transfer begins, we constructed a 3-D water quality model. We then used an inflow sensitivity analysis method to analyze the significance of inflows from each tributary that may contribute to the total nitrogen pollution and affect water quality. The results indicated that the Han River was the most significant river with a sensitivity index of 0.340, followed by the Dan River with a sensitivity index of 0.089, while the Guanshan River and the Lang River were not significant, with the sensitivity indices of 0.002 and 0.001, respectively. This result implies that the concentration and amount of nitrogen inflow outweighs the geographical position of the tributary for sources of total nitrogen pollution to the Taocha canal head of the Danjiangkou Reservoir.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				DEC	2017	11	4					609	619		10.1007/s11707-017-0650-3								WOS:000416164400002

This comprises a significant threat to potable water supplies and overall estuary ecosystem health. In this study, the environmental flows of the Modaomen Estuary, one of the estuaries of the Pearl River Delta in China, were determined based on the salinity demand of keystone species and the linear relationship between river discharge and estuarine salinity. The estimated minimum and optimal annual environmental flows in the Modaomen Estuary were 116.8 x 10(9) m(3) and 273.8 x 10(9) m(3), respectively, representing 59.3% and 139.0% of the natural runoff. Water quality assessments in recent years indicate that the environmental flows have not been satisfied most of the time, particularly the optimal environmental flow, despite implementation of various water regulations since 2005. Therefore, water regulations and wetland network recoveries based on rational environmental flows should be implemented to alleviate saltwater intrusion and for the creation of an ideal estuarine habitat.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				DEC	2017	11	4					670	681		10.1007/s11707-016-0609-9								WOS:000416164400007

A Keyword Approach to Finding Common Ground in Community-Based Definitions of Human Well-Being	HUMAN ECOLOGY												Ecosystem-based management involves the integration of ecosystem services and their human beneficiaries into decision making. This can occur at multiple scales; addressing global issues such as climate change down to local problems such as flood protection and maintaining water quality. At the local scale it can be challenging to achieve a consistent and sustainable outcome across multiple communities, particularly when they differ in resource availability and management priorities. A key requirement for consistent decision support at the community level is to identify common community objectives, as these can form the basis for readily transferable indices of ecosystem benefit and human well-being. We used a keyword-based approach to look for common terminology in community fundamental objectives as a basis for transferable indices of human well-being and then compared those commonalities to community demographics, location, and type. Analysis centered on strategic planning documents readily available from coastal communities in the conterminous United States. We examined strategic planning documents based on eight domains of human well-being, and found that Living Standards and Safety and Security were the most commonly addressed domains, and Health and Cultural Fulfillment were the least. In comparing communities, regional differences were observed in only one well-being domain, Safety and Security, while community type yielded significant differences in five of the eight domains examined. Community type differences followed an urban to rural trend with urban communities focusing on Education and Living Standards, and more rural communities focused on Social Cohesion and Leisure Time. Across all eight domains multivariate analysis suggested communities were distributed along two largely orthogonal gradients; one between Living Standards and Leisure Time and or Connection to Nature, and a second between Safety and Security and Social Priorities (Education/Health/Culture/Social Cohesion). Overall these findings demonstrate the use of automated keyword analysis for obtaining information from community strategic planning documents. Moreover, the results indicate measures and perceptions of well-being at the local scale differ by community type. This information could be used in management of ecosystem services and development of indices of community sustainability that are applicable to multiple communities with similar demographics, regional location, and type.																	0300-7839	1572-9915				DEC	2017	45	6					809	821		10.1007/s10745-017-9940-3								WOS:000416149300009						
J	Valkama, P; Ruth, O				Valkama, Pasi; Ruth, Olli			Impact of calculation method, sampling frequency and hysteresis on suspended solids and total phosphorus load estimations in cold climate	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Load calculations of nutrients and suspended solids (SS) transported by rivers are usually based on discrete water samples. Water quality changes in cold climate regions often occur very rapidly and therefore discrete samples are unrepresentative of the range of water quality occurring. This leads to errors of varying magnitude in load calculation. High-resolution turbidity data were used to determine the SS and total phosphorus (TP), and paired with discharge to determine loads from two small catchments in southern Finland. The effect of sampling frequency was investigated by artificially sub-sampling the high frequency concentrations. Regardless of the sampling frequency, the TP load was more likely underestimated while using discrete samples. To achieve +/- 20% accuracy compared with the reference load, daily sampling should be performed. Hysteresis was detected to have an impact on TP load. Hysteresis analysis also revealed the main source of the TP to be in the fields of the catchment. Continuous measuring proved to be a valuable method for defining loads and short-term fluctuations in water quality in small clayey watercourses in a boreal cold climate, where the climate change will increase the frequency of winter floods.																	1998-9563	2224-7955				DEC	2017	48	6					1594	1610		10.2166/nh.2017.199								WOS:000416144600010

Application of neuro-fuzzy based expert system in water quality assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEM ASSURANCE ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT												In this research a framework is developed to predict the drinking water quality through the neural network models. A fuzzy rule-based system and similarity measure algorithm yield a water quality index for different sampling locations in a water distribution network (WDN), and a neural network is trained using the quality indices. Different sources of uncertainty exist in this model, including deficient, missing, and noisy data, conflicting water quality parameters and subjective information. Hourly and monthly data from Quebec City WDN are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed neuro-fuzzy model. Also, historical data from 52 sampling locations of Quebec City network is utilized to develop the rule-based model in order to train the neural network. Water quality is evaluated by categorizing quality parameters in two groups including microbial and physicochemical. Two sets of rules are defined using expert knowledge to assign water quality grades to each sampling location in the WDN. The fuzzy inference system outputs are deffuzzified using a similarity measure algorithm in this approach. The fuzzy inference system acts as a decision making agent. A utility function provides microbial and physicochemical water quality indices. Final results are used to train the neural network. In the proposed framework, microbial and physicochemical quality of water are predicted individually.																	0975-6809	0976-4348				DEC	2017	8	4		4	SI		2137	2145		10.1007/s13198-014-0315-5								WOS:000416152000011

Aquatic eutrophication indicators in LCA: Methodological challenges illustrated using a case study in New Zealand	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Objective: The objective of this work was to determine the effects and implications of generic and site-specific aquatic eutrophication potential indicators in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of livestock farm systems using a New Zealand (NZ) lake catchment case study.& para;& para;Method: Average dairy and sheep & beef farm systems in the Lake Taupo catchment were studied. Emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to waterways, and ammonia and nitrogen oxides to air from these farms were calculated using the site-specific OVERSEER (R) nutrient budget model. These emissions data were then used to calculate the increase in nutrients in water bodies and aquatic Eutrophication indicators with a range of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods.& para;& para;Results: Eutrophication indicator results varied considerably depending on the environmental mechanisms modelled by the LCIA method for the fate of N and P, accentuated by different choices for the inventory modelling. Using default emission factors instead of site-specific ones overestimated eutrophication impact results. The most recent methods are not only spatially-explicit and applicable beyond Europe, but they also account for more environmental mechanisms for the fate of the nutrients, giving relatively lower calculated impact results. However, the appropriate scale and spatial resolution is still a crucial question to address for these methods since they greatly affect results. Regarding eutrophication damage assessment, when the actual background nutrient concentration is very low, the end-point assessment method for freshwater eutrophication is not applicable. In this case, LCA fails to account for a high standard of water quality that is in a near-pristine state, but deteriorating.& para;& para;Conclusions: The inventory of nutrient flows at a farm scale and fate factors modelled at a catchment scale should be site-specific. Freshwater eutrophication indicators should be based on a site-specific (and globally-valid) LCIA model rather than a generic one. Currently-accepted freshwater eutrophication indicators focus only on P, thus capturing only part of the problem for freshwater bodies that are co-limited by N and P (in terms of algal growth) such as Lake Taupo in NZ. Lake Taupo water quality concerns and regulations are not focused on P, but solely on N due to increasing N levels over time. Conclusions from this study are valid beyond NZ and beyond agricultural systems. Future work needs to investigate coupling N and P fate modelling based on the most recent globally-valid and spatially-explicit LCIA methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The quality of dialysis-water is a factor responsible for inflammation in dialysis patients. Inflammation is a potent trigger of atherosclerosis and a pathogenetic factor in anemia, increasing mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients. Current systems for water treatment do not completely eliminate bacteria and endotoxins. This prospective study tested whether improved dialysis-water purity by an additional ultrafilter can reduce inflammation and ameliorate hemoglobin levels, with a consequent reduction in erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESA). Methods An ultrafilter, composed of two serially positioned devices with polysulfone membranes of 2.0 and 1.0 m(2), respectively, was positioned within the fluid pathway before the dialysis machine. Prevalent dialysis patients were assigned either to continue dialysis with conventional dialysis-water (control phase) or to initiate dialysis sessions with improved dialysis-water purity (study phase). After 6 months, patients were crossed over. Total study duration was 1 year. Routine chemistry, bacterial count, endotoxin levels in dialysis-water as well as blood levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, human serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and fraction 5 of complement were measured. Results Thirty-two patients completed the study. Mean bacterial count was lower and endotoxin levels were absent in dialysis-water obtained with the ultrafilter. At the end of the study-phase, C-reactive protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased while anti-inflammatory ones increased. Hemoglobin levels were improved with lower ESA doses. Conclusions An additional ultrafilter improved dialysis-water purity, reduced levels of inflammation markers, ameliorated hemoglobin concentration with reduced ESA doses. These results remain speculative but they may generate studies to assess whether improved dialysis-water quality with an ultrafilter can reduce inflammation and improve survival of dialysis patients.

The Fe3O4@C core-shell nanostructures can self-assemble into a thin film at the air-water interface, which benefits their full utilization for light absorption and heat transfer. When needed, the Fe3O4@C thin film can be separated from water within 20 seconds by applying an external magnetic field. Removing the external magnetic field allows rapid reassembly of the nanostructures within a second. Such efficient separation of the light absorbers and their reformation as a thin film is beneficial to practical applications where recycling and reuse of the light absorbers are critically important. In order to evaluate their practicability for interfacial solar heating, we systematically study the water evaporation efficiency, water quality of the condensed vapor, and chemical durability of this new Fe3O4@C nanostructures. It is found that the water evaporation efficiency of the floating Fe3O4@C film can reach 1.07 kg m(-2) h(-1) under a solar intensity of 1 kW m(-2), which is significantly higher than the case of uniform dispersion of Fe3O4@C nanostructures in water.

J	Metz, F; Ingold, K				Metz, Florence; Ingold, Karin			Politics of the precautionary principle: assessing actors' preferences in water protection policy	POLICY SCIENCES												This paper analyzes the prospects for introducing the precautionary principle in water protection policy. In situations where a problem enters the political agenda and scientific uncertainties remain about causes or effects, political actors can justify state intervention based on the precautionary principle. It allows for public action even if risks related to the problem remain unclear. While the precautionary principle is widely applied in health and environmental policy fields all over the world, the mechanisms leading to its adoption are not fully understood. To close this gap, the paper investigates decision-makers preferences for the precautionary principle and further asks: Which factors promote political actors' preferences for precautionary policy measures? In order to answer this question we study the case of emerging micropollutants-a water quality issue that recently entered political agendas, where many uncertainties remain about sources and effects. We rely on data gathered through a standardized survey among the political elite in Switzerland, which represents one of the first countries that adopted policy measures to reduce micropollutants in water bodies, despite the uncertainties that remain. Results analyzed through a temporal network autocorrelation model reveal that actors embedded in collaborative governance arrangements have the tendency to prefer precautionary action. Certain aspects of policy design, such as problem prioritization and target group membership, also impact the prospects for introducing the precautionary principle.																	0032-2687	1573-0891				DEC	2017	50	4					721	743		10.1007/s11077-017-9295-z								WOS:000415953600014

Tolerance of melon cultivars to irrigation water salinity	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL												The use of saline water for irrigation causes severe restriction to nutritional balance, growth and production in many crops due to the effect of salts on plant and soil. The objective of this study was to investigate the response of melon (Cucumis melo L.) cultivars to various levels of irrigation water salinity on yield and fruit quality. A field experiment was conducted in a split-plot randomized block design with four replicates. The factors were five levels of irrigation water salinity (0.54, 1.48, 2.02, 3.03 and 3.90 dS m(-1)) in the plots and five melon cultivars (C-1 - Sancho - Pele de sapo; C-2 - Medellin - Pele de sapo; C-3 - Mandacaru - Canary; C-4 - Nectar - Galia; C-5 - Sedna - Cantaloupe) in the sub-plots. According to the results, among the five genotypes studied, Sancho was the most salt-tolerant genotype, followed by Mandacaru, Medellin, Sedna and Nectar. Since irrigation water salinity did not influence the mean fruit weight, the reduction in the number of fruits was the main cause of yield reduction of the melon crop under high salinity water. The contents of total soluble solids increased under high salinity level.																	1807-1929					DEC	2017	21	12					846	851		10.1590/1807-1929/agriambi.v21n12p846-851								WOS:000416041100006

Environmental Survey of Drinking Water Sources in Kampala, Uganda, during a Typhoid Fever Outbreak	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												In 2015, a typhoid fever outbreak began in downtown Kampala, Uganda, and spread into adjacent districts. In response, an environmental survey of drinking water source types was conducted in areas of the city with high case numbers. A total of 122 samples was collected from 12 source types and tested for Escherichia coli, free chlorine, and conductivity. An additional 37 grab samples from seven source types and 16 paired large volume (20 liter) samples from wells and springs were also collected and tested for the presence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Escherichia coli was detected in 60% of kaveras (drinking water sold in plastic bags) and 80% of refilled water bottles; free chlorine was not detected in either source type. Most jerry cans (68%) contained E. coli and had free chlorine residuals below the WHO-recommended level of 0.5 mg/liter during outbreaks. Elevated conductivity readings for kaveras, refilled water bottles, and jerry cans (compared to treated surface water supplied by the water utility) suggested that they likely contained untreated groundwater. All unprotected springs and wells and more than 60% of protected springs contained E. coli. Water samples collected from the water utility were found to have acceptable free chlorine levels and no detectable E. coli. While S. Typhi was not detected in water samples, Salmonella spp. were detected in samples from two unprotected springs, one protected spring, and one refilled water bottle. These data provided clear evidence that unregulated vended water and groundwater represented a risk for typhoid transmission. IMPORTANCE Despite the high incidence of typhoid fever globally, relatively few outbreak investigations incorporate drinking water testing. During waterborne disease outbreaks, measurement of physical-chemical parameters, such as free chlorine residual and electrical conductivity, and of microbiological parameters, such as the presence of E. coli or the implicated etiologic agent, in drinking water samples can identify contaminated sources. This investigation indicated that unregulated vended water and groundwater sources were contaminated and were therefore a risk to consumers during the 2015 typhoid fever outbreak in Kampala. Identification of contaminated drinking water sources and sources that do not contain adequate disinfectant levels can lead to rapid targeted interventions.																	0099-2240	1098-5336				DEC	2017	83	23							UNSP e01706-17	10.1128/AEM.01706-17								WOS:000415617800020	28970225

The evaluation was determined using chemical parameters representing typical contaminants of sugar industry wastewater (SIWW) and yeast industry wastewater (YIWW), and characterising the content of organic matter (BOD5), nutrients (NH4-N, NO3-N, TN and TP) and salts (Cl, SO4, Na and K). The studies reveal that food industry wastewater constitutes a valuable water-nutrient-rich medium that can be reused in agricultural applications as an alternative water resource for irrigation and nutrients for fertilisation. Furthermore, the reuse facilitates the sustainable discharge of wastewater through a soil-aquifer zone to the natural environment. This does not affect chemical quality of groundwater, which was comparable in areas irrigated and non-irrigated with SIWW and YIWW. Although some parameters (NO3-N, NH4-N, SO4, Cl and Na) displayed higher concentrations in groundwater from the fields irrigated with wastewater, these contents were within recommended health-based guideline limits defined in either the groundwater quality standards or the drinking water quality norms. Only the contents of K revealed an exclusive groundwater impact from wastewater irrigation. This was confirmed in statistical tests employing the Ward's hierarchical clustering method, which exposed excessive amounts of K introduced into groundwater through irrigation with both SIWW and YIWW. However, this parameter is not considered to pose any health risk to humans or the environment, and its content is not restricted by quality guideline values for either groundwater or drinking water.

The objective of this research is to discover useful knowledge amidst water monitoring data collected between 2005 and 2011, in a specific region of the state of So Paulo in Brazil. The research was performed in three steps: discovery of classification rules of ecotoxicity in water samples using predictive modelling; investigation of the presence of strong relationships between water quality parameters by associative analysis; and discovery of sampling sites, which are similar with respect to their quality parameters, by applying a clustering method. The knowledge discovery process employed in this work was divided into four phases: selection of study area and data, pre-processing of the selected data, mining of the pre-processed data, and interpretation and evaluation of the results. The data mining step was supported by different algorithms, each one focused on a particular issue of the research: sequential coverage algorithm for classification of ecotoxicity; Apriori algorithm for identifying associations between quality parameters, and Prim's algorithm and pruning algorithm for clustering of water sampling sites. We observed the association of certain quality parameters to water ecotoxicity, the existence of correlations between some of the quality parameters, and the presence of homogeneous groups amidst the sampling sites. These results may provide valuable input to the field of water quality monitoring, from the technical activities, such as the laboratorial analysis of water samples, to the decision makers responsible for defining the future public policies for water resources management.

Fuzzy Inference Systems: Selection of the most Appropriate Fuzzy Implication from Available Lake Water Quality Statistical Data	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												To this day, models such as empirical and dynamic, along with the multi-criteria analysis methods, have helped us towards the very understanding and estimation of all the functions (physical, chemical, biological) existing in freshwater ecosystems. The rich and variable system of the Greek lake Karla is a perfect candidate for our study and its purpose, which is to investigate the factors responsible for eutrophication (water temperature, nitrates, total phosphorus, secchi depth, chlorophyll-a) using fuzzy logic. In fuzzy logic, where the proposition can take any value in the close interval [0,1], there are infinite numbers of fuzzy implications which can be used; hence, a method of selecting the most appropriate implication is required. In this paper, we propose a method of evaluating fuzzy implications using available statistical data. The choice of the appropriate implication is based on the deviation of the true value of the fuzzy implication from the real values, as described by the statistical data.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				DEC	2017	4	4					923	935		10.1007/s40710-017-0266-3								WOS:000415318100009

Shahriyar reservoir is a dam with a total capacity of 700 million cubic meters (MCM) and a dead volume of 360 MCM. In case of with sedimentation compared with without sedimentation, results showed an annual average increase of 4, 4.3, and 8.7% in TDS of outflow for normal, wet, and dry periods, respectively. There is no significant change in TDS profile of the reservoir in both conditions. According to the average outflow TDS of 1448, 1301, and 1555 mg/L compared with the average inflow TDS of 1714, 1520, and 1835 in normal, wet, and dry conditions, respectively, the effect of dam on inflow TDS adjustment can be also observed. With the mentioned outflow TDS, there is no limitation to use of reservoir water for agricultural purposes based on FAO irrigation guidelines for both scenarios.																	1735-1472	1735-2630				DEC	2017	14	12					2623	2636		10.1007/s13762-017-1317-z								WOS:000415229400008

However, their provisioning has been under the increasing pressure from both natural and socio-economic changes. This paper aims to assess the most significant hazards, such as water quality, nitrogen deposition, erosion, floods, invasive species, urbanisation and contaminated sites affecting delivery of ecosystem services in the Czech Republic. Using the multi-hazard assessment, the integrated risk index for ecosystem service provisioning was proposed. The spatial analysis based on this approach was then applied to the Czech Republic as a case study. The results showed that about 48% of the area falls into the very low risk category followed by 30%, 21%, and 1% for low, medium and high categories, respectively. Forest and wetland ecosystems were estimated to have the highest proportion of their total area among the highest risk values. Moreover, we found that the national parks appeared to have the highest proportion of medium- and high-risk classes among the natural areas. The approach presented in this study should aggregate the existing knowledge on ecosystem services and hazards and thus monitor the integrated risk. The results are intended to help with various planning and management decisions at both the national and regional levels and to bring more attention on the most problematic hot-spots.

J	Demissie, Y; Yan, EG; Wu, M				Demissie, Yonas; Yan, Eugene; Wu, May			Hydrologic and water quality impacts of biofuel feedstock production in the Ohio River Basin	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY												This study addresses the uncertainties related to potential changes in land use and management and associated impacts on hydrology and water quality resulting from increased production of biofuel from the conventional and cellulosic feedstock. The Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to assess the impacts on regional and field scale evapotranspiration, soil moisture content, stream flow, sediment, and nutrient loadings in the Ohio River Basin. The model incorporates spatially and temporally detailed hydrologic, climate and agricultural practice data that are pertinent to simulate biofuel feedstock production, watershed hydrology and water quality. Three future biofuel production scenarios in the region were considered, including a feedstock projection from the DOE Billion-Ton (BT2) Study, a change in corn rotations to continuous corn, and harvest of 50% corn stover. The impacts were evaluated on the basis of relative changes in hydrology and water quality from historical baseline and future business-as-usual conditions of the basin. The overall impact on water quality is an order of magnitude higher than the impact on hydrology. For all the three future scenarios, the sub-basin results indicated an overall increase in annual evapotranspiration of up to 6%, a decrease in runoff up to 10% and minimal change in soil moisture. The sediment and phosphorous loading at both regional and field levels increased considerably (up to 40-90%) for all the biofuel feedstock scenario considered, while the nitrogen loading increased up to 45% in some regions under the BT2 Study scenario, decreased up to 10% when corn are grown continuously instead of in rotations, and changed minimally when 50% of the stover are harvested. Field level analyses revealed significant variability in hydrology and water quality impacts that can further be used to identify suitable locations for the feedstock productions without causing major impacts on water quantity and quality.					, yonas/0000-0002-2600-5809												1757-1693	1757-1707				DEC	2017	9	12					1736	1750		10.1111/gcbb.12466								WOS:000415052100004

On Tutuila, the main island of American Samoa, production wells in the most populated region (the Tafuna-Leone Plain) produce most of the island's drinking water. However, much of this water has been deemed unsafe to drink since 2009. Tutuila has three predominant anthropogenic non-point-groundwater-pollution sources of concern: on-site disposal systems (OSDS), agricultural chemicals, and pig manure. These sources are broadly distributed throughout the landscape and are located near many drinking-water wells. Water quality analyses show a link between elevated levels of total dissolved groundwater nitrogen (TN) and areas with high non-point-source pollution density, suggesting that TN can be used as a tracer of groundwater contamination from these sources. The modeling framework used in this study integrates land-use information, hydrological data, and water quality analyses with nitrogen loading and transport models. The approach utilizes a numerical groundwater flow model, a nitrogen-loading model, and a multi-species contaminant transport model. Nitrogen from each source is modeled as an independent component in order to trace the impact from individual land-use activities. Model results are calibrated and validated with dissolved groundwater TN concentrations and inorganic delta N-15 values, respectively. Results indicate that OSDS contribute significantly more TN to Tutuila's aquifers than other sources, and thus should be prioritized in future water-quality management efforts.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				DEC	2017	25	8					2419	2434		10.1007/s10040-017-1617-x								WOS:000415195900015

Differences in staining intensities affect reported occurrences and concentrations of Giardia spp. in surface drinking water sources	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aim: USEPA Method 1623, or its equivalent, is currently used to monitor for protozoan contamination of surface drinking water sources worldwide. At least three approved staining kits used for detecting Cryptosporidium and Giardia are commercially available. This study focuses on understanding the differences among staining kits used for Method 1623. Methods and Results: Merifluor and EasyStain labelling kits were used to monitor Cryptosporidium oocyst and Giardia cyst densities in New York City's raw surface water sources. In the year following a change to the approved staining kits for use with Method 1623, an anomaly was noted in the occurrence of Giardia cysts in New York City's raw surface water. Specifically, Merifluor-stained samples had higher Giardia cyst densities as compared with those stained with EasyStain. Side by side comparison revealed significantly lower fluorescence intensities of Giardia muris as compared with Giardia duodenalis cysts when labelled with EasyStain. Conclusions: This study showed very poor fluorescence intensity signals by EasyStain on G. muris cysts resulting in lower cyst counts, while Merifluor, with its broader Giardia cyst staining specificity, resulted in higher cyst counts, when using Methods 1623. Significance and Impact of the Study: These results suggest that detected Giardia cyst concentrations are dependent on the staining kits used, which can result in a more or less conservative estimation of occurrences and densities of zoonotic Giardia cysts by detecting a broader range of Giardia species/Assemblages.

In order to quantify the effect of water quality on the inception of tip vortex cavitation, we develop a motion model to describe the migration and growth of nuclei in water. An analytical solution of migration of nuclei in a vortex flow is obtained so that the capture times of various nuclei can be given out directly. A criterion is built to determine the critical nucleus in a certain nuclei spectra distribution. Tensile strength of the critical nucleus is used to quantify the effect of water quality and correct the tip vortex cavitation inception number. Finally this change of cavitation inception number is compared with experimental results to validate our model.																	1001-6058	1878-0342				DEC	2017	29	6					954	961		10.1016/S1001-6058(16)60809-0								WOS:000415278700005

We focus on total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved silica (DSi) inputs to the Bay of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem (BOB LME) in the years 2000, 2030, and 2050. In 2000, rivers exported 7.1 Tg N and 1.5 Tg P to the BOB LME. Three rivers (Ganges, Godavari, Irrawaddy) account for 75-80% of the total river export of N and P. For 2050, we calculate an increase in river export of N to 8.6 Tg, while P export stabilizes at the 2000 level. Future trends are the net effect of increasing river export of dissolved N (by 40%) and P (by 80%), and decreasing river export of particulate N and P. The increases in dissolved N and P loads are associated primarily with increased N and P losses from agriculture and sewage systems. The decreasing export of particulate N and P is associated with damming of rivers and increased human water consumption. There are large differences in nutrient export among rivers. Rivers draining into the western BOB LME generally export more N and P than eastern BOB LME rivers. Most N and P in western BOB LME rivers are from anthropogenic sources. Future increases in dissolved inorganic N and P (DIN and DIP) export can be large for individual rivers: up to more than a factor of five for DIP and more than a doubling for DIN. The calculated nutrient export ratios (N and P relative to DSi) indicate an increasing risk for blooms of non-siliceous algal species, which can potentially produce toxins and otherwise disrupt coastal ecosystems. Our results indicate that basin-specific management may be the most effective approach towards reducing the risk of coastal eutrophication in the BOB LME.

Widespread legacy brine contamination from oil production reduces survival of chorus frog larvae	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Advances in drilling techniques have facilitated a rapid increase in hydrocarbon extraction from energy shales, including the Williston Basin in central North America. This area overlaps with the Prairie Pothole Region, a region densely populated with wetlands that provide numerous ecosystem services. Historical (legacy) disposal practices often released saline co-produced waters (brines) with high chloride concentrations, affecting wetland water quality directly or persisting in sediments. Despite the potential threat of brine contamination to aquatic habitats, there has been little research into its ecological effects. We capitalized on a gradient of legacy brine-contaminated wetlands in northeast Montana to conduct laboratory experiments to assess variation in survival of larval Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata) reared on sediments from 3 local wetlands and a control source. To help provide environmental context for the experiment, we also measured chloride concentrations in 6 brine-contaminated wetlands in our study area, including the 2 contaminated sites used for sediment exposures. Survival of frog larvae during 46- and 55-day experiments differed by up to 88% among sediment sources (Site Model) and was negatively correlated with potential chloride exposure (Chloride Model). Five of the 6 contaminated wetlands exceeded the U.S. EPA acute benchmark for chloride in freshwater (860 mg/L) and all exceeded the chronic benchmark (230 mg/L). However, the Wetland Site model explained more variation in survival than the Chloride Model, suggesting that chloride concentration alone does not fully reflect the threat of contamination to aquatic species. Because the profiles of brine-contaminated sediments are complex, further surveys and experiments are needed across a broad range of conditions, especially where restoration or remediation actions have reduced brine-contamination. Information provided by this study can help quantify potential ecological threats and help land managers prioritize conservation strategies as part of responsible and sustainable energy development.

We assessed catchments surrounding the Gold Ridge gold mine (Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands) and found that extensive changes in river course, and water and sediment quality have occurred downstream of the gold mine since its development. Sediment run-off from exposed areas associated with the mine pit has increased, elevating turbidity (up to 2450 NTU) and metal and arsenic levels, with levels of the latter being up to 0.141 mg/L in surface waters and 265 mg/kg in sediments. An overfull, inoperative tailings storage facility associated with the currently inactive gold mine with fluctuating arsenic levels (up to 0.087 mg/L in the water; 377 mg/kg in the sediment) presents an ongoing threat to the environment. Arsenic, due to its toxicity, appears to be the greatest threat, with sediment and water guideline levels in rivers exceeded 10-fold and exceeded nearly 20-fold in the tailings dam sediments. Despite elevated metal and arsenic content in the area, no toxic inorganic arsenic was found to have bioaccumulated in locally harvested food. In summary, the natural environment surrounding the Gold Ridge mine has been modified substantially and requires an ongoing monitoring program to ensure the ecosystem services of food and water for the local communities continue to be safe. This study informs not only the local area but also provides a microcosm of the broader global challenges facing the regulation of extractive industries in proximity to subsistence communities.

This study verified that the decomposition processes of three different kinds of aquatic macrophytes (water hyacinth, hydrilla and cattail) could exert significant influences on water quality of the receiving water, including the change extent of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), the contents of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, etc. The influence of decomposition on water quality and the concentrations of the released chemical materials both followed the order of water hyacinth > hydrilla > cattail. Greater influence was obtained with higher dosage of plant litter addition. The influence also varied with sediment addition. Moreover, nitrogen released from the decomposition of water hyacinth and hydrilla were mainly NH3-N and organic nitrogen while those from cattail litter included organic nitrogen and NO3--N. After the decomposition, the average carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) in the receiving water was about 2.6 (water hyacinth), 5.3 (hydrilla) and 20.3 (cattail). Therefore, cattail litter might be a potential plant carbon source for denitrification in ecological system of a constructed wetland. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The main goals accomplished in this work address the specific required characteristics for a miniaturized on-line monitoring system to control water quality in such missions. To begin with, the integration of three ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) and a reference electrode in a compact microfluidic platform that incorporates a simple automatic autocalibration process allows obtaining information about the concentration of the three ions with optimal analytical response characteristics, but moreover with low reagents consumption and therefore with few waste generation, which is critical for this specific application. By a simple signal processing (signal removal) the chloride ion interference on the nitrate electrode response can be eliminated. Furthermore, all fluidics management is performed by computer-controlled microvalves and micropumps, so no manual intervention of the crew is necessary. The analytical features provided by the microsystem after the optimization process were a linear range from 6.3 to 630 mg L-1 and a detection limit of 0.51 mg L-1 for the potassium electrode, a linear range from 10 to 1000 mg L-1 and a detection limit of 1.58 mg L-1 for the chloride electrode and a linear range from 10 to 1000 mg L-1 and a detection limit of 3.37 mg L-1 for the nitrate electrode with a reproducibility (RSD) of 4%, 2% and 3% respectively. Sample throughput was 12 h(-1) with a reagent consumptions lower than 2 mL per analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The fish were transported at a loading density of similar to 103g/L for 3hr in 12 plastic bags (3L water and 6L pure oxygen) divided into four triplicated treatments: control (without linalool), L50 (50mg linalool/L), L100 (100mg linalool/L) and L200 (200mg linalool/L). After 3-hr transportation, serum physiological responses and water physico-chemical parameters were compared among the treatments. Results showed that water total and un-ionized ammonia increased and dissolved oxygen decreased in all treatments after transportation. Water total ammonia and dissolved oxygen levels in the linalool-treated bags were significantly lower than the control. After transportation, the control fish showed significant elevation in serum cortisol and glucose levels; however, the levels were significantly lower than the linalool-treated fish. All fish showed similar serum lactate levels, significantly lower than the value obtained before transportation. The control fish showed serum urea levels similar to the level obtained before transportation; however, the linalool-treated fish had significantly higher serum urea levels compared to the control and before transportation levels. After transportation, all fish had decreased serum chloride and sodium levels compared to the before transport level. Overall, the present results showed that linalool is not beneficial for carp transportation in plastic bags, because it reacts with water oxygen, increases stress in fish, interferes with ammonia excretion and has no benefits in preventing ion loss.

Results showed survival rates of 87.7 and 11.9% in M1 and M2, respectively. Water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity and chlorophyll a were not significantly (p>.05) different between modules. In contrast, the concentrations of nitrogen compounds were significantly (p<.05) different between modules, except nitrite-N (M2 were 2.31 +/- 1.38mg/LN-TAN, 0.18 +/- 0.49mg/LN-NO2- and 6.83 +/- 6.52mg/LN-NO3-; in M1: 0.97 +/- 0.73mg/LN-TAN, 0.05 +/- 0.21mg/LN-NO2- and 0.63 +/- 0.70mg/LN-NO3-). When waters of both modules reached higher levels of ammonia and nitrite, histological alterations were observed in gills. The histological alterations index (HAI) was higher in M2 (5-112) than in M1 (2-22).

The first experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions and the fish were submitted to schedule meal timings (at 08:00, 12:00,16:00, 20:00, 00:00 and 04:00). A control on continuous feeding was also maintained. ANOVA had revealed a significant (p<.05) increase in live weight gain (g), growth per cent gain in body weight, specific growth rate, PER, GPR, GER and APD (%) values in fingerlings fed between 12:00 and 16:00hours. A decline in growth parameters, nutrient retention and an increase in FCR values were observed in the group fed at 20:00, 00:00hours and also in the control group. Studies have further revealed that meal timings had also significantly (p<.005) affected protein digestibility, nitrogen retention and excretion of metabolites. Fish carcass composition had significantly (p<.05) higher accumulation of protein (14.82 +/- 0.032), fat (5.51 +/- 0.006) and energy (5.95 +/- 0.004) in the group fed at 16:00hours. The second experiment was conducted under field conditions and the fish were submitted to schedule meal timings (at 08:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00). A control on continuous feeding was also maintained. Significantly (p<.05) higher values in growth parameters were observed in the group fed at 16:00hours and lower values in the group fed at 20:00hours and also in controls. Water quality, nutrients and productivity status of ponds revealed favourable levels and appears to have been affected by meal timings. Thus, in C.mrigala, timings of food intake can serve to optimize the utilization of ingested calories.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				DEC	2017	48	12					5940	5954		10.1111/are.13417								WOS:000414941000024

This study aims to evaluate the response of mitochondrial activity in spores of the autochthonous fern Cyathea costaricensis as a bioassessment tool concurrently with land use and physicochemical evaluation in 11 sites along Bobos River, Veracruz, Mexico, to assess river water quality. Bobos River is located in the Nautla basin, northeastern Veracruz (Mexico); the upper river runs through a protected natural area (Filobobos River and adjacent areas). The study involved three monitoring periods: February, June and September 2014. In each study site, physicochemical water quality parameters were recorded to calculate the Water Quality Index (WQI); also, study sites were characterized in terms of land use. Water samples were collected to perform bioassays where spores of C costaricensis were exposed to samples to assess mitochondrial activity; a positive control exposure test was run under controlled conditions to maximize mitochondrial activity. A Principal Component Analysis was performed to correlate land-use attributes with environmental variables and mitochondrial activity. Three river sections were identified: the upper portion was characterized by the dominance of native vegetation, the highest WQI (in September), and the lowest mitochondrial activity (63.87%-77.47%), related to the geological nature of the basin and high hardness levels. Mitochondrial activity peaked in September (98.32% +/- 9.01), likely resulting from nutrient enrichment in the rainy season, and was lowest in February (74.54% +/- 1.60) (p < 0.05). Mitochondrial activity was found to be a good benchmark for the assessment of water quality, reflecting the effects of physicochemical characteristics. Mitochondrial activity showed changes along the river and between seasons, associated with environmental characteristics such as land use and the geological nature of the basin, as well as with those related to human impacts.

Thus, this study aimed to assess the water quality of two sites of the Ilha River (source and mouth, S1 and S2 respectively) in five sampling periods using water physicochemical and microbiological analyses, biomarkers, such as condition factor, micronucleus test, gill histopathological analysis, and metal bioaccumulation in the native fish Bryconamericus iheringii. Mean values of BOD5, thermotolerant coliforms, aluminum, iron and lead exceeded the limits established by the Brazilian legislation for surface waters at both sampling sites. Significant higher micronucleus, nuclear abnormalities and mucous cells frequencies were found at S2 in, at least, one sampling period, whereas fish from S1 presented significant lower condition factor, higher frequencies of lamellar alterations and higher concentrations of chromium and nickel in muscle. Additionally, concentrations of cadmium, chromium and lead in fish muscle exceeded the limits considered safe for human consumption at both sites in at least one sampling period. Data from our study evidenced the mouth of the Ilha River suffers from point genotoxic effects, whereas the source is also contaminated by metals, despite being located in an area under minor anthropic activities.

J	Opare, S				Opare, Service			Practising the past in the present: using Ghanaian indigenous methods for water quality determination in the contemporary era	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Surface water sources remain the dominant sources of water supply for a significant proportion of poor communities. These water supply sources tend to have low water quality levels. Application of water quality determination and purification measures could minimize water-related diseases associated with direct consumption of water with poor quality levels. A number of simple measures have been devised and utilized by indigenous communities based on their resource conservation knowledge to improve water quality levels. However, scientific approaches that are more in tune with modern demands for reliability and exactness are the preferred, mainstream approaches for determining water quality. Growing recognition of the relevance of indigenous knowledge has led to renewed interest in the possibility of utilizing it for such tasks. Research conducted in 2007 and 2008 in two indigenous communities in Ghana revealed a diversity of indigenous methods for water quality determination and purification including straining, settling and use of special seeds which could still be useful in this contemporary era. This paper recommends that knowledge co-production and transdisciplinary approaches be employed to enable indigenous communities and experts to collaborate and develop measures that tap both knowledge systems for improving water quality levels for human use.																	1387-585X	1573-2975				DEC	2017	19	6					2217	2236		10.1007/s10668-016-9851-2								WOS:000414459300005						
J	Sheikhzeinoddin, A; Esmaeili, A				Sheikhzeinoddin, Azar; Esmaeili, Abdoulkarim			Ecological and economic impacts of different irrigation and fertilization practices: case study of a watershed in the southern Iran	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Best management practices, such as conservation tillage, the optimum level of irrigation, fertilization, are frequently used to reduce non-point source pollution from agricultural land and improve water quality. In this study, we used the soil and water assessment tool to model the impacts of different irrigation (adjusted to crop need), cropping and fertilization practices on total nitrogen loss. The economic impacts of these practices on crop net farm income were also evaluated. For this purpose, the model was calibrated through comparing model outputs with observations to ensure reliable hydrologic, crop yield and nitrate leaching simulations. The results showed that by reducing water or fertilizer or combination of both, we can reduce nitrate leaching. For wheat and corn, the best scenario was S1n1 (combination between reduction by 10 % of water and nitrogen fertilizer application, simultaneously) and S2n3 (combination of 20 and 30 % reduction in water and fertilizer application), respectively. These scenarios are both ecologically and economically desirable. Also, decreasing nitrogen fertilization by 50 % for corn would decrease the nitrate pollution from 101.1 to 32.3 kg N ha(-1); therefore, this strategy is ecologically desirable but economically unsound. So, there are opportunities for environmental decision makers to encourage farmers to implement these strategies. Also, since the nitrogen leaching cannot decrease without a reduction in net farm income for crops such as corn; hence, the losses of farmers should be compensated.																	1387-585X	1573-2975				DEC	2017	19	6					2499	2515		10.1007/s10668-016-9868-6								WOS:000414459300020

Although a key feature of urban areas is their higher temperature (urban heat islands), adaptive thermal evolution in organisms inhabiting urban areas has rarely been studied. We tested for evolution of a higher heat tolerance (CTMAX) in urban populations of the water flea Daphnia magna, a keystone grazer in freshwater ecosystems, by carrying out a common garden experiment at two temperatures (20 degrees C and 24 degrees C) with genotypes of 13 natural populations ordered along a well-defined urbanization gradient. We also assessed body size and haemoglobin concentration to identify underlying physiological drivers of responses in CTMAX. We found a higher CTMAX in animals isolated from urban compared to rural habitats and in animals reared at higher temperatures. We also observed substantial genetic variation in thermal tolerance within populations. Overall, smaller animals were more heat tolerant. While urban animals mature at smaller size, the effect of urbanization on thermal tolerance is only in part caused by reductions in body size. Although urban Daphnia contained higher concentrations of haemoglobin, this did not contribute to their higher CTMAX. Our results provide evidence of adaptive thermal evolution to urbanization in the water flea Daphnia. In addition, our results show both evolutionary potential and adaptive plasticity in rural as well as urban Daphnia populations, facilitating responses to warming. Given the important ecological role of Daphnia in ponds and lakes, these adaptive responses likely impact food web dynamics, top-down control of algae, water quality, and the socio-economic value of urban ponds.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				DEC	2017	23	12					5218	5227		10.1111/gcb.13784								WOS:000414969000022	28614592

Unexpected stasis in a changing world: Lake nutrient and chlorophyll trends since 1990	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The United States (U.S.) has faced major environmental changes in recent decades, including agricultural intensification and urban expansion, as well as changes in atmospheric deposition and climate-all of which may influence eutrophication of freshwaters. However, it is unclear whether or how water quality in lakes across diverse ecological settings has responded to environmental change. We quantified water quality trends in 2913 lakes using nutrient and chlorophyll (Chl) observations from the Lake Multi-Scaled Geospatial and Temporal Database of the Northeast U.S. (LAGOS-NE), a collection of preexisting lake data mostly from state agencies. LAGOS-NE was used to quantify whether lake water quality has changed from 1990 to 2013, and whether lake-specific or regional geophysical factors were related to the observed changes. We modeled change through time using hierarchical linear models for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), stoichiometry (TN:TP), and Chl. Both the slopes (percent change per year) and intercepts (value in 1990) were allowed to vary by lake and region. Across all lakes, TN declined at a rate of 1.1% year(-1), while TP, TN:TP, and Chl did not change. A minority (7%-16%) of individual lakes had changing nutrients, stoichiometry, or Chl. Of those lakes that changed, we found differences in the geospatial variables that were most related to the observed change in the response variables. For example, TN and TN:TP trends were related to region-level drivers associated with atmospheric deposition of N; TP trends were related to both lake and region-level drivers associated with climate and land use; and Chl trends were found in regions with high air temperature at the beginning of the study period. We conclude that despite large environmental change and management efforts over recent decades, water quality of lakes in the Midwest and Northeast U.S. has not overwhelmingly degraded or improved.

In this study, we investigated denitrification rate and denitrifier community structure and their abundance in different hydrological pulsing phases and vegetation types (tree, shrub, and herb) in the water-level-fluctuate-zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. Results revealed that hydrologic pulsing greatly affected denitrification rate possibly by regulating the soil NO3-N concentration, with higher denitrification rate in the reflooding phase in tree soils than that in the saturated and drying phases. Hydrologic pulsing also significantly regulated the abundance and structure of denitrifier communities in herb soils by altering soil temperature, moisture, and NH4+-N. As expected, vegetation types affected the denitrifier communities by altering soil texture, pH, temperature, moisture, soil organic C, and C:N ratio, with higher abundance of nirS genes and higher diversity of nirS and nirK genes in herb soils. However, there was no significant relationship between denitrification rate and denitrifier communities, indicating that hydrologic pulsing regulated denitrification rate primarily by changing soil environmental factors rather than community composition or abundance of denitrifiers. Our results suggest that tree and herb plantations would potentially improve water quality in the riparian zone and adjacent rivers by increasing denitrification rate and abundance of denitrifiers, respectively.

A highly specific Escherichia coil qPCR and its comparison with existing methods for environmental waters	WATER RESEARCH												The presence of Escherichia coil in environmental waters is considered as evidence of faecal contamination and is therefore commonly used as an indicator in both water quality and food safety analysis. The long period of time between sample collection and obtaining results from existing culture based methods means that contamination events may already impact public health by the time they are detected. The adoption of molecular based methods for E. coil could significantly reduce the time to detection. A new quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was developed to detect the ybbW gene sequence, which was found to be 100% exclusive and inclusive (specific and sensitive) for E. coil and directly compared for its ability to quantify E. coil in environmental waters against colony counts, quantitative real-time NASBA (qNASBA) targeting clpB and qPCR targeting uidA. Of the 87 E. coil strains tested, 100% were found to be ybbW positive, 94.2% were culture positive, 100% were clpB positive and 98.9% were uidA positive. The qPCR assays had a linear range of quantification over several orders of magnitude, and had high amplification efficiencies when using single isolates as a template. This compared favourably with qNASBA which showed poor linearity and amplification efficiency. When the assays were applied to environmental water samples, qNASBA was unable to reliably quantify E. coil while both qPCR assays were capable of predicting E. coli concentrations in environmental waters. This study highlights the inability of qNASBA targeting mRNA to quantify E. coli in environmental waters, and presents the first E. coli qPCR assay with 100% target exclusivity. The application of a highly exclusive and inclusive qPCR assay has the potential to allow water quality managers to reliably and rapidly detect and quantify E. coli and therefore take appropriate measures to reduce the risk to public health posed by faecal contamination.

In the present study, the toxicity removal during wastewater treatment at seven municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) was investigated using an effect-based approach. A battery of eight bioassays was applied comprising of cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, endocrine disruption and fish embryo toxicity assays. Human cell-based CALUX assays, transgenic larval models and the fish embryo toxicity test were particularly sensitive to WWTP effluents. The results indicate that most effects were significantly reduced or completely removed during wastewater treatment (76-100%), while embryo toxicity, estrogenic activity and thyroid disruption were still detectable in the effluents suggesting that some harmful substances remain after treatment. The responsiveness of the bioassays was compared and the human cell-based CALUX assays showed highest responsiveness in the samples. Additionally, the fish embryo toxicity test and the transgenic larval models for endocrine disrupting effects showed high responsiveness at low sample concentrations in nearly all of the effluent samples. The results showed a similar effect pattern among all WWTPs investigated, indicating that the wastewater composition could be rather similar at different locations. There were no considerable differences in the toxicity removal efficiencies of the treatment plants and no correlation was observed with WWTP characteristics, such as process configuration or sludge age. This study demonstrated that a biotest battery comprising of multiple endpoints can serve as a powerful tool when assessing water quality or water treatment efficiency in a holistic manner. Rather than analyzing the concentrations of a few selected chemicals, bioassays can be used to complement traditional methods of monitoring in the future by assessing sum-parameter based effects, such as mixture effects, and tackling chemicals that are present at concentrations below chemical analytical detection limits.

Removal of selected emerging PPCP compounds using greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland	WATER RESEARCH												Greater duckweed (Spirodela polyrhiza) based lab-scale free water constructed wetland (CW) was employed for removing four emerging pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) (i.e. DEET, paracetamol, caffeine and triclosan). Orthogonal design was used to test the effect of light intensity, aeration, E.coli abundance and plant biomass on the target compounds. Synthetic wastewater contaminated with the target compounds at concentration of 25 mu g/L. was prepared, and both batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted. Up to 100% removals were achieved for paracetamol (PAR), caffeine (CAF) and tricolsan (TCS) while the highest removal for DEET was 32.2% in batch tests. Based on orthogonal Duncan analysis, high light intensity (240 mu molmm(-2)s(-1)), full aeration, high plant biomass (1.00 kg/m(2)) and high E.coli abundance (1.0 x 10(6) CFU/100 mL) favoured elimination of the PPCPs. Batch verification test achieved removals of 17.1%, 98.8%, 96.4% and 95.4% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS respectively. Continuous flow tests with CW only and CW followed by stabilization tank (CW-ST) were carried out. Final removals of the PPCP contaminants were 32.6%, 97.7%, 98.0% and 100% for DEET, PAR, CAF and TCS, respectively, by CW system alone, while 43.3%, 97.5%, 98.2% and 100%, respectively, were achieved by CW-ST system. By adding the ST tank, PPCP concentrations decreased significantly faster (p < 0.05) compared with continuous flow CW alone. In addition, after removing aerators during continuous flow CW experiments, the treatment systems presented good stability for the PPCP removals. CW-ST showed better chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) removals (89.3%, 91.2%, respectively) than CW only (79.4%, 85.2%, respectively). However, poor DEET removal (<50%) and high E.coli abundance (up to 1.7 log increase) in the final treated water indicated further treatment processes may be required. Statistical analysis showed significant correlations (p < 0.05) between PPCPs and water quality parameters (e.g. COD, nitrate, phosphate), and between the four PPCP compounds for the continuous flow CW and CW-ST systems. Positive results encourage further test of Greater duckweed at pilot scale ON using real wastewater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A risk-based approach for developing standards for irrigation with reclaimed water	WATER RESEARCH												A generalised quantitative risk assessment (QRA) is developed to assess the potential harm to human health resulting from irrigation with reclaimed water. The QRA is conducted as a backward calculation starting from a pre-defined acceptable risk level at the receptor point (defined as an annual infection risk of 10(-4) for pathogens and by reference doses (RfD) for chemical hazards) and results in an estimate of the corresponding acceptable concentration levels of the given hazards in the effluent. In this way the QRA is designed to inform the level of water treatment required to achieve an acceptable risk level and help establish reclaimed water quality standards. The QRA considers the exposure of human receptors to microbial and chemical hazards in the effluent through various exposure pathways and routes depending on the specific irrigation scenario. By considering multiple pathways and routes, a number of key aspects relevant to estimating human exposure to recycled water can be accounted for, including irrigation and crop handling practices (e.g., non-edible vs edible, spray vs. drip, withholding time) and volumes consumed (directly vs indirectly). The QRA relies on a large number of inputs, many of which were found to be highly uncertain. A possibilistic approach, based on fuzzy set theory, was used to propagate the uncertain input values through the QRA model to estimate the possible range of hazard concentrations that are deemed acceptable/safe for reclaimed water irrigation. Two scenarios were considered: amenity irrigation and irrigation of ready-to-eat food crops, and calculations were carried out for six example hazards (norovirus, Cryptosporidium, cadmium, lead, PCB118 and naphthalene) and using UK-specific input values. The human health risks associated with using reclaimed water for amenity irrigation were overall deemed low, i.e. the calculated acceptable concentration levels for most of the selected hazards were generally far greater than levels typically measured in effluent from wastewater treatment plants; however the predicted acceptable concentration levels for norovirus and Cryptosporidium suggested that disinfection by UV may be required before use. It was found that stricter concentration standards were required for hazards that are more strongly bound to soil and/or are more toxic/infectious. It was also found that measures that reduce the amount of effluent directly ingested by the receptor would significantly reduce the risks (by up to 2 orders of magnitude for the two pathogens). The results for the food crop irrigation scenario showed that stricter concentration standards are required to ensure the effluent is safe to use. For pathogens, the dominant exposure route was found to be ingestion of effluent captured on the surface of the crops indicating that risks could be significantly reduced by restricting irrigation to the non-edible parts of the crop. The results also showed that the exposure to some organic compounds and heavy metals through plant uptake and attached soil particles could be high and possibly pose unacceptable risk to human health. For both scenarios, we show that the predicted acceptable concentration levels are associated with large uncertainty and discuss the implications this has for defining quality standards and how the uncertainty can be reduced.

Nutrient loading impacts on culturable E. coil and other heterotrophic bacteria fate in simulated stream mesocosms	WATER RESEARCH												Understanding fecal indicator bacteria persistence in aquatic environments is important when making management decisions to improve instream water quality. Routinely, bacteria fate and transport models that rely on published kinetic decay constants are used to inform such decision making but may not adequately represent instream conditions. The objective of this work was to evaluate bacterial responses to applied nutrient amendments and provide additional information regarding bacterial response to applied changes that can be incorporated into future modeling efforts. Re-created stream mesocosms were established in laboratory-based, repurposed algae raceways filled with water and sediment from a small, 3rd order Southeast Texas stream. Mesocosm treatments consisted of low (10x) or high (50x) nutrient doses above ambient water concentrations operated at low (0.032 m/s) or high (0.141 m/s) flow rates. Escherichia coli and heterotrophic bacterial concentrations were quantified in water and sediment over 22 days. No significant differences in kinetic constants were observed among E. coli in water or sediment, and only E. coli in sediment showed any growth response. Heterotrophic plate counts revealed a pronounced growth response in water and sediment within 24 h of nutrient addition but did not differ significantly from control mesocosms. Significant kinetic constant differences between E. coli and heterotrophic bacteria in water were identified (p < 0.01) but did not differ significantly in sediment (p > 0.48). Results indicate that nutrient addition does affect microbial numbers instream, but competition from heterotrophic bacteria may prevent an E. coli growth response. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ozcan, Z; Kentel, E; Alp, E				Ozcan, Zeynep; Kentel, Elcin; Alp, Emre			Evaluation of the best management practices in a semi-arid region with high agricultural activity	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The arid and semi-arid regions with water scarcity are vulnerable to several stressors such as urbanization, high water demand created by agricultural and industrial activities, point and non-point pollution sources, and climate change. Hence, proactive policies and sustainable water management strategies that are based on decision support systems are crucial in arid and semi-arid regions. Because of large expenses and implementation difficulties associated with the diffuse pollution abatement plans, many authorities are hesitant to initiate, especially those that may present a financial burden on population. Lake Mogan, a shallow lake, is located in a semi-arid region dominated by dry agricultural activities and has been in eutrophic state for the past 20 years. There has been several management alternatives suggested to improve the water quality in Lake Mogan and one of the alternative is the application of BMPs that include fertilizer management, conservation/no tillage, contouring, and terracing to reduce the amount of diffuse source pollutants. In this study, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) Model is applied to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural best management practices (BMPs) in the Lake Mogan watershed located in a semi-arid region. The most effective BMP scenario was found as the one in which three individual BMP scenarios (30% fertilizer reduction, no tillage, and terracing) were combined. With this scenario average annual load reductions of 9.3%, 8.6%, 8.0%, and 11.1% were achieved in sediment, nitrate, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus, respectively. Even with the most effective BMP strategy, high levels of nutrient reduction will not be achieved since non-irrigated agriculture and intermittent low-flow streams accounts majority of the study area. The outcomes suggest integrated solutions should be developed to improve water quality in Lake Mogan. It is aimed that this study will aid decision makers to implement effective best management practices in watersheds showing similar characteristics (i.e. topographical, hydrologic processes, LULC (Land use land cover) characteristics, agricultural activities, meteorological etc.) with the study area.

Our study employed the concepts of technological path and aeration frame to analyze the extensive restoration and aeration history of the hypertrophic Tuusulanjarvi in southern Finland. Continuously aerated since 1972, it has the longest history of aeration in Finland. Qualitative analysis of documentary and archival sources revealed that the longstanding preference for aeration in the context of increasing scientific controversy was based on its functional versatility and seemingly unproblematic applicability in regard to shifting emphasis and goal setting of restoration. Additionally, the stability of the aeration frame has been supported by the practical and emotional attachment of local residents to lake restoration, particularly aeration, and finally the problems and contradicting interests related to alternative restoration methods.																	0044-7447	1654-7209				DEC	2017	46	8					865	877		10.1007/s13280-017-0926-6								WOS:000412998600004	28623630					
J	Liuzzo, L; Bono, E; Sammartano, V; Freni, G				Liuzzo, Lorena; Bono, Enrico; Sammartano, Vincenzo; Freni, Gabriele			Long-term temperature changes in Sicily, Southern Italy	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												Temperature series recorded at 84 measurement stations across Sicily (Italy) have been analysed in order to detect statistically significant changes during the 1924-2013 period. The occurrence of abrupt change points in annual maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures and temperature range series was investigated using cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts. Then, the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test was applied to the average annual, monthly and seasonal series. Prior to the application of the Mann -Kendall test, gaps in the historical dataset were filled using a geostatistical technique, namely the Residual Ordinary Kriging, and then processed to remove the influence of serial correlation on test results. Significant trends were quantified using a robust non-parametric estimate. Once the trends at each site were identified, the spatial patterns in those trends were obtained using the Inverse Distance Weighted. Results indicated a general increase in the analysed series over the area of study. Upward trends in maximum temperatures frequently occurred during the winter months, with the largest increases in the south-west, while mean temperatures increases occurred mostly during the spring, summer and winter. Across a wide western area, a small number of negative trends were observed in annual minimum temperatures, especially in autumn months. Temperature ranges showed both positive and negative trends. Decreasing trends occurred along the eastern coast and in the western part of the region.

In this study, algal-bacterial consortia were introduced into aquaponics, i.e., algal-bacterial based aquaponics (AA), to improve the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of aquaponics. The results showed that the NUE of AA was 13.79% higher than that of media-based aquaponics (MA). In addition, higher NO3- removal by microalgae assimilation led to better water quality in AA, which made up for the deficiencies of poor aquaponic management of nitrate. As a result of lower NO3- concentrations and dramatically higher dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations caused by microalgae photosynthesis in the photobioreactor, the N2O emission of AA was 89.89% lower than that of MA, although nosZ gene abundance in MA's hydroponic bed was approximately 30 times over that in AA. Considering the factors mentioned above, AA would improve the sustainability of aquaponics and have a good application foreground.

Here we studied the historical (1983-2007) metal contamination in the Ulla river (NW Iberian Peninsula) watershed impacted by a Cu mine that was in operation from 1973 until 1988 by means of the analysis of major and trace elements in salmon scales. Results indicate the presence of a significant contamination for several metals (especially Cu, Au, Ag, Sb, Zn) during the 1980's. Concentrations of Cu in salmon scales during the influence of the mine (1983-1990) were 20 +/- 5 mu g/g, exceeding the values for the recent years (1995-2007): 1.8 +/- 0.4 mu g/g. Concentrations for Au in these two periods were 31 +/- 12 and 2.1 +/- 1.2 ng/g; for Ag: 21 +/- 4 and 4 +/- 2 ng/g; for Sb: 48 +/- 21 and 15 4 ng/g; and for Zn: 133 +/- 16 and 93 +/- 10 mu g/g. The estimated concentrations of dissolved copper during the operation of the mine indicate a scenario of toxic effects due to sensory impairinents in the salmon, and a reduction in scales calcification. The results presented here demonstrate that the analysis of trace elements in archived fish scales is a suitable tool for the reconstruction of the past contamination in aquatic systems, and it can be also used as a non-lethal approach for biomonitoring purposes.

Disinfection byproduct precursor dynamics and water treatability during an extreme flooding event in a coastal blackwater river in southeastern United States	CHEMOSPHERE												Coastal blackwater rivers, characterized by high concentrations of natural organic matter, are source water for millions of people in the southeastern US. In October 2015, large areas of coastal South Carolina were flooded by Hurricane Joaquin. This so-called "thousand-year" rainfall mobilized and flushed large amounts of terrestrial organic matter and associated pollutants (e.g. mercury) into source water, affecting water quality and safety of municipal water supply. To understand the dynamics of water quality and water treatability during this extreme flood, water samples were collected from Waccamaw River (a typical blackwater river in the southeastern US) during rising limb, peak discharge, falling limb, and base flow. Despite decreasing water flow after peak discharge, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels (increased by up to 125%), and formation potentials of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids (increased by up to 150%) remained high for an extended period of time (>eight weeks after peak discharge), while variation in the N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) FP was negligible. Coagulation with alum and ferric at optimal dosage significantly reduced concentrations of DOC by 51-76%, but up to 10 mg/L Of DOC still remained in treated waters. For an extended period of time, elevated levels of THMs (71-448 mu g/L) and HAAS (88-406 mu g/L) were quantified in laboratory.chlorination experiments under uniform formation conditions (UFC), exceeding the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) maximum contaminant level of 80 and 60 mu g/L, respectively. Results demonstrated that populations in coastal cities are at high risk with disinfection by-products (DBPs) under the changing climate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The reservoir, which supplies drinking water for nearly half of Shanghai's population, is located in Yangtze Delta. The integrated model was built by Delft3D suite, a fully integrated multidimensional modeling software. Atrazine and Bisphenol A (BPA) were selected as two representative emerging contaminants for the study in this reservoir. The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated against observations from 2011 to 2015 while the integrated model was calibrated against observations from 2014 to 2015 and then applied to explore the potential risk of high atrazine concentrations in the reservoir driven by agriculture activities. Our results show that the model is capable of describing the spatial and temporal patterns of water temperature, salinity and the dynamic distributions of two representative emerging contaminants (i.e. atrazine and BPA) in the reservoir. The physical and biodegradation processes in this study were found to play a crucial role in determining the fate and transport of atrazine and BPA in the reservoir. The model also provides an insight into the potential risk of emerging contaminants and possible mitigation thresholds. The integrated approach can be a very useful tool to support policy-makers in the future management of Qingcaosha Reservoir. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we developed a multiple-endpoints gene alteration-based (MEGA) assay, a real-time PCR-based transcriptomic analysis, to assess the water quality of wastewater effluents for human health risk assessment and management. Twenty-one genes from the human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2), covering the basic health-relevant stress responses such as response to xenobiotics, genotoxicity, and cytotoxicity, were selected and incorporated into the MEGA assay. The genes related to the p53-mediated DNA damage response and cytochrome P450 were selected as markers for genotoxicity and response to xenobiotics, respectively. Additionally, the genes that were dose-dependently regulated by exposure to the wastewater effluents were chosen as markers for cytotoxicity. The alterations in the expression of an individual gene, induced by exposure to the wastewater effluents, were evaluated by real-time PCR and the results were validated by genotoxicity (e.g., comet assay) and cell-based cytotoxicity tests. In summary, the MEGA assay is a real-time PCR-based assay that targets cellular responses to contaminants present in wastewater effluents at the transcriptional level; it is rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput and can thus complement any chemical analysis for water quality assessment and management.

In this study, water quality and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption and fluorescence were investigated in different seasons to elucidate how hydraulic connectivity and evaporation may affect the water quality and variability of CDOM in the lake. Mean suspended solids and turbidity were significantly higher in the upstream tributaries than in the lake, the difference being notably more pronounced in the wet than in the dry season. A markedly higher mean first principal component (PC1) score, which was significantly positively related to protein-like components, and a considerably lower fluorescence peak integration ratio -I-C:I-T, indicative, of the terrestrial humic-like CDOM contribution percentage, were observed in the lake than in the upstream tributaries. Correspondingly, notably higher contribution percentages of terrestrial humiclike components were observed in the river mouth areas than in the remaining lake regions. Furthermore, significantly higher mean turbidity, and notably lower mean conductivity and salinity, were recorded in the southwestern Kaidu river mouth than. in the remaining lake regions in the wet season. Notably higher mean salinity is recorded in Lake Bosten than in upstream tributaries. Autochthonous protein-like associated amino-acids and also PC1 scores increased significantly with increasing salinity. We conclude that the dynamics of water quality and CDOM composition in remote arid Lake Bosten are strongly driven by evaporation and also the hydraulic connectivity between the upstream tributaries and the downstream lake.

J	Lee, YG; Jang, A				Lee, Yong-Gu; Jang, Am			Application of sensitive electrochemical sensing system for detecting bromate from disinfection process in desalination plant	DESALINATION												Chlorination is the most commonly used in disinfection to prevent from the bacterial growth in both intake and distribution pipelines or storage tanks. However, the disinfection treatment can result in an undesirable by-product, such a bromate (BrO3-), which is a suspected human carcinogen. Seawater has a high potential of BrO3- formation because of high bromide (Br-) concentration (around 65 mg/L) which can be transformed by chlorination in disinfection process. Therefore, the measurement or monitoring of BrO3- formation is necessary. This study aims to apply the sensitive amperometric sensing system for detecting BrO3- in free chlorine condition. A linear dynamic ranged from 60 to 200 nM of BrO3- even in 28 mu M free chlorine solution with a sensitivity of 108.8 mu A/mu M. The detection limit level of BrO3- was 38.6 nM and the limit of quantification value of BrO3- was 113.7 nM (at pH 7). This detection limit value was half of global guideline value for drinldng water. The proposed technique had no noticeable interference to the sensing of BrO3- over various potentially interfering agents and other chlorinated disinfection by-products. The data measured by multilayered sensor system was in a good agreement for detecting BrO3- with validated data measured by using a conventional UV-vis spectroscopic method. As a final demonstration, the proposed amperometric sensing system would significantly contribute to the on-site detection of BrO3- concentration from chlorinating disinfection process within drinking water treatment plants, including desalination, and water quality monitoring applications.																	0011-9164	1873-4464				DEC 1	2017	423						135	140		10.1016/j.desal.2017.09.011								WOS:000413389300013

Removal of nutrients, trace organic contaminants, and bacterial indicator organisms in a demonstration-scale unit process open-water treatment wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A demonstration-scale unit process open-water wetland system was built to treat water from an effluent-dominated river (i.e., a river in which the flow consisted almost entirely of municipal wastewater effluent from May to October). Monitoring of the system over a two-year period indicated effective removal of nitrate, with concentrations decreasing by over 90% during summer. The temperature-independent areal first-order nitrate removal rate constant, k(20), ranged from 61.7 to 68.1 m yr(-1) after the microbial community was established, which is significantly higher than values typically observed in full-scale surface flow wetlands. The beta-adrenergic blockers, atenolol and propranolol, as well as the antiviral drug, acyclovir, were removed by photolysis and biotransformation in the wetland biomat, whereas the antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine, exhibited little removal. The bacterial indicators E. coli and enterococci decreased substantially during summer, mainly through sunlight exposure. Models of contaminant removal based upon measured flow rates and performance data collected at a similar pilot-scale system agreed well with measured data for nitrate and the trace organic contaminants. The model accurately predicted removal of enterococci but systematically over-predicted the removal of E. coli. During the two-year study period, routine maintenance was necessary to prevent colonization of the water surface with duckweed (Lemna spp.). Unit process open-water (UPOW) wetlands may offer a low-cost means of improving water quality in natural treatment systems that can be integrated with conventional surface-flow wetlands and other managed natural systems.

Use of Fish Telemetry in Rehabilitation Planning, Management, and Monitoring in Areas of Concern in the Laurentian Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Freshwater ecosystems provide many ecosystem services; however, they are often degraded as a result of human activity. To address ecosystem degradation in the Laurentian Great Lakes, Canada and the United States of America established the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA). In 1987, 43 highly polluted and impacted areas were identified under the GLWQA as having one or more of 14 Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) to the physical and chemical habitat for fish, wildlife and humans, and were designated as Areas of Concern (AOC). Subnational jurisdictions combined with local stakeholders, with support from federal governments, developed plans to remediate and restore these sites. Biotelemetry (the tracking of animals using electronic tags) provides information on the spatial ecology of fish in the wild relevant to habitat management and stock assessment. Here, seven case studies are presented where biotelemetry data were directly incorporated within the AOC Remedial Action Plan (RAP) process. Specific applications include determining seasonal fish-habitat associations to inform habitat restoration plans, identifying the distribution of pollutant-indicator species to identify exposure risk to contamination sources, informing the development of fish passage facilities to enable fish to access fragmented upstream habitats, and assessing fish use of created or restored habitats. With growing capacity for fish biotelemetry research in the Great Lakes, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of incorporating biotelemetry into AOC RAP processes to improve the science and practice of restoration and to facilitate the delisting of AOCs.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				DEC	2017	60	6					1139	1154		10.1007/s00267-017-0937-x								WOS:000413777700010	28939998

H.			Do Riparian Buffers Protect Stream Invertebrate Communities in South American Atlantic Forest Agricultural Areas?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												We investigated the influence and relative importance of insecticides and other agricultural stressors in determining variability in invertebrate communities in small streams in intensive soy-production regions of Brazil and Paraguay. In Paraguay we sampled 17 sites on tributaries of the Pirapo River in the state of Itapua and in Brazil we sampled 18 sites on tributaries of the San Francisco River in the state of Parana. The riparian buffer zones generally contained native Atlantic forest remnants and/or introduced tree species at various stages of growth. In Brazil the stream buffer width was negatively correlated with sediment insecticide concentrations and buffer width was found to have moderate importance in mitigating effects on some sensitive taxa such as mayflies. However, in both regions insecticides had low relative importance in explaining variability in invertebrate communities, while various habitat parameters were more important. In Brazil, the percent coverage of soft depositional sediment in streams was the most important agriculture-related explanatory variable, and the overall stream-habitat score was the most important variable in Paraguay streams. Paraguay and Brazil both have laws requiring forested riparian buffers. The ample forested riparian buffer zones typical of streams in these regions are likely to have mitigated the effects of pesticides on stream invertebrate communities. This study provides evidence that riparian buffer regulations in the Atlantic Forest region are protecting stream ecosystems from pesticides and other agricultural stressors. Further studies are needed to determine the minimum buffer widths necessary to achieve optimal protection.

This study aimed to reveal the spatial pattern and sources of phosphorus export and loading from the watershed. We applied an export coefficient model and the Dillon-Rigler model to quantify contributions of different sub-watersheds and sources to the total phosphorus (TP) export and loading in 2010. Together, the upper and lower reaches of the Xiang River watershed and the Dongting Lake Area contributed 60.9% of the TP exported from the entire watershed. Livestock husbandry appeared to be the largest anthropogenic source of TP, contributing more than 50% of the TP exported from each secondary sub-watersheds. The actual TP loading to the lake in 2010 was 62.9% more than the permissible annual TP loading for compliance with the Class III water quality standard for lakes. Three primary sub-watersheds-the Dongting Lake Area, the Xiang River, and the Yuan River watersheds-contributed 91.2% of the total TP loading. As the largest contributor among all sources, livestock husbandry contributed nearly 50% of the TP loading from the Dongting Lake Area and more than 60% from each of the other primary sub-watersheds. This study provides a methodology to identify the key sources and locations of TP export and loading in large lake watersheds. The study can provide a reference for the decision-making for controlling P pollution in the Dongting Lake watershed.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2017	189	12							602	10.1007/s10661-017-6293-8								WOS:000414460100003	29101549

Hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater was analysed using Durov diagram, statistical analysis, Gibbs diagram and correlation analysis. Entropy weighted water quality index evaluated groundwater quality. Health risk assessment model was used to evaluate the health risk to adults and children caused by target pollutants (NO3 (-), NH4 (+), NO2 (-), F-, Mn, Zn, Ba2+, As and Cr6+) through direct ingestion and dermal absorption. The results show that the groundwater is alkaline in the study area and the abundance of cations is Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and anions is SO4 (2-) > Cl- > HCO3 (-). All evaluation indicators except K+, NH4 (+), Zn and Ba2+ in groundwater exceed the permissible limits of drinking water. Gibbs diagrams display that evaporation crystallisation and rock weathering control the groundwater hydrochemical components. The study shows 53.4% of groundwater samples are not suitable for drinking in the study area. Total dissolved solids (TDS), Mg2+, Na+, SO4 (2-), Cl- and total hardness are the main contaminants which mainly come from industrial activities. The health risk assessment shows that the total risks of carcinogens (As and Cr6+) to adults and children are 4.20 x 10(-4) and 1.14 x 10(-3) per year, respectively, which are far higher than the International Commission on Radiologic Protection recommended maximum acceptable annual level (5.0 x 10(-6) per year).																	2451-9766	2451-9685				DEC	2017	9	4					227	242		10.1007/s12403-016-0234-6								WOS:000414200000001

Safe drinking water is one of the major prerequisites for a healthy life. The current study assessed the contamination of drinking water including physicochemical parameters (pH, TDS, EC, TH, Cl1-, NO3 (1-), PO4 (3-), SO4 (2-), Mn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Cr) and bacteriological contamination (Fecal coliform) in chromite mining-impacted areas of Pakistan. However, the main focus of the study was to identify the potential health risk of these parameters to the local people of the study area. Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, AAS-PEA-700) was used to analyze the concentrations of potentially toxic metals. The concentrations of Cd, Pb, Ni, and Cr ranged from below detection limit (BDL)-7.20, BDL-14.4, BDL-78.3 and 0.20-69.0 and exceeded their respective limits in 31, 11, 17, and 36% samples of drinking water set by World Health Organization, while the concentration of Ni (63% samples) also exceeded the safe limit set by Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency. Furthermore, the chronic daily intake (CDI) and health risk index (HRI) of potentially toxic metals through consumption of drinking water were found in the order of Mn > Ni > Cr > Cd > Pb and Cd > Ni > Mn > Pb > Cr, respectively. The HRI values of selected toxic metals in mining-impacted sites were found within the safe limit (HRI < 1). The results showed that both geogenic and anthropogenic activities were the main sources of drinking water contamination in the study area.																	2451-9766	2451-9685				DEC	2017	9	4					275	287		10.1007/s12403-016-0240-8								WOS:000414200000005

Mussels may accumulate contaminants of public health concern, including pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Microbiological monitoring of harvesting areas is based on count of Escherichia coli in bivalve molluscs in the European Union. It is assumed that E. coli does not reflect contamination with enteric viruses. A structured field study was undertaken at six locations in Bay of Kotor, Montenegro, in order to investigate plausible influence of environmental factors on the variability of E. coli and norovirus (NoV). From July 2015 to July 2016, a total of 72 samples of mussels were collected in coastal harvesting areas of the Montenegro. The samples were screened for NoV of genogroups GI and GII using reverse transcription-qPCR (RT-qPCR). There were 43% NoV positive samples with higher presence of genogroup GII (74.2%). With regard to influence of environmental conditions on Norovirus presence, we have proved seasonal pattern of virus occurrence i.e., the largest number of positive samples was noticed during winter, while other physico-chemical factors were not of great significance. It was found that count of E. coli did not correlate with Norovirus prevalence. From the aspect of food safety, an upgrade of monitoring plans could lead to obtaining safer products.

Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) is one of the most abundant RNA viruses associated with human feces, making it a viable indicator for tracking fecal pollution in aquatic environments, including groundwater. In this study, groundwater samples collected from a karst aquifer from fresh and brackish water locations were analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria, somatic and male F+ specific coliphages, and PMMoV during the rainy and dry seasons. Total coliform bacteria were detected at all sites, whereas Escherichia coli were found at relatively low levels < 40 MPN/100 ml. The highest average concentrations of somatic and male F+ specific coliphages were 920 and 330 plaque forming units per 100 ml, respectively, detected in freshwater during the rainy season. PMMoV RNA was detected in 85% of the samples with gene sequences sharing 99-100% of nucleotide identity with PMMoV sequences available in GenBank. Quantification of PMMoV genome copies (GC) by quantitative real-time PCR indicated concentrations ranging from 1.7 x 10(1) to 1.0 x 10(4) GC/L, with the highest number of GC detected during the rainy season. No significant correlation was observed between PMMoV occurrence by season or water type (p > 0.05). Physicochemical and indicator bacteria were not correlated with PMMoV concentrations. The abundance and prevalence of PMMoV in the karst aquifer may reflect its environmental persistence and its potential as a fecal indicator in this karst aquifer system.																	1867-0334	1867-0342				DEC	2017	9	4					487	497		10.1007/s12560-017-9309-1								WOS:000414377300012	28646449

Record flooding of the Illinois River, Illinois, in 2013 reconnected two floodplain preserves under restoration that had been disconnected from the river by levees for > 80 years. Differences in hydrological connections between sites created a natural experiment where field-based data collection could be employed to document flood effects. Levee failure and subsequent river connection at Merwin Preserve increased nutrient capture and floodwater retention, shifted microbial and invertebrate communities, increased fish species richness, spawning and nursery habitat, and stimulated production of moist-soil plant communities during summer drawdown that provided foraging habitat for spring-migrating waterfowl. However, increased hydrologic connectivity during the growing season resulted in loss of submersed vegetation and habitat for autumn-migrating waterfowl. In contrast, river water overtopped the levee at Emiquon Preserve during a 6-day event that resulted in marginal changes in the bacterial community and negligible changes in water quality and community diversity. Tradeoffs among ecological services should be carefully considered when reconnection of highly altered rivers to restored lakes and wetlands is proposed.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2017	804	1					151	175		10.1007/s10750-017-3220-5								WOS:000414375700010						
J	Perni, A; Martinez-Paz, JM				Perni, Angel; Martinez-Paz, Jose Miguel			Measuring conflicts in the management of anthropized ecosystems: Evidence from a choice experiment in a human-created Mediterranean wetland	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Economic valuation of ecosystem services provides valuable information for the management of anthropized environments, where individual preferences can be heterogeneous and even opposed. Here, we discuss how these ecosystem services were approached in the literature and we address the main issues in relation to their economic valuation. We consider that avoiding misspecifications in economic valuation surveys requires considering the linkages between anthropized ecosystems and human intervention. To illustrate, we analyse the case study of a human-created Mediterranean wetland (El Hondo, SE Spain) using a Choice Experiment. Our findings suggest that management strategies in El Hondo should be oriented to improve the water ecological status, to enhance blodiversity and to develop ecotourism, whereas hunting should be strictly limited and controlled. Our measures of conflict (trade-off between ecosystem services and willingness to pay values) can help to find the optimal allocation of public and private goods and services and for the implementation of compensation schemes in the area. According to public preferences, a conservationist management strategy would generate 331,100 (sic)/year in terms of environmental benefits, whereas a tourism-based management strategy would benefit society with 805,200 (sic)/year.

J	Higashino, M; Stefan, HG				Higashino, Makoto; Stefan, Heinz G.			Oxygen uptake prediction in rivers and streams: A stochastic approach	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Dissolved oxygen fluctuations in a river over a short period of time were assumed to be caused by the microbial growth dynamics, and a stochastic model was built for oxygen uptake. As a case study, biochemical oxygen demand (BUD) was measured in water from the Ura River, Oita River, and Otozu River flowing through the urban district of Oita, Japan. Water samples were taken from each river and partitioned into BOD bottles. BOD was measured in five of these bottles on each of nine days. The experimental results show that the average daily BOD decreased exponentially as expressed by the Streeter-Phelps equation. A wide range of the measured five daily BOD-values was expressed by the difference between the maximum and minimum BOD-values on each day for each river. After the first few days the range became smaller. The proposed stochastic model describes the observed experimental fluctuation of BOD over time. Eighty to ninety percent of the experimental BUD plots are within the 80% probability range given by the model. The uncertainty of BUD prediction can be expressed by the error which is the non-dimensional ratio of the range to the median. Modeled and experimental results reveal that the error is about 0.5-1 (50-100% of expected value) after a few days. This suggests that the BUD predicted by deterministic water quality models can include uncertainty, i.e. the actual BOD can be a quarter or double of the simulated value, for the time scale of a few days. For a longer period, e.g. more than a week, the error can become even more significant. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison of sediment and nutrient export and runoff characteristics from watersheds, with centralized versus distributed stormwater management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Stormwater control measures (SCMs) are used to retain stormwater and pollutants. SCMs have traditionally been installed in a centralized manner using detention to mitigate peak flows. Recently, distributed SCM networks that treat runoff near the source have been increasingly utilized. The aim of this study was to evaluate differences among watersheds that vary in SCM arrangement by assessing differences in baseflow nutrient (NOx-N and PO4-) concentrations and fluxes, stormflow export of suspended sediments and particulate phosphorus (PP), and runoff characteristics. A paired watershed approach was used to compare export between 2004 and 2016 from one forested watershed (For-MD), one suburban watershed with centralized SCMs (Cent-MD), and one suburban watershed with distributed SCMs (Dist-MD). Results indicated baseflow nitrate (NOx-N) concentrations typically exceeded 1 mg-N\L. in all watersheds and were highest in Dist-MD. Over the last 10 years in Dist-MD, nitrate concentrations in both stream baseflow and in a groundwater well declined as land use shifted from agriculture to suburban. Baseflow nitrate export temporarily increased during the construction phase of SCM development in Dist-MD. This temporary pulse of nitrate may be attributed to the conversion of sediment control facilities to SCMs and increased subsurface flushing as infiltration SCMs came on line. During storm flow, Dist-MD tended to have less runoff and lower maximum specific discharge than Cent MD for small events (<1.3 cm), but runoff responses became increasingly similar to Cent-MD with increasing precipitation (>1.3 cm). Mass export estimated during paired storm events indicated Dist-MD exported 30% less sediment and 31% more PP than Cent-MD. For large precipitation events, export of sediment and PP was similar among all three watersheds. Results suggest that distributed SCMs can reduce runoff and sediment loads during small rain events compared to centralized SCMs, but these differences become less evident for large events when peak discharge likely leads to substantial bank erosion.

The city of Jacksonville (Florida), the location for this study, owns the dubious distinction of being ranked among the worst major American cities in water quality according to water quality tests conducted between 2005 and 2009 by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). This report of toxic chemicals in the Jacksonville water supply generated considerable negative publicity and coincides with a frequent and common complaint among residents of foul-smelling water. System revenues from water supply and program subsidies from government are often inadequate in mitigating the problems, perceived or real, with water quality. Therefore, this paper investigates how much residents will be willing to pay for improvements in the quality of tap water. The commonly known economic metric willingness-to-pay (WTP) is applied to estimate any possible rate hikes public utility can assess in any effort to improve real or perceived water quality. The study shows that the estimated weighted average of WTP is $6.22, which can be added to the regular water bill without eliciting much negative reaction from residents. Evidence shows that factors such as trust in authorities, health concerns, family structure, and education significantly impact the WTP.

Shadow prices of emerging pollutants in wastewater treatment plants: Quantification of environmental externalities	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are designed to remove mainly the organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds and suspended solids from wastewater but are not capable of removing chemicals of human origin, such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). The presence of PPCPs in wastewater has environmental effects on the water bodies receiving the WWTP effluents and renders the effluent as unsuitable as a nonconventional water source. Considering PPCPs as non-desirable outputs, the shadow prices methodology has been implemented using the output distance function to measure the environmental benefits of removing five PPCPs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen, carbamazepine and trimethoprim) from WWTP effluents discharged to three different ecosystems (wetland, river and sea). Acetaminophen and ibuprofen show the highest shadow prices of the sample for wetland areas. Their values are 128.2 and 11.0 (sic)/mg respectively. These results represent a proxy in monetary terms of the environmental benefit achieved from avoiding the discharge of these PPCPs in wetlands. These results suggest which PPCPs are urgent to remove from wastewater and which ecosystems are most vulnerable to their presence. The findings of this study will be useful for the plant managers in order to make decisions about prioritization in the removal of different pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Wastewater treatment process includes energy intensive equipment such as pumps and blowers to move and treat wastewater. Presently, a data-driven approach has been applied for aeration process modeling and optimization of one large scale wastewater in Midwest. More specifically, aeration process optimization is carried out with an aim to minimize energy usage without sacrificing water quality. Models developed by data mining algorithms are useful in developing a clear and concise relationship among input and output variables. Results indicate that a great deal of saving in energy can be made while keeping the water quality within limit. Limitation of the work is also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The amounts of tritium released into the environment are kept within the legal requirements, which minimize the noxious effects of radioactivity, but the activity concentration is well measurable in surface water of the recipient. This study compares amount of tritium activity in waste water from nuclear power plants and the tritium activity detected at selected relevant sites of surface water quality monitoring. The situation is assessed in the catchment of the Vltava and Elbe Rivers, affected by the Temelin Nuclear Power Plant as well as in the Jihlava River catchment (the Danube River catchment respectively), where the waste water of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant is discharged. The results show a good agreement of the amount of released tritium stated by the power plant operator and the tritium amount detected in the surface water and highlighted the importance of a robust independent monitoring of tritium discharged from a nuclear power plant which could be carried out by water management authorities. The outputs of independent monitoring allow validating the values reported by a polluter and expand opportunities of using tritium as e.g. tracer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Rapid fluctuations in the northern Baltic Sea H2S layer	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is linked to water quality deterioration in the Baltic Sea, with widespread seafloor hypoxia. We examined the vertical and temporal variability of in situ [H2S], oxygen concentration ([O-2]), temperature (T) and pH at weekly, hourly and minute intervals at 13 locations in the western Gulf of Finland in 2013-2014. The main target was the 60-100 m water depth range, containing 3.2-290 mu M O-2 and 6.3-22.6 mu M H2S. Where gas was detected by acoustic surveys, the structure of the H2S layer was more complex compared to stations devoid of gas. Local minima and maxima in pH frequently occurred near the H2S upper boundary (redox transition zone). Except for the homogeneous, tranquil zone above the seafloor at some stations, substantial rapid changes in hydrographic conditions were common. Typically, a layer of marked temporal T variability was present atop or within the topmost H2S layers. The largest temporal changes over a weekly period were - 0.44 degrees C/-10.8 mu M H2S/-0.12 pH units (at seafloor level), + 0.18 degrees C/+7.9 mu M H2S between casts (1 h) and + 0.03 degrees C/-2.5 mu M H2S per minute (high resolution logging). Abrupt [H2S] changes were recorded at two stations with sediments containing free gas. The T and [H2S] changes were synchronous at several layers, reflecting water movement. We conclude that rapid changes occur in hydrographic conditions in the near-bottom H2S layer in the northern Baltic Sea, especially at locations where free gas is present in the underlying sediments.

Abalones (shell length: 41.39 +/- 2.85 mm, body weight: 8.19 +/- 0.66 g) were cultured at three flow velocities; high-velocity (400 L/h), medium-velocity (300 L/h), and low-velocity (200 L/h) during the course of the experiment. Four repeats of each flow velocity were conducted over an experimental cycle of 90 days. Results showed that the survival and specific growth rate of abalones in the 200 L/h group were significantly lower than in any other group at the end of the experiment, while total ammonia nitrogen and NO2-N concentration in the water was significantly higher than that in any other group (P < 0.05). Food intake, food conversion efficiency, protein content, pepsin, and a-amylase activity of abalones in the 300 L/h group were significantly higher than in the 200 and 400 L/h groups (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference identified between 200 and 400 L/h groups (P > 0.05). Although no significant difference was identified between 300 and 400 L/h groups with respect to cellulase activity or the expression levels of Hdaly, both were significantly higher than in the 200 L/h group (P < 0.05). In the 400 L/h group, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activity, and lactic acid content were significantly higher compared with in the 300 L/h group (P < 0.05). The ash and fat contents of abalones in the 200 L/h group were significantly lower than in any other group, but moisture content was significantly higher (P < 0.05). At Day 90, the expression levels of Hdamyl, Hdlam, and Hdcel in the 300 L/h group were significantly higher than in any other group (P < 0.05), and compared with Day 45, the expression levels of were Hdamyl significantly increased (P < 0.05). Although no significant difference was identified between 200 and 400 L/h groups with respect to the expression levels of Mn-SOD and CAT, both were significantly higher than those in the 300 L/h group (P < 0.05). Therefore, control of flow velocity at 300 L/h will not only stimulate the food intake and growth of abalones, but also reduce energy consumption to resist against water flow impact and avoid oxidative damage due to water quality deterioration. This will be beneficial for abalone health and will improve aquaculture production.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				DEC 1	2017	481						48	57		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.023								WOS:000411453300006

Influence of feeding, periphyton and compost application on the performances of striped grey mullet (Mugil cephalus L.) fingerlings in fertilized brackishwater ponds	AQUACULTURE												To evaluate the effects of different management systems on performances of grey mullet (Mugil cephalus L.) fingerlings, a 120-day experimental trial was conducted in twelve brackishwater ponds (600 m(2) each). Rearing management systems assessed were: fertilization alone (FR), combined fertilization-feeding (FF), fertilizationperiphyton (FP) and fertilization-compost application (FC) in triplicate ponds. Soaked mustard cake was used as a fertilizer @ 100 kg ha-1 at 15-day intervals in all the treatment ponds. Formulated crumble diet containing 29.7% protein and 4.9% lipid was used as a supplementary feed in FF. Bamboo poles were used as substrates (equivalent to 10% of pond surface area) to facilitate periphyton growth in FP and composted aquatic weed was applied @ 500 kg ha(-1) in FC at monthly intervals. Ponds were stocked with grey mullet fry (3.36 +/- 0.32 g/63.70 +/- 4.61 mm) at 30,000 number ha(-1). The experiment revealed significant differences in most of the water quality parameters among the four treatments. In FP ponds, a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous, chlorophyll-a contents, and plankton population was observed. The highest fish growth (28.39 +/- 1.94 g) and survival (94.3 +/- 4.2%) were recorded in FP followed by in FF, FC and FR (P < 0.05). A significantly higher total fish biomass (P < 0.05) was obtained in FP (803 +/- 29 kg ha(-1)) followed by in FF (730 +/- 37), FC (507 +/- 33) and FR (362 +/- 22). Condition factor (K) and isometric exponent (b) of length-weight relationship indicated that fingerlings were in better condition with isometric growth (K=1.37 +/- 0.13; b = 3.01 +/- 0.12) in FP. Inferior condition with allometric growth was observed in FR, FF and FC systems. These results suggest that periphyton based system can be an appropriate rearing technique for grey mullet fingerling production in brackishwater fertilized ponds as an environment-friendly and sustainable practice.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				DEC 1	2017	481						64	71		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.08.026								WOS:000411453300008

Oxidative balance of fish transported for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h in normoxic (NX), moderate hyperoxia (MH), and severe hyperoxia (SH) was evaluated. For this, it was determined the total antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and lipid peroxidation levels (TBARS) in liver, gills, muscle, and brain. After 24 h and, regardless of water quality, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and duration of transport, no mortality occurred for any of the treatments. The antioxidant competence of P. oligospila in the different organs remained high, except for some occasional decrements. Because of this, TBARS concentration remained low in the different organs, irrespective of transport time or initial oxygen concentrations. According to the results, P. oligospila antioxidant system was efficient enough for the prevention and/ or suppression of products derived from lipid peroxidation. Therefore, the oxidative status was not severely affected in the assessed organs over transport time in hyperoxic conditions. Furthermore, Peckoltia oligospila can be safely transported in plastic bags without an extra supply of oxygen for up to 24 h, since survival was not affected.

J	Steinberg, K; Zimmermann, J; Stiller, KT; Meyer, S; Schulz, C				Steinberg, Kathrin; Zimmermann, Jan; Stiller, Kevin Torben; Meyer, Stefan; Schulz, Carsten			The effect of carbon dioxide on growth and energy metabolism in pikeperch (Sander lucioperca)	AQUACULTURE												Pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) is a popular fish for human consumption and decreasing wild catches increase the demand for aquaculture production. Limited knowledge of the species' requirements under intense recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) culture conditions has motivated this study to focus on the effect of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on pikeperch metabolism. The trial was conducted in a recirculating aquaculture respirometer system with pikeperch (average body weight 251.9 g) and three hypercapnia regimes over 58 feeding days. Food grade CO2 gas was gradually added to the medium (15 mg L-1) and high (30 mg L-1) treatments while no gas was added to the low treatment (hence 4 mg L-1). Fish were fed daily for 10 min with a commercial diet (ALLER Metabolica). O-2, T, pH, CO2 were measured individually for each tank and logged every 2 h to calculate oxygen consumption rates of each treatment. Total Ammonia-Nitrogen was measured monthly for individual tanks and used to calculate TAN excretion. Results showed a linear decrease of 6% in final body weight with increasing CO2 levels between the low and the high CO2 treatment. Feed intake was linearly increased after four weeks of the experiment from 0.97 +/- 0.07% in the low CO2 treatment to 0.86 +/- 0.03% in the high CO2 treatment but the effect faded after eight weeks, indicating a habituation to the hypercapnia conditions. High levels of CO2 were associated with reductions in haematocrit and metabolic oxygen consumption. The results suggest that adult pikeperch can survive carbon dioxide concentrations of up to 30 mg L-1 when other water quality parameters are in acceptable levels but will be affected in metabolism already at moderate CO2 levels of 15 mg L-1.

Causes and consequences of spatial links between sea cage aquaculture and coral reefs in Vietnam	AQUACULTURE												A majority of the sea cage farms in South East Asia are located close to coral reefs. This causes a conflict between conservation and food production since sea cage aquaculture has a number of negative impacts on coral reefs. The aim of this investigation was to assess the drivers causing the sea cage farmers to place their farms close to reefs and to examine some potential farming effects in detail i.e. usage of coral reef fish for grow out farming and feed. For some 3500 Vietnamese fish and lobster farms, we measured; the distance to the closest coastal city (proxy for infrastructure access), satellite derived Chl a (proxy for water quality), wind fetch, and the adjacent coastal slope and elevation. We also performed 159 semi-structured interviews with fish and lobster cage farmers from three regions in Vietnam. The interviews revealed that the choice of farming site is mainly determined by access to infrastructure, wind and wave shelter, and water quality. Although the farmers used coral reef services, e.g. coral reef derived seedlings, they were in general not aware of coral reef presence or did not find it important for selection of site. Both coral reefs and sea cage farms were found close to steep rocky coasts, which are favorable for corals, and provide sufficient depth for sea cages. Sea cages were always found on the leeward side of the coast where the wind fetch is low enough for the floating farms and their inhabitants. Most of the farms were located within 20 km from a coastal city confirming the importance of access to infrastructure. With few exceptions, sea cage farms were located in areas with good water quality, where also coral reefs are present. The study showed that several of the coral associated species groups farmed were dependent on wild caught seedlings and that 22% of the feed used at farms was "trashfish" of coral reef associated species. We consider the spatial correlation between sea cage farms and coral reefs as circumstantial and suggest that shared environmental preferences explain the farm distribution pattern, rather than access to ecosystem services provided by the nearby reef itself. We found no evidence that it is necessary for sea cage farms to be located near coral reefs and strongly recommend that sea cages are moved further away from coral reefs, but to areas still providing clear water, shelter and access to infrastructure.

Remote controlled water craft for water measurement	MEASUREMENT												This paper presents a remote controlled water craft and automatic calibrator for water quality parameter measurement. To determine the water condition as temperature, conductance, pH, O-2, NO3- and NH4+ ion concentration were used. All apparatus was placed on our own-design catamaran. The measurements are taken automatically on the craft, transmitted wirelessly to a PC-based control station and saved there in a dedicated database. The drone was built in such a way that it can be easily expanded using new measurement equipment and analysis software. Hence, the modularity and extensibility are important advantages of the catamaran. Using the Modbus based communication protocol enables easy measurement equipment expansion for the end-user. An important aspect in taking the measurements is the calibration of the multiple electrodes. To provide good accuracy, calibration has to be undertaken before each use. Calibration undertaken manually is very time-consuming and inconvenient; that is why the automatic calibration station was built. The proposed hardware and software were created within Project-Based Learning classes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Coal mining industry in the area may influence the water quality evolution. To provide primary characterization of the hydrogeo-chemical processes and paths that control the water quality evolution, a complex multi-layer groundwater system in a coal mining area is investigated. Multivariate statistical methods involving hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) are applied, 6 zones and 3 new principal components are classified as major reaction zones and reaction factors. By integrating HCA and PCA with hydrogeochemical correlations analysis, potential phases, reactions and connections between various zones are presented. Carbonates minerals, gypsum, clay minerals as well as atmosphere gases -CO2, H2O and NH3 are recognized as major reactants. Mixtures, evaporation, dissolution/precipitation of minerals and cation exchange are potential reactions. Inverse modeling is finally used, and it verifies the detailed processes and diverse paths. Consequently, 4 major paths are found controlling the variations of groundwater chemical properties. Shallow and deep groundwater is connected primarily by the flow of deep groundwater up through fractures and faults into the shallow aquifers. Mining does not impact the underlying aquifers that represent the most critical groundwater resource. But controls should be taken to block the mixing processes from highly polluted mine water. The paper highlights the complex hydrogeochemical evolution of a multi-layer groundwater system under mining impact, which could be applied to further groundwater quality management in the study area, as well as most of the other coalfields in North China.

China is currently one of the largest countries to engage in this practice. In this study, a representative mariculture zone, the Weihai coastal area in China, was explored to determine the temporal variations in regional nutrients, N/P ratio, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, chlorophyll a (Chl-a), and cellular abundance of diatoms and dinoflagellates in response to the rapid growth in mariculture activities between 2006 and 2014. The temporal variations in inorganic and organic nitrogen concentrations in the surface water presented significantly increasing trends during August, between 2009 and 2014. A marked increase in the ratios of dinoflagellate to diatom abundance, concurrently with ascending N/P ratios, was also observed during August between 2011 and 2014. In addition, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate variations revealed the highest concentrations during October and lower levels during May and August, which was attributed in part to the seasonal growth characteristics of kelp cultivated in the study area. Moreover, the nutrient concentrations in Sanggou, Rongcheng, Wulei, and Rushan bays were affected significantly by the various cultured organisms in these bays. The intensive mariculture activity in the Weihai coastal area is likely one of the causes of the negative effects on water quality, such as eutrophication and future ocean acidification. The exploration of effective strategies is quite necessary in the future for keeping good quality of coastal environment and sustainable mariculture development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Variation partitioning of benthic diatom community matrices: Effects of multiple variables on benthic diatom communities in an Austral temperate river system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study explores diatom community dynamics in a highly modified semi-arid temperate region river system characterised by inconsistent river flow. Various water and sediment environmental variables were assessed using amulti-faceted analysis approach to determine the spatio-temporal drivers of benthic diatom communities in the river system. Overall, the diatom community was generally dominated by pollution tolerant species, reflecting the anthropogenic intensity and activities on the river system. Diatom community composition was found to be largely determined by water column chemistry variables particularly nutrient concentrations in comparison to sediment chemistry and physical variables. Strong seasonal diatom species composition was also observed and this was driven by strong seasonal variations in nutrient loads and metal concentrations, a result of the variable water flow across the two seasons. However, the greater temporal variation in communities was observed in the smaller systems with the mainstream river system being more homogenous over time. In addition, diatom community composition and environmental variables were found to be different and more pronounced between streams and mainstream sites, than between canals and streams. The study highlights the complex interaction between water column, sediment and physical variables in determining the diatom species composition in small river systems. It also highlights the importance of river flow inconsistency as an indirect variable that alters primary drivers such as nutrient concentrations in the water column and heavy metal levels in the sediment.

Although mortality and immobilisation are the main endpoints used for determination of toxicity, detection of subtle alterations induced by some chemicals particularly at lower levels may require more sensitive biomarkers. As a number of studies indicated that swimming behaviour may be altered by pesticides, nanoparticles, bacterial products or other chemicals, analysis of its various parameters is considered as a novel methodological approach for toxicity assessment and monitoring of water quality.

Dyes can be considered as emergent contaminants and were detected in waters, under the influence of textile activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of 9 azo dyes to the mutagenicity of representative environmental samples. Samples were collected along one year in the largest conglomerate of textile industries of Brazil. We analyzed water samples from an important water body, Piracicaba River, upstreamand downstreamtwo main discharges, the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and the tributary Quilombo River, which receives untreated effluent from local industries. Samples were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS and tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay with TA98 and YG1041. Six dyes were detected in the collected samples, Disperse Blue 291, Disperse Blue 373, Disperse Orange 30, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Violet 93, and Disperse Yellow 3. The most sensitive condition for the detection of the mutagenicity was the strain YG1041 with S9. The concentration of dyes and mutagenicity levels varied along time and the dry season represented the worst condition. Disperse Blue 373 and Disperse Violet 93were the major contributors to the mutagenicity. Weconclude that dyes are contributing for the mutagenicity of Piracicaba River water; and both discharges, WWTP effluent and Quilombo River, increase themutagenicity of Piracicaba Riverwaters in about 10-fold. The combination of chemical analysis and bioassays were key in the identification the main drivers of the water mutagenicity and allows the selection of priority compounds to be included inmonitoring programs aswell for the enforcing actions required to protect the water quality for multiple uses.

J	Zafra, C; Temprano, J; Suarez, J				Zafra, Carlos; Temprano, Javier; Suarez, Joaquin			A simplified method for determining potential heavy metal loads washed-off by stormwater runoff from road-deposited sediments	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A simplified method is proposed for determining the potential load of heavy metals (HMs) derived from the wash-off caused by surface runoff on road-deposited sediment (RDS). The method consists of three phases: (i) characterization of RDS load wash-off, (ii) assessment of HM load in dry weather, and (iii) application of a wash-off equation. Two processes were included in the wash-off equation: HM transport (solid fraction) and HM leaching (dissolved fraction). The average wash-off of HMs ranges from 16.6 to 46.3%, relative to the total mass ofHMs associatedwith dry-weather RDS (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Cd, Fe, Mn, Co, and Ba). Cd, Mn, and Zn presented the highest wash-off in the areas studied. The size fraction below 250 mu m contributed an average of 86.7% of potential HMload washed-off fromRDS. Based on the phenomena included in the wash-off equation, it was observed the following order of precedence: transport of RDS b 250 mu m, leaching of RDS < 250 mu m, and leaching of RDS >= 250 mu m. Solid and dissolved fractions contributed 70.7 and 29.3% of the potential HM load washed-off by runoff from RDS, respectively. The proposed method serves as a management tool for road HM pollution during rain. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Vrebos, D; Beauchard, O; Meire, P				Vrebos, Dirk; Beauchard, Olivier; Meire, Patrick			The impact of land use and spatial mediated processes on the water quality in a river system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												River systems are highly complex, hierarchical and patchy systems which are greatly influenced by both catchment surroundings and in-stream processes. Natural and anthropogenic land uses and processes affect water quality (WQ) through different pathways and scales. Understanding under which conditions these different river and catchment properties become dominant towards water chemistry remains a challenge. In this study we analyzed the impact of land use and spatial scales on a range of WQ variables within the Kleine Nete catchment in Belgium. Multivariate statistics and spatial descriptors (Moran's and Asymmetric Eigenvector Maps) were used to assess changes in water chemistry throughout the catchment. Both land use and complex mixes of spatial descriptors of different scales were found to be significantly associated to WQ parameters. However, unidirectional, upstream-downstream changes in water chemistry, often described in river systems, were not found within the Kleine Nete catchment. As different sources and processes obscure and interact with each other, it is generally difficult to understand the correct impact of different pollution sources and the predominant pathways. Our results advocate for WQ management interventions on large and small scales where needed, taking the predominate pathways in to account. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

On the other hand, increase of nutrients due to land based sources has led to eutrophication problems in the area. The sub surface water layer of Mediterranean origin is oxygen depleted (saturation < 30%) and rich in nutrients. Higher oxygen values indicated water mixing of the Sea of Marmara during winter 2012. Ammonium was the predominant form of inorganic nitrogen. The study area has been classified from Moderate to Bad trophic status. Izmit Bay also faced serious eutrophication problems together with hypoxic conditions below the halocline. Nutrient fluxes through the TSS showed temporal variation in the upper and lower layers related to changes in both nutrient concentrations and the water mass volume fluxes. Surface nitrates and phosphates outflux from the Sea of Marmara to the Aegean Sea was higher than the influx from the Black Sea through Bosporus strait, indicating high enrichment of nutrients in the Sea of Marmara from anthropogenic sources.

Estimates of water and solute release from a coal waste rock dump in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Long term (1999 to 2014) flow and water quality data from a rock drain located at the base of a coal waste rock dump constructed in the Elk Valley, British Columbia was used to characterize the release of three solutes (NO3-, Cl-and SO42-) from the dump and obtain whole dump estimates of net percolation (NP). The concentrations of dump derived solutes in the rock drain water were diluted by snowmelt waters from the adjacent natural watershed during the spring freshet and reached a maximum concentration during the winter baseflow period. Historical peak baseflow concentrations of conservative ions (NO3- and Cl-) increased until 2006/07 after which they decreased. This decrease was attributed to completion of the flushing of the first pore volume of water stored within the dump. The baseflow SO42- concentrations increased proportionally with NO3- and Cl- to 2007, but then continued to slowly increase as NO3- and Cl-concentrations decreased. This was attributed to ongoing production of SO42- due to oxidation of sulfide minerals within the dump. Based on partitioning of the annual volume of water discharged from the rock drain to waste rock effluent (NP) and water entering the rock drain laterally from the natural watershed, the mean NP values were estimated to be 446 +/- 50 mm/a (area normalized net per-colation/year) for the dump and 172 +/- 71 mm/a for the natural watershed. The difference was attributed to greater rates of recharge in the dump from summer precipitation compared to the natural watershed where rainfall interception and enhanced evapotranspiration will increase water losses. These estimates included water moving through subsurface pathways. However, given the limitations in quantifying these flows the estimated NP rates for both the natural watershed and the waste rock dump are considered to be low, and could be much higher (e.g. similar to 450 mm/a and similar to 800 mm/a).

J	Liu, YZ; Engel, BA; Flanagan, DC; Gitau, MW; McMillan, SK; Chaubey, I				Liu, Yaoze; Engel, Bernard A.; Flanagan, Dennis C.; Gitau, Margaret W.; McMillan, Sara K.; Chaubey, Indrajeet			A review on effectiveness of best management practices in improving hydrology and water quality: Needs and opportunities	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Best management practices (BMPs) have been widely used to address hydrology and water quality issues in both agricultural and urban areas. Increasing numbers of BMPs have been studied in research projects and implemented in watershed management projects, but a gap remains in quantifying their effectiveness through time. In this paper, we review the current knowledge about BMP efficiencies, which indicates that most empirical studies have focused on short-term efficiencies, while few have explored long-term efficiencies. Most simulation efforts that consider BMPs assume constant performance irrespective of ages of the practices, generally based on anticipated maintenance activities or the expected performance over the life of the BMP(s). However, efficiencies of BMPs likely change over time irrespective of maintenance due to factors such as degradation of structures and accumulation of pollutants. Generally, the impacts of BMPs implemented in water quality protection programs at watershed levels have not been as rapid or large as expected, possibly due to overly high expectations for practice long-term efficiency, with BMPs even being sources of pollutants under some conditions and during some time periods. The review of available datasets reveals that current data are limited regarding both short-term and long-term BMP efficiency. Based on this review, this paper provides suggestions regarding needs and opportunities. Existing practice efficiency data need to be compiled. New data on BMP efficiencies that consider important factors, such as maintenance activities, also need to be collected. Then, the existing and new data need to be analyzed. Further research is needed to create a framework, as well as modeling approaches built on the framework, to simulate changes in BMP efficiencies with time. The research community needs to work together in addressing these needs and opportunities, which will assist decision makers in formulating better decisions regarding BMP implementation in watershed management projects.

In this study, groundwater uptake on a peninsula where only one aquifer system-the Cambrian-Vendian (Cm-V) - is available for drinking water uptake is observed for a period of four years for relevant radionuclides and chemical parameters (Cl, Mn, Fe, delta O-18). Intensive groundwater uptake from the Cm-V aquifer system may lead to water inflow either from the sea, through ancient buried valleys or from the under-laying crystalline basement rock which is rich in natural radionuclides. Changes in the geochemical conditions in the aquifer may in turn bring about desorption of Ra from sediment surface. Knowing the hydrogeological background of the wells helps to predict possible changes in water quality which in turn are important for sustainable groundwater management and optimization of water treatment processes. Changes in Cl and Ra concentrations are critical parameters to monitor for sustainable management of the Cm-V groundwater. Radionuclide activity concentrations in groundwater are often considered rather stable, minimum monitoring frequency of the total indicative dose from drinking water is set at once every ten years. The present study demonstrates that this is not sufficient for ensuring stable drinking water quality in case of aquifer systems as sensitive as the Cm-V aquifer system. Changes in Cl concentrations can be used as a tool to predict Ra activity concentrations and distribute the production between different wells opening to the same aquifer system.

J	Lin, L; Jiang, WB; Xu, P				Lin, Lu; Jiang, Wenbin; Xu, Pei			Comparative study on pharmaceuticals adsorption in reclaimed water desalination concentrate using biochar: Impact of salts and organic matter	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The synergistic impact of salts and organic matter on adsorption of ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole by three types of biochar and an activated carbon was investigated using reclaimed water reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate and synthetic solutions spiked with target organic compounds and non-target water constituents (e.g., Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Cl-, SO42-, alkalinity, humic acid (HA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA)). Kinetic modeling was used to better understand the adsorption process between the carbon adsorbents and pharmaceuticals and to elucidate the impact of water chemistry on pharmaceuticals adsorption. The adsorption capacity of pharmaceuticals by biochar was affected by their physicochemical properties including ash content, specific surface area, charge, pore volume, as well as hydrophobicity, pi-energy, and speciation of pharmaceuticals. The adsorption of pharmaceuticals in concentrate was pH-dependent, the kinetic rate constant increased with deceasing pH due to the electrical interactions between pharmaceutical molecules and adsorbents. High salinity and electrolyte ions in RO concentrate improved adsorption, whereas the presence of carbonate species, HA, and BSA hindered the removal of ibuprofen and sulfamethoxazole. This study revealed the correlation of concentrate water quality on adsorption of pharmaceuticals by biochar and activated carbon. Biochar provides a promising alternative to activated carbon for removal of organic contaminants of emerging concerns in various wastewater and concentrate streams. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Lessons learned from Khartoum flash flood impacts: An integrated assessment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study aims at enabling the compilation of key lessons for decision makers and urban planners in rapidly urbanizing cities regarding the identification of representative, chief causal natural and human factors for the increased level of flash flood risk. To achieve this, the impacts of flash flood events of 2013 and 2014 in the capital of Sudan, Khartoum, were assessed using seven integrated approaches, i.e. rainfall data analysis, document analysis of affected people and houses, observational fieldwork in the worst flood affected areas, people's perception of causes and mitigation measures through household interviews, reported drinking water quality, reported water-related diseases and social risk assessment. Several lessons have been developed as follows. Urban planners must recognize the devastating risks of building within natural pathways of ephemeral watercourses. They must also ensure effective drainage infrastructures and physio-geographical investigations prior to developing urban areas. The existing urban drainage systems become ineffective due to blockage by urban waste. Building of unauthorized drainage and embankment structures by locals often cause greater flood problems than normal. The urban runoff is especially problematic for residential areas built within low-lying areas having naturally low infiltration capacity, as surface water can rapidly collect within hollows and depressions, or beside elevated roads that preclude the free flow of floodwater. Weak housing and infrastructure quality are especially vulnerable to flash flooding and even to rainfall directly. Establishment of services infrastructure is imperative for flash flood disaster risk reduction. Water supply should be from lower aquifers to avoid contaminant ground water. Regular monitoring of water quality and archiving of its indicators help identify water-related diseases and sources of water contamination in the event of environmental disasters such as floods. Though the understanding of risk perception by the locals is an important aspect of the decision making and planning processes, it should be advanced enough for proper awareness.

Integrative assessment of river damming impacts on aquatic fauna in a Portuguese reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The impacts of river damming on aquatic fauna are assessed and then integrated across hierarchical scales, portrayed as nested circles. The outer circles characterize the studied site for habitat disturbance and hydrologic regimeduring the construction and filling phases. The inner circles characterize the construction and filling phase zones for water quality parameters and aquatic fauna. The procedure for integrating the impacts comprises two consecutive stages: in the task stage, inner circles are characterized through field and laboratory work involving sampling and analyses of water aliquots and aquatic fauna; in the impact assessment stage, circle data are processed in ecological and statistical algorithms, which allow identification of changes in abundance and composition of aquatic fauna communities and their integration with changes in water quality parameters across the construction and filling phase zones. The integrative assessment of river damming impacts on aquatic fauna was carried out in the Sabor River dam (Portugal). This dam created two reservoirs: primary and secondary. Changes in water quality caused by dam construction and stream water impoundment were significant, marked by increases in temperature and electric conductivity downstream, accumulation of phosphorus and nitrogen in the reservoirs triggering the growth of algae and the increase of chlorophyll a, and drop of transparency. These changes were aggravated in the secondary reservoir. The consequences of water deterioration for aquatic fauna were severe, marked by abrupt declines of native fish species and invasion of exotic species even upwards the reservoirs. The ecological status determined from ecological quality ratios of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were also affected, changing from good-fair in the unaffected watercourses to fair-poor in the lakes.

However, the interplay between community and biogeochemical responses under different flow regimes in streams is less understood. In this study, we investigated the structural and functional responses of periphyton and macroinvertebrates to different densities of the Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis, Cyprinidae) in two stream reaches differing in flow regime. The study was conducted in Lemena Stream, a small calcareous Mediterranean stream with high nutrient levels. We selected a reach with permanent flow(permanent reach) and another subjected to flow regulation (regulated reach) with periods of flow intermittency. At each reach, we used in situ cages to generate 3 levels of fish density. Cages with 10 barbels were used to simulate high fish density (> 7 ind m(-2)); cages with open sides were used as controls (i.e. exposed to actual fish densities of each stream reach) thus having low fish density; and those with no fish were used to simulate the disappearance of fish that occurs with stream drying. Differences in fish density did not cause significant changes in periphyton bio-mass and macroinvertebrate density. However, phosphate uptake by periphyton was enhanced in treatments lacking fish in the regulated reach with intermittent flow but not in the permanent reach, suggesting that hydrologic alteration hampers the ability of biotic communities to compensate for the absence of fish. This study indicates that fish density can mediate the effects of anthropogenic alterations such as flow intermittence derived from hydrologic regulation on stream benthic communities and associated biogeochemical processes, at least in eutrophic streams.

Optimal implementation of green infrastructure practices to minimize influences of land use change and climate change on hydrology and water quality: Case study in Spy Run Creek watershed, Indiana	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Nutrient loading from the Maumee River watershed is a significant reason for the harmful algal blooms (HABs) problem in Lake Erie. The nutrient loading from urban areas needs to be reduced with the installation of green infrastructure (GI) practices. The Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment-Low Impact Development 2.1 (L-THIA-LID 2.1) model was used to explore the influences of land use (LU) and climate change on water quantity and quality in Spy Run Creek watershed (SRCW) (part of Maumee River watershed), decide whether and where excess phosphorus loading existed, identify critical areas to understand where the greatest amount of runoff/pollutants originated, and optimally implement GI practices to obtain maximum environmental benefits with the lowest costs. Both LU/climate changes increased runoff/pollutants generated from the watershed. Areas with the highest runoff/pollutant amount per area, or critical areas, differed for various environmental concerns, land uses (LUs), and climates. Compared to optimization considering all areas, optimization conducted only in critical areas can provide similar cost-effective results with decreased computational time for low levels of runoff/pollutant reductions, but critical area optimization results were not as cost-effective for higher levels of runoff/pollutant reductions. Runoff/pollutants for 2011/2050 LUs/climates could be reduced to amounts of 2001 LU/climate by installation of GI practices with annual expenditures of $0.34 to $2.05 million. The optimization scenarios that were able to obtain the 2001 runoff level in 2011/2050, can also reduce all pollutants to 2001 levels in this watershed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sensitivity of the glochidia (larvae) of freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionida: Hyriidae) to cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, nickel and zinc: Differences between metals, species and exposure time	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionida) are among the most threatened freshwater faunal groups worldwide. Metal contamination is one threat that has been linked to declining mussel population distribution and abundance. This study determined the sensitivity (valve closure) of the glochidia (larvae) of six species of Australian freshwater mussels to cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn), keymetal contaminants impacting urbanized coastal rivers in south-eastern Australia (home to similar to 50% of the population), in a soft reconstituted freshwater (hardness 42 mg CaCO3 L-1; alkalinity 22 mg CaCO3 L-1 and pH 7.0) over 72 h. The sensitivity of each mussel species to each metal increased 2.5-fold with increasing exposure time from 24 to 72 h. The most sensitive mussel species (Cucumerunio novaehollandiae), across all metals and exposure times, was similar to 60% more sensitive than the least sensitive species (Velesunio ambiguus). The relative sensitivity of glochidia to the six selected metals, across all mussel species and exposure times, was: Cu > Cd > Pb > Co = Ni > Zn. Glochidia were most sensitive to Cu and least sensitive to Zn. Quantitatively, the toxicity of Cu was 3-fold more than Cd, 8-fold more than Pb, 14-fold more than Co or Ni and 16-fold more than Zn. The cell surface binding affinities (conditional log K values) of Cd (range 6.65-6.94), Co (6.04-6.29), Cu (7.17-7.46), Ni (6.02-6.29), Pb (6.24-6.53) or Zn (5.96-6.23), pooled for all mussel species after 72 h exposure, were positively related to metal sensitivity. The chronic no effect concentrations (NECs) of Cu, Ni and Zn were below (i.e. glochidia were more sensitive than) their national freshwater guideline values, indicating that freshwater mussels may not be adequately protected for these metals in urbanized coastal rivers within south-eastern Australia.

Private-well stewardship among a general population based sample of private well-owners	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Private well stewardship, including on-going testing and treatment, can ensure private well users are able to maintain source-water quality and prevent exposures to potentially harmful constituents in primary drinking water supplies. Unlike municipal water supplies, private well users are largely responsible for their own testing and treatment and well stewardship is often minimal. The importance of factors influencing regular testing, and treatment behaviors, including knowledge, risk perception, convenience and social norms, can vary by geography and population characteristics. The primary goals of this study were to survey a general statewide population of private well users in Wisconsin in order to quantify testing and treatment patterns and gather data on motivations and barriers to well stewardship. The majority of respondents reported using and drinking well water daily but only about one half of respondents reported testing their wells in the last ten years and of these, only 10% reported testing in the last 12 months. Bacteria and nitrates were contaminants most often tested; and, a private laboratory most often conducted testing. The most commonly reported water treatment was a water softener. Living in a particular geographic region and income were the most significant predictors of water testing and treatment. Iron and hardness, which influence water aesthetics but not always safety, were the most commonly reported water quality problems. Health concerns or perceived lack thereof were, respectively, motivators and barriers to testing and treatment. Limited knowledge of testing and treatment options were also identified as barriers. Results confirm previous findings that well stewardship practices are minimal and often context specific. Understanding the target population's perceptions of risk and knowledge are important elements to consider in identifying vulnerable populations and developing education and policy efforts to improve well stewardship.

J	Ji, NN; Wang, SR; Zhang, L				Ji, Ningning; Wang, Shengrui; Zhang, Li			Characteristics of dissolved organic phosphorus inputs to freshwater lakes: A case study of Lake Erhai, southwest China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this study, we made the first estimate of the annual dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) load to Lake Erhai, a typical mesotrophic-eutrophic lake in China. We also evaluated what proportion of DOP was bioavailable using enzymatically hydrolyzable phosphorus (EHP), and further assessed the potential impacts of DOP on lake water quality. We estimated that the annual DOP load into Lake Erhai accounted for nearly 50% of total dissolved phosphorus, while EHP accounted for about 30% of the bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) pool. The DOP load increased and accounted for a greater proportion of total dissolved phosphorus and BAP loads during the wet season, and helped maintain algal blooms. Inflowing rivers were the main source of DOP with high bioavailability to Lake Erhai, especially in the wet season. The EHP concentrations of the inflowing rivers were positively correlated with algal biomass. The observation suggests that, as a significant source of BAP, the contribution of the DOP load to eutrophication of the lake should not be ignored, especially given the low soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations in the lake water during the algal biomass period. Information on the contributions from different pollution sources is needed to support the development of effective P pollution control strategies. Short-term strategies to protect Lake Erhai include better management of the inflowing rivers, especially in the northern part during the wet season, while, over the long-term, strategies to decrease P release from lake sediments should be considered.

Projected impact of climate change and chemical emissions on the water quality of the European rivers Rhine and Meuse: A drinking water perspective	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Low river discharges of the rivers Rhine and Meuse are expected to occur more often and more prolonged in a changing climate. During these dry periods the dilution of point sources such as sewage effluents is reduced leading to a decline in chemical water quality. This study projects chemical water quality of the rivers Rhine and Meuse in the year 2050, based on projections of chemical emissions and two climate scenarios: moderate and fast climate change. It focuses on specific compounds known to be relevant to drinking water production, i.e. four pharmaceuticals, a herbicide and its metabolite and an artificial sweetener. Hydrological variability, climate change, and increased emission show a significant influence on the water quality in the Rhine and Meuse. The combined effect of changing future emissions of these compounds and reduced dilution due to climate change has leaded to increasing ( peak) concentrations in the river water by a factor of two to four. Current water treatment efficiencies in the Netherlands are not sufficient to reduce these projected concentrations in drinking water produced from surface water below precautionary water target values. If future emissions are not sufficiently reduced or treatment efficiencies are not improved, these compounds will increasingly be found in drinking water, albeit at levels which pose no threat to human health.

J	Rodriguez-Castillo, T; Barquin, J; Alvarez-Cabria, M; Penas, FJ; Alvarez, C				Rodriguez-Castillo, Tamara; Barquin, Jose; Alvarez-Cabria, Mario; Penas, Francisco J.; Alvarez, Cesar			Effects of sewage effluents and seasonal changes on the metabolism of three Atlantic rivers	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Sewage inputs on fluvial ecosystems affect benthic communities and alter trophic networks resulting in changes on river functioning. Functional indicators (e.g. river metabolism) have been proposed as a valuable tool to evaluate ecosystem impairment. In the present study we monitored river metabolism in spring (few days after a major flood) and in summer (after 35 days of low flow conditions) using both single-station and two-stations methods over a 24 h period up and downstream of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents on three Atlantic river reaches located in northern Spain (Europe). Concurrently with river metabolism, we characterized environmental characteristics (flow, velocity, depth, pH, water temperature, nutrients, etc.), benthic macroinvertebrate communities and biofilm (algae and epilithic biomass). Ecosystem Respiration (ER24) was similar at the different periods and locations, but Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) tended to decrease in impacted reaches (downstream WWTPs) and in summer (except in the Saja River). However, the balance of the metabolic processes showed a trend towards autotrophy in the largest river, while WWTP effluents increased its autotrophy. Chlorophyll a concentration was >4 times larger in spring than in summer in all river reaches, while epilithic biomass followed a similar but less obvious pattern. Increase of invertebrate scraper densities (mainly, Potamopyrgus antipodarum) seems to be a plausible explanation for biofilm biomass temporal patterns in all sites (higher in spring than in summer), altering GPP and ER24 patterns. Thus, metabolism rates show different responses to WWTP effluents depending on season and on the relationships among functional and structural components, with special focus on the composition and structure of macroinvertebrate communities.

The degree of phosphorus saturation of agricultural soils in Germany: Current and future risk of diffuse P loss and implications for soil P management in Europe	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Decades of intensive agricultural production with excessive application of P fertilizer have resulted in the accumulation of P in soils, threatening water bodies in most industrialized countries with eutrophication. In our study, we elucidated the risk of P loss of German agricultural soils by transforming provided monitoring data of plant-available P determined by the calcium-acetate-lactate (PCAL) and double-lactate method (PDL) into the degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS). As water-soluble phosphorus (WSP) is correlated to DPS, we derived a pedotransfer function (PTF) between PCAL and WSP for different soil types. Considering all soils together resulted in WSP = 0.1918 x PCAL (R-2 = 0.80, n = 54). Subsequently, risk parameters DPS and EPC0 were calculated from PCAL and PDL monitoring data (n > 337,000) by using the determined PTF and soil type-independent correlations with WSP, as published in an earlier study. Calculated DPS values from monitoring data indicated high risks of dissolved P loss for >76% of German arable soils. Recent suggestions by the Association of German Agricultural Analytical and Research Institutes (VDLUFA) to reduce recommended PCAL levels are crucial for the reduction of P loss risks in the future. The accuracy of predicted DPS and EPC0 values by CAL and other methods used in Europe to estimate plant-available P is limited by the soil type-dependency of these methods. Consequently, we recommend considering WSP as an agri-environmental soil P test across Europe. Our results indicate that a WSP level in soils can be defined that constitutes a reasonable compromise between the securing of agronomic production and the fulfillment of environmental goals.

Yet, predicting the responses of macroinvertebrates to these stressors combination is quite challenging due to the reduced available information, especially if biotic and abiotic seasonal variations are taken under consideration. This study focused on the response of macroinvertebrates by drift to single and combined effects of water scarcity and dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion over two seasons (winter and spring). A factorial design of two flow velocity levels - regular and low (vL) - with three levels of oxygen depletion - normoxia, medium depletion (dM) and higher depletion (dH) - was carried out in a 5-artificial channels system, in short-term experiments. Results showed that both stressors individually and together had a significant effect on macroinvertebrate drift ratio for both seasons. Single stressor effects showed that macroinvertebrate drift decreased with flow velocity reduction and increased with DO depletion, in both winter and spring experiments. Despite single stressors opposing effects in drift ratio, combined stressors interaction (vL x dM and vL x dH) induced a positive synergistic drift effect for both seasons, but only in winter the drift ratio was different between the levels of DO depletion. Stressors interaction in winter seemed to intensify drift response when reached lower oxygen saturation. Also, drift patterns were different between seasons for all treatments, which may depend on individual's life stage and seasonal behaviour. Water scarcity seems to exacerbate the oxygen depletion conditions resulting into a greater drifting of invertebrates. The potential effects of oxygen depletion should be evaluated when addressing the impacts of water scarcity on river ecosystems, since flow reductions will likely contribute to a higher oxygen deficit, particularly in Mediterranean rivers.

While plot scale experiments have focused on mobilisation processes, many catchment scale studies have hitherto concentrated on the controls of dominant flow pathways on nutrient delivery. To place mobilisation and delivery at a catchment scale, this study investigated their relative influence on contrasting nitrate-N and soluble P concentrations and N:P ratios in two shallow groundwater fed catchments with different land use (grassland and arable) on the Atlantic seaboard of Europe. Detailed datasets of N and P inputs, concentrations in shallow groundwater and concentrations in receiving streams were analysed over a five year period (October 2010-September 2015). Results showed that nitrate-N and soluble P concentrations in shallow groundwater give a good indication of stream concentrations, which suggests a dominant control of mobilisation processes on stream exports. Near-stream attenuation of nitrate-N ( 30%), likely through denitrification and"dilution, and enrichment in soluble P (+ 100%), through soil-groundwater interactions, were similar in both catchments. The soil, climate and land use controls on mobilisation were also investigated. Results showed that grassland tended to limit nitrate-N leaching as compared to arable land, but grassland could also contribute to increased P solubilisation. In the context of land use change in these groundwater fed systems, the risk of pollution swapping between N and P must be carefully considered, particularly for interactions of land use with soil chemistry and climate.

Groundwater quality in the alluvial aquifer system of northwest India: New evidence of the extent of anthropogenic and geogenic contamination	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Groundwater depletion has been widely studied in northwest India, but water quality concerns are still poorly constrained. In this study, we explore the hydrochemistry of the top 160 m of the aquifer system, through detailed field studies in the Bist-Doab region, considering both anthropogenic and geogenic controls. A detailed comparison is made between sites dominated by urban and agricultural landuse. Salinity, nitrate, chloride and lead concentrations are significantly higher in the shallow (0-50 m) groundwater system due to surface anthropogenic contaminant loading from agricultural and urban sources. The widespread occurrence of oxic groundwater within the aquifer system means that denitrification potential is limited and also enhances the mobility of selenium and uranium in groundwater. Geogenic trace elements (e.g. As, Se, F), are generally found at concentrations below WHO guideline drinking water values, however elevated U concentrations (50-70 mu g/L) are found within the deeper part of the aquifer and shallow urban aquifers associated with higher bicarbonate waters. Higher concentration of Se (10-40 mu g/L) are found exclusively in the shallow groundwater system where Se is mobilised from soils and transported to depth in the shallow aquifer due to the prevailing Oxidising aquifer conditions. New evidence from a range of environmental tracers shows elevated concentrations of anthropogenic contaminants in the deeper part of the aquifer (50-160 m deep) and demonstrates vulnerability to vertical migration of contaminants. Continued intensive groundwater abstraction. from >100 m deep means that water quality risks to the deep aquifer system need to be considered together with water quantity constraints.

J	Abraham, J; Dowling, K; Florentine, S				Abraham, Joji; Dowling, Kim; Florentine, Singarayer			Risk of post-fire metal mobilization into surface water resources: A review	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												One of the significant economic benefits to communities around the world of having pristine forest catchments is the supply of substantial quantities of high quality potable water. This supports a saving of around US$ 4.1 trillion per year globally by limiting the cost of expensive drinking water treatments and provision of unnecessary infrastructure. Even low levels of contaminants specifically organics and metals in catchments when in a mobile state can reduce these economic benefits by seriously affecting the water quality. Contamination and contaminant mobility can occur through natural and anthropogenic activities including forest fires. Moderate to high intensity forest fires are able to alter soil properties and release sequestered metals from sediments, soil organic matter and fragments of vegetation. In addition, the increase in post-fire erosion rate by rainfall runoff and strong winds facilitates the rapid transport of these metals downslope and downstream. The subsequent metal deposition in distal soil and water bodies can influence surface water quality with potential impacts to the larger ecosystems inclusive of negative effects on humans. This is of substantial concern as 4 billion hectares of forest catchments provide high quality water to global communities. Redressing this problem requires quantification of the potential effects on water resources and instituting rigorous fire and environmental management plans to mitigate deleterious effects on catchment areas. This paper is a review of the current state of,the art literature dealing with the risk of post-fire mobilization of the metals into surface water resources. It is intended to inform discussion on the preparation of suitable management plans and policies during and after fire events in order to maintain potable water quality in a cost-effective manner. In these times of climate fluctuation and increased incidence of fires, the need for development of new policies and management frameworks are of heighted significance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, to what extent the public can identify specific environmental problems and whether people are ready to cope with potential risks is to a great extent unknown. Public environmental awareness of factors underpinning the pollution of rivers and approaches for reducing it were studied in Rasht City of Guilan Province in northern Iran, with Zarjub and Goharrud rivers as a case study. Data were collected from residents on the banks of the studied rivers using a questionnaire. Industrial areas, hospitals, and poultry farms were perceived as the main factors deteriorating water pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers in Guilan Province. The discharge of urban sewage into the rivers was the second most important polluting factor. Most residents on the banks of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers showed high interest in the conservation of the environment. Overall, 62.7% of the residents had moderate, 20% had high, and 4% had very high environmental awareness. Families and mass media (TV and radio) were perceived of being the most important sources of information of family members concerning environmental awareness. According to the residents, the main approach for alleviating the pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers were creating green spaces, dredging the rivers, establishing a water purifying system, and establishing a waste incinerator with a separation system (based on municipal planning). The public in the study area appeared well prepared to cope with the risks of water pollution, but further improving environmental awareness of the community can be a first step for preventing environmental degradation. The positive attitudes of the residents towards environmental conservation, the use of proper information sources, and practical training in the context of extension services can be effective in conserving water resources in urban areas.

Influence of land development on stormwater runoff from a mixed land use and land cover catchment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Mitigating for the negative impacts of stormwater runoff is becoming a concern due to increased land development. Understanding how land development influences stormwater runoff is essential for sustainably managing water resources. In recent years, aggregate low impact development-best management practices (LID-BMPs) have been implemented to reduce the negative impacts of stormwater runoff on receiving water bodies. This study used an integrated approach to determine the influence of land development and assess the ecological benefits of four aggregate LID-BMPs in stormwater runoff from a mixed land use and land cover (LULC) catchment with ongoing land development. It used data from 2011 to 2015 that monitored 41 storm events and monthly LULC, and a Personalized Computer Storm Water Management Model (PCSWMM). The four aggregate LID-BMPs are: ecological (S1), utilizing pervious covers (S2), and multi-control (S3) and (S4). These LID-BMPs were designed and distributed in the study area based on catchment characteristics, cost, and effectiveness. PCSWMM was used to simulate the monitored storm events from 2014 (calibration: R-2 and NSE > 0.5; RMSE <11) and 2015 (validation: R2 and NSE > 0.5; RMSE <12). For continuous simulation and analyzing LID-BMPs scenarios, the five-year (2011 to 2015) stormwater runoff data and LULC change patterns (only 2015 for LID-BMPs) were used. Results show that the expansion of bare land and impervious cover, soil alteration, and high amount of precipitation influenced the stormwater runoff variability during different phases of land development. The four aggregate LID-BMPs reduced runoff volume (34%61%), peak flow (6%-19%), and pollutant concentrations (53%-83%). The results of this study, in addition to supporting local LULC planning and land development activities, also could be applied to input data for empirical modeling, and designing sustainable stormwater management guidelines and monitoring strategies.

We developed a novel data analysis approach, using self-organizing maps and non-linear projection methods, to approximate the TCC dynamics using the multivariate data sets of abiotic parameter time-series, thus providing a method that could be implemented in an online water quality management system for water suppliers. The (TCC) data, obtained over several months, provided a good basis to study the microbiological dynamics in detail. Alongside the TCC measurements, online abiotic parameter time-series, including spring discharge, turbidity, spectral absorption coefficient at 254 nm (SAC254) and electrical conductivity, were obtained. High-density sampling over an extended period of time, i.e. every 45 min for 3 months, allowed a detailed analysis of the dynamics in karst spring water quality. Substantial increases in both the TCC and the abiotic parameters followed precipitation events in the catchment area. Differences between the parameter fluctuations were only apparent when analyzed at a high temporal scale. Spring discharge was always the first to react to precipitation events in the catchment area. Lag times between the onset of precipitation and a change in discharge varied between 0.2 and 6.7 h, depending on the spring and event. TCC mostly reacted second or approximately concurrent with turbidity and SAC254, whereby the fastest observed reaction in the TCC time series occurred after 2.3 h. The methodological approach described here enables a better understanding of bacterial dynamics in karst springs, which can be used to estimate risks and management options to avoid contamination of the drinking water.

Effects of inequality of supply hours on consumers' coping strategies and perceptions of intermittent water supply in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												To investigate the effects of unequal supply hours on consumers' coping strategies and perceptions of the intermittent water supply (IWS) in the Kathmandu Valley (KV), Nepal we conducted a randomized household survey (n = 369) and on-site water quality tests. Half of the households received piped water for 6 or fewer hours per week. To augment or cope with the inadequate supply, 28% of the households used highly contaminated and expensive tanker-delivered water. Half of the piped water samples (n = 13) were contaminated with Escherichia coli. Free chlorine concentration in all piped water samples was below the national standards (0.1-0.2 mg/L), but combined chlorine was detected at an average of 0.24 mg/L, indicating ingression of contaminants in the network. Point-of-use devices could increase access to safe water in the KV from 42% to 80%. The use of Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients revealed inequality of piped water supply hours per week both between and within service areas in the IN, due mainly to a small percentage of households who receive longer supply hours. To cope with reduced supply hours, home owners pay more to get water from alternative sources, while tenants compromise their water consumption. Under IWS, expectations for improvements in piped water quality and supply regularity are higher than those for supply volume. Consumers' perceptions of the piped water services worsen with the reduction in supply hours, but perceptions of piped water tariff are independent of supply hours. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This dam was built in the context of steelmaking to constitute a water reservoir for blast furnace cooling and wet cleaning of furnace smokes. The dam also enhanced sediment deposition in the upstream zone. This study was performed to unravel the contamination status of sediments and to evidence possible contribution sources. The sediment layers were analyzed for water content, grain size, chemical composition, crystalline phases at a bulk scale and poorly crystalline and amorphous phases at a sub-micrometer scale. Visual aspect, texture, color, and chemical and mineralogical analyses showed that the settled sediments were mainly composed of fine black matter, certainly comprising steelmaking by-products. Those materials were highly enriched with Fe, Zn, Pb and other trace metals, except for a relatively thin layer of surficial sediments that had settled more recently. Bulk mineralogy revealed crystalline iron minerals, such as magnetite, goethite, wuestite and pyrite, in the deep layers of the sediment cores. Furthermore, microscopic investigations evidenced the presence of ferrospheres, goethite nanoparticles and newly formed Fe-aluminosilicates; all originating from the former steelmaking facilities. The variation of iron mineralogy, combined with specific chemical profiles and other sediment features, demonstrate the different contributions that constitute the sediment deposit. Furthermore, chemical and mineralogical features of goethite and Fe-aluminosilicates could be used as a fingerprint for such contaminated sediments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, an effective watershed management method is explored, in which water quality is first assessed using the heavy metal pollution index and the human health risk index, and then by classifying the pollution and management grade based on cluster analysis and GIS visualization. Three marine reserves in Tianjin were selected and analyzed, namely the Tianjin Ancient Coastal Wetland National Nature Reserve (Qilihai Natural Reserve), the Tianjin DaShentang Oyster Reef National Marine Special Reserve (DaShentang Reserve), and the Tianjin Coastal Wetland National Marine Special Reserve (BinHai Wetland Reserve) which is under construction. The water quality and potential human health risks of 5 heavy metals (Pb, As, Cd, Hg, Cr) in the three reserves were assessed using the Nemerow index and USEPA methods. Moreover, ArcGIS10.2 software was used to visualize the heavy metal index and display their spatial distribution. Cluster analysis enabled classification of the heavy metals into 4 categories, which allowed for identification of the heavy metals whose pollution index and health risks were highest, and, thus, whose control in the reserve is a priority. Results indicate that heavy metal pollution exists in the Qilihai Natural Reserve and in the north and east of the DaShentang Reserve; furthermore, human health risks exist in the Qilihai Natural Reserve and in the BinHai Wetland Reserve. In each reserve, the main factor influencing the pollution and health risk were high concentrations of As and Pb that exceed the corresponding standards. Measures must be adopted to control and remediate the pollutants. Furthermore, to protect the marine reserves, management policies must be implemented to improve water quality, which is an urgent task for both local and national governments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Much controversy exists about the factors that control the release of P from sediments (internal P loading). One of the main debates concerns the role of oxygen deficit (anoxia) in the regulation of water quality. Our results based on a comprehensive set of lakes worldwide demonstrate that internal P loading (IPtot) plays a significant role in water quality regulation. Internal P loading due to anoxia (IPanox) contributes significantly to the IPtot. However, this contribution is insufficient to significantly increase the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in stratifying lakes. In the lakes of the north temperate and boreal zone, this is because the IPanox reaches surface water layer in the end of the growing season. Observed water quality implications of IPtot are most likely caused by the sedimentary P that actually originates from the shallow areas. These findings suggest limitations for the use of aeration (improvement of the oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion) in lake water quality restoration. Moreover, lake ecosystem managers can benefit from our model that enables to predict anoxia triggered sedimentary P release from the combination of lake characteristics. The final decision on the use of aeration is indeed unique to each lake, and lake specific targets should be considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Episodic acidification of 5 rivers in Canada's oil sands during snowmelt: A 25-year record	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Episodic acidification during snowmelt is a natural phenomenon that can be intensified by acidic deposition from heavy industry. In Canada's oil sands region, acid deposition is estimated to be as much as 5% of the Canadian total and large tracks of northeastern Alberta are considered acid-sensitive because of extensive peatland habitats with poorly weathered soils. To identify the frequency, duration and severity of acidification episodes during snowmelt (the predominant hydrological period for delivery of priority pollutants from atmospheric oil sands emissions to surface waters), a 25-year record (1989 to 2014) of automated water quality data (pH, temperature, conductivity) was assembled for 3 rivers along with a shorter record (2012-2014) for another 2 rivers. Acidic episodes (pH < 7, ANC < 0) were recorded during 39% of all 83 snowmelt events. The severity (duration x magnitude) of episodic acidification increased exponentially over the study period (r(2) = 0.56, P < 0.01) and was strongly correlated (P < 0.01) with increasing maximum air temperature and weakly correlated with regional land development (P = 0.06). Concentrations of aluminum and 11 priority pollutants (Sb, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se, Ag, TI and Zn) were greatest (P <0.01) during low (<6.5) pH episodes, particularly when coincident with high discharge, such that aluminum and copper concentrations were at times high enough to pose a risk to juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Although low pH (pH < 6.5) was observed during only 8% of 32 acidification episodes, when present, low pH typically lasted 10 days. Episodic surface water acidification during snowmelt, and its potential effects on aquatic biota, is therefore an important consideration in the design of long-term monitoring of these typically alkaline (pH = 7.72 +/- 0.05) rivers.

Interspecies comparison of selected pollution biomarkers in dreissenid spp. inhabiting pristine and moderately polluted sites	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Stress biomarkers, which can outline impacts of contaminants in aquatic biota at the biochemical level, are increasingly used as early warning tools in environmental monitoring. Reliable biomarker based assessment schemes, however, request appropriate knowledge of baseline levels of selected endpoints, and the potential influence of a range of natural influencing factors (both abiotic and biotic) as well. In this study, we examined the interspecies variability of various biomarkers (metallothioneins (MT), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity (EROD), lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA strand breaks (DNA_sb), vitellogenin-like proteins (Vtg)) in Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis inhabiting either pristine- or moderately impacted sites of Lake Balaton (Hungary). Levels of all biomarkers considered revealed low interspecies variability in the two dreissenid species at all sampling sites, with consistently higher (but statistically insignificant) values in Dreissena polymorpha. Levels of all biomarkers varied within the two investigated seasons, with significant influence of the reproduction cycle particularly on the levels of metallothioneins and vitellogenin-like proteins. Each biomarker considered was elevated by October, with significantly higher values in the mussels inhabiting harbours. Insignificant spatial and temporal variability in the general health indicators (condition index, total protein content) of dreissenids was observed, which, in parallel with evident rise in biomarker levels, apparently suggest that the anthropogenic impactsin harbours affect mussel fitness yet at sub organismal level. Our data might serve useful basis for future environmental monitoring surveys, especially in habitats where the progressive replacement of Dreissena polymorpha by Dreissena bugensis is taking place, as the interspecies variability in susceptibility to chemical stress of the two species is well comparable.

Recent evidence from molecular data and mating experiments has shown that some traditional diatom morphospecies represent species complexes, containing several to many cryptic species. This case study is based on epiphytic diatom and environmental data from shallow fishponds, investigating whether the recognition and use of fine taxonomic resolution (cryptic species) can improve assessment of community response to environmental drivers and increase sharpness of classification, compared to coarse taxonomic resolution (genus level and species level with unresolved species complexes). Secondly, trophy bioindication based on a species matrix divided into two compartments (species complexes and remaining species) was evaluated against the expectation that species complexes would be poor trophy indicators, due to their expected wide ecological amplitude. Finally, the response of species complexes and their members (cryptic species) to a trophic gradient (phosphorus) were compared. Multivariate analyses showed similar efficiency of all three taxonomic resolutions in depicting community patterns and their environmental correlates, suggesting that even genus level resolution is sufficient for routine bio-assessment of shallow fishponds with a wide trophic range. However, after controlling for coarse taxonomic matrices, fine taxonomic resolution (with resolved cryptic species) still showed sufficient variance related to the environmental variable (habitat groups), and increased the sharpness of classification, number of indicator species for habitat categories, and gave better separation of habitat categories in the ordination space. Regression analysis of trophic bioindication and phosphorus concentration showed a weak relationship for species complexes but a close relationship for the remaining taxa. GLM models also showed that no species complex responded to phosphorus concentration. It follows that the studied species complexes have wide tolerances to, and no apparent optima for, phosphorus concentrations. In contrast, various responses (linear, unimodal, or no response) of cryptic species within species complexes were found to total phosphorus concentration. In some cases, fine taxonomic resolution to species level including cryptic species has the potential to improve data interpretation and extrapolation, supporting recent views of species surrogacy.

Development of a Paddle Wheel Aerator for Small and Medium Fish Farmers in Nigeria	AMA-AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION IN ASIA AFRICA AND LATIN AMERICA												Pond aeration systems were developed to sustain large quantities of fish and biomass materials. In this study the importance and functions of aeration were examined and prototype paddle wheel aerator was developed. The main features of the paddle wheel aerator were electric motor used as prime mover which was of one horse power capacity, and paddle hubs with six paddles all mounted on a shaft made of stainless steel and brass materials. Aeration experiment was conducted in water basin made up of plastic. Paddle - wheel aerator performance evaluation was conducted using unsteady state test. Physico-chemical properties of water sampled from the tested ponds were determined in accordance with the American Public Health Association standards (APHA, 2005). Performance test carried out showed that the overall oxygen transfer co-efficient (K(L)a) was observed to be as high as 8.19 hr(-1) and standard oxygen transfer rate (SOTR) and standard aerator efficiency (SAE) ranged from 1.1-1.2 kg O-2 hr(-1) and 1.1-1.3 kg O-2 kW(-1) hr(-1) respectively. The paddle wheel aerator improved the water quality by addition of oxygen leading to appreciable increase in the fish stock density which has been a major setback of low-income fish farmer in Nigeria.																	0084-5841					WIN	2017	48	1					22	26										WOS:000397363600005

Applying the HPT-GWS for Hydrostratigraphy, Water Quality and Aquifer Recharge Investigations	GROUND WATER MONITORING AND REMEDIATION												The primary objective of this study was to evaluate use of the hydraulic profiling tool-groundwater sampler (HPT-GWS) log data as an indicator of water quality (level of dissolved ionic species) in an alluvial aquifer. The HPT-GWS probe is designed for direct push advancement into unconsolidated formations. The system provides both injection pressure logs and electrical conductivity (EC) logs, and groundwater may be sampled at multiple depths as the probe is advanced (profiling). The combination of these three capabilities in one probe has not previously been available. During field work it was observed that when HPT corrected pressure (P-c) indicates a consistent aquifer unit then bulk formation EC can be used as an indicator of water quality. A high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.93) was observed between groundwater specific conductance and bulk formation EC in the sands and gravels of the alluvial aquifer studied. These results indicate that groundwater specific conductance is exerting a controlling influence on the bulk formation EC of the coarse-grained unit at this site, and probably many similar sites, consistent with Archie's Law. This simple relationship enables the use of the EC and P-c logs, with targeted water samples and a minimum of core samples, to rapidly assess groundwater quality over extended areas at high vertical resolution. This method was used to identify both a brine impacted zone at the base of the aquifer investigated and a groundwater recharge lens developing below storm water holding ponds in the upper portion of the same aquifer. Sample results for trace level, naturally occurring elements (As, Ba, U) further demonstrate the use of this system to sample for low level groundwater contamination.																	1069-3629	1745-6592				WIN	2017	37	1					78	91		10.1111/gwmr.12193								WOS:000395067500007

Predicting criteria continuous concentrations of metals or metalloids for protecting marine life by use of quantitative ion characteristic-activity relationships-species sensitivity distributions (QICAR-SSD)	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					8th International Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology (ICMPE)	JUN 20-24, 2016	Hong Kong, HONG KONG					Marine pollution by metals has been a major challenge for ecological systems; however, water quality criteria (WQC) for metals in saltwater is still lacking. Especially from a regulatory perspective, chronic effects of metals on marine organisms should receive more attention. A quantitative ion characteristic-activity relationships-species sensitivity distributions (QICAR-SSD) model, based on chronic toxicities for eight marine organisms, was established to predict the criteria continuous concentrations (CCCs) of 21 metals. The results showed that the chronic toxicities of various metals had good relationships with their physicochemical properties. Predicted CCCs of six metals (Hg2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+) were in accordance with the values recommended by the U.S. EPA, with prediction errors being less than an order of magnitude. The QICAR-SSD approach provides an alternative tool to empirical methods and can be useful for deriving scientifically defensible WQC for metals for marine organisms and conducting ecological risk assessments.

The bleaching affected eight species of corals with different growth forms. Bleaching at seven of the eight study sites was minor, affecting only 0.4-5.2% colonies and 0.8-10.0% coral-covered area. Sharp Island East, however, suffered from a moderate level of bleaching, with 13.1% colonies and 30.1% coral-covered area affected. Examination of the government's environmental monitoring data indicated abnormal water quality conditions preceding and during the bleaching event. Follow-up field surveys of tagged colonies showed that 76% of them had fully recovered, 12% partially recovered, and 12% suffered from mortality. These results indicate that the subtropical corals of Hong Kong are not immune to bleaching, and there is a need to study their responses under climate change scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Taiwanese marine microbenthic algal communities remain similar yet chlorophyll a concentrations rise in mesocosms with elevated CO2 and temperature	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN					8th International Conference on Marine Pollution and Ecotoxicology (ICMPE)	JUN 20-24, 2016	Hong Kong, HONG KONG					The effects of increasing CO2 concentrations and temperature on microalgal assemblages were examined in Taiwan using mesocosms that simulate coral reef ecosystem. We assessed changes in abundance and diversity of benthic algae grown at 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C, under ambient (similar to 400 mu atm) and at high CO2 conditions (800-1000 mu atm). Total alkalinity, pCO(2), and the aragonite saturation state, were all significantly different between control and high CO2 treatments in both temperature treatments. Chl a concentration increased significantly in CO2-treated groups at 25 degrees C, but benthic microalgal abundance was not significantly different. The number of microalgal species and the microalgal community structure did not differ between control and CO2-treated groups at both temperatures. Our results suggest that increasing CO2 may boost benthic microalgal primary productivity if sufficient nutrients are available, although site-specific responses are difficult to predict.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV 30	2017	124	2			SI		929	937		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.050								WOS:000417964500045	28669477

The results show that the PAHs, turbidity, and other nutrients increased shortly after oil spill, however levels of these parameters eventually returned to baseline levels. On the other hand, DO saturation, pH and chl a decreased initially, reached maxima after 10 days, and returned to the baseline levels after 14 days. The chl a concentration, pH and DO saturation fluctuated in a similar pattern at both sites during the oil spills, likely driven by algal blooms. In this study, we documented a full environmental recovery at coastal areas before, during and after the oil spills. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zarco-Perello, S; Simoes, N				Zarco-Perello, Salvador; Simoes, Nuno			Ordinary kriging vs inverse distance weighting: spatial interpolation of the sessile community of Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico	PEERJ												Information about the distribution and abundance of the habitat-forming sessile organisms in marine ecosystems is of great importance for conservation and natural resource managers. Spatial interpolation methodologies can be useful to generate this information from in situ sampling points, especially in circumstances where remote sensing methodologies cannot be applied due to small-scale spatial variability of the natural communities and low light penetration in the water column. Interpolation methods are widely used in environmental sciences; however, published studies using these methodologies in coral reef science are scarce. We compared the accuracy of the two most commonly used interpolation methods in all disciplines, inverse distance weighting (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK), to predict the distribution and abundance of hard corals, octocorals, macroalgae, sponges and zoantharians and identify hotspots of these habitat-forming organisms using data sampled at three different spatial scales (5, 10 and 20 m) in Madagascar reef, Gulf of Mexico. The deeper sandy environments of the leeward and windward regions of Madagascar reef were dominated by macroalgae and seconded by octocorals. However, the shallow rocky environments of the reef crest had the highest richness of habitat-forming groups of organisms; here, we registered high abundances of octocorals and macroalgae, with sponges, Millepora alcicornis and zoantharians dominating in some patches, creating high levels of habitat heterogeneity. IDW and OK generated similar maps of distribution for all the taxa; however, cross-validation tests showed that IDW outperformed OK in the prediction of their abundances. When the sampling distance was at 20 m, both interpolation techniques performed poorly, but as the sampling was done at shorter distances prediction accuracies increased, especially for IDW. OK had higher mean prediction errors and failed to correctly interpolate the highest abundance values measured in situ, except for macroalgae, whereas IDW had lower mean prediction errors and high correlations between predicted and measured values in all cases when sampling was every 5 m. The accurate spatial interpolations created using IDW allowed us to see the spatial variability of each taxa at a biological and spatial resolution that remote sensing would not have been able to produce. Our study sets the basis for further research projects and conservation management in Madagascar reef and encourages similar studies in the region and other parts of the world where remote sensing technologies are not suitable for use.																	2167-8359					NOV 30	2017	5								e4078	10.7717/peerj.4078								WOS:000417096100005

The role of land surface versus drainage network characteristics in controlling water quality and quantity in a small urban watershed	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The processes that control run-off quantity and quality in urban watersheds are complex and not well understood. Although impervious surface coverage has traditionally been used to examine altered hydrologic response in urban watersheds, several studies suggest that other elements of the urban landscape, particularly those associated with urban infrastructure and the drainage system, play an equally important role. The relative importance of impervious surfaces, stormwater ponds, expansion of the drainage network, and drainage network structures in controlling hydrologic response was examined in the subwatersheds of the Kromma Kill, an urban watershed located in Albany County, NY. In this study, geographic information systems was used to compute geospatial land surface and drainage network properties of 5 Kromma Kill subwatersheds. In these same subwatersheds, water quantity (rainfall and run-off) and quality (macroinvertebrates, nitrate, total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, and nonpurgable organic carbon) parameters were measured. Strong and significant correlations were identified between land surface and drainage network properties and field observations. Causal relationships were then tested using the Environmental Protection Agency's Stormwater Management Model. Field and model analyses suggest that whereas percent imperviousness is a dominant control on water quality, drainage density and slope are equally important. However, for water quantity, whereas imperviousness is positively correlated with increased run-off volumes, drainage network properties and slope are the dominant controls on run-off volumes. Results have important implications for stormwater management plans, especially those aimed at reducing the effective impervious surface coverage of urban watersheds. Reducing the percentage of effective imperviousness in a watershed is not a one size fits all solution and can help to meet some management objectives, such as reducing nitrogen concentrations and improving water quality, but may not serve as the most effective, and therefore economical, solution for every management objective including reducing run-off volumes.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				NOV 30	2017	31	24					4384	4397		10.1002/hyp.11367								WOS:000416149500010						
J	Wang, CY; Chen, SS; Li, D; Wang, DN; Liu, W; Yang, J				Wang, Chongyang; Chen, Shuisen; Li, Dan; Wang, Danni; Liu, Wei; Yang, Ji			A Landsat-based model for retrieving total suspended solids concentration of estuaries and coasts in China	GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT												Retrieving total suspended solids (TSS) concentration accurately is essential for sustainable management of estuaries and coasts, which plays a key role in the interaction between hydrosphere, pedosphere and atmosphere. Although many TSS retrieval models have been published, the general inversion method that is applicable to different field conditions is still under research. In order to obtain a TSS remote sensing model that is suitable for estimating TSS concentrations with wide range in estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, after reviewing a number of Landsatbased TSS retrieval models and improving a comparatively better one among them, this study developed a quadratic model using the ratio of logarithmic transformation of red band and near-infrared band and logarithmic transformation of TSS concentration (QRLTSS) based on 119 in situ samples collected in 2006-2013 from five regions of China. It was found that the QRLTSS model works well and shows a satisfactory performance. The QRLTSS model based on Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper), ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) and OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensors explained about 72 % of the TSS concentration variation (TSS: 4.3-577.2 mg L-1, N = 84, P value < 0.001) and had an acceptable validation accuracy (TSS: 4.5-474 mg L-1, root mean squared error (RMSE) < 25 mg L-1, N = 35). In addition, a threshold method of red-band reflectance (OLI: 0.032, ETM+ and TM: 0.031) was proposed to solve the two-valued issue of the QRLTSS model and to retrieve TSS concentration from Landsat imagery. After a 6S model based atmospheric correction of Landsat OLI and ETM + imagery, the TSS concentrations of three regions (Moyangjiang River estuary, Pearl River estuary and Hanjiang River estuary) in Guangdong Province in China were mapped by the QRLTSS model. The results indicated that TSS concentrations in the three estuaries showed large variation ranging from 0.295 to 370.4 mg L-1. Meanwhile we found that TSS concentrations retrieved from Landsat imagery showed good validation accuracies with the synchronous water samples (TS S : 7-160 mg L-1, RMSE: 11.06 mg L-1, N = 22). The further validation from EO-1 Hyperion imagery also showed good performance (in situ synchronous measurement of TSS: 106-220.7 mgL(-1), RMSE: 26.66 mgL(-1), N = 13) of the QRLTSS model for the area of high TSS concentrations in the Lingding Bay of the Pearl River estuary. Evidently, the QRLTSS model is potentially applied to simulate high-dynamic TSS concentrations of other estuaries and coasts by Landsat imagery, improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of TSS concentrations on regional and global scales. Furthermore, the QRLTSS model can be optimized to establish a regional or unified TS S retrieval model of estuaries and coasts in the world for different satellite sensors with medium- and high-resolution similar to Landsat TM, ETM + and OLI sensors or with similar red bands and near-infrared bands, such as ALI, HJ-1 A and B, LISS, CBERS, ASTER, ALOS, RapidEye, Kanopus-V, and GE.

J	Hartmann, A; Barbera, JA; Andreo, B				Hartmann, Andreas; Barbera, Juan Antonio; Andreo, Bartolome			On the value of water quality data and informative flow states in karst modelling	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												If properly applied, karst hydrological models are a valuable tool for karst water resource management. If they are able to reproduce the relevant flow and storage processes of a karst system, they can be used for prediction of water resource availability when climate or land use are expected to change. A common challenge to apply karst simulation models is the limited availability of observations to identify their model parameters. In this study, we quantify the value of information when water quality data (NO3- and SO42-) is used in addition to discharge observations to estimate the parameters of a process-based karst simulation model at a test site in southern Spain. We use a three-step procedure to (1) confine an initial sample of 500 000 model parameter sets by discharge and water quality observations, (2) identify alterations of model parameter distributions through the confinement, and (3) quantify the strength of the confinement for the model parameters. We repeat this procedure for flow states, for which the system discharge is controlled by the unsaturated zone, the saturated zone, and the entire time period including times when the spring is influenced by a nearby river. Our results indicate that NO3- provides the most information to identify the model parameters controlling soil and epikarst dynamics during the unsaturated flow state. During the saturated flow state, SO42- and discharge observations provide the best information to identify the model parameters related to groundwater processes. We found reduced parameter identifiability when the entire time period is used as the river influence disturbs parameter estimation. We finally show that most reliable simulations are obtained when a combination of discharge and water quality date is used for the combined unsaturated and saturated flow states.

Projected precipitation changes within the Great Lakes and Western Lake Erie Basin: a multi-model analysis of intensity and seasonality	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The Great Lakes region encompasses the largest freshwater lake network in the world and supports a diverse network of agriculture, transportation, and tourism. Recently, Lake Erie has experienced increased hypoxia events, which have been attributed to agricultural practices and changes in run-off. Here we examine the projected changes in extreme precipitation events to address concerns regarding regional agriculture, surface run-off, and subsequent water quality. Precipitation projections within the overall Great Lakes Basin and the Western Lake Erie Basin subregion are examined using climate model simulations of varying spatial resolutions to understand historical precipitation and projected future precipitation. We develop three model ensembles for the historical period (1980-1999) and the mid-century (2041-2060) that cover a range of spatial resolutions and future emissions scenarios, including: (1) 12 global model members from the fifth Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, (2) ten regional climate model (RCM) members from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program driven by CMIP3 global models using the A2 emissions scenario, and (3) two high resolution RCM simulations (RCM4) driven by CMIP5 global models using the RCP 8.5 scenario. For the historical period, all model ensembles overestimate winter and spring precipitation, and many of the models simulate a summer drying that is not observed. At mid-century, most of the models predict a 10-20% increase in precipitation depending on the time of year. Daily probability distribution functions from three model ensembles reveal spring seasonal increases in high precipitation event probabilities when compared to the historical period, suggesting an increase in the frequency of high intensity precipitation at mid-century. Overall, the presence of lakes or higher spatial resolution does not ensure improved representation of historical processes, and more complex interactions between large-scale dynamics, local feedbacks, and physical parameterizations drive the model spread.

J	Arnoux, M; Barbecot, F; Gibert-Brunet, E; Gibson, J; Noret, A				Arnoux, Marie; Barbecot, Florent; Gibert-Brunet, Elisabeth; Gibson, John; Noret, Aurelie			Impacts of changes in groundwater recharge on the isotopic composition and geochemistry of seasonally ice-covered lakes: insights for sustainable management	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Lakes are under increasing pressure due to widespread anthropogenic impacts related to rapid development and population growth. Accordingly, many lakes are currently undergoing a systematic decline in water quality. Recent studies have highlighted that global warming and the subsequent changes in water use may further exacerbate eutrophication in lakes. Lake evolution depends strongly on hydrologic balance, and therefore on groundwater connectivity. Groundwater also influences the sensitivity of lacustrine ecosystems to climate and environmental changes, and governs their resilience. Improved characterization of groundwater exchange with lakes is needed today for lake preservation, lake restoration, and sustainable management of lake water quality into the future. In this context, the aim of the present paper is to determine if the future evolution of the climate, the population, and the recharge could modify the geochemistry of lakes (mainly isotopic signature and quality via phosphorous load) and if the isotopic monitoring of lakes could be an efficient tool to highlight the variability of the water budget and quality. ' Small groundwater-connected lakes were chosen to simulate changes in water balance and water quality expected under future climate change scenarios, namely representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Contemporary baseline conditions, including isotope mass balance and geochemical characteristics, were determined through an intensive field-based research program prior to the simulations. Results highlight that future lake geochemistry and isotopic composition trends will depend on four main parameters: lo-cation (and therefore climate conditions), lake catchment size (which impacts the intensity of the flux change), lake volume (which impacts the range of variation), and lake G index (i.e., the percentage of groundwater that makes up total lake inflows), the latter being the dominant control on water balance conditions, as revealed by the sensitivity of lake isotopic composition. Based on these model simulations, stable isotopes appear to be especially useful for detecting changes in recharge to lakes with a G index of between 50 and 80 %, but response is non-linear. Simulated monthly trends reveal that evolution of annual lake isotopic composition can be dampened by opposing monthly recharge fluctuations. It is also shown that changes in water quality in groundwater-connected lakes depend significantly on lake location and on the intensity of recharge change.

We performed a vegetation survey and measured water depth and water velocity from May to September, 2014-2015. Averaged water quality data from the Ministry of Environment's national water quality measurement network from January 2012 to October 2015 were used for modeling. Potential habitats of M. spicatum were linked with chlorophyll a, nitrate nitrogen, suspended solids, water temperature, water depth, and water velocity (deviance explained = 28.7%, accuracy = 74%). In the case of H. verticillata, electrical conductivity and suspended solids were key habitat factors (deviance explained = 23.4%, accuracy = 75%). Model results were highly consistent with observations and field data. Model performances were evaluated by the accuracy rate, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, the kappa value, and field verification, and were in generally good agreement. Few studies have evaluated the developed models using the independent field data. By understanding the environmental factors that characterize the habitats for submerged macrophytes, our results contribute to the development of conservation and management strategies for river ecosystems.																	1961-9502					NOV 27	2017		418							58	10.1051/kmae/2017044								WOS:000416259600001

Elevated moisture stimulates carbon loss from mineral soils by releasing protected organic matter	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												Moisture response functions for soil microbial carbon (C) mineralization remain a critical uncertainty for predicting ecosystem-climate feedbacks. Theory and models posit that C mineralization declines under elevated moisture and associated anaerobic conditions, leading to soil C accumulation. Yet, iron (Fe) reduction potentially releases protected C, providing an under-appreciated mechanism for C destabilization under elevated moisture. Here we incubate Mollisols from ecosystems under C-3/C-4 plant rotations at moisture levels at and above field capacity over 5 months. Increased moisture and anaerobiosis initially suppress soil C mineralization, consistent with theory. However, after 25 days, elevated moisture stimulates cumulative gaseous C-loss as CO2 and CH4 to > 150% of the control. Stable C isotopes show that mineralization of older C-3-derived C released following Fe reduction dominates C losses. Counter to theory, elevated moisture may significantly accelerate C losses from mineral soils over weeks to months-a critical mechanistic deficiency of current Earth system models.

This is of concern because many drinking water sources, such as karstic springs are often subject to changes in bacterial concentrations on much shorter time scales (e.g., hours to days), for example after precipitation events. Microbial contamination events are crucial from a risk assessment perspective and should therefore be targeted by monitoring strategies to establish both the frequency of their occurrence and the magnitude of bacterial peak concentrations. In this study we used monitoring data from two specific karstic springs. We assessed the performance of conventionalmonitoring based on historical records and tested a number of alternative strategies based on a high-resolution data set of bacterial concentrations in spring water collected with online flow cytometry (FCM). We quantified the effect of increasing sampling frequency and found that for the specific case studied, at least bi-weekly sampling would be needed to detect precipitation events with a probability of >90%. We then proposed an optimized monitoring strategy with three targeted samples per event, triggered by precipitation measurements. This approach is more effective and efficient than simply increasing overall sampling frequency. It would enable the water utility to (1) analyze any relevant event and (2) limit median underestimation of peak concentrations to approximately 10%. We conclude with a generalized perspective on sampling optimization and argue that the assessment of short-term dynamics causing microbial peak loads initially requires increased sampling/analysis efforts, but can be optimized subsequently to account for limited resources. This offers water utilities and public health authorities systematic ways to evaluate and optimize their current monitoring strategies.																	1664-302X					NOV 22	2017	8								2229	10.3389/fmicb.2017.02229								WOS:000415915400001

Consequently, these flows ignore the inter-annual flow variability that rules species with longer lifecycles and therefore disregard the long-term perspective of the riverine ecosystem. We analyzed the importance of considering riparian requirements for the long-term efficiency of environmental flows. For that analysis, we modeled the riparian vegetation development for a decade facing different environmental flows in two case studies. Next, we assessed the corresponding fish habitat availability of three common fish species in each of the resulting riparian landscape scenarios. Modeling results demonstrated that the environmental flows disregarding riparian vegetation requirements promoted riparian degradation, particularly vegetation encroachment. Such circumstance altered the hydraulic characteristics of the river channel where flow depths and velocities underwent local changes of up to 10 cm and 40 cm s(-1), respectively. Accordingly, after a decade of this flow regime, the available habitat area for the considered fish species experienced modifications of up to 110 % when compared to the natural habitat. In turn, environmental flows regarding riparian vegetation requirements were able to maintain riparian vegetation near natural standards, thereby preserving the hydraulic characteristics of the river channel and sustaining the fish habitat close to the natural condition. As a result, fish habitat availability never changed more than 17 % from the natural habitat.

Stimulation of Phytoplankton Production by Anthropogenic Dissolved Organic Nitrogen in a Coastal Plain Estuary	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												There is increased focus on nitrogen (N) containing dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a nutrient source supporting eutrophication in N-sensitive estuarine ecosystems. This is particularly relevant in watersheds undergoing urban and agricultural development, leading to increased dissolved organic N (DON) loading. To understand how this shift in N-loading influences estuarine phytoplankton production, nutrient addition bioassays were conducted in the N-limited Neuse River Estuary, North Carolina from 2014 to 2015. Additions included N-rich DOM sources characteristic of urban and agricultural development, including chicken and turkey litter leachate, wastewater treatment facility effluent, and concentrated river DOM (used as a reference). Each DOM addition was coupled with an inorganic nutrient treatment to account for inorganic nutrient concentrations (NO2/3, NH4, PO4) in each respective DOM addition. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) showed that chicken litter leachate stimulated phytoplankton growth greater than its coupled inorganic nutrient treatment. Wastewater treatment facility effluent, turkey litter leachate, and concentrated river DOM did not stimulate phytoplankton growth greater than their respective inorganic nutrient controls. DOM fluorescence (EEM-PARAFAC) indicated the chicken litter contained a biologically reactive fluorescent DOM component, identified as the nonhumic, biologically labile, "N-peak", which may be responsible for stimulating the observed phytoplankton growth in the chicken litter leachate treatments.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 21	2017	51	22					13104	13112		10.1021/acs.est.7b03538								WOS:000416496700005	29083877

Modeling the Concentration of Volatile and Semivolatile Contaminants in Direct Contact Membrane Distillation (DCMD) Product Water	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) is an emerging water treatment technology that has high salt rejection; however, its commercialization potential for applications such as seawater desalination or industrial wastewater reuse may be limited by low rejection of volatile and semivolatile contaminants. In this manuscript, a contaminant concentration (CC) model describing the transport of volatile and semivolatile contaminants for DCMD systems was developed and validated using data from the bench-scale DCMD treatment of synthetic wastewaters. The DCMD tests showed that the more volatile contaminants (methyl-tert-butyl ether, acetone, pentanone, butanol, and hexanol) accumulated in the permeate collection stream at greater concentrations than in the feed stream. The validated CC model (average normalized root mean squared error <= 11.3%) was then used to evaluate the product water quality from the large-scale DCMD treatment of oil and gas produced waters. The modeled product water contaminant concentrations exceeded the Environmental Protection Agency limits for discharging to publicly owned treatment works. This indicated that DCMD treatment of produced waters may require additional processing to meet discharge requirements.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 21	2017	51	22					13113	13121		10.1021/acs.est.6b05663								WOS:000416496700006	29111695

We evaluated the suitability of the methodology to assess complex field contaminations through its application in the framework of a regional river monitoring network. Thanks to the high throughput acquisition of biomarker levels in G. fossarum exposed in four reference and 13 contaminated sites, we analyzed the individual responses of 38 peptides reporting for 25 proteins of interest in 170 organisms. Responses obtained in contaminated sites included inductions of vitellogenin-like proteins in male organisms, inductions of Na+K+/ATPases, and strong inhibitions of molt-related proteins such as chitinase and JHE-carboxylesterase. Proteins from detoxification and immunity processes were also found modulated in abundance. Summarizing, the results presented here show that the SRM strategy developed for multibiomarker measurement paves a very promising way to define multiple indicators of the health status of sentinel organisms for environmental hazard assessment.

Therefore, the knowledge about the distribution of nitrate in groundwater and its source has an effective role in protecting health. The study aimed to optimize an interpolation method to predict the nitrate concentration and assessment of aquifer vulnerability in Qazvin plain. Methods: One hundred sixty-two deep wells in Qazvin plain aquifer were randomly selected and nitrate concentration was analyzed in four different lands including agricultural, residential, steppe and mixed-use areas. Interpolation was done by IDW, Spline, Kriging and National neighbor methods using ArcGIS software. To select the best interpolation method, errors of predicted values were determined by Mean Relative Error (RME) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For analysis of potential vulnerability of aquifer to nitrate pollution due to agricultural activity and sewage leaks, hazard factors and control factors were used for identification of hazard indexes (HI) using IPNOA and IPNOC model. Results: The results showed that in 8.82% and 18.52% of samples in agricultural and residential areas, the detected nitrate was above the acceptable level at 50 mg/L. National neighbor method with the lowest RME and Spline method with the lowest RMSE were provided the most accurate estimates of nitrates in the aquifer. The highest hazard was obtained in agricultural areas (HI = 6.11). Also, the most influential parameters on aquifer vulnerability were mineral fertilizer (HFf = 3), organic fertilizers (HFm = 3), irrigation systems (CFi = 1.04) and tillage patterns (CFap = 1.04). Conclusions: According to the results, National neighbor with the lowest RME was preferable than the other spatial interpolation methods for prediction of nitrate concentration in the aquifer. This method provided similar spatial distribution maps of nitrate in groundwater and that was an efficient method for assessing water quality. Hazard index as a result of agricultural activities (IPNOA) was ranged from "very low" to "low" which was in accordance with detected and predicted nitrate concentration in the aquifer. In addition he hazard of nitrate contamination from household (IPNOC) was in very low (class 2).

J	Massicotte, P; Stedmon, C; Markager, S				Massicotte, Philippe; Stedmon, Colin; Markager, Stiig			Spectral signature of suspended fine particulate material on light absorption properties of CDOM	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Fine submicron organic particles can represent an important fraction of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool in aquatic ecosystems and their optical properties differ from those normally considered dissolved ( < 0.2 mu m), which means that the choice of filter type/pore size can influence the light absorption characteristics. In this study, a total of 867 paired CDOM absorption spectra (n = 1734) from different ecosystems (lakes, streams, sewages and estuaries) were measured on 0.2 mu m and GF/F (nominal pore size 0.7 mu m) filters. The aims were to evaluate how fine organic particles influence the spectral signature of the DOM pool and to quantify the effects of choice of filter type. In aquatic ecosystems influenced by terrestrial DOM (rivers and lakes), the dissolved fraction (here defined as < 0.2 mu m) overwhelmed the fine particulate signal (0.2-0.7 mu m) which did not contribute significantly to the absorption signal. In contrast, freshly-produced fine particles released by phytoplankton significantly increased measured CDOM absorption in productive environments with low terrestrial background. Our results demonstrate that the choice of filter pore size can have a significant impact on the outcome of spectral metrics often used to characterise CDOM such as the spectral slope (S) or the slope ratio (SR). Hence, this may complicate the combining of CDOM absorption measurements from different studies where different pore sizes were used as fine particulate material may significantly influence the spectral signature, particularly in situations where phytoplankton is the dominating source of DOM.

Factors controlling the photochemical degradation of methylmercury in coastal and oceanic waters	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Many studies have recognized abiotic photochemical degradation as an important sink of methylmercury (CH3Hg) in sunlit surface waters, but the rate-controlling factors remain poorly understood. The overall objective of this study was to improve our understanding of the relative importance of photochemical reactions in the degradation of CH3Hg in surface waters across a variety of marine ecosystems by extending the range of water types studied. Experiments were conducted using surface water collected from coastal sites in Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Maine, as well as offshore sites on the New England continental shelf break, the equatorial Pacific, and the Arctic Ocean. Filtered water amended with additional CH3Hg at environmentally relevant concentrations was allowed to equilibrate with natural ligands before being exposed to natural sunlight. Water quality parameters - salinity, dissolved organic carbon, and nitrate - were measured, and specific UV absorbance was calculated as a proxy for dissolved aromatic carbon content. Degradation rate constants (0.87-1.67 day(-1)) varied by a factor of two across all water types tested despite varying characteristics, and did not correlate with initial CH3Hg concentrations or other environmental parameters. The rate constants in terms of cumulative photon flux values were comparable to, but at the high end of, the range of values reported in other studies. Further experiments investigating the controlling parameters of the reaction observed little effect of nitrate and chloride, and potential for bromide involvement. The HydroLight radiative transfer model was used to compute solar irradiance with depth in three representative water bodies - coastal wetland, estuary, and open ocean - allowing for the determination of water column integrated rates. Methylmercury loss per year due to photodegradation was also modeled across a range of latitudes from the Arctic to the Equator in the three model water types, resulting in an estimated global demethylation rate of 25.3 Mmol yr(-1). The loss of CH3Hg was greatest in the open ocean due to increased penetration of all wavelengths, especially the UV portion of the spectrum which has a greater ability to degrade CH3Hg. Overall, this study provides additional insights and information to better constrain the importance of photochemical degradation in the cycling of CH3Hg in marine surface waters and its transport from coastal waters to the open ocean.

Chemical elements from 17 groundwater samples, 9 surface water samples (treated wastewater), and 14 soil samples were analyzed. Water facies analyses showed that both groundwater and surface water belong to the SO4-Cl class. However, the groundwater is characterized by high salinity (average value of 3547 mg/l), which may be result of the greater rock-water interaction and limited rainfall recharge. The NO3 values are also high in the groundwater samples (average value of 40 mg/l) and are mainly attributed to the agricultural practices in the study area. The surface water samples (treated wastewater from the plant) shows an average salinity value of 1232 mg/l and is better suited for irrigation purposes. Heavy elements analyzed in the soil samples show high concentrations of all the elements except Mn and Ni as compared to their background concentration. Enrichment factor and index of geoaccumulation calculated from the soil samples indicate that they are severely enriched with respect to Cd and Se. The spatial distribution maps were prepared based on kriging interpolation technique to estimate the concentrations of the analyzed elements at unknown locations. The treated wastewater in the study area is better suited for agricultural and domestic activities as compared to groundwater.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				NOV 17	2017	10	22							490	10.1007/s12517-017-3256-x								WOS:000415964600001

To remove residual nitrogen after Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (A(2)O) treatment, three multistage Anoxic-Oxic (A/O) were added to investigate the nitrogen removal efficiency and its mechanism. In addition, the constituents and evolution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during wastewater reclamation was also investigated using a method combining fluorescence spectroscopy with fluorescence regional integration (FRI). The results suggested that multistage A/O treatment can effectively improve the nitrogen removal ability under low concentrations of carbon sources. The total nitrogen (TN) exhibits significantly positive correlation with fulvic acid-like materials and humic acid-like materials. The correlation coefficient for TN and fulvic acid-like substances (R-2 = 0.810, P < 0.01) removal was greater than that of humic acid-like substances (R-2 = 0.636, P < 0.05). The results indicate that nitrogen removal may be achieved with the fulvic-like and humic-like substances, and the removal effects were higher by fulvic acid-like substances than humic-like substances, mostly due to that the latter were relatively more difficult to be utilized as carbon source during the nitrogen removal process. The effluent water quality of biological treatment reached the first grade A standard of "Cities sewage treatment plant pollutant discharge standard" (GB18918-2002). In addition, the effluent from the membrane bioreactor reached the "Standards of reclaimed water quality" (SL368-2006).																	1932-6203					NOV 17	2017	12	11							e0187355	10.1371/journal.pone.0187355								WOS:000415646100010	29149172

This manuscript aims to challenge current regulatory approaches that do not recognize stereochemistry of chiral pharmaceuticals by testing the hypothesis that environmental transformation and effects of chiral pharmaceuticals are stereoselective. Our experiments revealed that, while degradation of chiral fluoxetine (FL) in river water occurs via non-enantioselective photochemical and mildly-enantioselective microbial processes favoring the (R)enantiomer, a pronounced enantioselectivity favoring (S)-FL (leading to the formation of (S)-NFL (norfluoxetine)) is observed during activated sludge treatment. Toxicity tests proved strong enantiomer-specific toxicity in the case of Tetrahymena thermophila, protozoa that are utilized during activated sludge treatment ((R)-FL is 30x more toxic than (S)-FL; (S)-NFL is 10x more toxic than (S)-FL). This is of paramount importance as preferential degradation of (S)-FL in activated sludge microcosms leads to the enrichment of FL with 30x more toxic (R)-FL and formation of 10x more toxic (S)-NFL. It is commonly assumed that a decreased concentration of FL leads to decreased biological impact. Our study proves that despite the overall decrease in FL concentration, accumulation of toxic (R)-FL and formation of toxic (S)-NFL leads to much higher than presumed toxicological effects.

Understanding the regional impact of climate fluctuations on aquaculture production thus is critical for the sustainability of this crucial food resource. The objective of this work was to understand the role of climate fluctuations and climate change in subtropical coastal estuarine environments within the context of aquaculture practices in He. eia Fishpond, O. ahu Island, Hawai'i. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study of climate effects on traditional aquaculture systems in the Hawaiian Islands. Data from adjacent weather stations were analyzed together with in situ water quality instrument deployments spanning a 12-year period (November 2004 - November 2016). We found correlations between two periods with extremely high fish mortality at He. eia Fishpond (May and October 2009) and slackening trade winds in the week preceding each mortality event, as well as surface water temperatures elevated 2-3 degrees C higher than the background periods (March-December 2009). We posit that the lack of trade wind-driven surface water mixing enhanced surface heating and stratification of the water column, leading to hypoxic conditions and stress on fish populations, which had limited ability to move within net pen enclosures. Elevated water temperature and interruption of trade winds previously have been linked to the onset of El Nio in Hawai'i. Our results provide empirical evidence regarding El Nico effects on the coastal ocean, which can inform resource management efforts about potential impact of climate variation on aquaculture production. Finally, we provide recommendations for reducing the impact of warming events on fishponds, as these events are predicted to increase in magnitude and frequency as a consequence of global warming.																	1932-6203					NOV 16	2017	12	11							e0187951	10.1371/journal.pone.0187951								WOS:000415378800043	29145446

Results show that these lakes are shallow, weakly stratified, and of polymictic type. These characteristics may have caused vertical mixing of limnological parameters. Seasonal changes were minor for most parameters, except for chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and cyanobacteria, which also showed considerable variation between lakes. In general, waters of these lakes were mostly acidic in nature (avg. pH 4.9-5.9), with high total Fe (up to 1.52mg/L) and low electrolytic conductivity (avg. 8.13-14 mS/cm) and total phosphorus (TP) (avg. 10-35.5 mg/L). Although the water bodies have good quality and classified as class I and II types according to CONAMA Resolution No. 357/05, trophic state index (TSI) varies from ultra-oligotrophic to eutrophic state, with higher trophic state observed for Vl, TI1 and TI2. Limnological characteristics of these lakes is highly influenced by lithological and morphological parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that Chl-a and cyanobacteria are not solely influenced by TP and lower concentrations of all these parameters in Am lake are probably due to specificities of its catchment lithology. Phytoplankton taxa in the lakes are characterized by small chroococcales groups and desmids together with filamentous algae, more commonly observed in the dry season. The zooplankton community in the lakes is mainly dominated by rotifers, followed by cladocerans and copepods. Regarding species richness, zooplankton was highest in Vl, while phytoplankton is highest in TI1, and this aspect is most likely related to lake water levels.

Assessing the chemical contamination dynamics in a mixed land use stream system	WATER RESEARCH												Traditionally, the monitoring of streams for chemical and ecological status has been limited to surface water concentrations, where the dominant focus has been on general water quality and the risk for eutrophication. Mixed land use stream systems, comprising urban areas and agricultural production, are challenging to assess with multiple chemical stressors impacting stream corridors. New approaches are urgently needed for identifying relevant sources, pathways and potential impacts for implementation of suitable source management and remedial measures. We developed a method for risk assessing chemical stressors in these systems and applied the approach to a 16-km groundwater-fed stream corridor (Grindsted, Denmark). Three methods were combined: (i) in-stream contaminant mass discharge for source quantification, (ii) Toxic Units and (iii) environmental standards. An evaluation of the chemical quality of all three stream compartments stream water, hyporheic zone, streambed sediment made it possible to link chemical stressors to their respective sources and obtain new knowledge about source composition and origin. Moreover, toxic unit estimation and comparison to environmental standards revealed the stream water quality was substantially impaired by both geogenic and diffuse anthropogenic sources of metals along the entire corridor, while the streambed was less impacted. Quantification of the contaminant mass discharge originating from a former pharmaceutical factory revealed that several 100 legs of chlorinated ethenes and pharmaceutical compounds discharge into the stream every year. The strongly reduced redox conditions in the plume result in high concentrations of dissolved iron and additionally release arsenic, generating the complex contaminant mixture found in the narrow discharge zone. The fingerprint of the plume was observed in the stream several km downgradient, while nutrients, inorganics and pesticides played a minor role for the stream health. The results emphasize that future investigations should include multiple compounds and stream compartments, and highlight the need for holistic approaches when risk assessing these dynamic systems.

Assessment and monitoring of water quality of the gulf of Morbihan, a littoral ecosystem under high anthropic pressure	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												This field study is intended to propose a global methodology to assess and monitor the water quality of the gulf of Morbihan, a littoral ecosystem under increasing anthropic pressure. To this end, the Locmariaquer site, where Crassostrea gigas is extensively cultivated, was selected to perform a one-year follow-up of tissular glutathione S-transferase and acetylcholinesterase specific activities in this filter feeder organism. Calculation of an integrated index, corresponding to the ratio of the two enzymes activities, allowed to discriminate from the environmental noise, several clusters which could be representative environmental stress, potentially latent pollution. Moreover, the estrogenic activity was assessed in water samples collected at Locmariaquer and other strategic sites of the gulf. The results evidenced a low estrogenic-disrupting compound contamination of waters. Overall, this methodology produced an accurate outlook of a basal state for the gulf and could be developed in the context of a chronic monitoring of this site.

Bloom dynamics and hydrographical conditions were examined by field survey. The bloom initially developed in the eastern area of Imari Bay, subsequently after rainfall during the neap tides, cell density exceeded over 10,000 cells ml. Vertical distribution of K. mikimotoi was primarily controlled by the light intensity and secondarily by the water quality during the daytime. Almost all cell-density maxima occurred in depths with weak daytime light intensities of < 300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). In some cases of weak light intensity, cell-density maxima occurred in depths with favorable hydrodynamic conditions for the growth. Spatially classified areas were identified by cluster analysis using the growth rate calculated from seawater temperature and salinity. This study quantitatively evaluated the environmental factors of the eastern area, where the bloom initially occurred, during the development of the bloom.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV 15	2017	124	1					130	138		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.07.019								WOS:000415391200028	28712772

Metals can be either toxic or beneficial to health, inducing many different responses. The response mechanism depends on the class of metals to which organisms are exposed: essential, nonessential, and borderline. To analyze the influence of metals from different classes on the protective mechanisms of an ascidian, we investigated the production of nitric oxide (NO) after exposure to various concentrations of Mg, Mn and Pb over different time periods. We also determined the amounts of each metal in the hemocytes. Our results indicated that especially Pb could stimulate NO production. Although Pb induced the highest NO production, cell viability was not severely altered in all Pb concentrations and time periods. Ascidians might serve as biomonitor for Pb, since their vanadocytes accumulate Pb.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV 15	2017	124	1					441	448		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.043								WOS:000415391200061	28779885

Stormwater management network effectiveness and implications for urban watershed function: A critical review	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Deleterious effects of urban stormwater are widely recognized. In several countries, regulations have been put into place to improve the conditions of receiving water bodies, but planning and engineering of stormwater control is typically carried out at smaller scales. Quantifying cumulative effectiveness of many stormwater control measures on a watershed scale is critical to understanding how small-scale practices translate to urban river health. We review 100 empirical and modelling studies of stormwater management effectiveness at the watershed scale in diverse physiographic settings. Effects of networks with stormwater control measures (SCMs) that promote infiltration and harvest have been more intensively studied than have detention-based SCM networks. Studies of peak flows and flow volumes are common, whereas baseflow, groundwater recharge, and evapotranspiration have received comparatively little attention. Export of nutrients and suspended sediments have been the primary water quality focus in the United States, whereas metals, particularly those associated with sediments, have received greater attention in Europe and Australia. Often, quantifying cumulative effects of stormwater management is complicated by needing to separate its signal from the signal of urbanization itself, innate watershed characteristics that lead to a range of hydrologic and water quality responses, and the varying functions of multiple types of SCMs. Biases in geographic distribution of study areas, and size and impervious surface cover of watersheds studied also limit our understanding of responses. We propose hysteretic trajectories for how watershed function responds to increasing imperviousness and stormwater management. Even where impervious area is treated with SCMs, watershed function may not be restored to its predevelopment condition because of the lack of treatment of all stormwater generated from impervious surfaces; non-additive effects of individual SCMs; and persistence of urban effects beyond impervious surfaces. In most cases, pollutant load decreases largely result from run-off reductions rather than lowered solute or particulate concentrations. Understanding interactions between natural and built landscapes, including stormwater management strategies, is critical for successfully managing detrimental impacts of stormwater at the watershed scale.
