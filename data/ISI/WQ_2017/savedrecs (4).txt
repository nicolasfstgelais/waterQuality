Water Quality Considerations on the Rise as the Use of Managed Aquifer Recharge Systems Widens	WATER												Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a promising method of increasing water availability in water stressed areas by subsurface infiltration and storage, to overcome periods of drought, and to stabilize or even reverse salinization of coastal aquifers. Moreover, MAR could be a key technique in making alternative water resources available, such as reuse of communal effluents for agriculture, industry and even indirect potable reuse. As exemplified by the papers in this Special Issue, consideration of water quality plays a major role in developing the full potential for MAR application, ranging from the improvement of water quality to operational issues (e.g., well clogging) or sustainability concerns (e.g., infiltration of treated waste water). With the application of MAR expanding into a wider range of conditions, from deserts to urban and coastal areas, and purposes, from large scale strategic storage of desalinated water and the reuse of waste water, the importance of these considerations are on the rise. Addressing these appropriately will contribute to a greater understanding, operational reliability and acceptance of MAR applications, and lead to a range of engineered MAR systems that help increase their effectiveness to help secure the availability of water at the desired quality for the future.

However, the phosphorus (P) removal in BRC has been variable due to differences of soil properties in filter media. The objectives of this research were to identify and evaluate P accumulation in filter media and to quantify effluent P reduction in BRC. Each cell has a sand and fly ash media designed to remove phosphorous. Filter media were collected in 2014 across the cell surface and to a depth of 0.6 m to quantify the P accumulation. The mean total P (T-P) concentration increased over the seven years of operation, but the changes were not statistically significant. The average Mehlich-3 P (M3-P) and water-soluble P (WS-P) concentrations in the media profiles showed higher P accumulation in the top 0.15 m. The average M3-P and WS-P concentrations between 0.15 m to 0.30 m, and 0.30 m to 0.60 m were variable on all four BRCs media. The media with 5% fly ash significantly retained M3-P and WS-P over the top 0.15 m. Stormwater influent and effluent samples from three of the BRCs monitored over one year showed reductions in both P concentration (68% to 75%) and P mass (76% to 93%).																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							746	10.3390/w9100746								WOS:000414707500023

Investigation of Algal Biotoxin Removal during SWRO Desalination through a Materials Flow Analysis	WATER												The operation of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination facilities has become challenged by the increasing frequency and severity of harmful algal blooms (HABs). The efficiency of algal toxins removal during SWRO and pretreatment processes has critical human health implications. Therefore, a probabilistic materials flow analysis (pMFA) was developed to predict the removal of algal toxins in source water by various pretreatment configurations and operations during SWRO desalination. The results demonstrated that an appreciable quantity of toxins exists in the SWRO permeate (ng/L-mu g/L levels), the backwash of pretreatment, and final brine rejects (mu g/L-mg/L levels). Varying the pretreatment train configuration resulted in statistically significant differences in toxin removals, where higher removal efficiencies were evidenced in systems employing microfiltration/ultrafiltration (MF/UF) over granular media filtration (GMF). However, this performance depended on operational practices including coagulant addition and transmembrane pressures of MF/UF systems. Acute human health risks during lifetime exposure to algal toxins from ingestion of desalinated water were benign, with margins of safety ranging from 100 to 4000. This study highlights the importance of pretreatment steps during SWRO operation in the removal of algal toxins for managing marine HABs.

Besides the harmful algae blooms (HAB) and a severe prolonged drought, the bay has a strategic importancee.g., the eastern channel of the newly built water diversion will withdraw water from it (drinking water). This article presents the implementation of a three-dimensional (3D) numerical modelpioneering for the regionusing TELEMAC-3D. The aim was to investigate the 3D flows induced by moderate or extreme winds as well as by heating of the water surface. The findings showed that a windstorm increased the flow velocities (at least one order of magnitude, i.e., up to 10(-1)-10(-2) m/s) without altering significantly the circulation patterns; this occurred substantially for the heating scenario, which had, in contrast, a lower effect on velocities. In terms of the bay's management, the main implications are: (1) the withdrawals for drinking water and irrigation agriculture should stop working during windstorms and at least three days afterwards; (2) a heating of the water surface would likely increase the risk of development of HAB in the shallow areas, so that further assessments with a water quality module are needed to support advanced remediation measures; (3) the 3D model proves to be a necessary tool to identify high risk contamination areas e.g., for installation of new aquaculture systems.

J	Meng, XY; Wang, H				Meng, Xianyong; Wang, Hao			Significance of the China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets for the SWAT Model (CMADS) of East Asia	WATER												The high degree of spatial variability in climate conditions, and a lack of meteorological data for East Asia, present challenges to conducting surface water research in the context of the hydrological cycle. In addition, East Asia is facing pressure from both water resource scarcity and water pollution. The consequences of water pollution have attracted public concern in recent years. The low frequency and difficulty of monitoring water quality present challenges to understanding the continuous spatial distributions of non-point source pollution mechanisms in East Asia. The China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model (CMADS) was developed to provide high-resolution, high-quality meteorological data for use by the scientific community. Applying CMADS can significantly reduce the meteorological input uncertainty and improve the performance of non-point source pollution models, since water resources and non-point source pollution can be more accurately localised. In addition, researchers can make use of high-resolution time series data from CMADS to conduct spatial- and temporal-scale analyses of meteorological data. This Special Issue, Application of the China Meteorological Assimilation Driving Datasets for the SWAT Model (CMADS) in East Asia, provides a platform to introduce recent advances in the modelling of water quality and quantity in watersheds using CMADS and hydrological models, and underscores its application to a wide range of topics.

J	Meyers, G; Kapelan, Z; Keedwell, E				Meyers, Gregory; Kapelan, Zoran; Keedwell, Edward			Data-Driven Study of Discolouration Material Mobilisation in Trunk Mains	WATER												It has been shown that sufficiently high velocities can cause the mobilisation of discolouration material in water distribution systems. However, how much typical hydraulic conditions affect the mobilisation of discolouration material has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, results are presented from real turbidity and flow observations collected from three U.K. trunk main networks over a period of two years and 11 months. A methodology is presented that determines whether discolouration material has been mobilised by hydraulic forces and the origin of that material. The methodology found that the majority of turbidity observations over 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) could be linked to a preceding hydraulic force that exceeded an upstream pipe's hydraulically preconditioned state. The findings presented in this paper show the potential in proactively managing the hydraulic profile to reduce discolouration risk and improve customer service.

J	Tsai, LY; Chen, CF; Fan, CH; Lin, JY				Tsai, Lin-Yi; Chen, Chi-Feng; Fan, Chi-Hsuan; Lin, Jen-Yang			Using the HSPF and SWMM Models in a High Pervious Watershed and Estimating Their Parameter Sensitivity	WATER												Models are necessary tools for watershed management. However, applying watershed models is time consuming and requires technical knowledge, including model selection and validation. The objective of this study is to assess two commonly used watershed models and their parameter sensitivity to reduce model loadings and to gain a better understanding of the model performances. The Hydrological Simulation Program-Fortran (HSPF) model and Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) were applied to a mostly forested Taiwanese reservoir watershed with pollution from tea plantations. Statistical analysis showed that both models are suitable for the studied watershed, but the performances of the flow and water quality simulations are different. The mean flow simulated by SWMM was lower than the experimental observations. The HSPF model performed better, possibly because the soil in the study area is highly permeable and the HSPF model has more precise soil layer calculations. SWMM may underestimate the total phosphorous (TP) and suspended solid (SS) loads following small storm events in highly permeable watersheds. The Latin Hypercube-One factor At a Time (LH-OAT) method was used to determine the parameter sensitivity of the HSPF model and SWMM. In both of the models, the parameters related to infiltration and soil characteristics strongly affected the flow simulation, except when using the Horton infiltration method in the SWMM. Manning's roughness coefficient for pervious areas was more sensitive in SWMM than in the HSPF model because SWMM has fewer parameters.																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							780	10.3390/w9100780								WOS:000414707500057

However, an understanding of water-soil-vegetation dynamic interactions is needed to develop practical and effective solutions to sustain the globe's eco-environment and grassland agriculture, which depends on grasses, legumes, and other fodder or soil-building crops. This special issue is intended to be a platform for a discussion of the relevant scientific findings based on experimental and/or modeling studies. Its 12 peer-reviewed articles present data, novel analysis/modeling approaches, and convincing results of water-soil-vegetation interactions under historical and future climates. Two of the articles examine how lake/pond water quality is related to human activity and climate. Overall, these articles can serve as important references for future studies to further advance our understanding of how water, soil, and vegetation interactively affect the health and productivity of the Earth's ecosystem.

The aim is to identify environmental parameters governing spatial and temporal differences in phytoplankton density and composition. Physicochemical parameters, including nutrient concentrations, were determined in monthly surface water samples from 2015. The average concentration of key eutrophication indexes (i.e., total phosphorous (TP: 0.24 +/- 0.11 mgL(-1)), total nitrogen (TN: 2.96 +/- 1.60 mgL(-1)), and Chlorophyll a (Chl a: 38.5 +/- 11.5 mgm(-3))) substantially exceeded threshold values for eutrophic streams. Moreover, the eutrophication increased significantly downstream along the river reservoir as a consequence of an increasing fraction of agricultural and industrial land-use in the watershed. 103 phytoplankton species were identified, of which Chlorophyta was the dominated phylum (47 species), followed by Bacillariophyta (23 species) and Cyanophyta (18 species). No spatial difference in species distribution (ANOVA, p > 0.05) were found, while the temporal differences in species composition exhibited significant heterogeneity (ANOVA, p < 0.001). Phytoplankton abundance was highest in early summer (June and July), with maximum values increasing from 1.78 x 10(8) and 2.80 x 10(8) cellsL(-1) in upstream and middle reaches, respectively, to 4.18 x 10(8) cellsL(-1) furthest downstream. Cyanophyta, also known as Cyanobacteria and commonly referred to as blue-green algal, are known to constitute algae bloom in eutrophic systems. Common species are Microcystis marginata, Microcystis flos-aquae, and Oscillatoria sp. This was the dominant phyla during summer months, especially in the middle and lower reaches of the stream reservoir where it accounted for 88.9% of the phytoplankton community. Shannon weaver index (H') and Pielous's evenness index (J') were extremely low (1.91-2.43 for H' and 0.39-0.45 for J') in samples collected from the lower part of the stream during the period of algal bloom, indicating an imbalance in the phytoplankton communities. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that water temperature (WT) and possible pH, along with nitrate (NO3-N) and nitrite (NO2-N), were the most important explanatory parameters in regard to phytoplankton composition. This research provides an understanding of the role of physicochemical water quality parameters in governing algal blooms and phytoplankton composition in river reservoirs.																	2073-4441					OCT	2017	9	10							754	10.3390/w9100754								WOS:000414707500031

We present an overview of deep-well recharge applications which have taken place in the Netherlands over the last two decades. We present the purpose of each application, the issues which had to be resolved, the preventive measures which were taken to improve performance and the lessons learned from each experience. Examples are given of applications which aimed at the storage of water for drinking and other purposes such as irrigation, achieving environmental goals and disposal of wastewater. Applications aiming at drinking water production usually faced issues related to the quality of the abstracted water not meeting drinking water standards with respect to various elements, such as iron, manganese and arsenic. Storage of water in brackish aquifers was complicated by buoyancy effects making part of the recharged water irrecoverable. Recharge of water with the purpose of recovering declined groundwater tables and fighting seawater intrusion was hindered by clogging of the injection well while the disposal of wastewater was limited to aquifers of lower groundwater quality.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1201	1211		10.2166/ws.2017.032								WOS:000417944300001						
J	Zhang, J; Fu, YC; Shi, WL; Guo, WX				Zhang, Jian; Fu, Yi-Cheng; Shi, Wan-Li; Guo, Wen-Xian			A method for estimating watershed restoration feasibility under different treatment levels	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The restoration of watershed health can be influenced by ecological, technical and socio-economic factors. The paper presents a conceptual framework and typology to assess watershed ecological restoration based on the properties and processes of sustainable watershed development. According to multiple life stages, habitat properties and existing legal frameworks and applicable valuation approaches, the bio-indicator that integrates natural, political and socio-economic dimensions is proposed. With existing assessment results and official web-pages as references, evaluation systems concerning human impacts on aquatic systems are set forth. Suitable aquatic bio-indicators can standardize the monitoring methodology with respect to water quality, organic pollutants and pesticides, generation time, migration ability, saprobic status, taxonomic composition and diversity. A large number of fish-based indexes have been developed to monitor and manage river ecosystems. Biophysical and statistical models are being used to identify influential stream variables that correlate with macroinvertebrate indices. A probabilistic fuzzy hybrid model to assess river water quality is proposed. The method and process of ecological risk assessment are provided based on adaptive management principles. The environmental sustainability index (ESI) is used to estimate the degree of environmental restoration sustainability with the emergy triangle as a reference.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1232	1240		10.2166/ws.2017.017								WOS:000417944300005

The treatment scheme was: (1) As(III) in contaminated water is oxidized by arsenite-oxidizing bacteria fixed in the sponges in the reactor; (2) Fe(II) naturally existing in the water is oxidized by dissolved oxygen; (3) Fe(III) is precipitated as iron hydroxide and As(V) is co-precipitated with the iron hydroxide; and finally (4) the co-precipitates are fixed in the sponges. This system could remove As from As-contaminated water on a small scale and at low cost. The results showed that, after using the DHS reactor, As and Fe concentrations in the treated water were lower than water quality standards for drinking water when Fe(II) concentration in the influent was lower than 10 mg/L and the Fe/As ratio was higher than 6.67-8.42, with dependence on the Fe concentration. Additionally, even if Fe concentration is higher than 10 mg/L, the treatment system is still applicable if the pH of the influent is higher than 7 or the retention time is longer than 2 h.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1249	1259		10.2166/ws.2017.025								WOS:000417944300007

Investigation of natural organic matter (NOM) character and its removal in a chlorinated and chloraminated system at Rand Water, South Africa	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												In its natural environment, natural organic matter (NOM) is not problematic. However, during water treatment NOM does affect water quality specifically during the disinfection step, where if NOM is present it reacts with disinfectants resulting in the formation of disinfection by-products. To emphasize the importance of NOM monitoring during potable water treatment this study aimed to characterize NOM and evaluate NOM removal by a conventional water treatment plant considering seasonal trends. NOM was characterized by making use of NOM polarity and specific ultraviolet absorbance. NOM removal was monitored with high-performance size exclusion chromatography, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV254 analyses. The polarity rapid assessment method indicated that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic NOM fractions within the surface water increased during a period of heavy rain when floods occurred, but conversely decreased during an average rain season. Although NOM character showed variability during the 5-year study period, seasonal relationship during high and low flow seasons between aromatic NOM and total trihalomethane (TTHM) formation was not evident. Aromatic NOM was not the only precursor to TTHM formation, which stresses the need to implement advanced NOM characterization techniques during NOM monitoring to study reactivity of the individual NOM fraction with the disinfectant used at the water treatment plant.

In this study, we conducted high-frequency, synchronous field observations of meteorology, hydrology, and water quality to determine the relationship between sediment release rate and wind speed in the central region of Lake Taihu. We combined these results with our previous findings from other regions to establish the temporal-spatial variation in sediment release patterns for this lake. We then calculated the annual total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) release fluxes. We constructed an environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC) model; we then loaded the temporal-spatial variation parameters and simulated the effects on different TN and TP concentrations. Overall, the following results were observed: (1) the critical wind speed at which sediment was first suspended in the central region of the lake was 4 m/s, and the fitted curve of the sediment release rate and wind speed was r = 144.7x - 100 (R-2 = 0.851); and (2) the annual TN and TP release fluxes of Lake Taihu were approximately 3,086 and 740 tons, respectively. This research would provide a basis for decision-making regarding pollution control in this region.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1335	1346		10.2166/ws.2017.034								WOS:000417944300016

Evaluation of the potential impact of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and pumping scenarios on groundwater level in the Nile Delta aquifer	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and pumping scenarios on groundwater level by a three- dimensional groundwater model of the Nile Delta using MODFLOW software. The Nile Delta has highly intensive irrigation canal networks that share yearly about 35.5 km(3) of water. In this study, an integrated three- dimensional groundwater model is built considering the actual condition of the irrigation canals and their recharges of the Nile Delta aquifer. The model was calibrated for estimating the vertical and hydraulic conductivity. The model was run for three scenarios: (1) reduction of water depth in canals, (2) increasing pumping discharge from the aquifer and (3) combination between the first and second scenarios. Results reveal that the effect of increasing the pumping discharge on groundwater level in the Nile Delta is more significant than decreasing the water depth of the canals network due to the fact of the existence of the upper clay layer which reduces the amount of water penetrating and reaching the groundwater in the aquifer. The last scenario presents the worst case as the average drawdown reached 1.26 m, 1.7 m and 1.35 m in the western, central and eastern parts of the Nile Delta respectively. The study results should be taken in account for studying the saltwater intrusion and climate change impacts on the Nile Delta region.

Statistical assessment of water quality of a Ramsar site wetland	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												This study was conducted to evaluate the wetland water quality (WWQ) over a period of 3 years and establish relationships between these qualities using Ramsar site Uchali Wetland, Pakistan (32 degrees 33'N, 72 degrees 01'E). WWQ data obtained were subjected to summary statistics, generalized linear model (glm), correlation, covariance and cluster analysis. The glm of the monthly mean water indices showed that the mean returned for pH (2.57) was not significant while means for others were significant (p< 0.05). The correlation analysis of the WWQ indices indicated that 56% of the pairing indices were inversely correlated while 44% were directly correlated and three piles of clusters of WWQ indices were distinct. The wetland water is not very safe for drinking but safe for other non- domestic uses since it contains fewer microbes and the water health model as arrived at in this study provides a management protocol for wetland water.

Hydrochemical characteristics and quality assessment of urban groundwater in Urmia City, NW Iran	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and hydrochemical characteristics of urban groundwater in Urmia City, northwest of Iran. In order, 59 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for various anions and cations. Result shows that, mineral weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activity are the main hydrochemical processes controlling urban groundwater chemistry. The evaluation of groundwater geochemistry in the flow path beneath the urban area shows that, due to land use changes, the hydrochemical change occurs predominantly in electrical conductivity (EC), Cl- and NO3. The EC is increased in the direction of groundwater flow and in the last decade in industrial areas. According to the groundwater quality index values, most of the samples fit into the good quality class and samples with poor quality are located in the old residential, parks and agricultural areas of the city. The calculation of the irrigation water quality indices (Na%, sodium adsorption ratio, permeability index, residual sodium carbonate), and industrial water quality indices (Ryznar stability index, Langelier saturation index, Larson- Skold, Puckorius scaling index) indicated that the quality of water for irrigation purposes could be classified in the excellent to permissible categories. However, as for the industrial uses, the results also revealed that most of the samples could be classified in the aggressive and very aggressive categories.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1410	1425		10.2166/ws.2017.039								WOS:000417944300023

The analysis starts from the 'manual' Strategemata of Sextus Julius Frontinus, in addition to other references left by historians and chroniclers of different periods. It continues with the evaluation of the impact of the intentional actions of water contamination described by the ancient authors, according to present toxicological and health knowledge.																	1606-9749					OCT	2017	17	5					1490	1498		10.2166/ws.2017.043								WOS:000417944300030

Firstly, explanatory relationships were derived between an Antecedent Precipitation Index and the loads of thermo-tolerant coliforms and intestinal enterococci measured at three catchment outlets in the Gulf of Aigues-Mortes (southern France). Secondly, fecal bacterial loadings were simulated during summer season from 2006-2016, with a confidence interval arising from measurements uncertainties. On average, more than two rainstorms per summer season elevate bacterial loads at least by one order of magnitude, potentially leading to the degradation of bathing and fishing water quality observed in regulatory monitoring data. The results highlight the crucial importance of considering hydrological conditions in coastal water quality management. (C) 2017 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

For this purpose, 14 groundwater quality variables that had been collected from 27 groundwater sampling wells were used. Cluster analysis discriminated the total sampling stations into two groups. The classification was implemented by SVM using polynomial and RBF kernel methods. The respective sensitivity and specificity of this model were 0.89 and 0.80 while that of positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 0.89 and 0.86, respectively. The prediction of water quality index (WQI) was implemented using ANN. Despite the high correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed values of WQI(r = 0.90), the generalization ability of this model was low(r = 0.60) indicating the over-fitting of the model to the training data set.																	1947-3192	1947-3206				OCT-DEC	2017	8	4					37	53		10.4018/IJAEIS.2017100103								WOS:000417449400003

The research was carried out during the months of June, July and December of the years 2015-2016. Samples were taken in the following locations: La Arena, Los Angeles, Santa Gertrudis Norte and Sur, San Isidro, Carbonal, San Miguel, San Roque, Santa Rosa, Grecia and San Pedro de Poas. The results obtained are compared to the corresponding norms in the Regulation for Drinking Water Quality No 38924-S, which establishes the alert values of concentration of these anions. Alterations shown by data are related to possible contamination originated in human activities such as industry, population growth and sewage management, among other factors that may be affecting the areas under study. As a relevant event, the analysis stablishes that the aqueducts ASADA (Administrated by Associations) of La Arena and El Cajon are the ones that represent the greatest risk for environmental and human health, since there were obtained values above the norm. For this reason, anions concentrations shall be monitored as contamination indicators.																	0379-3982	2215-3241				OCT-DEC	2017	30	4					15	27		10.18845/tm.v30i4.3408								WOS:000417410200002

TOURISM MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES												Progress towards a more sustainable tourism sector at an enterprise level has been slow, even though a number of studies have developed a variety of indicators. Indeed, so many indicators have been developed that industry seems to be overwhelmed by choice, leading to inaction, poor decision-making or adoption of the easiest option. Perhaps, simplicity is theway forward. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a number of studies that have proposed a variety of indicator themes to identify commonalities among them that may serve as a starting point for enterprises to move towards a more sustainable path. Seven key indicator themes emerged, including job creation, business viability, quality of life, water quality, wastemanagement, energy conservation andmaintenance of community integrity. The term 'indicator theme' is used for it identifies what needs to be assessed to monitor progress towards sustainable tourism, while simultaneously recognizing that specific measurement metrics may vary depending as they are site, context and enterprise specific.

ELM evaluation model of regional groundwater quality based on the crow search algorithm	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												According to the multi-parameter evaluation of groundwater quality, an evaluation model of groundwater quality based on the improved Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was proposed to resolve fuzziness of the water quality evaluation and incompatibility of water parameters. A training sample set and testing sample set were randomly generated according to the classification standards of groundwater quality, then Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) was used to optimize the input weights and thresholds of hidden-layer neurons of the ELM; thus, the CSA-ELM evaluation model of groundwater quality was constructed based on optimization of the ELM by the CSA. Base on the training sample set and testing sample set, the CSA-ELM model was tested. The test results indicate that the evaluating precision and generalization ability of the CSA-ELM model reach a high level and can be used for comprehensive evaluations of groundwater quality. The Jiansanjiang Administration in Heilongjiang Province, China, was used as an example; the groundwater quality of 15 farms in this region was evaluated based on the CSA-ELM model. The groundwater quality in this region was generally good, and the groundwater quality appeared to have spatial distribution characteristics. Compared with the Nemerow Index Method (NIM), the CSA-ELM evaluation model of groundwater quality is more reasonable and can be used for the comprehensive evaluation of groundwater quality. The stability of the NIM, ELM model, back propagation (BP) model and CSA-ELM model was analyzed using the theory of serial number summation and Spearman's correlation coefficient. The stability of the NIM and BP model in groundwater quality evaluation was poor, while the stability of the ELM model and CSA-ELM model was relatively superior. The ranked results of stability are CSA-ELM model > ELM model > NIM > BP model. The reliability of the NIM, ELM model, BP model and CSA-ELM model was analyzed using the theory of distinction degree. The reliability of the NIM was not good, although its distinction degree was large; the distinction degrees of the ELM model, BP model and CSA-ELM model were close to each other. The ranked results of reliability are CSA-ELM model > ELM model > BP model. The CSA-ELM model can provide a stable and reliable evaluation method for the evaluation of related fields and thus has important practical applicability.

Monitoring river water quality with transplanted bryophytes: A methodological review	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The aim of this literature review, which considers 47 articles published between 1989 and 2015, is to ascertain the current status of the active biomonitoring technique for assessing water quality and to evaluate the degree to which different aspects of the method have been standardized. Use of the tool is largely limited to Europe (83% of the articles reviewed). The technique has been used to biomonitor inorganic contaminants (in 96% of the studies) and, to a lesser extent, organic contaminants (4% of the studies). Only 25% of the articles concern methodological aspects of the technique. Moreover, most authors (78%) have only published one article on the topic, and many different protocols have been used in the various studies. As a result, the technique is not standardized, which hampers comparison of the results of different studies. We propose a protocol that would facilitate use of the technique for routine monitoring of the quality of river waters.

To assess the biomonitoring potential of the Caryophyllaeid tapeworm Adenoscolex oreini and the possible impact of water quality on fish species, a study was carried out in three lakes with marked eutrophication and pollution gradients. The A. oreini infection level in three host fish species of the genus Schizothorax and corresponding fish health status were determined. The pattern of cestode infection varied significantly in the three fish species across the pollution gradient. The prevalence of infection in two fish species (Schizothorax esocinus and S. curvifrons) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the eutrophic lake than in the reference lake, whereas in S. niger, the maximum was reached in the hypereutrophic lake. The estimated marginal mean intensity and other infection indices varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the inter and intra-pollution gradients of lakes. Multivariate statistical analysis results revealed maximum cestode infection in the eutrophic lake. An altered seasonal pattern was observed in the highly stressed lake. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and condition factor values were significantly greater in fish collected from the reference lake than in those collected from the other lakes. A significant negative relationship between GSI and cestode prevalence was observed in the hypereutrophic lake as compared to least eutrophic lake. These findings indicate that infection indices of the Caryophyllaeid tapeworm and health attributes of fish can act as surrogates for the environmental quality of deteriorated lentic water bodies of the north-western Himalayan region, which is currently undergoing environmental degradation.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2017	81						503	513		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.06.025								WOS:000417229100049

O.; Herlihy, Alan T.; Hughes, Robert M.; Callisto, Marcos			An improved macroinvertebrate multimetric index for the assessment of wadeable streams in the neotropical savanna	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Multimetric indices (MMIs) have been successfully used to assess ecological conditions in freshwater ecosystems worldwide, and provide an important management tool especially in countries where biological indicators are fostered by environmental regulations. Nonetheless, for the neotropics, the few published papers are limited to small local scales and lack standardized sampling protocols. To fill the gaps left by previous studies, we propose a stream MMI that reflects anthropogenic impacts by using macroinvertebrate assemblage metrics from a data set of 190 sites collected from four hydrologic units in the Parana and Sao Francisco River Basins, southeastern Brazil. Sites were selected through use of a probabilistic survey design allowing us to infer ecological condition to the total of 9432 kilometers of wadeable streams in the target population in the four hydrologic units. We used a filtering process to determine the least- and most-disturbed sites based on their water quality, physical habitat structure, and land use. To develop the MMI, we followed a stepwise procedure to screen our initial set of biological metrics for influence of natural variation, responsiveness and discriminance to disturbances, sampling variability, and redundancy. The final MMI is the sum of 7 scaled assemblage metrics describing different aspects of macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics: Ephemeroptera richness, % Gastropoda individuals, Shannon Wiener diversity index, % sensitive taxa richness, % scraper individuals, temporarily attached taxa richness, and gill respiration taxa richness. The MMI clearly distinguished the least-disturbed sites from the most-disturbed sites and showed a significant negative response to anthropogenic stressors. Of the total length of wadeable streams in the study area, 38%, 35%, and 27% were classified by the MMI as being in good, fair, and poor condition, respectively. By reducing the subjectivity of site selection, rigorously selecting the set of reference sites, and following a standardized metric screening method, we developed a robust MMI to assess and monitor ecological condition in neotropical savanna streams. This improved MMI provides an effective ecological tool to guide decision makers and managers in developing and implementing improved, cost-effective environmental policies, regulations, and monitoring of those systems.

Between June 2014 and March 2015, 200 specimens were sampled from two fish farms: one with a semi-intensive system and the other with an extensive system (100 fish from each farm: 50 during the dry season and 50 during the rainy season). Fifteen species of parasites were found, with seasonal variations of some according to the farming system. In the semi-intensive fish farm, there was greater prevalence of infection during the dry season. Also, Urocleidoides paradoxus, Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus, Goezia leporini and Rhabdochona (Rhabdochona) acuminata presented differences in their parasitism rates between the seasons. In the extensive fish farm, no variation in the prevalence of infection was observed between the seasons and two species Tereancistrum parvus and G. leporini demonstrated differences only regarding the mean intensity of infection. The data presented here may help fish farmers to understand the parasite dynamics of L. macrocephalus in farming systems during the dry and rainy seasons in the state of Acre.																	1984-2961					OCT-DEC	2017	26	4					419	426		10.1590/S1984-29612017062								WOS:000417026500003

However, it remains challenging because of hydrological uncertainties in the single scale. A multimodal water quality prediction model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and support vector regression (SVR) is proposed to address this problem. Based on the idea of decomposition and ensemble, dissolved oxygen (DO), one representation in water quality, is firstly decomposed into several intrinsic mode functions, which are then modeled by the SVR in each mode. According to the reconstruction theory of the EEMD, the subresults predicted by the SVR of each mode are summarized into the final results. The proposed model is evaluated by the weekly DO concentrations during 2014-2015 from one monitoring station of the Jialing River, China. A back propagation neural network and the standard SVR models are used for a comparison study. The results demonstrate that the addressed model, combining the mode representation capacity of the EEMD and the nonlinear mapping of the SVR, has the best prediction performance among the peer models.

Fish juveniles (length: 10.63 +/- 0.980 cm, weight: 9.030 +/- 1.40g) were stocked after acclimatization. A total of 3 treatments were tested following 2 replications i.e. first treatment (T-1 Squid feed), second treatment (T-2 Tubifex feed) and third treatment (T-3 pellet feed). Juveniles were fed with 5% of total biomass twice in a day. At the end, higher growth increments were found such as length and weight in average, T-1=15.01 +/- 0.33cm and 15.80 +/- 0.01g, T-3=14.13 +/- 0.76cm and 13.35 +/- 0.67g whereas in T-2=11.80 +/- 0.96cm and 10.47 +/- 1.19g lower growth were found. Specific growth rate (SGR) were obtained 1.160, 0.960 and 1.110 in T-1, T-2 and T-3 individually differing statistically from all treatment groups. Similar situation was found in values of the condition factor which remained as 0.610, 0.720 and 0.620 for T1, T2 and T3, respectively. Feed conversion (FCR) were found to be non-significant among all treatments (P>0.05). Survival rate were 90% in T-1 which was highest than T-2(50%) and T-3 (80%). Water quality remained as temperature (25.2 +/- 0.20 degrees C), dissolved oxygen (5.2 +/- 0.11mg/L), pH (6.9 +/- 0.15), ammonia (0.48 +/- 0.02 1mg/L) and hardness (118 +/- 2.4 mg/L). Our results indicated that better growth increment can be achieved on squid or pellet feed and so it is suggested that in similar culture conditions of Snakehead will be more profitable on pellet feed followed by squid feed.																	0030-9923					OCT	2017	49	5					1871	1877		10.17582/journal.pjz/2017.49.5.1871.1877								WOS:000416295400040

BTEX compounds in water - future trends and directions for water treatment	WATER SA												BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene) compounds are common water resource and potable water pollutants that are often left undetected and untreated by municipal treatment systems in spite of the negative repercussions associated with their ingestion. The US EPA has classified these pollutants as priority pollutant, yet they are persistently present in a variety of water resources. In this review paper, we highlight the sources and reported concentrations of BTEX compounds in water and explore historical remediation techniques that have been applied such as bioremediation and natural attenuation. We also highlight emerging possibilities and future directions for remediation techniques, such as nanotechnology-based materials and novel green materials (tannins) that can be applied to ensure removal of these compounds in water.

J	Lethea, L				Lethea, Lerato			Impact of water hardness on energy consumption of geyser heating elements	WATER SA												South Africa is an electricity-stressed country with a growing energy demand. Globally, hot water appliances are major consumers of electricity. Poor water quality for domestic purposes is a concern that may affect the efficiency of hot water appliances. Therefore, the Eskom Research, Testing, and Development Business Unit embarked on a study to examine total water hardness as a chemical parameter that may impact the power consumption of electrical geyser heating elements. An accelerated scaling method was developed to lime-scale the geyser heating elements for about 2 to 3 months. In addition, the geyser heating elements were tested with and without electronic descaler technology. The results showed that the accelerated scaling method developed for shortening the scaling time of geyser heating elements was successful. Furthermore, the results proved that scale formation of 1.5 kW and 3 kW geyser heating elements due to high total water hardness increased the power consumption by approximately 4% to 12%. This paper also presents energy-efficient electronic descaler technology as an alternative treatment of scaling for geyser heating elements.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				OCT	2017	43	4					614	625		10.4314/wsa.v43i4.09								WOS:000417004800009

The use of bioassays to assess the toxicity of sediment in an acid mine drainage impacted river in Gauteng (South Africa)	WATER SA												Sediment contamination may occur from various anthropogenic activities, such as mining-, agricultural- and industrial practices. Many of the contaminants arising from these activities enter the aquatic system and precipitate from the surrounding water, becoming bound to sediment particles. These bound contaminants may reach concentrations higher than in the overlying water. Although water quality may be acceptable, an aquatic system may still be at risk if the contaminated sediment were to be disturbed through flooding, bioturbation or changes in the water chemistry. These contaminants may then desorb into the water column and prove detrimental to life forms in contact and dependent on that water source. Sediment quality monitoring has been a widespread international initiative and has led to the development of sediment toxicity assessment methods. This study focused on sediment bioassays, namely, Phytotoxkit, Ostracodtoxkit F and the Diptera bioassay, in assessing sediment quality of the Tweelopiespruit-Rietspruit-Bloubankspruit river system in Gauteng, South Africa. This river is known to have been impacted by acid mine drainage (AMD) since late August, 2002. Exposure of river sediment from 7 sampling sites to these bioassays provided an eco-toxicological estimation of the acute toxicity and chronic toxicity emanating from the contaminated sediments. Physico-chemical analyses revealed higher levels of sediment contamination closer to the mine. The bioassays displayed a similar trend with greater sensitivities to sediments closer to the mine and lower sensitivities to the less contaminated sites further downstream. AMD was therefore the main driver for sediment contamination. Whilst not all contaminants were bioavailable, statistical analysis showed that there were significant correlations between the elevated contaminant concentrations closer to the mine and bioassay responses.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				OCT	2017	43	4					673	683		10.4314/wsa.v43i4.15								WOS:000417004800015

Biosensors for the detection of Escherichia coli	WATER SA												The supply of safe potable water, free from pathogens and chemicals, requires routine analyses and the application of several diagnostic techniques. Apart from being expensive, many of the detection methods require trained personnel and are often time-consuming. With drastic climate changes, severe droughts, increases in population and pollution of natural water systems, the need to develop ultrasensitive, low-cost and hand-held, point-of-use detection kits to monitor water quality is critical. Although Escherichia coli is still considered the best indicator of water quality, cell numbers may be below detection limits, or the cells may be non-culturable and thus only detected by DNA amplification. A number of different biosensors have been developed to detect viable, dead or non-culturable microbial cells and chemicals in water. This review discusses the differences in these biosensors and evaluates the application of microfluidics in the design of ultra-sensitive nano-biosensors.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				OCT	2017	43	4					707	721		10.4314/wsa.v43i4.17								WOS:000417004800017						
J	Greenway, M				Greenway, Margaret			Stormwater wetlands for the enhancement of environmental ecosystem services: case studies for two retrofit wetlands in Brisbane, Australia	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Constructed stormwater wetlands are examples of 'blue-green' ecological engineering in the urban environment providing a range of ecosystem services. A study was undertaken in Brisbane, Australia to examine the enhancement of environmental ecosystem services in 2 retrofit wetlands. Originally concrete drainage channels in existing residential catchments, a series of wetlands and ponds were created i.e. green infrastructure in a brownfield setting. Boardwalks, pathways and interpretive signage were incorporated into the design. Golden Pond wetland was only 0.2% of the catchment whereas Bridgewater Creek - Bowie's Flat wetland was 0.4% of the catchment. The larger 0.8 ha Bridgewater Creek wetland had an overflow bypass channel. Water quality (suspended solids and nutrients) and the diversity of aquatic macro invertebrates were monitored for 2-4 years after construction. During storm events suspended solids increased at Golden Pond due to resuspension from the high velocities in this small linear flow system. Resuspension was minimised at Bridgewater Creek due to the by-pass channel. During dry weather suspended solids in both wetlands increased due to resuspension from the activity of waterbirds. Both wetlands were effective in reducing nutrient concentrations especially NOx-N and PO4-P, attributed to biological uptake; but during dry periods NH4-N increased within the system. The concept of irreducible background concentrations in wetland systems is discussed. Open water and aquatic vegetation provided habitats for macroinvertebrates. Species richness increased by more than 50% in both stormwater wetlands, compared to the concrete drains. Wetland sizing and design are essential parameters for water quality improvement and biodiversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, WJ; Li, LJ; Qiu, GY				Li, Wenjiang; Li, Linjun; Qiu, Guoyu			Energy consumption and economic cost of typical wastewater treatment systems in Shenzhen, China	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Wastewater treatment, a great potential alternative to alleviate water shortage, has been attached more and more importance in China, and has been developing very fast. The quantity of wastewater treatment plants in China has increased up to 3272 in June 2013, and has a total handling capacity of 0.14 billion t/day. However, wastewater treatment requires to consuming a lot of energy, and even energy consumption is often the main operation cost of wastewater treatment systems. Thus, it is very necessary to explore energy consumption of wastewater treatment systems and its influential factors, and seek for some possible pathways to save energy and lower cost. In this paper, we investigated the average energy consumption per unit wastewater treatment in Shenzhen, and analyzed the effect of treatment capacity and treatment technology on the energy cost per unit of wastewater treatment. The results showed that the average energy consumption of wastewater treatment plants in Shenzhen was about 0.20 +/- 0.06 kWh/t, much less than those in some developed countries. This result may be related to the advanced wastewater treatment plants newly constructed and the low water quality requirements of wastewater treatment in Shenzhen. As the key to wastewater treatment, biochemical treatment sub-process consumed 50-70% of total energy cost in wastewater treatment. Secondly, the larger the treat capacity, the lower the energy cost per unit of wastewater treatment was. And the difference of treatment technologies can also significantly affect the energy consumption per unit of wastewater treatment. Finally, labor cost and electricity consumption respectively covered about 30.1% and 26.3% of total economic cost in the three typical wastewater treatment plants in original Shenzhen. Thus, upgrading treatment machines & equipment and improving management level are two effective alternatives to decrease energy consumption and lower total economic cost of wastewater treatment plants in Shenzhen and even China.

However, transitions towards regenerative urban built environments that widely incorporate sustainable drainage systems are "per se" innovative journeys that encounter barriers which include the limited evidence on the performance of these systems which, in many countries, are still unknown to professionals and decision makers. A further important barrier is the frequently poor interaction among stakeholders; key items such as sustainable drainage systems provide collective benefits which also demand collective efforts. With the aim of overcoming such innovation-driven barriers, six showcase projects (including rain gardens acting as infiltration basins, swales and a green roof) to demonstrate the feasibility and suitability of sustainable drainage systems were developed and/or retrofitted in two cities of the Valencian region of Spain as a part of an European project, and their performance was monitored for a year. The data acquired, after being fully analyzed and presented to a group of key regional stakeholders, is proving to be a valuable promoter of the desired transition (for instance in influencing the support to SuDS in recent regional legislation). This paper presents detailed data on how these urban ecological drainage infrastructure elements reduce runoff (peak flows and volumes) and improve its quality, contributing to the goal of healthier and livable cities. The data show that the pilots have good hydraulic performance under a typical Mediterranean climate and also provided water quality benefits. Furthermore, it shows how engagement can contribute to smarter governance in the sense of smoothing the difficulties faced by innovation when being presented, understood, and endorsed by professionals and decision-makers in the field of stormwater management. Finally, activities undertaken in the demonstration sites monitored, show how they have been drivers of innovation and transition towards a new stormwater paradigm in Spain, serving as a reference to other urban areas in the Mediterranean.

J	Khadim, FK; Su, HB; Xu, LN				Khadim, Fahad Khan; Su, Hongbo; Xu, Lina			A spatially weighted optimization model (SWOM) for salinity mapping in Florida Bay using Landsat images and in situ observations	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The surface water salinity of Florida Bay has been deteriorating due to anthropogenic interventions and natural disturbances for almost over a century, yet astoundingly, this issue perceiving limited exposure. Driven by this, this study developed a spatially weighted optimization model (SWOM) to predict the dry and wet season's surface water salinity in Florida Bay. The modeling was carried out using in situ salinity observations from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for 1998-2001 coupled with processed Landsat TM 5 images for corresponding dates. A mathematical optimization formulation was developed for the model, which was solved using a gradient-based optimization solver, following the clustering of the study area into a set of 3 km * 3 km grids. To train the model so as to infer optimum values of decision variables, the optimization process was simulated for each 3 km pixel using two-third randomly selected samples, which yielded acceptable R-squared values of 0.92 and 0.90 for dry and wet seasons and root mean squared error (RMSE) values of 1.8 and 1.73 parts per thousand (ppt) for dry and wet seasons, respectively. The validation of the model with the remaining one-third samples also provided good statistical correlation, as the R-squared values found were 0.91 (dry) and 0.89 (wet); and the validated RMSE values obtained were 1.92 ppt (dry) and 1.84 ppt (wet), providing strong inference of the model's consistency in estimating surface water salinity. Lastly, the model was applied to six different temporal cases (i.e., dry and wet seasons of 1996-97, 2004-05, and 2016). Upon application, the model provided reasonable accuracy except for showing errors in some regions for 2004-05. The surface water salinity mapping carried out using SWOM not only provided meaningful spatial and temporal variations of surface water salinity but also highlighted the wet season hypersaline peaks within the central Florida Bay region.

Field assessment of surface runoff, sediment yield and soil erosion in the opencast mines in Chirimiri area, Chhattisgarh, India	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Chirimiri Coal field is located in the Koriya district of Chhattisgarh state of India. It lies in the valley of the Hasdeo River and is spread over 125 km(2) area. Ever increasing problem of declining forest resources and water quality is a cause of concern particularly due to excessive soil erosion resulting in soil sediment deposition from the overburdened dump. Dwindling resources has compelled the policy makers to search for alternatives such as waste lands and mined areas to improve soil and water resources for use in agriculture and allied sectors while maintaining the local ecology and hydrology. Most Opencast mines release huge amount of mining wastes in the form of overburden dump (OBD) materials that are prone to soil erosion and also create problems of sedimentation and deteriorating water quality, affecting agriculture. Historical daily rainfall data for 21 years and daily surface runoff as estimated by SCS-Curve Number method were analysed. Sediment yield was estimated at lower end of erosion face of OBD and near drainage outlet of opencast mine. Assessment of soil erosion from OBD materials was made byRevised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) method and was compared with direct field measurements by placing plastic sheets in downstream portion of OBD. As a result monsoon rainfall constitutes 91.6 percent of the annual rainfall and surface runoff constitutes 31.7 percent of monsoon rainfall. The surface runoff was found to be 4133 m(3)/ha while the sediment yield of drainage effluent was negligible. The soil loss from OBD as estimated by the RUSLE method (62.7 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) was quite close (+13.2 percent) to the direct field measurement 54.44 t ha(-1). The sediment samples from OBD were found acidic in nature and exhibited low values of Electrical Conductivity (EC), Organic Content (OC), Water Holding Capacities (WHC), and Available Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K). For controlling soil erosion of OBD, mechanical and vegetative measures have been suggested along with installation of sediment traps inside and outside the mines. There is good scope to backfill the mines with the OBD in the form of well laid out terraces to support plantation. This can be eventually used for leguminous fodder/grass production.

Carbonate system parameters and anthropogenic CO2 in the North Aegean Sea during October 2013	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Data of A(T) (total alkalinity) and C-T (total inorganic carbon) collected during October 2013, on a N-S transect crossing the North of Lemnos basin allowed to identify the peculiarities of the CO2 system in the North Aegean Sea and estimate the anthropogenic CO2 (C-ANT) concentrations. Extremely high concentrations of A(T) and C-T were recorded in the upper layer of the North Aegean reflecting the high loads of A(T) and C-T by the brackish BSW (Black Sea Water) outflowing through the Dardanelles strait and by the rivers runoff. Both A(T) and C-T exhibit strong negative linear correlation with salinity in the upper layer (0-20 m). Investigation of the A(T)-S relationship along with the salinity adjustment of A(T) revealed excess alkalinity throughout the water column in relation to the surface waters implying a possible occurrence of non carbonate alkalinity inputs as well as of other processes that take place probably over the extended shelves and contribute to the alkalinity surplus. The intermediate layer occupied by the Modified Levantine Intermediate Water (MLIW) mass exhibits the lowest C-T and A(T) concentrations, while rather elevated A(T) and C-T concentrations characterize the North Aegean Deep Water (NAgDW) mass filling the deep layer of the North of Lemnos basin linked to previous dense water formation episodes. High anthropogenic CO2 content was detected at intermediate and deep layers of the North Aegean reflecting the effective transportation of the absorbed atmospheric CO2 from the surface to the deeper waters via the dense water formation episodes. The MLIW layer is more affected by the penetration of C-ANT than the NAgDW that fills the deep part of the basin. The observed variability of C-ANT distribution reflects the influence of the intensity of dense water formation events, of the different theta/S properties of the newly formed dense waters as well as of the diverse submarine pathways followed by the cascading dense waters. The invasion of C-ANT has lead to more acidic conditions and to lower saturation degree of calcium carbonate in relation to the preindustrial era. The findings of this study provide baseline information about the carbonate system properties of the North Aegean and highlight its active role in sequestering and storing anthropogenic CO2.																	0278-4343	1873-6955				OCT 1	2017	149				SI		69	81		10.1016/j.csr.2017.04.002								WOS:000416395500006

In present investigation, cytotoxic profiling was documented from Faisalabad, Sargodha and Gujranwala cities, Pakistan, followed by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) treatments (UV and gamma radiation). The cytotoxicity was evaluated by Allium cepa, haemolytic and brine shrimp bioassays. Independent variables such as gamma radiation absorbed dose, H2O2, TiO2 concentrations, reaction time, pH and shaking speed were optimized using statistical techniques. The raw soap and detergent wastewater showed cytotoxicity up to high extent. At optimized conditions, >94% degradation was achieved both in case of UV (exposure time 100 min, TiO2 concentration 5.93 g/L, H2O2 4.39%, pH 6.50 and shaking speed 110 rpm) and gamma radiation (12.69 kGy absorbed dose in the presence of 4.65% H2O2) treated samples and water quality parameters (WQP) also improved significantly. The cytotoxicity reduced sharply as a result of AOPs treatment at optimized conditions. From the results, it is evident that AOPs under investigation could be used for the degradation and cytotoxicity reduction of soap and detergent wastewater.																	0253-5106					OCT	2017	39	5					706	717										WOS:000416390000001						
J	Salomons, E; Skulovich, O; Ostfeld, A				Salomons, Elad; Skulovich, Olya; Ostfeld, Avi			Battle of Water Networks DMAs: Multistage Design Approach	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Looped water distribution system (WDS) re-partitioning to district metering areas (DMAs) gained popularity as an effective technique to manage the system and detect and reduce system leakages. However, to apply this method to real WDS, various system properties should be taken into account to ensure efficient water supply. The battle of water networks district meter areas (BWNDMA) is a challenging problem that requires the redesign of the E-Town city network in Colombia. The water utility is looking to repartition the network into manageable DMAs while supplying future demands, keeping minimum and maximum pressures, improving water quality, operating the network at uniform low pressures, balancing water sources, and meeting their seasonal production capabilities. The problem is stated as a rnultiobjective optimization problem with DMA partitioning being one of eight equal-weighted objectives. They may be reached by (1) closing, opening, or replacing existing pipes, (2) adding parallel pipes, (3) managing storage tanks, pressure valves, and flow-control valves, and (4) utilizing pumps in the dry season. With no known analytical methodology to optimize-such a large mixed-integer nonlinear problem, a major difficulty is to find a feasible solution; therefore, a multistage classic engineering approach was taken. First, source allocation and general design were carried out for the operational zones. Then, tank volumes were adjusted to meet their constraints. At this stage, DMAs were introduced to meet pressure regulations. Finally, detailed design and fine-tuning of the operations were carried out. This paper describes the taken procedures and obtained results for the redesign of the E-Town network. (c) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Within the mid-Columbia River system, there is currently a lack of specific solutions for predicting how coordinated operational decisions can mitigate the impacts of total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation while satisfying multiple additional policy and hydropower generation objectives. In this study, a reduced-order TDG uptake equation is developed that predicts tailrace TDG at seven hydropower facilities on the mid-Columbia River. The equation is incorporated into a general multiobjective river, reservoir, and hydropower optimization tool as a prioritized operating goal within a broader set of system-level objectives and constraints. A test case is presented to assess the response of TDG and hydropower generation when TDG supersaturation is optimized to remain under state water-quality standards. Satisfaction of TDG as an operating goal is highly dependent on whether constraints that limit TDG uptake are implemented at a higher priority than generation requests. According to the model, an opportunity exists to reduce TDG supersaturation and meet hydropower generation requirements by shifting spillway flows to different time periods. A coordinated effort between all project owners is required to implement systemwide optimized solutions that satisfy the operating policies of all stakeholders.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fate and transport models are powerful tools that aid authorities in making unbiased decisions for developing sustainable management strategies. Application of pollution fate and transport models in semi-arid regions has been challenging because of unique hydrological characteristics and limited data availability. Significant temporal and spatial variability in rainfall events, complex interactions between soil, vegetation and topography, and limited water quality and hydrological data due to insufficient monitoring network make it a difficult task to develop reliable models in semi-arid regions. The performances of these models govern the final use of the outcomes such as policy implementation, screening, economical analysis, etc. In this study, a deterministic distributed fate and transport model, SWAT, is applied in Lake Mogan Watershed, a semi-arid region dominated by dry agricultural practices, to estimate nutrient loads and to develop the water budget of the watershed. To minimize the discrepancy due to limited availability of historical water quality data extensive efforts were placed in collecting site-specific data for model inputs such as soil properties, agricultural practice information and land use. Moreover, calibration parameter ranges suggested in the literature are utilized during calibration in order to obtain more realistic representation of Lake Mogan Watershed in the model. Model performance is evaluated using comparisons of the measured data with 95%CI for the simulated data and comparison of unit pollution load estimations with those provided in the literature for similar catchments, in addition to commonly used evaluation criteria such as Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency, coefficient of determination and percent bias. These evaluations demonstrated that even though the model prediction power is not high according to the commonly used model performance criteria, the calibrated model may provide useful information in the comparison of the effects of different management practices on diffuse pollution and water quality in Lake Mogan Watershed.

However, in certain areas, wars and instability have left millions of people setting in refugee camps and dangerous regions where infrastructures are lacking and rapid diagnostics of water quality and medical status are critical. In this work, microfluidic testing chips and photometric setups are developed in cheap and portable way to detect nitrate concentrations in water. The performed test is designed to work according to the Griess procedure. Moreover, to make it simple and usable in areas of low resource settings, commercially available Arduino mega and liquid crystal display (LCD) shield are utilized to process and display results, respectively. For evaluation purposes, different local products of tap water, bottled drinking water, and home-filter treated water samples were tested using the developed setup. A calibration curve with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.98 was obtained when absorbance of the prepared standard solutions was measured as a function of the concentrations. In conclusion, this is the first step towards a compact, portable, and reliable system for nitrate detection in water for point-of-care applications.																	1424-8220					OCT	2017	17	10							2345	10.3390/s17102345								WOS:000414931500187

Their evolution is affected by several factors, among which are runoff and sediment discharge. The spatial-temporal evolution of seven river islands in the Nanjing Section of the Yangtze River of China was examined using TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM (Enhanced Thematic Mapper)+ images from 1985 to 2015 at five year intervals. The following approaches were applied in this study: the threshold value method, binarization model, image registration, image cropping, convolution and cluster analysis. Annual runoff and sediment discharge data as measured at the Datong hydrological station upstream of Nanjing section were also used to determine the roles and impacts of various factors. The results indicated that: (1) TM/ETM+ images met the criteria of information extraction of river islands; (2) generally, the total area of these islands in this section and their changing rate decreased over time; (3) sediment and river discharge were the most significant factors in island evolution. They directly affect river islands through silting or erosion. Additionally, anthropocentric influences could play increasingly important roles.																	1424-8220					OCT	2017	17	10							2213	10.3390/s17102213								WOS:000414931500055

These campaign measurements yields a non-uniform spatio-temporal sampled data structure to characterize complex dynamics phenomena. In this work, we propose an enhanced statistical interpolation method to provide water quality managers with statistically interpolated representations of spatial-temporal dynamics. Specifically, our proposal makes efficient use of the a priori available information of the quality parameter measurements through Support Vector Regression (SVR) based on Mercer's kernels. The methods are benchmarked against previously proposed methods in three segments of the Machangara River and one segment of the San Pedro River in Ecuador, and their different dynamics are shown by statistically interpolated spatial-temporal maps. The best interpolation performance in terms of mean absolute error was the SVR with Mercer's kernel given by either the Mahalanobis spatial-temporal covariance matrix or by the bivariate estimated autocorrelation function. In particular, the autocorrelation kernel provides with significant improvement of the estimation quality, consistently for all the six water quality variables, which points out the relevance of including a priori knowledge of the problem.

Although several analytical techniques based on electrochemistry or biosensors have been developed for the detection of toxic compounds, most of them are time-consuming, inaccurate, or cumbersome for practical applications. More recently, microbial fuel cell (MFC)-based biosensors have drawn increasing interest due to their sustainability and cost-effectiveness, with applications ranging from the monitoring of anaerobic digestion process parameters (VFA) to water quality detection (e.g., COD, BOD). When a MFC runs under correct conditions, the voltage generated is correlated with the amount of a given substrate. Based on this linear relationship, several studies have demonstrated that MFC-based biosensors could detect heavy metals such as copper, chromium, or zinc, as well as organic compounds, including p-nitrophenol (PNP), formaldehyde and levofloxacin. Both bacterial consortia and single strains can be used to develop MFC-based biosensors. Biosensors with single strains show several advantages over systems integrating bacterial consortia, such as selectivity and stability. One of the limitations of such sensors is that the detection range usually exceeds the actual pollution level. Therefore, improving their sensitivity is the most important for widespread application. Nonetheless, MFC-based biosensors represent a promising approach towards single pollutant detection.																	1424-8220					OCT	2017	17	10							2230	10.3390/s17102230								WOS:000414931500072	28956857

The research site was located at the waterfront of Li-tze Lake in Pitou Township, Taiwan. A GWF was established to evaluate the improvement of water quality and ecological conservation. During one year, water quality and ecological conservation assessments were recorded to investigate the performance of GWF system.

Of those projects, governing diverse needs and desires from stakeholders for those who have various water values are key elements of identifying the success of the project. In fact, the Korean government has had concern over restoring the rivers which brings to construct 16 weirs in four major rivers and may fail to achieve main goal of the project, which is to ameliorate water quality. In this study, principle component analysis and multinomial logit model were executed to investigate major socioeconomic variables to influence water values in terms of sustainability in Korea. Evitable evidences have been found that age, income, education level, and city dwelling are the most effective variables to estimate water values. In addition, a monotonous water development project and a myopic view could cause major dejection across the nation and may lead to the failure of water governance.

In the present study, assessment of P recovery from swine wastewater in Beijing was performed. P amounts of swine wastewater increased from 11,687 tons in 1980 to 16,237 tons in 2014. Without treatment of swine wastewater, P concentration will reach a maximum 1.20 mg/L. The maximum P recovery was 99.36% under the condition of crystallization coupled BPR (biological phosphorus removal) when the operating conditions were 60.6 mg/L for C-p (initial P concentration (mg/L)), 1.2 for Mg/P (magnesium-to-P molar ratio), 9.7 for pH of crystallization process, and 8.0 for pH, 1.6 h for anaerobic stage time, 15 days for sludge retention time of BPR. The P concentration for water quality was 0.03 mg/L to meet the water regulation standard. Under this situation, if the target P concentration were set as Grade II and III, pig breeding numbers reached 42.07 and 95.90 million heads. Construction investments for the crystallization, BRP, and coupled methods are 411 (10(4) Yuan, 604,307 USD), 301 (10(4) Yuan, 442,580 USD), and 551 (10(4) Yuan, 810,170 USD), respectively.

Increases in agricultural production in response to population growth and wealth generation further increase risks associated with nutrient pollution. This paper presents results from projections of nutrient exports from global agricultural crop and pasture systems to the water environment generated using a process-based modeling approach. Brazil, China, India and the United States account for more than half of estimated global N and P loadings in the base year. Each country boasts large agriculture centers where high calculated loading values are found. Rapid growth in global agricultural nutrient loadings is projected. Growth of agricultural pollution loading is fastest in the group of low-income developing countries and loading growth rates also vary substantially with climate change scenario. Counter measures need to be taken to address the environmental risks associated with the projected rapid increase of agricultural nutrient loadings.																	1748-9326					OCT	2017	12	10							104008	10.1088/1748-9326/aa8148								WOS:000412439900001

A complementary configuration for mimicry of dolphin-like propulsion is first presented, involving a waist-fluke propulsive unit for dorsoventral oscillations and a pair of flippers with separate degree of freedom for three-dimensional (3-D) maneuvers. A host of onboard sensors is equipped to strengthen the capability of environment perception and mission execution on a near real-time basis. Considering the dynamic requirement formotion transition in water quality monitoring, a central pattern generator based controller is then built to govern the multimodal locomotion of the robotic dolphin. Moreover, a 3-D dynamic model based on the Lagrange method is employed to predict the propulsive performance, followed by simulations of continuous diving and surfacing motions. Finally, both laboratory and field experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented mechatronic design and control methods. The results further show that the robotic dolphin with 3-D maneuverability offers a feasible solution to aquatic mobile sensing.

Floating Monopole Antenna on a Tethered Subsurface Sensor at 433 MHz for Ocean Monitoring Applications	IEEE JOURNAL OF OCEANIC ENGINEERING												Low-cost tethered buoys are important for seawater observation, coastal area monitoring, and pollution sensing. Underwater sensor networks operating at 433 MHz (ISM band) suffer high attenuation due to seawater conductivity. Significant propagation distance cannot be achieved through seawater or along the seabed. This paper reports a novel technique for communication between sensors operating in shallow water. A sensor tethered to the bottom was connected to a floating monopole antenna via an insulated wire transmission line. Experiments and calculations show that the attenuation along the transmission line was 38 dB/m. Surface propagation for buoy-to-base station was approximately 1 dB/m with a communication range of 30 m using a 10-dBm transmitter circuit with receiver sensitivity of -110 dBm. For buoy to buoy the surface propagation was measured as 3.5 dB/m with a communication range of 4 m. Experiments were carried out in calm water conditions. The results demonstrate that significant sensor network coverage of coastal regions is possible.																	0364-9059	1558-1691				OCT	2017	42	4					818	825		10.1109/JOE.2016.2639111								WOS:000412626600009

The breakdown of this organic detritus is a key process for its remobilization into the trophic chains. Our objective was to describe the temporal dynamics of leaf breakdown in a tropical stream with a riparian canopy degraded by the extraction of palm trees. The vertical input of leaves was collected monthly in a natural stream and incubated for 30 days in a stream with a degraded canopy. Leaf breakdown rates (k), and leaf associated microbial biomass, fungal sporulation and invertebrate community were estimated. Higher values of k were observed in summer most likely due to high temperatures (increased metabolic activity) and rainfall (higher physical abrasion). Aquatic invertebrates (mainly shredders) and total microorganisms showed no overall influence on leaf breakdown rates. Therefore, in this large temporal sampling, water flow, temperature and precipitation were the factors controlling k in this stream. There were no observed changes in k compared to natural environments, most likely because the canopy degradation is a structural modification and does not represent a source of pollution.

However, understanding the influence of riparian zones on regulating N exports at the catchment scale still remains a big challenge in ecology, mainly because upscaling plot scale results is difficult, as it is disentangling the effects of riparian, upland, and in-stream processes on stream water chemistry. In this review, we summarize previous studies examining key hydrological and biogeochemical processes by which Mediterranean riparian zones regulate catchment water and N exports. We focus on Mediterranean regions because they experience a marked climatic seasonality that facilitates disentangling the close link between climate, riparian hydrology, and stream N exports. We show that Mediterranean riparian soils can be hot spots of N mineralization and nitrification within catchments given their relatively moist conditions and large stocks of N-rich leaf litter. Extremely large nitrification rates can occur during short-time periods (i.e. hot moments) and lead to increases in stream N loads, suggesting that riparian soils can be a potential source of N to adjacent aquatic systems. Moreover, riparian trees can contribute to decrease riparian groundwater level during the vegetative period, and promote reverse fluxes from the stream to the riparian zone. During periods of high hydrological retention, stream water exports to downstream ecosystem decrease, while stream water chemistry is mostly determined by in-stream processes. Riparian tree phenology can also affect catchment N exports by shaping the temporal pattern of both light and litter inputs into the stream. In spring, light enhances in-stream photoautotrophic N uptake before riparian leaf-out, while riparian leaf litter inputs promote in-stream N mineralization in summer and fall. Finally, we illustrate that the impact of Mediterranean riparian zones on stream hydrology and biogeochemistry increases along the stream continuum, and can ultimately influence catchment N exports to downstream ecosystems. Overall, findings gathered in this review question the well-established idea that riparian zones are efficient N buffers, at least for Mediterranean regions, and stress that an integrated view of upland, riparian, and stream ecosystems is essential for advancing our understanding of catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry.

In the context of water quality improvement in a river basin, we address the disparity issue by applying two approaches: a typical valuation question with a hypothetical option of voluntary payment and a valuation question with a real option of voluntary payment. The latter treatment allows for further analysis of the respondents who committed to a real payment. We show empirical evidence on the psychological factors explaining the disparity between the treatments and its relationship with response uncertainty. The extent of learning from the survey about water management of the watershed increased the likelihood of stating the willingness to contribute, either with certainty or uncertainty. In turn, a previous contribution to the environmental issue, higher income, belief in the scenario, and responding to the hypothetical treatment increased the likelihood of stating certain willingness to contribute. Our findings indicate that the factors influencing the decision on the maximum payment differ between treatments. Cognitive factors, such as perceiving the valuation scenario as plausible, learning from the questionnaire, and in which mailing round the respondent completed the survey, only explained the stated amount for the willingness to pay in the treatment with a hypothetical option for voluntary payment. In the real option treatment, a higher stated willingness to pay was more likely if the respondent actually made the payment and had a higher household income.

J	Srinivas, R; Singh, AP; Sharma, R				Srinivas, R.; Singh, Ajit Pratap; Sharma, Rishikesh			A Scenario Based Impact Assessment of Trace Metals on Ecosystem of River Ganges Using Multivariate Analysis Coupled with Fuzzy Decision-Making Approach	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The growing consciousness about the health risks associated with environmental pollutants has brought a major shift in global concern towards prevention of hazardous/trace metals discharge in water bodies. Majority of these trace metals gets accumulated in the body of aquatic lives, which are considered as potential indicators of hazardous content. This results in an ecological imbalance in the form of poisoning, diseases and even death of fish and other aquatic lives, and ultimately affect humans through food chain. Trace metals such as Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn originated from various industrial operations containing metallic solutions and agricultural practices, have been contributing significantly to cause aquatic pollution. The present study develops a novel approach of expressing sustainability of river's ecosystem based on health of the fish by coupling fuzzy sensitivity analysis into multivariate analysis. A systematic methodology has been developed by generating monoplot, two dimensional biplot and rotated component matrix (using 'Analyze it' and 'SPSS' software), which can simultaneously identify critical trace metals and their industrial sources, critical sampling stations, and adversely affected fish species along with their interrelationships. A case study of assessing the impact of trace metals on the aquatic life of river Ganges, India has also been presented to demonstrate effectiveness of the model. The clusters pertaining to various water quality parameters have been identified using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine actual sources of pollutants and their impact on aquatic life. The fuzzy sensitivity analysis reveals the cause-effect relationship of these critical parameters. The study suggests pollution control agencies to enforce appropriate regulations on the wastewater dischargers responsible for polluting river streams with a particular kind of trace metal(s).

J	Slaughter, AR				Slaughter, A. R.			Simulating Microbial Water Quality in Data-Scarce Catchments: an Update of the WQSAM Model to Simulate the Fate of Escherichia coli	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Faecal-derived microbial pollution of fresh surface waters is a global problem. Water quality models can play an important role in the management of microbial pollution; however, most existing models are too complex and require a large amount of observed data for calibration, thereby excluding their use in data-scarce catchments. The Water Quality Systems Assessment Model (WQSAM) is a water quality water model structured on the concept of requisite simplicity, thereby limiting the complexity and data requirements of the model. Here, microbial water quality simulation functionality was added to WQSAM, with the aim of assessing whether a simplified representation of processes affecting microbial water quality is sufficiently accurate for purposes of water resource management. Simulations of microbial water quality were based on the inputs and fate of an indicator organism, Escherichia coli. Non-point source inputs were modelled by assigning microbial water quality 'signatures' to incremental flow components, whereas a similar signature was assigned to point source inputs. The instream fate of E. coli was based on a first-order rate equation, moderated by salinity and water temperature. The model was validated by application to the upper to middle Crocodile River Catchment, Mpumalanga, South Africa, for historical conditions. Model simulations were obtained that were representative of the variability of observed temperature, salinity and microbial water quality data. The simulations of E. coli were found to be most sensitive to the decay rate k (0). It is argued here that the uncertainty in model results due to the use of a relatively simple model structure would be no more, or even less that that due to the application of a complex model to a catchment with insufficient observed data for adequate model calibration.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				OCT	2017	31	13					4239	4252		10.1007/s11269-017-1743-1								WOS:000411869000013

To advance understanding, we evaluated environmental and landscape factors that influence sediment rating curves (SRCs). We generated SRCs with recent total suspended solids (TSSs) and discharge data from 45 gages on 36 rivers throughout the state of Minnesota, USA. Watersheds range from 32 to 14,600 km(2) and represent distinct settings regarding topography, land cover, and geologic history. Rivers exhibited three distinct SRC shapes: simple power functions, threshold power functions, and peaked or negative-slope functions. We computed SRC exponents and coefficients (describing the steepness of the relation and the TSS concentration at median flows, respectively). In addition to quantifying watershed topography, climate/hydrology, geology, soil type, and land cover, we used lidar topography to characterize the near-channel environment upstream of gages. We used random forest models to analyze relations between SRC parameters and attributes of the watershed and the near-channel environment. The models correctly classify 78% of SRC shapes and explain 37%-60% of variance in SRC parameters. We find that SRC steepness (exponent) is strongly related to near-channel morphological characteristics including near-channel relief, channel gradient, and presence of lakes along the local channel network, but not to land use. In contrast, land use influences TSS concentrations at moderate and low flow. These findings suggest that the near-channel environment controls changes in TSS as flows increase, whereas land use drives median and low flow TSS conditions.																	2169-9003	2169-9011				OCT	2017	122	10					1901	1923		10.1002/2016JF004180								WOS:000415149000009

In this report, AuNPs have been characterized on the basis of spectroscopic and microscopic results; which showed selective and sensitive response toward Al3+ in aqueous media, and Al3+ induces aggregation of AuNPs. The sensing study performed for Al3+ revealed that the color change from red to blue was due to a red-shift in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band and the formation of aggregated species of AuNPs. The calibration curve determines the detection limit (LOD) for Al3+ about 20 ppb (0.067 mu M) is presented using both decrease and increase in absorbance at 530 and 700 nm, respectively. This value is considerably lower than the higher limit allowed for Al3+ in drinking water by the world health organization (WHO) (7.41 mu M), representing enough sensitivity to protect water quality. The intensity of the red-shifted band increases with linear pattern upon the interaction with different concentrations of Al3+, thus the possibility of producing unstable AuNPs aggregates. The method is successfully used for the detection of Al3+ in water samples collected from various sources, human urine and ionic drink. The actual response time required for AuNPs is about 1 min, this probe also have several advantages, such as ease of synthesis, functionalization and its use, high sensitivity, and enabling on-site monitoring.																	2079-4991					OCT	2017	7	10							287	10.3390/nano7100287								WOS:000414916100005

Our preliminary estimates suggest that these are worth at least R275 billion per annum to South Africans. Notwithstanding benefits to the rest of the world, natural systems provide a major source of direct income to poor households, and generate significant value in the economy through tourism and property markets, as well as providing considerable non-market benefits. Higher values correspond both to areas of higher biomass, which have higher capacity to supply ecosystem services, and areas of higher population densities, which generate demand as well as threats. The value of regulating services is higher for natural systems closer to population centres. Amenity values are highest in cities and protected areas, with the fragmented green open space areas within cities have among the highest values per ha. Even if the gaps are taken into account, our estimates are far lower than estimates based on average global values, but are likely to be more accurate, relevant and tractable to policymakers. Nevertheless, some services have large global values, the recognition of which is important in developing strategies for financing biodiversity conservation.

Climate change, land degradation and an inherently semi-arid, variable climate are making it increasingly difficult for water service providers to deliver sufficient quantity and quality of water to meet escalating demand. Investments in ecological infrastructure are seldom considered as a way of augmenting water supplies and improving water quality over the long-term. However, hydrological modelling shows that protecting and rehabilitating ecological infrastructure could generate meaningful gains in water quantity in two important South African water supply systems, the Baviaanskloof-Tsitsikamma and uMngeni catchments. The costs of such interventions, as estimated using resource economic techniques, are within the same order of magnitude as built infrastructure solutions. Investments in ecological infrastructure can also have a considerable range of other benefits. These findings make a compelling case for large-scale investment in the rehabilitation and protection of ecological infrastructure, which can be a cost-effective option for achieving water resource planning objectives. The types of rehabilitation activities planned would depend on the needs of local water users. Associated long-term monitoring and research would further improve knowledge of these systems, and provide support for the modelled results.

Chris			Irrigation Water Acidification to Neutralize Alkalinity for Nursery Crop Production: Substrate pH, Electrical Conductivity, Nutrient Concentrations, and Plant Nutrition and Growth	HORTSCIENCE												Liming agents (LAs) in irrigation water, typically associated with carbonates and bicarbonates of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), contribute to water alkalinity. Repeated application of LA to container crops can cause media-solution pH to rise overtime, that uncorrected, can lead to a nutrient availability imbalance that may be suboptimal for plant-growth due to nutrient disorder(s). To correct high levels of LA in irrigation water, growers can inject acid into their irrigation system to neutralize alkalinity. Therefore, a 52-week study was conducted using irrigation water, substrate, and plants from a commercial nursery in Florida that has a history of poor water quality and plant production problems related to high alkalinity irrigation water. The objectives of the study were to assess substrate pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and nutrients, and plant nutrition and growth for thyrallis (Galphimia gracilis Bartl.) to irrigation water acidification. Treatments consisted of irrigation water acidified with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to neutralize 0% (control), 40%, or 80% of calcium carbonates (CaCO3) yielding a CaCO3 (meq center dot L-1)/pH levels of 5 [High Alkalinity (H-A)]/7.37, 3 [Medium Alkalinity (M-A)]//6.37, and 1 [Low Alkalinity (L-A)]//4.79, respectively. Substrate analysis by the 1: 2 dilution method at the end of the study was significant (P < 0.05) for pH 6.2, 5.2, and 4.7 for the H-A, M-A, and L-A treatments, respectively, and for nutrients Ca, Mn, and Zn. Foliar nutrient levels were statistically significant (P < 0.05) for alkalinity treatment for Fe, K, Mn, P, and Zn. Alkalinity treatment was significant (P < 0.05) for growth, leaf greenness (by SPAD), and quality (by survey) with the M-A treatment producing more biomass, having greener leaves, and the highest aesthetic quality value than the H-A or L-A treatments. A qualitative survey of root systems at harvest showed that the M-A and L-A treatment root systems were greater than the H-A treatment based on visual side-wall root development. These data demonstrate that irrigation water acidification does alter substrate pH and nutrients and plant tissue nutrient levels and growth over a long-term production cycle typical for nursery crops.																	0018-5345	2327-9834				OCT	2017	52	10					1401	1405		10.21273/HORTSCI11439-17								WOS:000414646100013

A total of 161 water samples including 88 tap drinking waters (DW) and 73 surface waters (SW) were collected from five cities in Xi'an, Yan'an, Xining, Lanzhou, and Urumqi in northwestern China. Eighteen parameters including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total organic carbon (TOC) total nitrogen (TN), chemical compositions of anions (F-, Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42-), cations (NH4+, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+), and metals (lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu)) were analyzed in the first time at the five cities. The results showed that pH values and concentrations of Cl-, SO42-, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and Cd, Cr, Cu in DW were within the permissible limits of the Chinese Drinking Water Quality Criteria, whereas the concentrations of other ions (F-, NO3-, NH4+ and Pb) exceeded their permissible values. In terms of the SW, the concentrations of F-, Cl-, NO3-, SO42- were over the third range threshold i.e., water suitable for fishing and swimming of the Surface Water Quality Standards in China. The spatial distributions of most MEs in source water are similar, and there was no clear variation for all ions and metals. The metals in DW may be caused by water pipes, faucets and their fittings. The noncarcinogenic risk of metals in DW for local children are in decreasing order Cr > Cd > Pb > Cu. The carcinogenic risk from Cr exposure was at the acceptable level according to threshold of USEPA. Although the comprehensive index of potential ecological assessment of Cr, Cd, Pb and Cu in SW ranked at low risk level and was in the order of Huang River in Xining > Peaceful Canal in Urumqi > Yan River in Yan'an > Yellow River in Lanzhou, their adverse effects to ecology and human health at a low concentration in local semi-arid and arid areas should not be ignored in the long run.

When MPT-mass spectrometry (MPT-MS) is applied in the detection of some metal elements, the metallic ions exhibit some novel features which are significantly different with those obtained by the traditional inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and may be helpful for metal element analysis. As the representative elements of group IVA, titanium and zirconium are both of importance and value in modern industry, and they have impacts on human health. Here, we first provide a study on the complex anions of titanium and zirconium in water by using the MPT as ion source and a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-MS). These complex anions were produced in the plasma flame by an aqueous solution flowing through the central tube of the MPT, and were introduced into the inlet of the mass spectrometry working in negative ion mode to get the feature mass spectrometric signals. Moreover, the feature fragment patterns of these ions in multi-step collision-induced dissociation processes have been explained. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) using the MS2 (the second tandem mass spectrometry) procedure was estimated to be at the level of 10 mu g/L for titanium and 20 mu g/L for zirconium with linear dynamics ranges that cover at least two orders of magnitude, i.e., between 0-500 mu g/L and 20-200 mu g/L, respectively. These experimental data demonstrated that the MPT-MS is a promising and useful tool in field analysis of titanium and zirconium ions in water, and can be applied in many fields, such as environmental control, hydrogeology, and water quality inspection. In addition, MPT-MS could also be used as a supplement of ICP-MS for the rapid and on-site analysis of metal ions.																	1660-4601					OCT	2017	14	10							1129	10.3390/ijerph14101129								WOS:000414763200038	28954404

Puebla is the fourth largest city in Mexico, where there are significant industrial zones and a large population. Water needs are almost exclusively met by groundwater, which has brought intense exploitation of groundwater resources and water quality degradation. The present study investigates the hydrogeochemical changes in groundwater, particularly focuses on the chemical changes produced by upwelling mineralized water. These concentrations may represent potential risks to the health of the population. The groundwater presented five types of families Ca-HCO3, Mg-HCO3, Mix-HCO3, HCO3-Ca-SO4 and Ca-SO4. The high concentrations of sulphates, calcium and magnesium are reflected in high TDS and Total Hardness. The samples collected showed detectable concentrations of F, Fe, Mn, Ba, Sr, Cu, Zn, B and Li. The limitations for its use as drinking water are given by the high values of TDS, sulphates, total hardness and Mn. Geochemical modeling using Geochemist's Workbench (GWB) and PHREEQC software enabled the computation of the saturation index of mineral phases with ions in solution and speciation ions. Groundwater was initially in equilibrium with calcite; however, due to the changes in hydrogeological conditions, gypsum and dolomite are being dissolved until new equilibrium conditions are met. The additional calcium and carbonate in the water causes calcite to become oversaturated and to precipitate. Evidence of dedolomitization reactions and common ion effect is illustrated by concurrent increases in calcium and magnesium concentrations in the groundwater.

Assessing background values of chloride, sulfate and fluoride in groundwater: A geochemical-statistical approach at a regional scale	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												The Sardinia island (Italy) is one of the European areas least affected by potentially anthropogenic impacts, such as spreading urbanization, intensive agriculture and regional atmospheric contamination. Such characteristics allow to consider Sardinia a good site for testing an approach that integrates geochemical tools, hierarchical cluster and geographical information system, aimed at estimating background concentrations of chloride, sulfate and fluoride at the regional scale. Analytical data were obtained from several hydrogeochemical surveys and from the groundwater-monitoring program established by the Sardinian Regional Government. Groundwater samples were grouped according to their circulation in the predominant hydrogeologic complex: Quaternary sediments, Quaternary basalts, Tertiary sediments, Tertiary volcanic rocks, Mesozoic carbonatic rocks, Paleozoic carbonatic rocks, granitic rocks and metamorphic rocks. Samples surely affected by anthropogenic inputs, thermal waters, waters collected at wells with unknown construction details and poor quality analyses were excluded. The resulting dataset included 1414 groundwater sampling sites distributed over an area of 24,090 km(2) (All data). Another dataset comprised of 641 sampling sites (Selected data) was derived by All data excluding the groundwater with NO3- > 10 mg/L. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on both datasets considering Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Cr-, HCO3-, SO42- NO3- and F-. The values of total dissolved solids (TDS) were a major distinguishing factor among clusters, but distinct signatures related to the median nitrate and fluoride concentrations were also recognized. The geographic distribution of clusters reflected the role of geological and geographic characteristics on the geochemistry of groundwater. Background ranges of the regulated parameters chloride, sulfate and fluoride in each cluster, identified either using All data or Selected data, were calculated using the median +/- 2MAD. Although results were found in general agreement, the threshold using the median + 2MAD was calculated using the Selected data only, because the Selected data better represents near pristine conditions. Chloride threshold values above the drinking water limit were mainly observed in groundwater located in western Sardinia, where sediments and volcanic rocks prevalently outcrop, and also in some coastal areas. Threshold values of sulfate and fluoride above the limit were related to local conditions. Specifically, high threshold values of sulfate were observed in groundwater interacting with the Tertiary volcanic rocks that host known sulfide mineralization and at sites where evaporitic deposits occur. Threshold values of fluoride above the limit were often observed in the areas where fluoride mineralization occurs. High fluoride values may also result from cation exchange and/or super saturation with respect to calcite. The results of this study indicate that the integration of hierarchical clustering analysis with the geochemical characteristics of groundwater, also taking into account the geological context, allow the repartition of groundwater samples in distinct hydrogeochemical groups, which in turn allow to calculate the background ranges and reliable threshold values in groundwater. This approach can be applied to assess the background concentrations of chemical parameters at a regional scale when a large dataset is available.																	0375-6742	1879-1689				OCT	2017	181						243	255		10.1016/j.gexplo.2017.08.002								WOS:000414622400021

Dissolved Organic Matter Compositional Change and Biolability During Two Storm Runoff Events in a Small Agricultural Watershed	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Agricultural watersheds are globally pervasive, supporting fundamentally different organic matter source, composition, and concentration profiles in comparison to natural systems. Similar to natural systems, agricultural storm runoff exports large amounts of organic carbon from agricultural land into waterways. But intense management of upper soil layers, waterway channelization, wetland and riparian habitat removal, and postharvest vegetation removal promise to uniquely drive organic matter release to waterways. During a winter first flush and a subsequent storm event, this study investigated the influence of a small agricultural watershed on dissolved organic matter (DOM) source, composition, and biolability. Storm water discharge released strongly terrestrial yet biolabile (23 to 32%) dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Following a 21day bioassay, a parallel factor analysis identified an 80% reduction in a protein-like (phenylpropyl) component (C2) that was previously correlated to lignin phenol concentration, and a 10% reduction in a humic-like, terrestrially sourced component (C4). Storm-driven releases tripled DOC concentration (from 2.8 to 8.7mgL(-1)) during the first flush event in comparison to base flow and were terrestrially sourced, with an eightfold increase in vascular plant derived lignin phenols (23.0 to 185gL(-1)). As inferred from system hydrology, lignin composition, and nitrate as a groundwater tracer, an initial pulse of dilute water from the upstream watershed caused a counterclockwise DOC hysteresis loop. DOC concentrations peaked after 3.5days, with the delay between peak discharge and peak DOC attributed to storm water hydrology and a period of initial water repellency of agricultural soils, which delayed DOM leaching. Plain Language Summary Human activities have transformed vast areas of Earth's surface to agricultural use. Contemporary agricultural practices have vastly increased crop yield but have also greatly intensified agricultural land management practices, which deviate strongly from many of the basic processes that affect natural habitats. It follows, then, that agricultural land use could affect carbon cycling and water quality in agricultural watersheds very differently from how natural systems affect those same parameters. This study seeks to deepen scientific knowledge surrounding how storms drive carbon release from land to waterways, specific to an agricultural watershed. Results indicate that over a quarter of the carbon released from the subject agricultural watershed during storms has the potential to be used as energy by downstream ecosystems. This could support future management actions seeking to benefit downstream ecosystems or may pose a threat to ecosystem health. The study also suggests that the timing, amount, and quality of carbon released from the watershed depend on rainfall patterns and watershed plumbing, and on whether or not soil wetting has occurred recently, prior to the event in question.

Therefore, there is a strong need to validate the OLCI products to be sure that the technical capabilities provided will be used in the best possible way in water quality monitoring and research. The Baltic Sea is an optically complex waterbody where many ocean colour products, performing well in other waterbodies, fail. We tested the performance of standard Case-2 Regional/Coast Colour (C2RCC) processing chain in retrieving water reflectance, inherent optical properties (IOPs), and water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a, total suspended matter (TSM) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the Baltic Sea. The reflectance spectra produced by the C2RCC are realistic in both shape and magnitude. However, the IOPs, and consequently the water quality parameters estimated by the C2RCC, did not have correlation with in situ data. On the other hand, some tested empirical remote sensing algorithms performed well in retrieving chlorophyll a, TSM, CDOM and Secchi depth from the reflectance produced by the C2RCC. This suggests that the atmospheric correction part of the processor performs relatively well while IOP retrieval part of the neural network needs extensive training with actual IOP data before it can produce reasonable estimates for the Baltic Sea.																	2072-4292					OCT	2017	9	10							1070	10.3390/rs9101070								WOS:000414650600100

A hydrodynamic model was applied to simulate the transport and dispersion of fecal contaminants from CSO discharges and to quantify the impacts of climate and population changes on the water quality of the river used as a drinking water source in Quebec, Canada. The dispersion model was used to quantify Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentrations at drinking water intakes. Extreme flows during high and low water events were based on a frequency analysis in current and future climate scenarios. The increase of the number of discharges was quantified in current and future climate scenarios with regards to the frequency of overflows observed between 2009 and 2012. For future climate scenarios, effects of an increase of population were estimated according to current population growth statistics, independently of local changes in precipitation that are more difficult to predict than changes to regional scale hydrology. Under "business-as-usual" scenarios restricting increases in CSO discharge frequency, mean E. coli concentrations at downstream drinking water intakes are expected to increase by up to 87% depending on the future climate scenario and could lead to changes in drinking water treatment requirements for the worst case scenarios. The greatest uncertainties are related to future local discharge loads. Climate change adaptation with regards to drinking water quality must focus on characterizing the impacts of global change at a local scale. Source water protection planning must consider the impacts of climate and population change to avoid further degradation of water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the economic feasibility of re-integrating crops and livestock in farming systems of the U.S. Corn Belt. Using data on farming practices and yields from a long-term cropping systems experiment, we calculated annual revenue and costs of four farming systems a simple corn-soybean rotation with and without cattle (2-yr cash and 2-yr integrated, respectively) and a diversified corn-soybean-oat/alfalfa-alfalfa rotation with and without cattle (4-yr cash and 4-yr integrated, respectively). Our analysis was conducted for a 405-ha parcel in central Iowa over the period of 2008 to 2015. To maximize the use of harvested crops, cattle enterprises differed for the 2-and 4-yr rotations: yearlings were finished using a diet of mostly concentrate feeds for the 2-yr integrated system and calves were backgrounded and finished using a diet of forages and concentrates for the 4-yr integrated system. We found that mean annual returns to land and management were similar among all four farming systems ($790 ha I averaged across the four systems). The integrated systems exhibited greater variability among years in returns to land and management than the cash systems. In addition, total costs excluding land and management were four-to nine-fold greater for the integrated crop-livestock systems than for the cash crop systems. Labor requirements increased with crop rotation diversification by 59% (4-yr cash vs. 2-yr cash) and with integration of cattle by 217% (2-yr integrated vs. 2-yr cash) or 232% (4-yr integrated vs. 2-yr cash). We concluded that diversified crop rotations with or without cattle are profitable farming systems in Iowa, but require greater capital and labor inputs than the dominant 2-yr cash grain system.																	0308-521X	1873-2267				OCT	2017	157						51	69		10.1016/j.agsy.2017.07.001								WOS:000413282600005

Converting bahiagrass pasture land to elephantgrass bioenergy production enhances biomass yield and water quality	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Changing pasture land to the production of bioenergy crops will affect regional water dynamics. Returning byproducts of industrial conversion of bioenergy crops like fermentation residual or biochar back to the field could be used to improve sustainable nutrient management, but could also impact water quantity and quality in ways that are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of land-use conversion from low input bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Fliigge) pastures to elephantgrass [Pennisetum purpureum (L.) Schum.] for bioenergy production under different nutrient management practices on biomass yield, crop water dynamics and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching during growing and dormant seasons. Treatments evaluated were 1) bahiagrass + 50 kg N ha(-1); 2) elephantgrass + 50 kg N ha(-1); 3) elephantgrass + 50 kg N ha(-1) + fermentation residual; 4) elephantgrass + 50 kg N ha(-1) + biochar; and 5) elephantgrass + 250 kg N ha(-1). Data were collected on crop evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency, drainage, NO3-N leaching, and aboveground dry matter accumulation. Dry matter yield of elephantgrass was 4- to 7-fold greater than bahiagrass after the first growing season, but was similar among elephantgrass treatments. Elephantgrass produced with no residual amendments reduced drainage (approx. 43% across all growing seasons) compared to bahiagrass, and this reduction was exacerbated in the residual treatments. Reduced drainage was associated with increased ET. Elephantgrass, regardless of treatment, reduced the amount of NO3-N lost through drainage compared to bahiagrass. Therefore, replacing bahiagrass with elephantgrass will increase cropping system water use and diminish the rate of groundwater replenishment during the growing season, which could have detrimental effects for other ecosystem processes that rely on this water resource. However, elephantgrass increased the efficiency with which water was used to produce biomass and reduced NO3-N leaching to groundwater.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				OCT 1	2017	248						20	28		10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.021								WOS:000411539700003

This increases nitrate concentrations in the baseflow of streams, enhancing downstream eutrophication. Conservation practices reduce the impacts from agriculture, but little is documented on the recovery time of shallow groundwater after agriculture ceases and conservation practices are applied. Although conservation practices may reduce groundwater nitrate, they may also lead to the production of the greenhouse gas methane. This study investigated the temporal sequence of applying post-agricultural conservation practices and the effects on nitrate and methane concentrations in shallow groundwater. Harleigh Farms is a complex of fields near Oxford, MD (USA) that have been taken out of crop production and placed in conservation programs at various times after 1997. Groundwater nitrate and dissolved methane were sampled monthly from Nov 2012-Nov 2013 using age of the conservation practice as a proxy for time since fertilization. In this chronosequence study, an exponential decline in groundwater nitrate levels was found over the 16 year time period since last fertilization. Within 3-5 years after the cessation of intensive grain production, groundwater nitrate concentrations in the top of the surface unconfined aquifer dropped from 11 mg NO3--N L-1 to 0.5 mg NO3--N L-1. Methane only accumulated to high concentrations (2-60 mu M CH4) in hydric soils with low nitrate concentrations (<< 0.1 mg NO3--N L-1). Our results indicate rapid loss of nitrate in the top of the surficial aquifer after the cessation of intensive agriculture and seasonal accumulations of methane in wetland-based conservation practices. These data indicate that time series of groundwater nitrate concentrations at the top of the unconfined aquifer can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural conservation practices.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				OCT 1	2017	248						200	214		10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.026								WOS:000411539700021						
J	Fleming, P				Fleming, Patrick			Agricultural Cost Sharing and Water Quality in the Chesapeake Bay: Estimating Indirect Effects of Environmental Payments	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS												This article analyzes the effect of agricultural cost sharing for cover crops on the acres of three conservation practices. A survey of farmers from Maryland is used to estimate the direct effect of cover crop cost sharing on the acres of cover crops, and the indirect effect of cover crop cost sharing on the acres of two other practices: conservation tillage and contour/strip cropping. A two-stage simultaneous equation approach is used to correct for voluntary self-selection into cost-sharing programs, and to account for substitution effects among conservation practices. Using model parameters from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Chesapeake Bay Program, the estimated effects of cost sharing are then translated to pollution reduction in order to quantify water quality benefits. The results indicate that the large cover crop cost sharing effort in Maryland had considerable effects on cover crop acreage, substantially reducing nitrogen and phosphorus runoff. Moreover, after accounting for the indirect effects on conservation tillage, the cost per pound of phosphorus abatement in the Chesapeake Bay decreased by between 60-67%.																	0002-9092	1467-8276				OCT	2017	99	5					1208	1227		10.1093/ajae/aax040								WOS:000412122000008

Assessing multiple goods and services derived from livestock farming on a nation-wide gradient	ANIMAL												Livestock farming is an essential activity in many rural areas, where it contributes to the maintenance of soil fertility and farmland biodiversity, as well as to a set of social public goods including food security, rural vitality and culture. However, livestock sustainability assessments tend to focus primarily on environmental and economic dimensions; therefore, these valuations might be limited because they do not consider the complete set of associated goods and services (GS). Hence, a need exists to recognise the multiple contributions provided by livestock to human well-being and society. The objective of this study was to analyse the provision of multiple GS derived from livestock across regions in France and empirically demonstrate sets of GS that repeatedly appeared together. We designated these multiple GS provided by livestock as contributions to productive, environmental, rural vitality and cultural benefits that human populations derive directly or indirectly from livestock agroecosystems. First, we combined expert knowledge with results of a literature review to define a bundle of GS provided by livestock. We then described indicators that quantified each good or service and screened national databases to determine the availability of supporting data. Finally, we assessed the GS and their relationships (synergies or trade-offs) on a nation-wide gradient in France at the department level (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 3). Four main categories of GS were considered: provisioning (e.g. food quantity and quality), environmental quality (e.g. biodiversity, landscape heterogeneity, water quality), rural vitality (e.g. employment, rural dynamism) and culture (e.g. gastronomy and landscape heritage). Four major types of GS bundles were identified, which suggested strong contrasts among French rural areas in terms of the nature of the GS that occurred together and their levels of provision. GS bundles in France had a non-random spatial distribution. This study represents an initial step towards developing a methodology to consider GS bundles provided by livestock. Nonetheless, further research is needed to understand socio-economic, environmental, political and geographic determinants of the composition of GS bundles.

J	Guillou, N; Chapalain, G				Guillou, Nicolas; Chapalain, Georges			Assessing the impact of tidal stream energy extraction on the Lagrangian circulation	APPLIED ENERGY												Whereas numerous numerical modelling have been conducted to gain further insights about the hydrodynamic characteristics of tidal stream energy sites, the long-term transport of water particles has been routinely ignored. However, a refined evaluation of circulation pathways is fundamental to assess water quality changes induced by tidal energy converters. The present study investigates the tide-induced Lagrangian circulation in north-western coastal waters of Brittany (France, western Europe), including numerous islands, shoals and straits with strong potential for turbine farm implementation. Particular attention is dedicated to the hydrodynamic impact of tidal stream power extraction from a series of horizontal-axis turbines. An original approach, based on the coupling of the Lagrangian barycentric method with predictions from a model at high spatial resolution, is considered to assess circulation pathways in a single synoptic view. Spatial results reveal a complex Lagrangian circulation highly controlled by bathymetry and islands geometry. The residual flow in the Fromveur Strait, separating Ushant island from Molene archipelago, displays thus a strong asymmetry, between a prominent north-eastern pathway with residual currents up to 0.45 m s(-1) and a southward circulation. The positions of cyclonic and anti-cyclonic recirculations, both upstream and downstream the Strait, are furthermore precisely defined. The north eddy is found closely located to the sand bank of the Four. The extraction of tidal stream power impacts mainly the residual Lagrangian circulation along the current stream emerging from the Strait, with a tendency for surrounding eddies to get closer to the tidal stream energy site. The displacements of the south and north recirculations may thus exceed 1.5 km with possible implications on the evolution of surrounding seabed features. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Water quality impacts of bare peat revegetation with lime and fertiliser application	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Loss of peatland vegetation is a global problem with negative consequences for the quality of catchment drainage waters. Vegetation can be lost through a combination of human and natural processes, leading to areas of exposed bare peat frequently accompanied by loss of surface moisture due to drainage or gullying. Waters draining such degraded peatlands are likely to have increased levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other nutrients, which can adversely impact the global climate, drinking water supplies and freshwater ecology. Consequently peatland revegetation efforts have become widespread. This paper presents results from a four-year study conducted to monitor the water quality impacts of a bare peat revegetation approach, which used landscape scale application of lime and fertiliser to encourage a grass nurse crop. This study considers an area of severely degraded blanket peat in the UK uplands, with large areas of bare peat prior to revegetation and provides the largest field dataset to date on the effects of this method on catchment run-off waters. Despite concerns that liming could increase DOC concentrations, the revegetation method is not shown to have this effect over the time period, and interestingly results in short term periods of suppression. The mechanism for this novel and unexpected finding merits further investigation and results in reduced DOC concentration, by up to 14 mg/l or 50% of control values, combined with periods of reduced colour carbon ratios. The data show that other nutrients were largely unaffected although rates of phosphate (PO43-) export were above recommended levels in the first year of application, suggesting initial phosphorus (P) application rates may require adjustment. Further investigation is required to consider the longer term effects of this restoration method as the vegetation matures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Groundwater quality assessment using geospatial and statistical tools in Salem District, Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The water quality study of Salem district, Tamil Nadu has been carried out to assess the water quality for domestic and irrigation purposes. For this purpose, 59 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), major anions (HCO3-, CO3-, F-, Cl-, NO2- + NO3-, and SO42-),major cations (Ca2+ Mg2+, Na+, and K+), alkalinity (ALK), and hardness (HAR). To assess the water quality, the following chemical parameters were calculated based on the analytical results, such as Piper plot, water quality index (WQI), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly index (KI), and residual sodium carbonate (RSC). Wilcox diagram represents that 23% of the samples are excellent to good, 40% of the samples are good to permissible, 10% of the samples are permissible to doubtful, 24% of the samples are doubtful unsuitable, and only 3% of the samples are unsuitable for irrigation. SAR values shows that 52% of the samples indicate high-to-very high and low-to-medium alkali water. KI values indicate good quality (30%) and not suitable (70%) for irrigation purposes. RSC values indicate that 89% of samples are suitable for irrigation purposes. MH reveals that 17% suitable and 83% samples are not suitable for irrigation purposes and for domestic purposes the excellent (8%), good (48%), and poor (44%). The agricultural waste, fertilizer used, soil leaching, urban runoff, livestock waste, and sewages are the sources of poor water quality. Some samples are not suitable for irrigation purposes due to high salinity, hardness, and magnesium concentration. In general, the groundwater of the Salem district was polluted by agricultural activities, anthropogenic activities, ion exchange, and weathering.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2737	2751		10.1007/s13201-016-0501-5								WOS:000413256900010

The large number of data can lead to difficulties in the integration, interpretation, and representation of the results. Two multivariate statistical methods, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and factor analysis (FA), were applied to evaluate their usefulness to classify and identify geochemical processes controlling groundwater geochemistry. Four statistically significant clusters were obtained from 30 sampling stations. This has resulted two important clusters viz., cluster 1 (pH, Si, CO3, Mg, SO4, Ca, K, HCO3, alkalinity, Na, Na + K, Cl, and hardness) and cluster 2 (EC and TDS) which are released to the study area from different sources. The application of different multivariate statistical techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), assists in the interpretation of complex data matrices for a better understanding of water quality of a study area. From PCA, it is clear that the first factor (factor 1), accounted for 36.2% of the total variance, was high positive loading in EC, Mg, Cl, TDS, and hardness. Based on the PCA scores, four significant cluster groups of sampling locations were detected on the basis of similarity of their water quality.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2767	2777		10.1007/s13201-016-0504-2								WOS:000413256900012

Thirty-six groundwater samples were analyzed for their physical and chemical properties using standard laboratory methods. The constituents have the following ranges in the water: pH 6.4-8.6, electrical conductivity 80-1900 mu S/cm, total hardness 30-730 mg/l, TDS 48-1001 mg/l, Ca2+ 4.2222.6 mg/l, Na+ 2.33-103.33 mg/l, Mg2+ 1.56115.36 mg/l, K+ 0.67-14 mg/l and Fe BDL-2.53 mg/l, HCO3- 48.8-1000.4 mg/l, Cl -5.6-459.86 mg/l and SO4- BDL-99.03 mg/l. Results also show that bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) dominate the other anions (Cl - and SO24-). Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), soluble sodium percentage (SSP), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR), total hardness (TH), and permeability index (PI) were calculated as derived parameters, to investigate the ionic toxicity. Concerned chemical parameters when plotted in the U. S. Salinity diagram indicate that waters are of C-1-S-1, C-2-S-1 and C-3-S-1 types, i.e., low salinity and low sodium which is good for irrigation. The values of Sodium Adsorption Ratio indicate that the groundwater of the area falls under the category of low sodium hazard. So, there is neither salinity nor toxicity problem of irrigation water, and hence the ground water can safely be used for long-term irrigation. The chemical parameters when plotted in Piper's trilinear diagram are found to concentrate in the central and west central part of the diamond-shaped field. Based on the analytical results, groundwater in the area is found to be generally fresh and hard to very hard. The abundance of the major ions is as follows: HCO3 > Cl > SO4 and Ca > Na > Mg > K > Fe. Results also show that bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) dominate the other anions (Cl- and SO42-). According to Gibbs diagrams samples fall in the rock dominance field and the chemical quality of groundwater is related to the lithology of the area. The alkaline earth elements (Ca and Mg) occur in greater abundance than alkaline elements (Na and K). A comparative study of our analytical results with the WHO standards of drinking water indicate that the present waters are also good for drinking purposes.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2787	2802		10.1007/s13201-017-0530-8								WOS:000413256900014						
J	Malik, RN; Hashmi, MZ				Malik, Riffat Naseem; Hashmi, Muhammad Zaffar			Multivariate statistical techniques for the evaluation of surface water quality of the Himalayan foothills streams, Pakistan	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Himalayan foothills streams, Pakistan play an important role in living water supply and irrigation of farmlands; thus, the water quality is closely related to public health. Multivariate techniques were applied to check spatial and seasonal trends, and metals contamination sources of the Himalayan foothills streams, Pakistan. Grab surface water samples were collected from different sites (5-15 cm water depth) in pre-washed polyethylene containers. Fast Sequential Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Varian FSAA-240) was used to measure the metals concentration. Concentrations of Ni, Cu, and Mn were high in pre-monsoon season than the post-monsoon season. Cluster analysis identified impaired, moderately impaired and least impaired clusters based on water parameters. Discriminant function analysis indicated spatial variability in water was due to temperature, electrical conductivity, nitrates, iron and lead whereas seasonal variations were correlated with 16 physicochemical parameters. Factor analysis identified municipal and poultry waste, automobile activities, surface runoff, and soil weathering as major sources of contamination. Levels of Mn, Cr, Fe, Pb, Cd, Zn and alkalinity were above the WHO and USEPA standards for surface water. The results of present study will help to higher authorities for the management of the Himalayan foothills streams.

J	Mallick, J				Mallick, Javed			Hydrogeochemical characteristics and assessment of water quality in the Al-Saad Lake, Abha Saudi Arabia	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Hydrogeochemical characteristics and assessment of water quality investigations have been carried out at Abha, located in Saudi Arabia, where Al-Saad Lake represents a rare example of natural endorheic lake. The ecosystem within and around the Al-Saad Lake including catchment area is of great social, cultural, aesthetic, environmental and economic values to Abha. Sampling and experiments of lake water has been carried out with the aim of characterizing the main physico-chemical parameters, such as DO, EC, TDS, Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, K+, SO42-, Cl-, HCO3, NO3- and F- concentration. The ordinary kriging (OK) method was used to produce the spatial patterns of water quality. The Result of DO (mean 5.38 mg/L) trend in Al-Saad Lake is not very encouraging as majority of the lake area is under DO stress or marginally above it. So, proper management strategies are needed to be formulated to protect flora and fauna of the lake. Furthermore, the chemical analysis results show the abundance of the major cations in the order Mg2+ > Ca2+ > Na+ > K+ whereas the abundance of anions are in the order SO42- > Cl->HCO3>NO3->F-. The result obtained in this investigation inferred that the cations in water i.e. sodium and iron are within the permissible limits but magnesium and potassium have exceeded the permissible limit. Whereas anions such as nitrate and fluoride are within the permissible range but chloride and sulphate have exceeded the permissible limits. The concentration of cation, magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) in the lake water has exceeded the desirable range (30, 10 mg/L, respectively). This may be due to weathering and transported from rocks and particularly from sulphate deposits such as gypsum and anhydride and subsequently ends up in water. The concentration of anion, Sulphate (SO4) and chloride are above the desirable limit. The major source of bicarbonate are the carbonate rocks containing calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg (CO3)(2)), Calcium (Ca) and Magnesium (Mg) can also be transported from Ca-silicates and Mg-silicates. The piper trilinear plot suggests the increase of Ca and SO4 contents is attributed to dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite, which are commonly found in the quaternary formations of watershed (wadi). Ion exchange, dissolution of calcite, semi-arid climate, alkaline condition and weathering are responsible for high concentration of ions exceeding the desirable limit of the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2869	2882		10.1007/s13201-017-0553-1								WOS:000413256900020

Physicochemical parameters like temperature (Tem), potential hydrogen (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), total hardness (TH), calcium (Ca), chloride (Cl), fluoride (F), sulphate (SO42-), magnesium (Mg), phosphate (PO43-), sodium (Na), potassium (K), nitrite (NO2), nitrate (NO3), total dissolved solids (TDS), total carbon (TC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were analyzed using standard procedures. The values obtained were compared with the guidelines for drinking purpose suggested by the World Health Organization and Bureau of Indian Standard. The result shows the higher concentration of nitrite in all the location which is beyond the permissible limit. Eleven parameters were selected to derive the WQI for the estimation of water potential for five sampling sites. A relative weight was assigned to each parameter range from 1.46 to 4.09 based on its importance. The WQI values range from 64 to 77 indicating that the Loktak Lake water is not fit for drinking, including both human and animals, even though the people living inside the Lake are using it for drinking purposes. The implementation of WQI is necessary for proper management of the Loktak Lake and it will be a very helpful tool for the public and decision makers to evaluate the water quality of the Loktak Lake for sustainable management.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2907	2918		10.1007/s13201-017-0579-4								WOS:000413256900022

Prominence of seasonal water quality assessment in a tropical river using multivariate analysis: Kerala, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												An account of seasonal water quality variability has been taken as a proxy for the changes of environmental setting occurring in the catchment areas and helps to illustrate the ecological system processes associated with it. The present study in Meenachil River (L = 78 km, A = 1272 km 2) comprising of stations from upstream to downstream for pre monsoon (PRM), monsoon (MON) and post monsoon (POM). Ca2+ and SO42- show an erratic trend while extreme deviations were observed at S6 and S7 stations. Na+, K+, Cl-, DIC and DOC showed a similar trend in most stations, i. e. (PRM[POM[ MON). Significant rise of DIC and DOC at S7 during POM and PRM could explicate changes ensued in adjacent Vembanad lake system. Strong correlations of DIC and DOC for Na+, K+ and Cl-ions were noted in the study. HCA dendrogram reveals that ion chemistry in S6 and S7 was strictly controlled by neighbouring lake water dynamics. The results demonstrate high F1 variance of 73, 68 and 72% followed by F2 comprising of 17, 19 and 21% for PRM, MON and POM, respectively. General understanding into the autochthonous process associated within the river lake interfaced region was evident from the nutrient variability scenario.					/0000-0003-1217-3286												2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					2957	2966		10.1007/s13201-017-0595-4								WOS:000413256900026

The study aimed to examine the growth of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. Longifolia) in aquaponic system without the addition of artificial nutrient. The nutrient relies solely on wastewater of nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cultivation circulated continuously on the aquaponic system. The results showed that tilapia weight reached 48.49 +/- 3.92 g of T3 (tilapia, romaine lettuce, and inoculated bacteria), followed by T2 (tilapia and romaine lettuce) and T1 (tilapia) of 47.80 +/- 1.97 and 45.89 +/- 1.10 g after 35 days of experiment. Tilapia best performance in terms of growth and production occurred at T3 of 3.96 +/- 0.44 g/day, 12.10 +/- 0.63 %/day, 96.11 +/- 1.44 % and 1.60 +/- 0.07 for GR, SGR, SR, and FCR, respectively. It is also indicated by better water quality characteristic in this treatment. Romaine lettuce harvests of T2 and T3 showed no significant difference, with the final weight of 61.87 +/- 5.59 and 57.74 +/- 4.35 g. Overall, the integration of tilapia fish farming and romaine lettuce is potentially a promising aquaponic system for sustainable fish and horticulture plant production.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					3055	3063		10.1007/s13201-016-0418-z								WOS:000413256900034						
J	Bora, M; Goswami, DC				Bora, Minakshi; Goswami, Dulal C.			Water quality assessment in terms of water quality index (WQI): case study of the Kolong River, Assam, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The Kolong River of Nagaon district, Assam has been facing serious degradation leading to its current moribund condition due to a drastic human intervention in the form of an embankment put across it near its take-off point from the Brahmaputra River in the year 1964. The blockage of the river flow was adopted as a flood control measure to protect its riparian areas, especially the Nagaon town, from flood hazard. The river, once a blooming distributary of the mighty Brahmaputra, had high navigability and rich riparian biodiversity with a well established agriculturally productive watershed. However, the present status of Kolong River is highly wretched as a consequence of the post-dam effects thus leaving it as stagnant pools of polluted water with negligible socio-economic and ecological value. The Central Pollution Control Board, in one of its report has placed the Kolong River among 275 most polluted rivers of India. Thus, this study is conducted to analyze the seasonal water quality status of the Kolong River in terms of water quality index (WQI). The WQI scores shows very poor to unsuitable quality of water samples in almost all the seven sampling sites along the Kolong River. The water quality is found to be most deteriorated during monsoon season with an average WQI value of 122.47 as compared to pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season having average WQI value of 85.73 and 80.75, respectively. Out of the seven sampling sites, Hatimura site (S1) and Nagaon Town site (S4) are observed to be the most polluted sites.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					3125	3135		10.1007/s13201-016-0451-y								WOS:000413256900041

The aim of this study was to determine the groundwater suitability for drinking use based on heavy metal concentration and the associated human exposure risk in an intensively irrigated part of the Cauvery river basin, Tamil Nadu, India. Sixteen heavy metals analysed were in the order of dominance of chromium < zinc < copper < cadmium < cobalt < iron < aluminium < nickel < titanium < zirconium < boron < silver < manganese < lead < lithium < silicon in groundwater. Chromium and zinc were within permissible limits of the Bureau of Indian Standards for drinking water quality, and silver, lead and nickel were above limits in all the groundwater samples. In less than 50 % of the groundwater samples, aluminium, boron, cadmium, copper, iron and manganese exceeded their individual permissible limits. Heavy metal pollution index based on 11 heavy metals indicated that groundwater quality of this area is poor-to-unsuitable. Non-carcinogenic risk for humans due to ingestion of groundwater through drinking water pathway was very high for infants, children and adults. Silver, lead, nickel, cadmium and manganese largely contributed to the health hazard. Sources of heavy metals were identified to be geological and from human activities, i.e., application of fertilizers in agricultural fields, seawater intrusion due to intensive pumping for agriculture and wastewater from industries. Groundwater and surface water in this area pose large threat due to high levels of heavy metals, and it is necessary to avoid this water for drinking due to potential risk of health hazard. This study also demonstrated the application of HPI and human exposure hazard index to study the groundwater quality based on heavy metals' concentration.

J	Kaur, T; Bhardwaj, R; Arora, S				Kaur, Tajinder; Bhardwaj, Renu; Arora, Saroj			Assessment of groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes using hydrochemical studies in Malwa region, southwestern part of Punjab, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Deterioration of groundwater quality due to anthropogenic activities is increasing at an alarming rate in most parts of the Punjab, but limited work has been carried out on groundwater quality and monitoring. This paper highlights the groundwater quality and compares its suitability for drinking and irrigation purpose in Malwa region, a southwestern part of Punjab. The Malwa region makes up the most cultivated area of Punjab with high consumption of pesticides and fertilizers. Twenty-four water samples representing groundwater sources were collected and analyzed for almost all major cations, anions and other physicochemical parameters. Analytical results of physicochemical analysis showed majority of the samples above the permissible limits of the Indian standards. The groundwater of the study area was very hard and the relative abundance of major cations and anions was Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and HCO3- > SO42- > Cl-. Fluoride content was higher than permissible limit in 75 % of the samples. The mean concentration of arsenic in groundwater was 9.37 and 11.01lg/L during summer and winter season, respectively. The parameters like sodium adsorption ratio and sodium percentage (Na%) revealed good quality of groundwater for irrigation purposes, whereas magnesium ratio and corrosivity ratio values showed that water is not suitable for agriculture and domestic use. The dominant hydrochemical facies of groundwater was Ca-Mg-HCO3 and Ca-Mg-SO4-Cl. Chloro alkaline indices 1 and 2 indicated that reverse ion exchange is dominant in the region. The samples fall in rock dominance and evaporation dominance fields as indicated by Gibbs diagram. The saturation index shows that all the water samples were supersaturated with respect to carbonate minerals. This work thus concludes that groundwater in the study area is chemically unsuitable for domestic and agricultural uses. It is recommended to carry out a continuous water quality monitoring program and development of effective management practices for utilization of water resources.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					3301	3316		10.1007/s13201-016-0476-2								WOS:000413256900056						
J	Kamble, BS; Saxena, PR				Kamble, B. Soujanya; Saxena, Praveen Raj			Environmental impact of municipal dumpsite leachate on ground-water quality in Jawaharnagar, Rangareddy, Telangana, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The aim of the present work was to study the impact of dumpsite leachate on ground-water quality of Jawaharnagar village. Leachate and ground-water samples were investigated for various physico-chemical parameters viz., pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), carbonates (CO32-), bicarbonates (HCO3-), nitrates (NO3-), and sulphates (SO42-) during dry and wet seasons in 2015 and were reported. The groundwater was hard to very hard in nature, and the concentrations of total dissolved solids, chlorides, and nitrates were found to be exceeding the permissible levels of WHO drinking water quality standards. Piper plots revealed that the dominant hydrochemical facies of the groundwater were of calcium chloride (CaCl2) type and alkaline earths (Ca2+ and Mg2+) exceed the alkali (Na+ and SO42-), while the strong acids (Cl -and SO42-) exceed the weak acids (CO32- and HCO3-). According to USSL diagram, all the ground-water samples belong to high salinity and low-sodium type (C3S1). Overall, the groundwater samples collected around the dumpsite were found to be polluted and are unfit for human consumption but can be used for irrigation purpose with heavy drainage and irrigation patterns to control the salinity.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				OCT	2017	7	6					3333	3343		10.1007/s13201-016-0480-6								WOS:000413256900059

Here we use sharp microelectrode measurements to obtain ECG characteristics in adult zebra fish and analyze the effects of cadmium chloride (CdCl2) on the heart. We observe the overall changes of ECG parameters in different treatments (0.1 TU, 0.5 TU and 1.0 TU CdCl2), including P wave, Q wave, R wave, S wave, T wave, PR interval (atrial contraction), QRS complex (ventricular depolarization), ST segment, and QT interval (ventricular repolarization). The trends of the ECG parameters showed some responses to the concentration and exposure time of CdCl2\, but it was difficult to obtain more information about the useful indicators in water quality assessment depending on tendency analysis alone. A self-organizing map (SOM) showed that P values, R values, and T values were similar; R wave and T wave amplitude were similar; and most important, QRS value was similar to the CdCl2 stress according to the classified data patterns including CdCl2 stress (E) and ECG components based on the Ward linkage. It suggested that the duration of QRS complex was related to environmental stress E directly. The specification and evaluation of ECG parameters in Cd2+ pollution suggested that there is a markedly significant correlation between QRS complex and CdCl2 stress with the highest r (0.729) and the smallestp (0.002) among all ECG characteristics. In this case, it is concluded that QRS complex can be used as an indicator in the CdCl2 stress assessment due to the lowest AIC data abased on the linear regression model between the CdCl2 stress and ECG parameters.																	0166-445X	1879-1514				OCT	2017	191						236	244		10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.08.015								WOS:000411848700024	28869925

Safiur			Assessing irrigation water quality in Faridpur district of Bangladesh using several indices and statistical approaches	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Several water quality indices, i.e., salinity hazard (SH), sodium percentage (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), permeability index (PI), magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly's ratio (KR) and irrigation water quality (IWQ) indices are applied to assess the irrigation water quality using 60 groundwater samples collected from the study sites. This study reveals that groundwater samples are mainly Ca-MgHCO3 types. The IWQ of groundwater with various classifications are also followed to assess the water suitability for irrigation purposes. Based on IWQ index, it is observed that 68.33% of the water samples (41 locations) belong to high suitability water type, whereas 30% (18 locations) samples exhibit low suitability type for irrigation purposes in the study area. Results of the classification (EC, SH, Na%, SAR, PI, MH, and KR) indicate that groundwater in the study areas are mainly fit for irrigation uses. Besides the above findings, Na+ and Cl- concentrations reveal the positively skewed and are regarded to be extreme. Furthermore, results shows that groundwater mineralization process and rock-water interaction are mainly controlled with bivariate plots of major ions in the study areas. Subsequently, these results are validated using multiple regression models and correlation analysis. The spatial distribution of irrigation indices is carried out by geostatistical modeling. The results of semivariagram model show that most of the irrigation indices have weakly spatial dependence, suggesting agricultural and residential influences. However, it has been expected that this paper helps to give insights for a better management of the groundwater resources for the agricultural purposes in the study area.

An attempt has been made in this contribution to study the efficacy of the storm water injection systems not only in tackling urban flooding problems but also in augmenting the depleting ground water resources of the country. Two pilot studies were carried out in a centrally located area, one in a relatively open area and another in a densely populated location. A set of one recharge well and one observation well of about 40 m depth and 30 m apart was drilled in each site. Storm water was injected into the recharge wells after allowing it to pass through a specially designed natural filter system. Ground water levels were monitored at the observation wells on monthly basis and water samples were collected periodically during and after the rainfall events for chemical analysis. Initial results showed that the volume of storm water injected is proportional to the volume of storm water generated in an area. However, in the long run, the injection well having favourable hydrogeological situation and lesser silts in the storm water performed better in terms of total recharge despite having lesser volume of storm water available. Ground water quality for some parameters such as lead and cadmium remained an issue of concern, but could be controlled through construction of stricter filter system. Dilution of the injected storm water with the host ground water too significantly reduced the risks of contamination. The injection well located in the open area performed better than that of the densely populated area despite having lesser volume of storm water available. Site selection of the recharge wells, therefore, plays a vital role in the efficacy of a storm water injection system.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				OCT	2017	10	20							452	10.1007/s12517-017-3232-5								WOS:000414053300012

The mechanism and the processes are complex. Investigation of the spatiotemporal development of the hydrological process could lead to a better understanding of mine water inrush and effective countermeasures. For this reason, we investigated spatial and temporal characteristics (i.e., the changes of flow rate, groundwater level, and water quality) during a water inrush event in China, which had a flow rate of 730 m(3)/h at maximum and 300m(3)/h under a steady condition. The result shows that the water inrush developed in several stages. A mathematical model of the dynamic change between the water table and the inrush flow rate was constructed. Based on this model, we found the relationship of highly conductive flow channels between some observation boreholes and the water inrush point. In addition, the recharge velocity of the highly conductive flow channels and the equivalent mean flow velocity of the whole mine were determined. A comprehensive analysis of geological, hydrodynamic, and crustal stress conditions was conducted to study the development of the water channel near the F-13 fault and the nonlinear process from seepage stage to inrush stage. The result reveals the water inrush is likely caused by activation of faults under combined influences of high crustal stress and high hydraulic pressure.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				OCT	2017	10	19							433	10.1007/s12517-017-3216-5								WOS:000413203600017

Facing a wicked problem with optimism: issues and priorities for coral conservation in Hong Kong	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Economic development and environmental conservation are often seen as opposing forces in the arena of government policy-making. With more than 7 million people and a rich diversity of marine species and habitats, Hong Kong is an excellent case study to explore this dynamic. Despite anthropogenic impacts, Hong Kong still hosts more than 90 species of stony corals within a marine area of 1650 km 2. This is remarkable in light of the global plight of coral reefs, which have been reduced by similar to 80% worldwide in recent decades. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has not been immune to this negative trend with an unfortunate track of marine environmental disasters and, as such, can be viewed a harbinger for the future trajectory of coral reefs worldwide. Yet, the story is not entirely negative. Hong Kong possesses key assets, including capable government environmental agencies and competitive research led by local universities, which can bring novel and promising approaches for coral biodiversity conservation in an urbanized context. To coordinate and assist conservation efforts in Hong Kong, we here identify and prioritize major management efforts and identify knowledge gaps for coral conservation based on updated coral biodiversity distribution and a current literature review. Specifically, we propose five priorities for the most positive impact on conservation efforts: (1) reconstruct environmental baselines and establish long-term monitoring of local coral communities, (2) enhance the management and protection of local coral habitats, (3) improve water quality, (4) gain an understanding of the genetic connectivity among local and distant coral communities, and finally, (5) establish an active restoration program for local coral species/communities. In order to build progressive and integrative management strategies for coral biodiversity conservation in Hong Kong, we suggest specific ways in which these priorities be addressed and encourage a fresh dialogue between the government, the public and academia.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				OCT	2017	26	11					2521	2545		10.1007/s10531-017-1383-z								WOS:000412139000001

Such transformations, commonly termed regime shifts, have gained increasing attention in recent decades. Of 1084 studies documenting regime shifts, only 28% investigated the consequences for ecosystem functions and services such as habitat (13%), carbon processing (4%), or nutrient retention (4%). Although there is general consensus that a clear macrophyte state supports a higher diversity of aquatic organisms than a turbid one, the effects of shifts on primary production, carbon burial, greenhouse-gas emissions, and nutrient retention remain ambiguous. Shifts between the two states also affect drinking-water quality and the recreational value of lakes, leading to conflicting management measures and potentially deteriorating natural functions. We call for more comprehensive studies on the effects of regime shifts on ecosystem functions in shallow lakes to guide their sustainable management.

We tested how excavation (maintenance) of agricultural drains (ditches) altered fish assemblages. Uncertainty regarding the effects of drain maintenance on fish assemblages has been a source of tension between landowners, drain superintendents, and fishery managers. Fish assemblages in eight southwestern Ontario drains were sampled repeatedly from before to 2 years after drain maintenance using a replicated before-after, control-impact (BACI) design. Relative to reference sites, we found no evidence for short-or long-term decreases in the number of species and total abundance of fishes following drain maintenance, nor any consistent change in assemblage composition, despite clear changes in physical habitat. The fish assemblages in drains were resilient to drain maintenance and did not show changes expected to concern fishery managers. Our findings provide fishery managers with the information needed to manage drain maintenance more effectively under the Fish Protection Program of the Fisheries Act and to develop drain maintenance practices that balance the needs of agriculture with the protection of fish biodiversity.																	0706-652X	1205-7533				OCT	2017	74	10					1538	1548		10.1139/cjfas-2016-0361								WOS:000411897600005

The present study showed that values of temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chloride, phosphate, sulfate, fecal coliform, Streptococcus, Salmonella spp., and Enterococci were significantly higher in the dry season compared to samples taken in the wet season. Concurrently, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, suspended matter (SM), NH4+ presented values significantly lower in dry season than surveys in rainy season. The following parameters BOD5, COD, SO42-, Cl-, SM, Salmonella spp. did not meet the Tunisian standard NT 106 for surface water quality. Analysis of pollutant concentrations via PCA showed that the two first components accounted for 87.34 and 93.17% of the total variance for dry and rainy season sampling, respectively. The first component included T, pH, EC, SM, SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, turbidity, COD, BOD, PO43-, Enterococci, fecal coliform and streptococcus, Salmonella spp., and total bacteria. The second included DO and NO3-. Cluster analysis identified the five sampling sites into three groups in the rainy and dry season based on seasonal differences and various pollution levels caused by physicochemical and bacteriological properties. The results suggest that future monitoring can include fewer sampling sites, and stratified random sampling plans can save time and resources.

Future Scenarios Modeling of Urban Stormwater Management Response to Impacts of Climate Change and Urbanization	CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER												Future scenarios modeling is used to investigate the effectiveness of the urban stormwater infrastructure and its response to potential future changes. The changes of urban stormwater, both in-flow quantity and water quality, in response to climate change and urbanization are examined and tested in two highly developed urban catchments using the US Environmental Protection Agency's Storm Water Management Model. Similar responses are observed in the two catchments, despite their differences in size and land use. Flow quantity and water quality appears to be more sensitive to urbanization factors than to climatic change. With respect to factors attributable to urbanization, urban intensification (land use plus population density) has more of an effect than land-use changes alone. Low-impact development, as a key adaptation measure, could be effective in mitigating the adverse impacts of future changes on urban stormwater. The methodology developed in this study may be useful for urban stormwater planning and testing such plans against future urbanization and climate change scenarios.																	1863-0650	1863-0669				OCT	2017	45	10							1700111	10.1002/clen.201700111								WOS:000412916700006

Due to its physiological importance and sensitivity to various pollutants, CA activity has been used as biomarker of aquatic contamination. Considering that in bivalves the sensitivity of CA to pollutants seems to be tissue specific, we proposed here to analyze CA activity of hemolymph, gill and mantle of Crassostrea rhizophorae collected in two tropical Brazilian estuaries with different levels of anthropogenic impact, in dry and rainy season. We found increased carbonic anhydrase activity in hemolymph, gill and mantle of oysters collected in the Paraiba Estuary (a site of high anthropogenic impact) when compared to oysters from Mamanguape Estuary (inserted in an area of environmental preservation), especially in the rainy season. CA of hemolymph and gill were more sensitive than mantle CA to aquatic contamination. This study enhances the suitability of carbonic anhydrase activity for field biomarker applications with bivalves and brings new and relevant information on hemolymph carbonic anhydrase activity as biomarker of aquatic contamination.																	1532-0456	1878-1659				OCT	2017	201						19	25		10.1016/j.cbpc.2017.08.008								WOS:000414109100003	28888876

Model parameters for representative wetland plant functional groups	ECOSPHERE												Wetlands provide a wide variety of ecosystem services including water quality remediation, biodiversity refugia, groundwater recharge, and floodwater storage. Realistic estimation of ecosystem service benefits associated with wetlands requires reasonable simulation of the hydrology of each site and realistic simulation of the upland and wetland plant growth cycles. Objectives of this study were to quantify leaf area index (LAI), light extinction coefficient (k), and plant nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) concentrations in natural stands of representative plant species for some major plant functional groups in the United States. Functional groups in this study were based on these parameters and plant growth types to enable process-based modeling. We collected data at four locations representing some of the main wetland regions of the United States. At each site, we collected on-the-ground measurements of fraction of light intercepted, LAI, and dry matter within the 2013-2015 growing seasons. Maximum LAI and k variables showed noticeable variations among sites and years, while overall averages and functional group averages give useful estimates for multisite simulation modeling. Variation within each species gives an indication of what can be expected in such natural ecosystems. For P and K, the concentrations from highest to lowest were spikerush (Eleocharis macrostachya), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), smartweed (Polygonum spp.), cattail (Typha spp.), and hardstem bulrush (Schoenoplectus acutus). Spikerush had the highest N concentration, followed by smartweed, bulrush, reed canary grass, and then cattail. These parameters will be useful for the actual wetland species measured and for the wetland plant functional groups they represent. These parameters and the associated process-based models offer promise as valuable tools for evaluating environmental benefits of wetlands and for evaluating impacts of various agronomic practices in adjacent areas as they affect wetlands.

J	Palanca-Tan, R				Palanca-Tan, Rosalina			Health and water quality benefits of alternative sewerage systems in Metro Manila, Philippines	ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION												This paper presents results of a household survey on the current sanitation and sewerage conditions in Metro Manila. The survey included a choice, measured in terms of the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP), between two alternative domestic wastewater treatment systems: 1) a sewerage system connecting individual households to a treatment plant through sewer lines; and 2) a combined drainage-sewerage system in which wastewater effluent flows with rainwater through flood canals and is intercepted for treatment only at a certain point in the waterway. With the second, the health improvement effect may be limited, but the cost can be significantly lower. The finding in favour of the combined drainage-sewerage system lends some support to this new approach in municipal wastewater treatment, which some other increasingly congested metropolises in Asian countries are likewise adopting, as an alternative to the more costly individual household sewer connections.																	0956-2478	1746-0301				OCT	2017	29	2					567	580		10.1177/0956247817718402								WOS:000412087700014

The methodology can be used to elaborate and compare future socio-economic development scenarios to select the best interventions based on three criteria: (1) ideas of experts and stakeholders about the importance of scenarios, (2) impacts of each scenario on surface water quality in watershed, and (3) benefit-cost analysis for each scenario. A score is computed for each scenario based on a weighted sum technique which enables to take into consideration different level of importance for the three criteria. The methodology is applied to Cau River basin in Vietnam, with the aid of a computer tool, to assess interventions for river water quality improvement within the context of population growth and urbanization. The results show that fast future population growth in upstream has significant impacts. In 2020, an increase of 116 % of the population in Bac Kan town can lead to an increase of 120 and 135 % in BOD5 and NH4+ median concentrations, respectively, with the implementation of a treatment plant for 10,000 people in Bac Kan town. Therefore, the increase of the domestic wastewater treatment plant's capacity in Bac Kan town, at least twice as the projection of local government, is necessary. These results will help decision makers to select the best interventions for Cau River basin management.																	1387-585X	1573-2975				OCT	2017	19	5					1701	1729		10.1007/s10668-016-9822-7								WOS:000412840100007

Trophic state indicators are a better predictor of Florida bass condition compared to temperature in Florida's freshwater bodies	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Forecasted increases in global temperatures will likely have profound effects on freshwater fishes. Overlaid on increasing global temperatures, human populations are expected to grow, which will increase anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in freshwater ecosystems. Florida (US) represents the equatorial range limit for many freshwater fishes, thus these species are potentially at risk to climate warming. Likewise, Florida's population is expected to aggressively expand, increasing risk for nutrient enrichment. In this study, we examined whether maximum water temperatures or trophic state indicators (a proxy for nutrient enrichment) better explains variation in Florida Bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) condition across 23 different Florida freshwater bodies distributed throughout the state. Florida Bass lengths and weights, temperature, and chlorophyll-alpha, total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) measures were collected in the late summer and fall from 2010 to 2012. We described relationships between bass relative condition and environmental measurements (temperature, and trophic state indicators) across these lake-year combinations using linear and non-linear regressions. We found no significant relationship between temperature and bass condition (r(2) = 0.01). However, we found that trophic state indicators did predict bass condition (r(2) = 0.39-0.50). Though research is needed to more rigorously assess the effects of rising temperature on bass condition, our results may suggest that lake productivity is currently an influential driver on Florida Bass. As such, management efforts should continue to closely monitor and manage water quality and potential nutrient enrichment in Florida's freshwater waters, as bass condition appears to be closely tied to lake productivity.																	0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2017	100	10					1181	1192		10.1007/s10641-017-0635-9								WOS:000412840700003						
J	Amacker, TM; Alford, JB				Amacker, Todd M.; Alford, J. Brian			Selective predation by reintroduced juvenile Lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in Ft. Loudoun reservoir, Tennessee (USA)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Following water quality and minimum flow improvements to the impounded Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have been restocked annually since 2000. Our goal was to seasonally assess foraging mode of this recovering population in Ft. Loudoun Reservoir in the Upper Tennessee River. During 2014-15, individuals were captured using trot-lines in a 13-km reach that supports the greatest density of lake sturgeon. We used colonic flushing and gastric lavage techniques to obtain diet. We took systematic benthic sediment grabs along multiple transects throughout the reach and opportunistically deployed rock cages filled with hard substrates to assess potential prey that colonize hard surfaces. Foraging modes of lake sturgeon were determined by comparing relative abundances of invertebrate taxa in the gut contents (6581 invertebrates) of 28 fish to the relative abundances of the same invertebrate taxa collected from the resource base (1667 invertebrates). Proportional similarity, Levin's niche breadth, and Manly's index were used to assess the degree of prey selectivity. Lake sturgeon fed selectively on a narrow range of available prey consisting mostly of larval chironomids (93% composition by number during warm season, 96% during cool season), some genera of which they prey upon selectively, primarily Chironomus sp., but to a lesser extent Procladius, Ablabesmyia, Coelotanypus, and Cryptochironomus spp. Meanwhile, other abundant taxa in the resource base were avoided, such as Oligochaetes, Hexagenia mayflies, and the chironomid Glyptotendipes. Our results illustrate that assessing seasonally available prey from habitat utilized by lake sturgeon is important when investigating diet preference.																	0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2017	100	10					1301	1314		10.1007/s10641-017-0643-9								WOS:000412840700011

The authors made a great effort measuring 21 water quality indicators for the surface waters from 14 monitoring and sampling stations selected in the Coruh River Basin (northeastern Turkey) during a period from June 2014 to May 2015. Unfortunately, various mistakes, e.g., several misevaluated water quality indicators and a number of mistyped parts, as well as incomplete evaluation were identified with respect to the surface water quality in the Coruh River Basin, northeastern Turkey. Moreover, Bilgin and Konanc (Environ Earth Sci 75: 1029, 2016) considered the Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulation (TWPCR 2004), which was repealed as of 30.11.2012, and the Council Directive 75/440/EEC (1975), which was repealed as of 22.12.2007, to evaluate the surface water quality in the Coruh River Basin, northeastern Turkey. The mistakes were corrected, and the surface water quality was reevaluated with reference to the Turkish Regulation being in force.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	20							700	10.1007/s12665-017-6984-z								WOS:000413674900003

Hydrogeological modelling of these data can be implemented with physically based models (i.e. MODFLOW, MT3D.). Other approaches that are simpler to implement may be a good substitute for these numerical approaches. This is the case of probabilistic approaches and especially the statistical approach neural networks. The proposed method (coupling GIS/ANN) is especially suitable for the problem of large-scale and long-term simulation. It has been applied in the spatial prediction of nitrates in the chalk aquifer in Bethune (North of France). This confined chalk aquifer in its northern part provides natural denitrification and ensures a good drinking water quality, while in its southern part this aquifer is facing a high level of nitrate concentrations far above the European Nitrates Directive standard. A good groundwater management of this ecosystems service is therefore of great importance for regional water management. Thus, the spatial distribution of nitrate concentration obtained by GIS/ANN coupling model was compared with the results obtained from the numerical modelling (MT3D) and validated by the real measurements. ANN modelling seems to be more realistic than MT3D modelling both for 2003 and 2004. This is true for both of the nitrate concentrations and their difference. So, ANN modelling's spatially distributed difference with observed data ranges from - 3.67 to + 1.24 mg/l in 2003 and - 10.8 to + 6.51 mg/l in 2004, whereas for the MT3D model, this difference ranges from - 11.5 to + 17.9 mg/l in 2003 and - 9.91 to + 16.9 mg/l in 2004. The satisfactory results of the ANN model allowed to launch prospective simulations for 2025 under two groundwater recharge scenarios: a deficit year (150 mm/year) and a rainy year (500 mm/year) show an expansion of the exploitable zone ([NO3-] < 50 mg/L) in the case of a rainy year. The results demonstrate the potential of ANN modelling of spatially distributed hydrogeological data for groundwater management of nitrate pollution. From a groundwater management point of view, the GIS/ANN modelling represents an alternative data analysis to obtain fast results using a less tedious method whose results are satisfactory.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	19							649	10.1007/s12665-017-6990-1								WOS:000412736700005

Findings on water quality in Upper Mustang (Nepal) from a preliminary geochemical and geological survey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The major ion and trace element chemistry of water samples, including springs, rivers and irrigation ditches, collected during a survey on August 2016 in the Upper Mustang region of the Mustang District of Dhawalagiri Zone (Nepal) has been investigated. The Upper Mustang region, a cold desert, represents a hot-spot for climate change: indeed, violent hailstorms and rainstorms have been recently observed, consequently exposing land to erosion. Results of this study indicate that waters in the region belong to the Ca-HCO3, Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 and Na-K-Cl-types, reflecting different hydrochemical regimes. Uranium is widespread in waters, with concentrations up to 19 mu g/L recorded in a potable water supply. Locally, anoxic conditions affect uranium mobility due to the low solubility of U(IV) minerals. Highly toxic thallium was detected in a thermal spring at an elevated concentration (45 mu g/L Tl). The association of thallium with high concentrations of iron suggests that these elements are derived from pyrite oxidation. Detectable levels of thallium were also measured in the water of an irrigation ditch. Lithium concentrations ranged from 7 mu g/L to 12 mg/L in the thermal water and showed a strong association with chloride ions. Arsenic concentrations up to 4.7 mu g/L were measured in tributaries of the Kali Gandaki river. The data provide evidence that solutes in water have originated from an array of input sources, including carbonate dissolution, the dissolution of soluble salts, silicate weathering and localized sulfide oxidation. In particular, chemical weathering of granitic rocks is likely the primary source for metals and metalloids in waters. Since the erosion rate is a factor affecting lithological weathering, highintensity rainfalls due to climate change are expected to influence the release and fate of potentially harmful elements in the in the Upper Mustang Valley.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	19							651	10.1007/s12665-017-6991-0								WOS:000412736700007

Water in Central Asia: an integrated assessment for science-based management	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Central Asia contains one of the largest internal drainage basins in the world, and its continental location results in limited availability of both surface and groundwater. Since the twentieth century, water resources of the region have been exploited beyond sustainable levels. From small Mongolian headwater streams to the mighty Aral Sea, surface waters have been partially desiccated. Demands from the agricultural, energy and raw material sectors as well as population growth have not only increased water abstractions, but also left a diverse and strong pollution footprint on rivers, lakes and groundwater bodies. Such changes in water quantity and quality have not only led to a degradation of aquatic and riparian ecosystems, but also they have placed the region's socioeconomic development at risk. Because of the complexity of Central Asia's water problems, integrated assessment and management approaches are required. Despite some shortcomings in practical implementation, the widespread adoption of the Integrated Water Resources Management and water-food-energy nexus approaches may be keys to a more sustainable future. This thematic issue aims to provide documentation of the current state of scientific knowledge, ranging from hydrological research to water quality investigations, and offers an assessment of ecosystems and the services provided by them. Reviews and case studies on different management options conclude the thematic issue by providing insights into field-tested solutions for the region's water challenges.

Experimental investigation of fine sediment deposition using particle image velocimetry	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In order to create natural and healthy water ecosystems, the impact of hydrological processes in ponds must be identified. Pond structure may affect water quality in many ways. The present study provides a novel insight into some of the hydrological processes as well as how to employ retentions to enhance storm water detention and manage discharge. In this research, particle image velocimetry is utilized to study the two-dimensional collecting efficiency of fine sediments by retention structures with a range of hydraulic features. To examine the hydrodynamic behavior of water mixed with fine particles, a sediment basin was designed. Fluorescent polymer particles (1-50 mu m) were subsequently added to this fluid mix. This study demonstrates that gravitational force increases fine particle settlement by over 50% at greater depths. The optimum collecting efficiency of sediments at the water surface was found to be around 80%. It was also determined that flow rate and particle size are directly correlated and that inlets and outlets at higher levels impede fine particle dispersion in the water column. For these reasons, it seems that adjusting the hydraulic parameters may diminish siltation.

Spatial distribution maps of nitrate pollution for groundwater in the study area were created using a geographical information system (GIS), and the potential for contamination in the entire plain was determined. Seasonal variations of nitrate concentrations in groundwater were assessed by sampling during spring, summer, autumn, and winter in the period April 2012 to January 2013. The groundwater samples were analyzed for nitrate (NO3). The results obtained were evaluated using a number of national and international standards and classifications. Seasonal average concentration distribution maps were established for nitrate to determine the extent and severity of contamination by this parameter in groundwater in the region. The monitoring indicated that nitrate concentrations in only two wells exceeded the recommended drinking water limit and that groundwater beneath the basin is currently suitable for irrigation.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				OCT	2017	76	20							698	10.1007/s12665-017-7044-4								WOS:000413674900001

Impact of Corrosion Control on Biofilm Development in Simulated Partial Lead Service Line Replacements	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Interaction of water quality, flow conditions, and the presence of lead and biofilm was examined in simulated partial lead service line replacement. Recirculating pipe loops were connected to individual 90-L reservoirs, and biofilm was collected from polycarbonate coupons. Three corrosion inhibitors, including sodium orthophosphate (OP) (1 mg-P/L), zinc orthophosphate (ZOP) (1 mg-P/L), or sodium silicate (10 mg/L), were used to treat Pb-Cu pipe loops. Controls included an "inhibitor-free,'' "galvanic free,'' and "lead-free'' with Pb-Cu, Pb-PVC, and PVC-PVC coupled pipe loops, respectively. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was used to measure energy production of living cells and as a proxy to assess biofilm growth. The two highest (significant) ATP counts were found in the OP (under stagnant conditions) and ZOP (under flow-through conditions). Sodium silicates generally produced lower ATP counts compared to the phosphate-based inhibitors in the flow-through condition, although these differences were not statistically significant. Significant positive correlation between presence of lead and biofilm (ATP) and presence of copper and biofilm (ATP) were observed, although this observation does not imply a linear relationship. Biofilm was observed to act as a significant reservoir for lead with values ranging from 0.06 to 0.81 mu g Pb/cm(2) before chlorination to 0.04 to 0.21 mu g Pb/cm(2) postchlorination. This work highlights the potential for biofilm to act as a reservoir and subsequently as a source of lead release, and underscores the value of including biofilm evaluation when selecting corrosion inhibitors.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				OCT	2017	34	10					711	720		10.1089/ees.2016.0507								WOS:000412299000003

A continuous consumption of polluted water as drinking water or for culinary purposes is by no means a minor hazard for people's health that must be studied. This research presents a new methodology for the spatial analysis of health risk rate from intake of nitratepolluted groundwater. The method is illustrated through its application to a water quality sampling campaign performed in the south of Spain in 2003. The probability risk model used by the US Environmental Protection Agency has been applied, considering a residential intake framework and three representative population age groups (10, 40 and 65 years). The method was based upon coupling Monte Carlo simulations and geostatistics, which allowed mapping of the health risk coefficient (RC). The maps obtained were interpreted in the framework of water resources management and user's health protection (municipalities). The results showed waterborne health risk caused by nitrate-polluted water is moderately low for the region. The observed risk was larger for the elderly and children, although no significant differences were found among the three age groups (RC average values of 95th percentile for age of 0.37, 0.33 and 0.37, respectively). Significant risk values of RC[ 1 were obtained for 10 % of the surface in the NW site of the study area, where the municipalities with the highest contamination thresholds are located (agricultural activity). Nitrate concentration and intake rate stood out as the main explanatory variables of the RC.

Twenty-nine borehole water samples were collected in the dry season (July/August 2012) and another 27 samples from the same localities in the wet season (March 2013) from the study area. The samples were analysed for trace elements arsenic (As), cadmium(Cd), chromium(Cr), selenium (Se), and lead (Pb) using the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry technique. The average concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Se, and Pb were 11.3, 0.3, 33.1, 7.1, and 6.0 lg/L in the dry season and 11.0, 0.3, 28.3, 4.2, and 6.6 mu lg/L in the wet season, respectively. There was evidence of seasonal fluctuations in concentrations of all analysed elements except for As, though Cd and Pb displayed low concentrations (<0.2 and <6.0 mu g/L, respectively) in almost all sampled boreholes. Se and Cr concentrations slightly exceed the South African National Standard permissible limits for safe drinking water in few boreholes. A total of four boreholes exceeded the water quality guideline for As with two of these boreholes containing five times more As than the prescribed limit. The spatial distribution patterns of elevated As closely correlate with the underlying geology. The findings of this investigation have important implications for human health of the communities drinking from the affected boreholes.																	0269-4042	1573-2983				OCT	2017	39	5					1201	1219		10.1007/s10653-016-9887-0								WOS:000413749200017	27744552

We analyze Martin County, Florida waterfront home sales from 2001 to 2010 accounting for the associated significant real estate fluctuations in this area through flexible econometric controls in space and time. We apply a segmented regression methodology to identify housing market price instability over time, interact water quality with these identified market segmentations, and embed these interactions within a spatial fixed effect model to further account for any spatial heterogeneity in the waterfront market. Results indicate that water quality improvement is associated with higher property values. We find no evidence that the economic downturn crowded out concern for the water quality in this area. We further impute an implicit prices of $2614, evaluated at the sample mean, for 1 % point increase in the water quality grade.																	0924-6460	1573-1502				OCT	2017	68	2					319	341		10.1007/s10640-016-0020-8								WOS:000413957400005

Theory suggests that these estimates should be sensitive to geospatial factors including resource scale, market extent, and the availability of substitutes and complements. Valuation meta-regression models addressing the quantity of non-market commodities sometimes incorporate spatial variables that proxy for a subset of these effects. However, meta-analyses of WTP for environmental quality generally omit geospatial factors such as these, leading to benefit transfers that are invariant to these factors. This paper reports on a meta-regression model for water quality benefit transfer that incorporates spatially explicit factors predicted by theory to influence WTP. The metadata are drawn from stated preference studies that estimate per household WTP for water quality changes in United States water bodies, and combine primary study information with extensive geospatial data from external sources. Results find that geospatial variables are associated with significant WTP variations as predicted by theory, and that inclusion of these variables reduces transfer errors.																	0924-6460	1573-1502				OCT	2017	68	2					343	375		10.1007/s10640-016-0021-7								WOS:000413957400006						
J	Strangway, C; Bowman, MF; Kirkwood, AE				Strangway, Carrie; Bowman, Michelle F.; Kirkwood, Andrea E.			Assessing landscape and contaminant point-sources as spatial determinants of water quality in the Vermilion River System, Ontario, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The Vermilion River and major tributaries (VRMT) are located in the Vermilion watershed (4272 km(2)) in north-central Ontario, Canada. This watershed not only is dominated by natural land-cover but also has a legacy of mining and other development activities. The VRMT receive various point (e.g., sewage effluent) and non-point (e.g., mining activity runoff) inputs, in addition to flow regulation features. Further development in the Vermilion watershed has been proposed, raising concerns about cumulative impacts to ecosystem health in the VRMT. Due to the lack of historical assessments on riverine-health in the VRMT, a comprehensive suite of water quality parameters was collected monthly at 28 sites during the ice-free period of 2013 and 2014. Canadian water quality guidelines and objectives were not met by an assortment of water quality parameters, including nutrients and metals. This demonstrates that the VRMT is an impacted system with several pollution hotspots, particularly downstream of wastewater treatment facilities. Water quality throughout the river system appeared to be influenced by three distinct land-cover categories: forest, barren, and agriculture. Three spatial pathway models (geographical, topographical, and river network) were employed to assess the complex interactions between spatial pathways, stressors, and water quality condition. Topographical landscape analyses were performed at five different scales, where the strongest relationships between water quality and land-use occurred at the catchment scale. Sites on the main stem of Junction Creek, a tributary impacted by industrial and urban development, had above average concentrations for the majority of water quality parameters measured, including metals and nitrogen. The river network pathway (i.e., asymmetric eigenvector map (AEM)) and topographical feature (i.e., catchment land-use) models explained most of the variation in water quality (62.2%), indicating that they may be useful tools in assessing the spatial determinants of water quality decline.

Vegetation restoration projects have been carried out. However, the influences of water quality and hydrology on vegetation restoration from seed banks have been rarely investigated. This experiment aimed to identify the effect of water level and nitrogen loading (ammonium and nitrate) on seedling emergence and recruitment from the riparian seed bank of the river in this basin. Most of the species in the seed bank germinated under moist conditions. Under flooding conditions, however, the growth of aquatic species, especially Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara, was inhibited when the nitrogen concentration increased. At 0.37 mg/L NH4+-N in the water column, the growth of V. natans was inhibited. The results suggested that flooding was a primary limiting factor of seedling emergence. The inhibitory effect of high nitrogen loading on the growth of aquatic species was one of the main driving mechanisms of macrophyte degradation under flooding conditions; nevertheless, competitive advantage might determine the community pattern in moist habitats. Therefore, water level control and water quality improvement should be the key aspects of vegetation restoration in degraded rivers or lakes.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	28					22688	22697		10.1007/s11356-017-9926-0								WOS:000412452200055	28815432

Arsenic constitutes a broad range of elements from the Earth's crust and is released into the environment from both anthropogenic and natural sources due to its relative mobility under different redox conditions. The toxicity of arsenic is described in its inorganic form, as inorganic arsenic compounds can leach into different environments. Sampling was carried out in the Bestari Jaya catchment while using a land use map to locate the site, and experiments were conducted via sequential extraction and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy to quantify proportions of arsenic in the sediment samples. The results show that metals in sediments of nonresidual fractions, which are more likely to be likely released into aquatic environments, are more plentiful than the residual sediment fractions. These findings support the mobility of heavy metals and especially arsenic through sediment layers, which can facilitate remediation in environments heavily polluted with heavy metals.

Thirteen stations along Alur Ilmu were selected to produce thematic maps through spatial distribution analysis based on six water quality parameters of Malaysia's Water Quality Index (WQI) for dry and raining seasons. The maps generated were used to identify the highly polluted region for phytoremediation applicability assessment. Four free-floating plants were tested in treating water samples from the highly polluted region under three different conditions, namely controlled, aerated and normal treatments. The selected free-floating plants were water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes), rose water lettuce (Pistia sp.) and pennywort (Centella asiatica). The results showed that Alur Ilmu was more polluted during dry season compared to raining season based on the water quality analysis. During dry season, four parameters were marked as polluted along Alur Ilmu, namely dissolve oxygen (DO), 4.72 mg/L (class III); ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), 0.85 mg/L (class IV); total suspended solid (TSS), 402 mg/L (class V) and biological oxygen demand (BOD), 3.89 mg/L (class III), whereas, two parameters were classed as polluted during raining season, namely total suspended solid (TSS), 571 mg/L (class V) and biological oxygen demand (BOD), 4.01 mg/L (class III). The thematic maps generated from spatial distribution analysis using Kriging gridding method showed that the highly polluted region was recorded at station AL 5. Hence, water samples were taken from this station for pollution removal analysis. All the free-floating plants were able to reduce TSS and COD in less than 14 days. However, water hyacinth showed the least detrimental effect from the phytoremediation process compared to other free-floating plants, thus made it a suitable free-floating plants to be used for on-site treatment.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	29			SI		22873	22884		10.1007/s11356-017-0079-y								WOS:000412453500012	28905277					
J	Olowe, KO; Kumarasamy, M				Olowe, Kayode O.; Kumarasamy, Muthukrishnavellaisamy			Development of the hybrid cells in series model to simulate ammonia nutrient pollutant transport along the Umgeni River	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Discharge of organic waste results in high nutrient pollution of the water bodies which is a major menace to the environment. A high quantity of nutrients such as ammonia causes a reduction in the dissolved oxygen level and induces algal growth in the water bodies. Water quality models have been the tools to evaluate the rate at which streams can disperse the pollutants they receive. Many water quality models are flawed either because of their inadequacy to completely simulate the advection component of the pollutant transport, or because of the limited application of the models, due to inaccurate estimation of model parameters. The hybrid cell in series (HCIS) developed by Ghosh et al. (2004) has been able to overcome such difficulties associated with the mixing cell-based models. Thus, the current study focuses on developing an analytical solution for the pollutant transport of the ammonia concentration through the plug flow, the first and second well-mixed cells of the HCIS model. The HCIS model coupled with the first order kinetic equation for ammonia nutrient was developed to simulate the ammonia pollutant concentration in the water column. The ammonia concentration at various points along the river system was assessed by considering the effects of the transformation of ammonia to nitrite, the uptake of ammonia by the algae, the respiration rate of the algae and the input of benthic source to the ammonia concentration in the water column. The proposed model was tested using synthetic data, and the HCIS-NH3 model simulations for spatial and temporal variation of ammonia pollutant transport were analysed. The simulated results of the HCIS-NH3 model agreed with the Fickian-based advection-dispersion equation (ADE) for simulating ammonia concentration solved using an explicit finite difference scheme. The HCIS-NH3 model also showed a good agreement with the observed data from the Umgeni River, except during rainy periods.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	29			SI		22967	22979		10.1007/s11356-017-9916-2								WOS:000412453500019	28819754

This paper presents total characteristics of sediments collected from Jiaxing, China. Size distribution and concentrations of volatile solids (VS) and four metals (Pb, Cu, Zn, Cr) of sediment samples from seven land use categories were analyzed. Then, the sediment samples were graded five fractions according to its settling velocity through the custom-built settling velocity-grading device. Sediment mass and pollution load distribution based on settling velocity were also assessed. The results show that there are relatively high level of heavy metal load in the sediment of separated storm drainage systems in Jiaxing, especially for the catchment of residential area (RA), road of developed area (RDA), and industrial area (IA). Although grain size follows a trend of increasing along with settling velocity, the methods of settling velocity grading are meaningful for stormwater treatment facilities with precipitation. For all land use categories, the pollution concentrations of the three lower settling velocity-fractionated sediment are relatively consistent and higher than others. Combined with mass distribution, the pollution percentage of fraction with different velocities for seven land use categories were also evaluated. Based on it, the statistical conclusion of design target settling velocity to different pollution load removal rates are drawn, which is helpful to guide design of on-site precipitation separation facilities.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	29			SI		23133	23143		10.1007/s11356-017-9882-8								WOS:000412453500032	28828552

To gain insights into the predominant factors affecting the fate of ARGs in a highly polluted urban river in eastern China, a total of 285 ARGs, microbial communities, and 20 physicochemical parameters were analyzed for 17 sites. A total of 258 unique ARGs were detected using high-throughput qPCR, and the absolute abundance of total ARGs was positively correlated with total organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen concentrations (P < 0.01). ARG abundance and diversity were greatly altered by microbial community structure. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the combined effects of multiple factors contributed to the profile and dissemination of ARGs, and variation of microbial communities was the major factor affecting the distribution of ARGs. The disparate distribution of some bacteria, including Bacteroides from mammalian gastrointestinal flora, Burkholderia from zoonotic infectious diseases, and Zoogloea from wastewater treatment, indicates that the urban river was strongly influenced by point-source pollution. Results imply that microbial community shifts caused by changes in water quality may lead to the spread of ARGs, and point-source pollution in urban rivers requires greater attention to control the transfer of ARGs between environmental bacteria and pathogens.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2017	24	30					23753	23762		10.1007/s11356-017-0032-0								WOS:000412930300031	28864929

With the combined drivers of climate change and human activities, eutrophication has expanded from warm shallow lakes to cold-water lakes in relatively high latitude regions and has raised greater concerns over lake aquatic ecosystem health. A two-year field study was carried out to investigate water quality, phytoplankton characteristics and eutrophication status in a typical alpine glacial lake of Tianchi, a scenic area and an important drinking water source in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, in 2014 and 2015. Clear seasonal and annual variations of nutrients and organic pollutants were found especially during rainy seasons. For the phytoplankton community, Bacillariophyta held the dominant position in terms of both species and biomass throughout the year, suggesting the dominant characteristics of diatoms in the phytoplankton structure in such a high-altitude cold-water lake. This was quite different from plain and warm lakes troubled with cyanobacterial blooming. Moreover, the dominant abundance of Cyclotella sp. in Tianchi might suggest regional warming caused by climate change, which might have profound effects on the local ecosystems and hydrological cycle. Based on water quality parameters, a comprehensive trophic level index TLI (Sigma) was calculated to estimate the current status of eutrophication, and the results inferred emerging eutrophication in Tianchi. Results from Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and correlation analysis of phytoplankton genera and physico-chemical variables of water indicated that abiotic factors significantly influenced the phytoplankton community and its succession in Tianchi Lake. These abiotic factors could explain 77.82% of the total variance, and ammonium was identified as the most discriminant variable, which could explain 41% of the total variance followed by TP (29%). An estimation of annual nutrient loadings to Tianchi was made, and the results indicated that about 212.97 t of total nitrogen and 32.14 t of total phosphorus were transported into Tianchi Lake annually. Human socio-economic activities (runoff caused by historical overgrazing and increasing tourism) were identified as the most important contributors to Tianchi nutrient loadings.

J	Overduin, N; Moore, ML				Overduin, Natasha; Moore, Michele-Lee			Social license to operate: Not a proxy for accountability in water governance	GEOFORUM												With the emergence of more collaborative, watershed governance arrangements and the engagement of various actors in decision-making processes, new questions emerge about the potential roles for these organizations and agencies in both upholding accountability, and in being held accountable. Therefore, this study explores the intersection between alternative collaborative watershed governance approaches, and the simultaneous emergence of the concept of social license as an accountability instrument in relation to water governance. Based on an empirical analysis of a case study in southeast British Columbia, where water quality contamination is primarily the result of coal mining, this study seeks to: (1) examine how social license is understood by a range of watershed actors; (2) better understand whether social license may be useful as a watershed-based or community accountability instrument as new collaborative modes of watershed governance emerge; and, (3) explore how social license may be enforced or enabled. Findings show how industry efforts to earn social license have created benefits, such as enabling community-based water monitoring, thereby building capacity for deeper community engagement in governance processes and a greater ability for the community to uphold accountability. However, we confirm that social license is not a proxy or silver bullet for enhancing accountability in collaborative watershed governance. Our findings reveal four specific limitations regarding the use of social license as a principle for accountability in collaborative watershed governance.					, Michele-Lee/0000-0002-8837-524X												0016-7185	1872-9398				OCT	2017	85						72	81		10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.07.008								WOS:000413127400011

It may also lead to community-level impacts that provide public value, such as water quality protection, water conservation, and protection of biodiversity. In addition to documenting such outcomes and impacts, it is important to quantify their economic value, connect the value to actions taken by extension audiences, and demonstrate to extension's stakeholders a return on investment. However, it is difficult to document the economic contributions of consumer horticulture and even more difficult to document the economic impact of consumer horticulture extension programs. CH reaches individuals and communities directly and indirectly through personal gardens and landscapes, indoor flowers and plants, school and community gardens, and horticulture therapy. The economic contributions and benefits of consumer horticulture are challenging to quantify, but can be evaluated using several different strategies, including measuring the consumer dollars spent and the economy driven by consumers' purchase of gardening supplies and landscape services. A second strategy is to examine the value of consumers' gardening actions on environmental ecosystem services that support soils and plants, provide food and raw materials, and regulate functions, such as pollination, storm water catchment, water quality preservation, green waste reduction, and wildlife habitat and diversity. A third strategy is to focus on cultural, social, and health system services, such as education, recreation, and therapy, that result in exercise, nutrition, health, and happiness. Using a combination of these strategies, workgroups of Tennessee extension professionals are balancing the feasibility of data collection with the usefulness of the data gathered by developing realistic and robust outcome indicators that will form the basis for local and statewide reporting.																	1063-0198	1943-7714				OCT	2017	27	5					591	598		10.21273/HORTTECH03784-17								WOS:000413999500005

Three irrigation treatments were used, a standard nutrient solution or control (T-0), runoff water collected from kneeholy plants irrigated with the standard nutrient solution blended 50: 50 with tap water (T-1), and 100% runoff water collected from kneeholy plants irrigated with the standard nutrient solution (T-2), in which the nutrient concentrations were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Growth, photosynthetic parameters, and mineral composition were measured at the end of the experiment. Electrical conductivity and pH increased with increasing runoff application (decreased blending). Treatment 2 had significantly higher plant height, number of branches, number of leaves, leaf area index, and dry weight. Treatments 1 and 2 had significantly lower root lengths compared with the control. Chlorophyll concentration and green index color in leaves were greater in T-2 and T-1 than T0. The mineral composition of roots and leaves was affected by irrigation treatment, resulting in an increase of sodium and chloride concentration and a decline of nitrogen and phosphorous concentration compared with the control. The reuse of runoff water was beneficial for growing this commercially important halophytic species in Spain, a consideration that is particularly relevant in locations with water quality, quantity issues, or both.

Modeling results suggest an increase of 0.5% and 3.5% in the average annual streamflow at the basin outlet (Grafton, Illinois) during 2081-2100, respectively, for A1B and A2, whereas for B1, streamflow would decrease by 1.5%. Under the "worst case" A2 scenario, 6% and 133% increase, respectively, in agricultural and urban areas with 30% depletion of forest and grassland would result into 70% increase in surface runoff, 20% decrease in soil moisture, and 4% decrease in evapotranspiration in certain parts of the basin. Conversion of cropland, forest, or grassland to perennial hay/pasture areas would lower surface runoff by 25% especially in the central region, whereas persistent forest cover in the northern region would cause up to 7% increase in evapotranspiration. The ecosystem in the lower half of UMRB is likely to become adverse, as dictated by a composite water-energy balance indicator. Future land use change extents and resultant hydrologic responses are found significantly different under A2, A1B, and B1 scenarios, which resonates the need for multi-scenario ensemble assessments towards characterizing a probable future. The spatial variation of hydrologic processes as shown here helps to identify potential "hot spots," giving ways to adopt more effective policy alternatives at regional level.

J	Li, X; Sha, J; Wang, ZL				Li, Xue; Sha, Jian; Wang, Zhong-liang			A comparative study of multiple linear regression, artificial neural network and support vector machine for the prediction of dissolved oxygen	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Dissolved oxygen (DO) is an important indicator reflecting the healthy state of aquatic ecosystems. The balance between oxygen supply and consuming in the water body is significantly influenced by physical and chemical parameters. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of multiple linear regression (MLR), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector machine (SVM) for the prediction of DO concentration based on multiple water quality parameters. The data set included 969 samples collected from rivers in China and the 16 predicted variables involved physical factors, nutrients, organic substances, and metal ions, which would affect the DO concentrations directly or indirectly by influencing the water-air exchange, the growth of water plants, and the lives of aquatic animals. The models optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm were calibrated and tested, with nearly 80% and 20% data, respectively. The results showed that the PSO-BPNN and PSO-SVM had better predicted performances than linear regression methods. All of the evaluated criteria, including coefficient of determination, mean squared error, and absolute relative errors suggested that the PSO-SVM model was superior to the MLR and PSO-BPNN for DO prediction in the rivers of China with limited knowledge of other information.																	1998-9563	2224-7955				OCT	2017	48	5					1214	1225		10.2166/nh.2016.149								WOS:000412412500004						
J	Ameli, AA				Ameli, Ali A.			Controls on subsurface transport of sorbing contaminant	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Subsurface transport of a sorbing contaminant is poorly understood and characterized. Here, a new semi-analytical saturated-unsaturated flow and transport model is coupled to a kinetic sorption algorithm to assess the impact of changes in the subsurface permeability architecture and flow rate on sorption characteristics. The model outputs reveal the pronounced effect of the rate of vertical decline in K-s on the frequency of occurrence and spatial distribution of subsurface sorption as well as the timing and rate of sorbing contaminants discharged into stream. Sorption potential is weakened with infiltration rate. The impact of infiltration rate on the decline in sorption potential becomes more accentuated as the degree of subsurface vertical heterogeneity in saturated hydraulic conductivity increases. Porosity pattern also impacts sorption characteristics; but its effects highly depend upon the degree of vertical heterogeneity in Ks. The results and methodology presented in this paper have potential implications for assessing water quality in integrated groundwater-surface water systems as well as designing remediation systems.																	1998-9563	2224-7955				OCT	2017	48	5					1226	1239		10.2166/nh.2016.170								WOS:000412412500005

Therefore this study was conducted to study the presence of few specific antibiotic resistance genes, which imparts resistance to commonly used antibiotics in a rural drinking water plant in Louisiana, USA. Samples were taken from raw intake water, the treated water in holding tank at the water treatment facility, and an offsite consumer source serviced by the distribution line. Water quality analysis uncovered increase in organic carbon in distributed water. No live bacteria were found in the treated or distributed water, but bacterial DNA in the form of 16s rRNA was consistently found. Isolates of antibiotic resistant E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aerugenosa, and Klebsiella pneumonia were found in the raw intake water. Antibiotic resistance genes, tetA and sun were observed in the raw intake showing the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) in the raw intake water. However, no ARGs or ARB were found in the treated and distributed water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The bioflocs is capable of controlling water quality through absorption of undesirable nutrients in wastewater. It also contains microalgae such as Chlorella sp. that can be harvested for use in aqua culture applications. Nevertheless, the current harvesting technologies are based on chemicals or expensive membrane filtration. This study investigated the utilization of chitosan as a natural biocoagulant to harvest Chlorella sp. with an emphasis on the coagulation flocculation efficiency. The optimum dosage of chitosan at 30 mgri achieved 98% of microalgae removal efficiency and 80% of biomass recovery. The treated water was safe within a neutral pH level with less than 5 NTU of turbidity. The results show that chitosan can be an alternative and environmental-friendly bio-coagulant for microalgae harvesting. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Heavy irrigation and application of fertilizer over the last several decades have caused groundwater nitrate contamination in several domestic, public and monitoring wells in the CV above EPA's Maximum Contamination level of 10 mg/L. Source variables, aquifer susceptibility and geochemical variables could affect the contamination rate and groundwater quality in the aquifer. A comparative study was conducted using Geodetector (GED), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to observe which method is most effective at revealing environmental variables that control groundwater nitrate concentration. The GED method detected precipitation, fertilizer, elevation, manure and clay as statistically significant variables. Watersheds with percent of wells above 5 mg/L of nitrate were higher in San Joaquin and Tulare Basin compared to Sacramento Valley. PCA grouped cropland, fertilizer, manure and precipitation as a first principal component, suggesting similar construct of these variables and existence of data redundancy. The GWR model performed better than the OLS model, with lower corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values, and captured the spatial heterogeneity of fertilizer, precipitation and elevation for the percent of wells above 5 mg/L in the CV. Overall, the GED method was more effective than the PCA and GWR methods in determining the influence of explanatory variables on groundwater nitrate contamination.

Surface and groundwater samples of Kutahya plain were analyzed for their physio-chemical and environmental isotope properties. The relative concentrations of the water ions were found to occur in the order of Ca2+>Mg2+>(K+ + Na+) and HCO3->SO42->CI-. Piper diagram shows that Ca-Mg/Mg-Ca-HCO3 was the dominant water types. Waters in the area were super -saturated with respect to carbonates. However, they were under -saturated with respect to sulphate minerals. The groundwaters had a mean isotopic composition of -67.32 delta H-2 and- 9.72 delta O-18 and were comparatively lower than surface waters -64.64 delta H-2 and 9.25 delta O-18. Tritium activities in groundwater from the wells ranged from 1.00 to 8.38 TU with a mean value of 4.37 TU. The impact of agricultural practices and poor sanitation conditions is indicated by the positive correlation between K+ - NO3-, K+- NO2- and HCO3- - Cl- ions as well as Na+ and Mg2+ ions with Salon. The groundwater quality of Kutahya plain is influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Water Quality Monitoring of an Urban Estuary and a Coastal Aquifer Using Field Kits and Meters: A Community-Based Enyironmental Research Project	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION												Water quality is an important interdisciplinary environmental topic for project-based learning. An undergraduate summer research internship program at a public minority serving institution engaged environmental science majors in community-based research experiences. The research focused on the field monitoring of water quality for surface water and groundwater in urban areas of New York and New Jersey that have been heavily impacted by industrialization and urbanization. Groups of students collected water samples from the tidal section of the Passaic River and the Hackensack River, as well as the Newark Bay in New Jersey. Groundwater samples were also collected from a sandy coastal aquifer located in the East Shore of Staten Island, New York. Students analyzed water samples using a portable pH-EC meter, a portable colorimeter, or field test kits for various water quality parameters in the field or laboratory. Students prepared and presented research posters in conferences and at a local community event. The water quality monitoring project helped students to develop field and laboratory research skills, quantitative skills, collaboration skills, as well as written and oral communication skills. The research experiences enhanced students' attitudes toward science careers and motivated students to pursue degrees in science. The community-based environmental project can be implemented in various undergraduate science courses focusing on the chemistry of natural waters to facilitate inquiry-driven learning and connect classroom learning to the real world.																	0021-9584	1938-1328				OCT	2017	94	10					1512	1516		10.1021/acs.jchemed.7b00334								WOS:000413388900020

In order to enhance the stability of silica microsphere, titania was coated over silica microsphere by using sol-gel process. To enhance the exchange capacity of titania coated silica microsphere for Cs, it was functionalized with potassium ferrocyanide. The whole assembly was impregnated in calcium alginate in order to remove the Cs134+137 from potable water without altering drinking water quality parameters. Experiments were conducted by spiking the groundwater and seawater in the concentration range of 1000-50,000 BqL(-1.) Removal efficiency of more than 99% and 97% were observed in case fresh water and marine environment respectively. Sorption capacity of the material was evaluated by using stable Cs. Maximum sorption of Cs was seen at the pH range 7.5-8.5 and the equilibrium time required for the removal of Cs was 24 h. Kinetic models and adsorption isotherm equations (Langmuir & Freundlich) were used to fit the experiment data for describing the sorption process. The maximum sorption capacity of the beads is 23.55 mg g(-1) in case of stable Cs and the sorption follows the Langmuir isotherm. From the kinetic study it was observed that the reaction is following the pseudo first order kinetic equation.																	2213-3437					OCT	2017	5	5					5187	5195		10.1016/j.jece.2017.09.056								WOS:000414041300110

In this study, the impact of climate change and land-use change on the presence of faecal indicator bacteria in freshwater was evaluated, through the use of a recently-developed catchment-scale pathogen model. The River Conwy in Wales has been used as a case-study, because of the large presence of livestock in the catchment and the importance of the shellfish harvesting activities in its estuary. The INCA-Pathogens catchment model has been calibrated through the use of a Monte Carlo -based technique, based on faecal indicator bacteria measurements, and then driven by an ensemble of climate projections obtained from the HadRM3-PPE model (Future Flow Climate) plus four land-use scenarios (current land use, managed ecosystem, abandonment and agricultural intensification). The results show that climate change is not expected to have a very large impact on average river flow, although it might alter its seasonality. The abundance of faecal indicator bacteria is expected to decrease in response to climate change, especially during the summer months, due to reduced precipitation, causing reduced runoff, and increased temperature, which enhances the bacterial die-off processes. Land-use change can also have a potentially large impact on pathogens. The "managed ecosystems" scenario proposed in this study can cause a reduction of 15% in average water faecal indicator bacteria and up to 30% in the 90th percentile of water faecal indicator bacteria, mainly due to the conversion of pasture land into grassland and the expansion of forest land. This study provides an example of how to assess the impacts of human interventions on the landscape, and what may be the extent of their effects, for other catchments where the human use of the natural resources in the uplands can jeopardise the use of natural resources downstream.

A Bayesian-based multilevel factorial analysis method for analyzing parameter uncertainty of hydrological model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In this study, a Bayesian-based multilevel factorial analysis (BMFA) method is developed to assess parameter uncertainties and their effects on hydrological model responses. In BMFA, Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm is employed to approximate the posterior distributions of model parameters with Bayesian inference; factorial analysis (FA) technique is used for measuring the specific variations of hydrological responses in terms of posterior distributions to investigate the individual and interactive effects of parameters on model outputs. BMFA is then applied to a case study of the Jinghe River watershed in the Loess Plateau of China to display its validity and applicability. The uncertainties of four sensitive parameters, including soil conservation service runoff curve number to moisture condition II (CN2), soil hydraulic conductivity (SOL_K), plant available water capacity (SOL_AWC), and soil depth (SOL_Z), are investigated. Results reveal that (i) CN2 has positive effect on peak flow, implying that the concentrated rainfall during rainy season can cause infiltration-excess surface flow, which is an considerable contributor to peak flow in this watershed; (ii) SOL_K has positive effect on average flow, implying that the widely distributed cambisols can lead to medium percolation capacity; (iii) the interaction between SOLAWC and SOL_Z has noticeable effect on the peak flow and their effects are dependent upon each other, which discloses that soil depth can significant influence the processes of plant uptake of soil water in this watershed. Based on the above findings, the significant parameters and the relationship among uncertain parameters can be specified, such that hydrological model's capability for simulating/predicting water resources of the Jinghe River watershed can be improved.

Retention performance of green roofs in representative climates worldwide	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The ongoing process of global urbanization contributes to an increase in stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces, threatening also water quality. Green roofs have been proved to be innovative stormwater management measures to partially restore natural states, enhancing interception, infiltration and evapotranspiration fluxes. The amount of water that is retained within green roofs depends not only on their depth, but also on the climate, which drives the stochastic soil moisture dynamic. In this context, a simple tool for assessing performance of green roofs worldwide in terms of retained water is still missing and highly desirable for practical assessments. The aim of this work is to explore retention performance of green roofs as a function of their depth and in different climate regimes. Two soil depths are investigated, one representing the intensive configuration and another representing the extensive one. The role of the climate in driving water retention has been represented by rainfall and potential evapotranspiration dynamics. A simple conceptual weather generator has been implemented and used for stochastic simulation of daily rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Stochastic forcing is used as an input of a simple conceptual hydrological model for estimating long-term water partitioning between rainfall, runoff and actual evapotranspiration. Coupling the stochastic weather generator with the conceptual hydrological model, we assessed the amount of rainfall diverted into evapotranspiration for different combinations of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration in five representative climatic regimes. Results quantified the capabilities of green roofs in retaining rainfall and consequently in reducing discharges into sewer systems at an annual time scale. The role of substrate depth has been recognized to be crucial in determining green roofs retention performance, which in general increase from extensive to intensive settings. Looking at the role of climatic conditions, namely annual rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and their seasonality cycles, we found that they drive green roofs retention performance, which are the maxima when rainfall and temperature are in phase. Finally, we provide design charts for a first approximation of possible hydrological benefits deriving from the implementation of intensive or extensive green roofs in different world areas. As an example, 25 big cities have been indicated as benchmark case studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Generally, the effects of factors that cause casing pressure cannot be quantified. Some vague terms are often used to describe the risk degree. Considering the serious SCP situation in XX gas field in the southwest of China, a SCP risk evaluation model was proposed based on the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. Three risk indicators (annulus pressure, cementing quality, and formation leakage) were used to describe the SCP risk. The indicators' weight was determined with the application of Delphi method, and the membership matrix was established based on the trapezoidal distribution membership function and the gas field testing data. Then the evaluation model was used to calculate the risk values and risk degrees of 27 SCP wells in XX gas field. Electronic sensors installing and real-time monitoring were recommended to enhance the safety annulus pressure management. The proposed model provides an important technical basis for the production and management of SCP gas wells. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Al Shehhi, MR; Gherboudj, I; Ghedira, H				Al Shehhi, Maryam R.; Gherboudj, Imen; Ghedira, Hosni			In situ spectral response of the Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman coastal waters to bio-optical properties	JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY B-BIOLOGY												Mapping of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) over the coastal waters of the Arabian Gulf and the Sea of Oman using the satellite-based observations, such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer), has shown inferior performance (Chl-a overestimation) than that of deep waters. Studies in the region have shown that this poor performance is due to three reasons: (i) water turbidity (sediments re-suspension), and the presence of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), (ii) bottom reflectance and (iii) incapability of the existing atmospheric correction models to reduce the effect of the aerosols from the water leaving radiance. Therefore, this work focuses on investigating the sensitivity of the in situ spectral signatures of these coastal waters to the algal (chlorophyll: Chl-a), non-algal (sediments and CDOM) and the bottom reflectance properties, in absence of contributions from the atmosphere. Consequently, the collected in situ spectral signatures will improve our understanding of Arabian Gulf and Sea of Oman water properties. For this purpose, comprehensive field measurements were carried out between 2013 and 2016, over Abu-Dhabi (Arabian Gulf) and Fujairah (Sea of Oman) where unique water quality data were collected. Based on the in situ water spectral analysis, the bottom reflectance (water depth < 20 m) are found to degrade the performance of the conventional ocean color algorithms more than the sediment-laden waters where these waters increase the R-rs at the blue and red ranges. The increasing presence of CDOM markedly decreases the R-rs in the blue range, which is conflicting with the effect of Chl-a. Given the inadequate performance of the widely used ocean-color algorithms (OC3: ocean color 3, OC2: ocean color 2) in retrieving Chl-a in these very shallow coastal waters, therefore, a new algorithm is proposed here based on a 3-bands ratio approach using [R-rs (656)(-1) - R-rs (506)(-1)] X R-rs (661). The selected optimum bands (656 nm, 506 nm, and 661 nm) from this approach can be used to retrieve the Chl-a more accurately in these coastal Case II (turbid) waters which are close to the bands of the current missions such as Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument), MODIS, VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) and LandSat 8. However, more uniformly distributed data over the Arabian Gulf is required to have a highly accurate regional model for Chl-a retrieval.

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												This study aimed to evaluate the influence of sub-daily precipitation time steps on model performance and hydrological components by applying the Green and Ampt infiltration method using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Precipitation was measured at a resolution of 0.1mm and aggregated to 5-, 15-, 30-, and 60-min time steps. Daily discharge data over a 10-year period were used to calibrate and validate the model. Following a global sensitivity analysis, relevant parameters were optimized through an automatic calibration procedure using SWAT-CUP for each time step. Daily performance statistics were almost equal among all four time steps (NSE approximate to 0.47). Discharge mainly consisted of groundwater flow (55%) and tile flow (42%), in reasonable proportions for the investigated catchment. In conclusion, model outputs were almost identical, showing simulations responded nearly independently of the chosen precipitation time step. This held true for (1) the selection of sensitive parameters, (2) performance statistics, (3) the shape of the hydrographs, and (4) flow components. However, a scenario analysis revealed that the precipitation time step becomes important when saturated hydraulic conductivities are low and curve numbers are high. The study suggests that there is no need in using precipitation time steps <1h for lowland catchments dominated by soils with a low surface runoff potential if daily flow values are being considered.

However, these ubiquitous assets, valued at approximately $600,000 per km(2) in a representative suburban watershed, are ideal candidates to aid in reversing such cycles of channel degradation because improving their functionality would not necessarily require property acquisition or heavy construction. The objective of this research was to develop a simple, cost-effective device that could be installed in detention basin outlets to reduce the erosive power of the relatively frequent storm events (similar to < two-year recurrence) and provide a passive bypass to maintain flood control performance during infrequent storms (such as the 100-year recurrence). Results from a pilot installation show that the Detain H2O device reduced the cumulative sediment transport capacity of the preretrofit condition by greater than 40%, and contributed to reduced flashiness and prolonged baseflows in receiving streams. When scaling the strategy across a watershed, these results suggest that potential gains in water quality and stream channel stability could be achieved at costs that are orders of magnitude less than comparable benefits from newly constructed stormwater control measures.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1032	1047		10.1111/1752-1688.12548								WOS:000412132000005

Modeling Watershed-Scale Impacts of Stormwater Management with Traditional versus Low Impact Development Design	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Stormwater runoff and associated pollutants from urban areas in the greater Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) impair local streams and downstream ecosystems, despite urbanized land comprising only 7% of the CBW area. More recently, stormwater best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented in a low impact development (LID) manner to treat stormwater runoff closer to its source. This approach included the development of a novel BMP model to compare traditional and LID design, pioneering the use of comprehensively digitized storm sewer infrastructure and BMP design connectivity with spatial patterns in a geographic information system at the watershed scale. The goal was to compare total watershed pollutant removal efficiency in two study watersheds with differing spatial patterns of BMP design (traditional and LID), by quantifying the improved water quality benefit of LID BMP design. An estimate of uncertainty was included in the modeling framework by using ranges for BMP pollutant removal efficiencies that were based on the literature. Our model, using Monte Carlo analysis, predicted that the LID watershed removed approximately 78kg more nitrogen, 3kg more phosphorus, and 1,592kg more sediment per square kilometer as compared with the traditional watershed on an annual basis. Our research provides planners a valuable model to prioritize watersheds for BMP design based on model results or in optimizing BMP selection.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1081	1094		10.1111/1752-1688.12559								WOS:000412132000008

Designing and Implementing a Network for Sensing Water Quality and Hydrology across Mountain to Urban Transitions	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Water resources are increasingly impacted by growing human populations, land use, and climate changes, and complex interactions among biophysical processes. In an effort to better understand these factors in semiarid northern Utah, United States, we created a real-time observatory consisting of sensors deployed at aquatic and terrestrial stations to monitor water quality, water inputs, and outputs along mountain to urban gradients. The Gradients Along Mountain to Urban Transitions (GAMUT) monitoring network spans three watersheds with similar climates and streams fed by mountain winter-derived precipitation, but that differ in urbanization level, land use, and biophysical characteristics. The aquatic monitoring stations in the GAMUT network include sensors to measure chemical (dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, pH, nitrate, and dissolved organic matter), physical (stage, temperature, and turbidity), and biological components (chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin). We present the logistics of designing, implementing, and maintaining the network; quality assurance and control of numerous, large datasets; and data acquisition, dissemination, and visualization. Data from GAMUT reveal spatial differences in water quality due to urbanization and built infrastructure; capture rapid temporal changes in water quality due to anthropogenic activity; and identify changes in biological structure, each of which are demonstrated via case study datasets.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1095	1120		10.1111/1752-1688.12557								WOS:000412132000009

As a result, most models are calibrated and, if possible, validated using limited measured data. However, little research has been done to determine the impact of length of available calibration data on model parameterization and performance. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of length of calibration data (LCD) on parameterization and performance of the Agricultural Policy Environmental eXtender model for predicting daily, monthly, and annual streamflow. Long-term (1984-2015) measured daily streamflow data from Rock Creek watershed, an agricultural watershed in northern Ohio, were used for this study. Data were divided into five Short (5-year), two Medium (15-year), and one Long (25-year) streamflow calibration data scenarios. All LCD scenarios were calibrated and validated at three time steps: daily, monthly, and annual. Results showed LCD affected the ability of the model to accurately capture temporal variability in simulated streamflow. However, overall average streamflow, water budgets, and crop yields were simulated reasonably well for all LCD scenarios.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1164	1177		10.1111/1752-1688.12564								WOS:000412132000013

Lessons from Virginia Water Quality Trading Programs	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and agricultural organizations promote water quality trading programs as an innovative policy to engage agricultural producers in conservation activities. Cost analyses suggest regulated sources can reduce compliance costs by purchasing agricultural nonpoint source credits. Yet, such point-nonpoint trades are rare. This article assesses the demand for agricultural nonpoint sources in well-developed nutrient trading programs in Virginia for industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants, municipal stormwater programs, and land developers. Evidence suggests nutrient trading programs in Virginia will not stimulate investments in pollutant reduction practices on working agricultural lands. The lack of demand for agricultural nonpoint source credits can be attributed to a substantial degree to the design features and incentives present in multiple overlapping regulatory programs. The legal setting that dampens regulated source demand for nonpoint source credits in Virginia is broadly representative of conditions found elsewhere in the United States.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1178	1194		10.1111/1752-1688.12565								WOS:000412132000014

Water Quality Signals from Rural Land Use and Exurbanization in a Mountain Landscape: What's Clear and What's Confounded?	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In mountainous landscapes with high climatic and geomorphic variability, how do rural land uses and exurbanization alter hydrology and water quality? We evaluated effects of rural land use and exurbanization on streamflows, suspended sediment concentrations and loads, specific conductance, and summer water temperatures in 12 streams and rivers within the Upper Little Tennessee River basin in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Eleven streams featured low levels of development (>61% forest cover) but differed in land use patterning, basin size, annual precipitation, and watershed morphology. One urban stream, located within the largest town in the basin, provided the high development comparative endpoint. Even low levels of rural development and exurbanization were associated with substantial increases in suspended sediment concentrations, sediment loads, and summer stream temperature daily maxima and diurnal variation. Observed summer temperature increases were much larger than would be expected due to global climate change over the next century. Specific conductance was idiosyncratic among the smaller streams. These water quality changes were not accompanied by streamflow changes that were discernible amid the high natural variation in precipitation and geomorphology. The water quality findings suggest the need for applying the best management practices, including riparian buffers, to even low levels of rural development.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2017	53	5					1212	1228		10.1111/1752-1688.12567								WOS:000412132000016

Unfortunately, there are few publicly available data sources at the local level and even fewer at the national scale. In this research, randomly selected points within agricultural lands were examined for selected conservation practices using Google Earth aerial imagery by a team of interpreters. In total, 13,530 points had field boundaries digitized, and were subsequently examined and classified. The presence of terraces, grassed waterways, contour farming, center pivot irrigation, strip cropping, ponds, riparian vegetation, filter strips, and land cover were noted. Subjectivity among interpreters was evaluated using duplicate samples and was found to be similar to image misclassification rates in other research. Conservation practice adoption rates for selected major river basins compared favorably with data collected by the Conservation Effects Assessment Project. The frequency of occurrence of each conservation practice was summarized and presented by ecoregion. To facilitate future research, point level data and software source code developed in this research are available via the web at . Aerial imagery was found to be a powerful, inexpensive, and easily accessible tool to assess large-scale conservation practice implementation for certain conservation practices.

Development of recreational water spray ground design regulations in New York State, an engineering approach	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The New York State Department of Health developed regulations for the design and operation of spray grounds to address the potential for recreational water illnesses associated with this type of venue. The water treatment component of the new regulation was based on a first-principles approach to address the unique challenges of spray grounds. The regulation departs from traditional recreational water treatment methods by requiring a novel filtration approach and the installation of UV disinfection. The water treatment system was also required to incorporate automatic control systems to ensure the water quality is maintained with a minimum of operator involvement. The treatment process specifications were based on pathogen and contaminant loadings that are likely to be encountered at spray grounds. The regulation was finalized in 2007, giving New York State a reliable means of protecting the health of spray ground patrons.																	1477-8920					OCT	2017	15	5					718	728		10.2166/wh.2017.032								WOS:000413113900005	29040075

The purpose of this study was to explore techniques for describing microbial water quality in rural drinking water wells, based on spatiotemporal analysis, time series analysis and relative risk mapping. Tests results for Escherichia coli and coliforms from private and small public well water samples, collected between 2004 and 2012 in Alberta, Canada, were used for the analysis. Overall, 14.6 and 1.5% of the wells were total coliform and E. coli-positive, respectively. Private well samples were more often total coliform or E. coli-positive compared with untreated public well samples. Using relative risk mapping we were able to identify areas of higher risk for bacterial contamination of groundwater in the province not previously identified. Incorporation of time series analysis demonstrated peak contamination occurring for E. coli in July and a later peak for total coliforms in September, suggesting a temporal dissociation between these indicators in terms of groundwater quality, and highlighting the potential need to increase monitoring during certain periods of the year.

A methodology for relating wetland configuration to human disturbance in Alberta	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Widespread loss of wetland ecosystems resulting from human land use highlights the need for a reclamation strategy that can sustain wetland ecosystem services. Since wetland function partly depends on landscape structure, reclamation and monitoring can be aided by knowing the differences in wetland configuration between undisturbed and disturbed landscapes. Objectives Identify a parsimonious set of landscape metrics for quantifying wetland configuration and land-cover composition, and quantify how these metrics vary with anthropogenic disturbance. Methods A large suite of landscape metrics quantifying area/edge, shape, aggregation, and diversity were calculated for landscapes in the Grassland, Parkland, and Boreal Natural Regions of Alberta. Variable reduction techniques were applied to identify representative metrics. These representative metrics were related to anthropogenic disturbance using non-parametric tests. Results The spatial configuration of wetlands in low-disturbance and high-disturbance landscapes were significantly different from other landscapes. Aggregation metrics were the most commonly identified measures of wetland configuration independent of wetland-proportion in the landscape. Conclusions Our findings provide insight for reclamation and monitoring by showing that some aspects of wetland configuration vary independently of composition, and therefore both need to be considered when parameterizing the design of reclaimed landscapes. We suggest that using landscape metrics in a reference condition approach is appropriate for evaluating landscape degradation and for setting landscape reclamation targets and monitoring programs.																	0921-2973	1572-9761				OCT	2017	32	10					2059	2076		10.1007/s10980-017-0566-z								WOS:000412693200010

A coupled metabolic-hydraulic model and calibration scheme for estimating whole-river metabolism during dynamic flow conditions	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS												Conventional methods for estimating whole-stream metabolic rates from measured dissolved oxygen dynamics do not account for the variation in solute transport times created by dynamic flow conditions. Changes in flow at hourly time scales are common downstream of hydroelectric dams (i.e., hydropeaking), and hydrologic limitations of conventional metabolic models have resulted in a poor understanding of the controls on biological production in these highly managed river ecosystems. To overcome these limitations, we coupled a two-station metabolic model of dissolved oxygen dynamics with a hydrologic river routing model. We designed calibration and parameter estimation tools to infer values for hydrologic and metabolic parameters based on time series of water quality data, achieving the ultimate goal of estimating whole-river gross primary production and ecosystem respiration during dynamic flow conditions. Our case study data for model design and calibration were collected in the tailwater of Glen Canyon Dam (Arizona, U.S.A.), a large hydropower facility where the mean discharge was 325 m(3) s(-1) and the average daily coefficient of variation of flow was 0.17 (i.e., the hydropeaking index averaged from 2006 to 2016). We demonstrate the coupled model's conceptual consistency with conventional models during steady flow conditions, and illustrate the potential bias in metabolism estimates with conventional models during unsteady flow conditions. This effort contributes an approach to solute transport modeling and parameter estimation that allows study of whole-ecosystem metabolic regimes across a more diverse range of hydrologic conditions commonly encountered in streams and rivers.																	1541-5856					OCT	2017	15	10					847	866		10.1002/lom3.10204								WOS:000413768000003

DNA metabarcoding holds great promise for the assessment of macroinvertebrates in stream ecosystems. However, few large-scale studies have compared the performance of DNA metabarcoding with that of routine morphological identification. 2. We performed metabarcoding using four primer sets on macroinvertebrate samples from 18 stream sites across Finland. The samples were collected in 2013 and identified based on morphology as part of a Finnish stream monitoring program. Specimens were morphologically classified, following standardised protocols, to the lowest taxonomic level for which identification was feasible in the routine national monitoring. 3. DNA metabarcoding identified more than twice the number of taxa than the morphology-based protocol, and also yielded a higher taxonomic resolution. For each sample, we detected more taxa by metabarcoding than by the morphological method, and all four primer sets exhibited comparably good performance. Sequence read abundance and the number of specimens per taxon (a proxy for biomass) were significantly correlated in each sample, although the adjusted R-2 values were low. With a few exceptions, the ecological status assessment metrics calculated from morphological and DNA metabarcoding datasets were similar. Given the recent reduction in sequencing costs, metabarcoding is currently approximately as expensive as morphology-based identification. 4. Using samples obtained in the field, we demonstrated that DNA metabarcoding can achieve comparable assessment results to current protocols relying on morphological identification. Thus, metabarcoding represents a feasible and reliable method to identify macroinvertebrates in stream bioassessment, and offers powerful advantage over morphological identification in providing identification for taxonomic groups that are unfeasible to identify in routine protocols. To unlock the full potential of DNA metabarcoding for ecosystem assessment, however, it will be necessary to address key problems with current laboratory protocols and reference databases.

Role of a naturally varying flow regime in Everglades restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The Everglades is a low-gradient floodplain predominantly on organic soil that undergoes seasonally pulsing sheetflow through a network of deepwater sloughs separated by slightly higher elevation ridges. The seasonally pulsing flow permitted the coexistence of ridge and slough vegetation, including the persistence of productive, well-connected sloughs that seasonally concentrated prey and supported wading bird nesting success. Here we review factors contributing to the origin and to degradation of the ridge and slough ecosystem in an attempt to answer How much flow is needed to restore functionality? A key restoration objective is to increase sheetflow lost during the past century to reestablish interactions between flow, water depth, vegetation production and decomposition, and transport of flocculent organic sediment that build and maintain ridge and slough distinctions. Our review finds broad agreement that perturbations of water level depth and its fluctuations were primary in the degradation of landscape functions, with critical contributions from perturbed water quality, and flow velocity and direction. Whereas water levels are expected to be improved on average across a range of restoration scenarios that replace between 79 and 91% of predrainage flows, the diminished microtopography substantially decreases the probability of timely improvements in some areas whereas others that retain microtopographic differences are poised for restoration benefits. New advances in predicting restoration outcomes are coming from biophysical modeling of ridge-slough dynamics, system-wide measurements of landscape functionality, and large-scale flow restoration experiments, including active management techniques to kick-start slough regeneration.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				OCT	2017	25			1	SI		S27	S38		10.1111/rec.12558								WOS:000414165700003

Water quality implications of hydrologic restoration alternatives in the Florida Everglades, United States	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The use of models to generate future scenarios is an important tool for restoration planning. We used a scenario modeling approach to examine water quality implications of five options for Everglades hydrologic restoration. In oligotrophic Everglades wetlands, phosphorus (P) inputs exceeding 10 mu g/L cause P accumulation in soils and a shift to cattail marsh. Everglades restoration seeks to improve wetland hydrology while ensuring that delivered water contains no more than 10 mu g P/L (long-term average). Outputs from a landscape-scale ecological model, the Everglades Landscape Model (ELM), showed that P concentrations in new water inputs will be controlled by P uptake by constructed treatment wetlands and by the movement of legacy P. Benthic periphyton responds quickly to changes in P, initiating a eutrophication response cascade, so we used ELM output to drive periphyton response models that predicted abundance, quality, and composition. All five restoration scenarios had similar effects on these three attributes in Everglades National Park, but variable responses across the other wetland units depended on water delivery and legacy P mobilization. Periphyton biomass was considerably reduced in scenarios that maximized freshwater delivery, but predicted values for periphyton total P were below the legal P concentration maximum in most of the Everglades. Benthic algal edibility increased more than 4-fold, with the greatest increases in the deeper water areas. To meet water quality standards for the five restoration scenarios, we estimated that Everglades restoration should include an additional 105-156 km(2) of treatment marshes upstream of surface water inflows to the landscape.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				OCT	2017	25			1	SI		S48	S58		10.1111/rec.12513								WOS:000414165700005

Impacts of the Mississippi River spillway opening on faecal coliform concentration in Lake Pontchartrain	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												This study focuses on explaining the role of the periodic opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway on the faecal coliform levels in Lake Pontchartrain. Water quality data were collected by the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation to analyse the faecal coliform bacteria levels, turbidity, salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen in the lake water. The results show that the faecal coliform concentrations were lower during the spillway opening than the preceding and subsequent months. Statistical analysis shows the dilution effect, characterized by an effective reduction in faecal coliform concentrations due to increase in water turbidity, coupled with decrease in water salinity and dissolved oxygen because of spillway opening. It is also indicated that the combine effect of more than one factor produces a significantly greater reduction in the faecal coliform than each factor acting independently. Periodic spikes in faecal coliform concentrations were observed at sampling points located near the outlets of streams and drainage canals with high settlement densities. A positive correlation (r=0.78467) was found between the average faecal coliform counts and average monthly precipitations, highlighting the role of precipitation run-offs. The results of this study indicate that the spillway opening contributed to a reduction in the faecal coliform concentration in the lake's surface water during the studied periods.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				OCT	2017	33	8					1327	1335		10.1002/rra.3179								WOS:000412518100010

Quantifying streambank movement and topography using unmanned aircraft system photogrammetry with comparison to terrestrial laser scanning	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Streambank movement is an integral part of geomorphic changes along river corridors and affects a range of physical, ecological, and socio-economic systems including aquatic habitat, water quality, and infrastructure. Various methods have been used to quantify streambank erosion, including bank pins, ground surveys, lidar, and analytical models, however, due to high-cost or labour intensive fieldwork these are typically feasible or appropriate only for site-specific studies. Advancements in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and photogrammetry provide opportunities for more rapid and economical quantification of streambank erosion and deposition at variable scales. This work assesses the performance of UAS-based photogrammetry for capturing topography of streambank surfaces and quantifying bank movement. UAS data are compared to terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) and GPS surveying from streambank sites located in Vermont that featured a variety of bank conditions and vegetation. Cross-sectional analysis of data from UAS and TLS revealed that the UAS reliably captured the bank surface within 0.2m of TLS and GPS surveys across all sites during leaf-off conditions. Mean error between UAS and TLS was only 0.11m in early spring conditions. Dense summer vegetation resulted in decreased accuracy and was a limiting factor in the ability of the UAS to capture the ground surface. At areas with observed bank movement, the change in cross-sectional area estimated using UAS data compared reliably to TLS survey for net cross-sectional changes greater than 3.5m(2), given a 10% error tolerance. At locations with smaller changes, error increased due to the effect of vegetation, georeferencing, and overhanging bank profiles. UAS-based photogrammetry shows significant promise for capturing bank topography and movement at fine resolutions in a flexible and efficient manner.

J	Piyoosh, AK; Ghosh, SK				Piyoosh, Atul Kant; Ghosh, Sanjay Kumar			Effect of autocorrelation on temporal trends in rainfall in a valley region at the foothills of Indian Himalayas	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												This study examines the effect of autocorrelation on step and monotonic trends in seasonal and annual rainfall. Initially, for step change, modified-Pettitt test is applied in two ways. First, using the corrected and unbiased trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPWcu) approach. Second, using a new approach in which time series is modelled by intervention analysis for modified Pettitt test. Subsequently, for monotonic trends, Mann-Kendall (MK) and six approaches of modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) test are applied to NCDC data for period 1901-2012 and its sub-periods. Approaches of MMK include pre-whitening (PW), trend-free-pre-whitening (TFPW), TFPWcu, two Variance Correction Approaches (VCAs) based on empirical formula (VCA:CF1) and Monte-Carlo-Simulations (VCA:CF2) and long term persistence (MK-LTP). A single change point is identified in 1970 for annual and monsoon rainfall from original and modified-Pettitt's test using TFPWcu, while time series modelling approach has not exhibited any change point. Process shift in rainfall series is also studied using CUSUM and multiple change points are identified using Segment-Neighbourhood method. Outcomes of MMK show that TFPWcu is able to efficiently limit the effect of autocorrelation and may be preferred over PW and TFPW. The VCA:CF2 is not dependent on whole autocorrelation structure and corrects variance of all data series using lag-1 autocorrelation and may be preferred over VCA:CF1. MK-LTP considers long term persistence and it has exhibited presence of weaker trends than exhibited by other approaches.

Theoretical and technical biomass resource assessment from swine and cattle manure in Tabasco: A case study in southeast Mexico	SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS												Nowadays, the lack of a proper waste management in the livestock sector has contributed, not only to climate change with greenhouse gas emissions, but also to soil degradation and water quality deterioration. A case study was carried out in the state of Tabasco, in southeast Mexico, because it holds a significant livestock production that can be compared to some European countries. About 80% of the livestock waste in the region is not properly managed. In this respect, a biomass resource assessment was performed through an adapted methodology to quantify the livestock biomass potential according to livestock production systems, zootechnical functions and technical factors. Additionally, a weighted decision matrix (WDM) was designed to determine the most feasible technologies employing sustainability criteria. Theoretical and technical biomass potentials were obtained corresponding to 7,864,796 tonnes/year and 765,947 tonnes/year, respectively. As a result, the technical biomass potential is affected by the livestock production system in the region. A technical energy potential of 396,727 GJ/year was calculated from livestock biomass, which could be used to energise around 7,688,510 refrigerators and replace the use of 64,030 tonnes of wood. Finally, silvopastoral systems, composting and anaerobic digestion were the most feasible technologies and practices according to the WDM.																	2213-1388	2213-1396				OCT	2017	23						83	92		10.1016/j.seta.2017.09.005								WOS:000414330900008

The present study is conducted to assess spatio-temporal pattern of phytoplankton assemblage in the southern parts of the Caspian Sea (CS) which in turn can serve as an ecological health indicator in this region. Among 64 identified phytoplankton species, diatoms (37 species and 66.2%) and Dinophyceae (11 species and 18.2%) were dominant. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were employed to reveal Spatial and temporal distributions of phytoplankton assemblages. Four groups were established using hierarchical clustering based on species richness similarities which were absolutely represented the four seasons. The summer and spring samples were highly separated from the winter and autumn samples. The Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model showed that temporal patterns of phytoplankton assemblages were mostly explained by chemical factors (silicate, phosphate, and nitrite) and temperature. In conclusion, results of this study suggested that spatio-temporal patterns of phytoplankton in the southern part of the CS are closely associated with seasonal variations in river flow and temperature. The temporal patterns are apparently dominant in this area and water nutrients are mainly responsible for seasonal changes.

In this way a pilot system, comprising an anaerobic pretreatment and two duckweed ponds designed in series (10 m(2) each), was operated with real domestic sewage. The treatment efficiency was evaluated through the monitoring of conventional physical-chemical water quality variables sach as Temperature, pH, total phosphorus (TP), phosphate (PO4), total nitrogen (TN), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4+-N) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Simultaneously the excess of biomass produced during the treatment was submitted to Biochemical Methane Potential test (BMP) carried out in a multi-batch reactor system. Three pretreatment approaches (fermentative, drying and alkaline) were performed in triplicate to evaluate their influence on methane production. Findings showed that the duckweed ponds removed the organic matter and nutrients from the wastewater (TN = 94%, TP = 92% and COD = 91%). Moreover, the biomass submitted to a fermentative pretreatment returned higher gas production (0.39 NmA(biogas)(3)/kgVS(fed)) compared with the anaerobic digestion (AD) of unpretreated biomass (0.25 NmA(biogas)(3)/kgVS(fed)). These results highlight the potential of duckweed ponds technologies to treat wastewater and produce clean energy simultaneously.																	1877-2641	1877-265X				OCT	2017	8	7					2363	2369		10.1007/s12649-016-9800-1								WOS:000411975600011

A Modeling System for Monitoring Water Quality in Lagoons	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Regular monitoring of key water quality parameters is important for assessing the hydrological status of a lagoon and its management activities. In this study, a new cost-effective technique based on the geoecological information-modeling system (GIMS) is implemented employing the combined use of simulation experiments and in-field observations to investigate the problem of optimizing water quality monitoring of a lagoon. The GIMS is accompanied by 39 elements selected in 8 management systems and 31 functional elements, which are described in detail. It is shown that the combined use of model and field observations allows reliable recording of lagoon water quality and optimization of the monitoring regime. Finally, simulation experiments are presented, demonstrating the fidelity of the proposed modeling system to optimize water quality control through regular in-field measurements and simulations.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2017	228	10							397	10.1007/s11270-017-3581-4								WOS:000413334900022

Evaluation of Water Quality for Sustainable Agriculture in Bangladesh	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Sustainable groundwater quality has become a major concern for the agro-based country like Bangladesh. Integrated approaches of various irrigation water quality indices and geostatistical modeling were applied to evaluate the suitability and for spatial mapping of groundwater quality of Faridpur District in central Bangladesh. The irrigation water quality index (IWQI) revealed that majority of the samples were suitable for irrigation. Similar outcomes were recorded from other indices including Na%, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium bicarbonate (RSBC), total hardness (TH), Kelley's ratio (KR), and magnesium adsorption ratio (MAR). Classifications based on Wilcox diagram and permeability index (PI) plot indicated a similar conclusion wherein almost all the samples were safe for agricultural uses without posing considerable effect on the soil fertility and overall crop yield. Principal component analysis (PCA) grouped the major cations and anions into three principal components including dissolution of calcite minerals, leaching of silicate sediments, and ion exchange process. Spatial mapping of IWQI identified that groundwater in the northern side of Faridpur region were more suitable for irrigational uses relative to central and southern side, possibly due to gradients of domestic discharges and agricultural activates from north to south side. These findings would provide useful information to water distributors, managers, and decision makers for taking adaptive measures in irrigation water quality management systems.

During snowmelt or precipitation events, water runoff carries nutrients into nearby streams and impairs the water quality. There is a need, therefore, to identify improved management of manure application in the soils. This study was conducted to assess water quality impacts associated following manure application during winter months when soil is completely covered with snow. The study site included three watersheds, named south (SW), east (CW), and north (NW) managed with a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation located in South Dakota. The SW and NW were used as treatment, and CW as the control watershed. The treatments included manure application on the upper half of the SW and lower half of the NW, and CW received no manure application. This study showed that manure improved soil properties including infiltration rate and organic matter. Nitrogen and phosphorus losses in the surface runoff were higher from NW compared to that of SW. The CW had similar nutrient losses compared to the NW with slight differences. It can be concluded that maintaining a setback distance can help in improving the environmental quality as well as managing the agricultural wastes during the winter months.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2017	228	10							389	10.1007/s11270-017-3572-5								WOS:000413334900015

The aim of this paper was the assessment of the ecological status of water quality and calculating water pollution index (WPI) of the Danube River in Serbia. For all surface waters, the WFD requires "good ecological status," i.e., low level changes of the natural state that occur as a result of human activities by 2015. The assessment was based on the data obtained from ten hydrological measuring stations on the Danube River in Serbia for 2014. It was ascertained that the ecological status of the Danube River water quality was class III, corresponding to "moderate ecological status" and deviating from the required "good ecological status." According to the calculated WPI = 1.352, the water pollution of the Danube River in Serbia was characterized as moderately polluted and corresponded to class III of surface water. The ecosystem approach clearly indicated that the concentration of physico-chemical parameters of the watercourse deviated from the target values. Therefore, there is an urgent need to take some measures to prevent pollution and improve the water quality of the Danube River as an integral part of the environment in Serbia.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2017	228	10							380	10.1007/s11270-017-3551-x								WOS:000413334900004

The survey gathers cost and water quality data from 37 treatment plants in forested ecoregions of the United States. We model the effect of forest conversion on the cost of water treatment using a two-step process. First, we examine the effect of changes in land use on water quality through an ecological production function. Second, we examine the effect of changes in water quality on cost of treatment through an economic benefits function. We find a negative relationship between forest cover and turbidity, but no relationship between forest cover and total organic carbon (TOC). Increasing forest cover in a watershed by 1% reduces turbidity by 3%, and increasing development by 1% in a watershed increases turbidity by 3%. The impact of development is more consistent across models than the impact of forest cover. We also find a large impact on turbidity from grazing in the watershed. Our economic benefits function shows a 1% increase in turbidity increases water treatment costs by 0.19%, and 1% increase in TOC increases water treatment costs by 0.46%. TOC has a clearer impact on costs than turbidity, which becomes insignificant when we omit one of our observations with high turbidity.																	2382-624X	2382-6258				OCT	2017	3	4							UNSP 1750006	10.1142/S2382624X17500060								WOS:000413077000002

Analysis of mine water from four decommissioned pits in south-western Ghana - implications for remediation programmes for mine closure	WATER POLICY												Research into water quality status of accumulated water in decommissioned pits is a grey area in Ghana and could be of significant benefit in the effectiveness of remediation of pits after mining. Water sampled from four decommissioned pits in Amansie West District were analysed for their water quality status. Seasonal variations of physico-chemical parameters for determining water quality were reported as well as their average values. In general, the ion concentrations varied from season to season but were within World Health Organization (WHO) maximum permissible limits (MPL) with the exception of boron. Similar observation was made for heavy metals/trace elements analysed, with the exception of As and Fe. Seasonal and average concentrations of As were higher than the WHO MPL. Similarly, the mid-season concentration of Fe recorded from a water sample collected from one pit was higher than WHO limits. Turbidity levels were significantly higher in two pits. The studies revealed that some parameters for water quality determination were above WHO acceptable limits for potable water, an indication that the effect of mining on water quality from water bodies investigated persisted after mine closure. Hence remediation programmes should be broadened to include effective reclamation of mine water accumulated in pits during mine closure.																	1366-7017					OCT	2017	19	5					957	977		10.2166/wp.2017.123								WOS:000412832300009

Optimization of hydrometric monitoring network in urban drainage systems using information theory	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Regular and continuous monitoring of urban runoff in both quality and quantity aspects is of great importance for controlling and managing surface runoff. Due to the considerable costs of establishing new gauges, optimization of the monitoring network is essential. This research proposes an approach for site selection of new discharge stations in urban areas, based on entropy theory in conjunction with multi-objective optimization tools and numerical models. The modeling framework provides an optimal trade-off between the maximum possible information content and the minimum shared information among stations. This approach was applied to the main surface-water collection system in Tehran to determine new optimal monitoring points under the cost considerations. Experimental results on this drainage network show that the obtained cost-effective designs noticeably outperform the consulting engineers' proposal in terms of both information contents and shared information. The research also determined the highly frequent sites at the Pareto front which might be important for decision makers to give a priority for gauge installation on those locations of the network.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	7					1603	1613		10.2166/wst.2017.226								WOS:000412778000002	28991778

To illustrate the applicability of ANFIS method, the upstream catchment of Feitsui Reservoir in Taiwan is chosen as the case study area. The appropriate input variables used to develop the ANFIS models are determined based on the t-test. The results obtained by ANFIS are compared with those by multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Simulated results show that the identified ANFIS model is superior to the traditional MLR and nonlinear ANNs models in terms of the performance evaluated by the Pearson coefficient of correlation, the root mean square error, the mean absolute percentage, and the mean absolute error. These results indicate that ANFIS models are more suitable than ANNs or MLR models to predict the nonlinear relationship within the variables caused by the complexity of aquatic systems and to produce the best fit of the measured BOD concentrations. ANFIS can be seen as a powerful predictive alternative to traditional water quality modeling techniques and extended to other areas to improve the understanding of river pollution trends.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	7					1739	1753		10.2166/wst.2017.359								WOS:000412778000014	28991790

We found that organic matter is the main pollution source of Yitong River and its tributaries. A black-odor evaluation model that can describe the pollution of the Yitong River water system was developed, and this model has the parameters I = 0.21 [CODCr] + 0.18 [DO] - 0.36[NH3-N] + 0.91. The model performance was satisfactory with a black-odor defining accuracy of 69%. Moreover, we found that CODCr, NH3-N, and DO are the influential factors of the Yitong River black-odor water body and that their threshold values when the water body transitioned to black odor were 109.2, 1.90, and 7.50 mg.L-1, respectively. We found that most of the Yitong River was polluted by six heavy metals, namely, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn. We used the Nemerow method to calculate the heavy metal pollution degree of each sampling point and found that 60% of the points were seriously polluted. Furthermore, we drew the heavy metal pollution distribution map of the Yitong River. Finally, we proposed an effective measure called new-type multistep constructed wetland to improve the water quality of Yitong River.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				OCT	2017	76	8					2051	2064		10.2166/wst.2017.372								WOS:000413666500011	29068335

To that end, nine water quality parameters [pH, turbidity (TURB), temperature (T), dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate (NO3), total solids (TS), phosphate (PO4), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and fecal coliforms (FC)] were analyzed at eight selected stations. According to the proposed classification for water quality indices (higher value (0-100), better water quality), the Wetland water quality was classified as the mean values of the three indices for the three sampled years, as follows: NSFWQI(a) (13.72, 12.81, 12.07); NSFWQI(m) (63.049, 52.388, 49.108); and OWQI (26.867, 14.477, 15.53). The values of NSFWQI(a), NSFWQI(m), and OWQI for the western stations were better than for the other stations in the region over the 29-year span of investigation; however, the remainders of the stations' values were very poor. Because wastewaters discharged from industrial and agricultural areas are more concentrated in the eastern part of the Anzali Wetland, the eastern stations of the Wetland showed lower water quality compared to the central and western stations. The water of the Anzali Wetland has different quality classes according to the aggregation methods employed. It is concluded that when evaluating water quality of aquatic ecosystems, several indices should be used to obtain more comprehensive results.

Three small eutrophic urban ponds which displayed considerable within-pond and betweenpond variability in water quality and cyanobacterial community composition were used as trial sites. On-board algorithms provide field measurements of phycocyanin (CPC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) from surface reflectance spectra measured by the instrument. These were compared with laboratory measurements. Although significant but weak relationships were found between WISP-3 measured CPC and cyanobacterial biovolume measurements and WISP-3 and laboratory Chl-a measurements, there was considerable scatter in the data due likely to error in both WISP-3 and laboratory measurements. The relationships generally differed only slightly between ponds, indicating that different cyanobacterial communities had little effect on the pigment retrievals of the WISP-3. The on-board algorithms need appropriate modification for local conditions, posing a problem if it is to be used extensively across water bodies with differing optical properties. Although suffering a range of other limitations, the WISP-3 has a potential as a rapid screening tool for preliminary risk assessment of cyanobacterial blooms. However, such field assessment would still require adequate support by sampling and laboratory-based analysis.

Considerable effort has therefore gone into the development of methods that control the ANPS input of N and P to surface waters. Phytoremediation has been extensively used because it is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and efficient. The N and P loads from agricultural drainage are a potential threat to the water quality of the Yellow River in Ningxia, China. Yet, phytoremediation has only rarely been applied within the Ningxia irrigation area. In an experimental setup, five species (Ipomoea aquatica, IA; Lactuca sativa, LS; Oryza sativa, OS; Typha latifolia, TL; Zizania latifolia, ZL) were evaluated for their ability to reduceNand P loads over 62 days and five observation periods. Total N and P concentrations, plant biomass, and nutrient content were measured. The results showed that OS, LS, and IA performed better than ZL and TL in terms of nutrients removal, biomass accumulation, and nutrients storage. The highest overall removal rates of N and P (57.7 and 57.3%, respectively) were achieved by LS treatment. In addition, plant uptake contributed significantly to nutrient removal, causing a 25.9-72.0% reduction in N removal and a 54.386.5% reduction in P removal. Thus, this study suggests that OS, LS, and IA would be more suitable than ZL and TL for controlling nutrient loads in the Ningxia irrigation area using phytoremediation.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2017	189	10							497	10.1007/s10661-017-6213-y								WOS:000411166100015	28890992					
J	Hornsey, W; Service, B				Hornsey, Warren; Service, Bill			A major failure involving an exposed geotextile to contain dredged spoil	GEOTEXTILES AND GEOMEMBRANES												The development of facility for the export of LNG from coal seam gas required a major dredging program which, due to the proximity of the Great Barrier Reef, was subject to strict environmental conditions. Most of the dredged spoil was required to be disposed of into a purpose-built bunded disposal area, constructed over existing seabed shallows. The as constructed rock fill embankment unintentionally allowed significant leakage of dredged spoil through and along much of its perimeter, compromising the disposal area's effectiveness in meeting water quality requirements. The loss of the dredged material through the embankment was primarily attributed to the geotextile component of the wall not performing as anticipated by the design and construct alliance. The design and construction factors that lead to the failure are discussed. Guidance is provided so as to avoid similar designs from being implemented in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study incorporated water quality testing into an existing national socioeconomic survey in Yogyakarta province, Indonesia; the first such study in Indonesia in terms of SDG tracking. Multivariate regression analysis assessed the association between faecal and nitrate contamination and drinking water sources household drinking water adjusted for wealth, education level, type of water sources and type of sanitation facilities. The survey observed widespread faecal contamination in both sources for drinking water (89.2%, 95%Cl: 86.9-91.5%; n=720) and household drinking water (67.1%, 95%CI: 64.1-70.1%; n=917) as measured by Escherichia coli. This was despite widespread improved drinking water source coverage (85.3%) and commonly self-reported boiling practices (82.2%). E.coli concentration levels in household drinking water were associated with wealth, education levels of a household head, and type of water source (i.e. vender water or local sources). Following the proposed SDG definition for Target 6.1 (water) and 6.2 (sanitation), the estimated proportion of households with access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation was 8.5% and 45.5%, respectively in the study areas, indicating substantial difference from improved drinking water (82.2%) and improved sanitation coverage (70.9%) as per the MDGs targets. The greatest contamination and risk factors were found in the poorest households indicating the urgent need for targeted and effective interventions here. There is suggested evidence that sub-surface leaching from on-site sanitation adversely impacts on drinking water sources, which underscores the need for further technical assistance in promoting latrine construction. Urgent action is still needed to strengthen systematic monitoring efforts towards tracking SDG Goal 6. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

A survey of domestic wells and pit latrines in rural settlements of Mali: Implications of on-site sanitation on the quality of water supplies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												On-site sanitation is generally advocated as a means to eradicate the health hazards associated with open defecation. While this has provided a welcome upgrade to the livelihoods of millions of people in low-income countries, improved sanitation facilities are increasingly becoming a threat to domestic groundwater-based supplies. Within this context, a survey of pit latrines, domestic wells and improved water sources was carried out in a large rural village of southern Mali. All households were surveyed for water, sanitation and hygiene habits. Domestic wells and improved water sources were georeferenced and sampled for water quality (pH, electric conductivity, temperature, turbidity, total dissolved solids, thermotolerant coliforms, chloride and nitrate) and groundwater level, while all latrines were inspected and georeferenced. A GIS database was then used to evaluate the proportion of water points within the influence area of latrines, as well as to underpin multiple regression models to establish the determinants for fecal contamination in drinking supplies. Moreover, an appraisal of domestic water treatment practices was carried out. This revealed that nearly two-thirds of the population uses bleach to purify drinking supplies, but also that domestic-scale treatment as currently implemented by the population is far from effective. It is thus concluded that existing habits could be enhanced as a means to make water supplies safer. Furthermore, population, well and latrine density were all identified as statistically significant predictors for fecal pollution at different spatial scales. These findings are policy-relevant in the context of groundwater-dependent human settlements, since many countries in the developing world currently pursue the objective of eliminating open defecation.

Assessing condition of macroinvertebrate communities and bed sediment toxicity in the Rochester Embayment Area of Concern, New York, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The United States and Canada agreed to restore the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Great Lakes ecosystem under the first Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972. The lowest reach of the Genesee River and the Rochester Embayment on Lake Ontario between Bogus Point and Nine Mile Point, including Braddock Bay, were designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) due to effects of contaminated sediments and physical disturbance on several beneficial uses. Following sediment remedial efforts and with conditions improving in the AOC, the present study was conducted to reevaluate the status of the benthic macroinvertebrate (benthos) beneficial use impairment (BUI). Benthic macroinvertebrate community assessments and 10-day Chironomus dilutus bioassays were used to test the hypotheses that sediments within the AOC were no more toxic than sediments from surrounding reference areas. The study was separated into three discrete systems (Genesee River, Lake Ontario, and Braddock Bay) and non-parametric analyses determined that a multimetric index of benthic macroinvertebrate community integrity was significantly higher at AOC sites compared to reference sites on the Genesee River and in Braddock Bay while AOC and reference sites on Lake Ontario did not differ significantly. Survival and growth of C. dilutus were also similar between AOC and reference sites for each system with the exception of significantly higher growth at reference sites on Lake Ontario. Results generally indicated that the condition of benthos and toxicity of sediment of the Rochester Embayment AOC are similar to or better than that in the surrounding area.

J	Howell, ET; Dove, A				Howell, E. Todd; Dove, Alice			Chronic nutrient loading from Lake Erie affecting water quality and nuisance algae on the St. Catharines shores of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Water quality and lake circulation in the nearshore of Lake Ontario bordering the city of St. Catharines were examined from May to October 2013 to interpret factors impacting water resources and contributing to nuisance algae. Our findings suggest that loadings from eastern Lake Erie via Twelve Mile Creek and the Welland Canal are a primary driver of variability in nearshore water quality, creating mixing areas enriched in particulate and dissolved phosphorus and turbidity. Impingement of the Niagara River plume and regional lake circulation also impact water quality conditions. Quantitative benthic sampling revealed that Cladophora was abundant to lake depths of about six meters, which is shallower than other nearshore areas of Lake Ontario. Estimates of PAR intensity at the lakebed interpolated over the study area suggest that light limitation counteracts the stimulation of Cladophora growth attributable to elevated dissolved phosphorus over the discharge mixing areas. No evidence was found that the chronic loading of phosphorus in the area resulted in a higher prevalence of Cladophora compared with other areas of the lake. The abundance of dreissenid mussels, reaching 4760 individuals/m(2), was not correlated with water chemistry features or biomass of Cladophora. Interactions between dreissenids and Cladophora may be muted in the area due to overriding physical factors which appear to limit Cladophora to shallow depths and mussels to deeper waters.

Long-term decline in stream total phosphorus concentrations: A pervasive pattern in all watershed types in Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Cultural eutrophication of the Great Lakes resulted in actions to reduce phosphorus loading beginning in the 1970's. Despite these measures, a resurgence of harmful algae blooms began in the 1990s. Non-point sources and changing agricultural practices are frequently cited as contributing to this resurgence. We examined changes in total phosphorus concentrations ([TP]) and several other water quality parameters from April through November from 1979 to 2011 using 56 streams throughout Ontario, including agricultural, undeveloped, urban, and mixed-use watersheds. Growing season median [TP] was not significantly different among stream types, but decreased in 32 of the 56 sites; only one urban site increased. There were weak differences among land uses; mixed sites typically had the highest [TP] and steepest declines. Soluble reactive P concentration [SRP] decreased at 12 sites, and increased at one agricultural and three urban sites. Where trends were significant, suspended solids typically decreased, while [Cl-] and alkalinity typically increased. As adequate winter data were not available and there may have been changes in the seasonal distribution of high flow during the period we studied, the changes we observed in median growing season [TP] may not reflect changes in loading. However, seasonal discharge trends were not significant except for one site with a decreasing trend in spring discharge. Possible mechanisms for pervasive downward trends in TP include improved rural and urban land use practices, reduced acid precipitation, increased nitrogen availability in terrestrial ecosystems, and ongoing forest regrowth after initial clear-cutting.

This paper discusses evaluating, analyzing and monitoring of urban drinking water quality and application systematically and proposes a multiple criteria decision-making model, which integrates analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Kullback-Leibler divergence ratio (KLDR) and comprehensive weighted index (CWI) method to evaluate the quality of drinking water comprehensively. AHP method and KLDR are employed to distribute reasonable weight to indices, and CWI method is used to get comprehensive score of multiple criteria system for evaluation. Association analysis is used to find the useful association rules between criteria and drinking water quality. Geographic information system (GIS) technology is employed to show the distribution map of drinking water quality visually. The proposed method is applied to real-time comprehensive evaluation and visualized monitoring of drinking water quality in Shanghai City. The distribution map of drinking water quality based on GIS can provide monitoring and government agencies with an overall assessment and enable them to make better informed decisions. Real-time application shows that the proposed methods are effective for the assessment and monitoring of urban water quality.																	1432-7643	1433-7479				OCT	2017	21	20			SI		6031	6041		10.1007/s00500-017-2809-y								WOS:000411868100012

But most of the total maximum daily load (TMDL) implementation plans crafted to meet water quality standards in the USA are developed assuming stationary climate and at best a small number of land use futures, although neither assumption seems reliably justified. To address this challenge, this study employs robust decision making (RDM) methods, commonly used to help develop water supply plans, to stress test the proposed Enhanced Watershed Management Plan (EWMP), a TMDL implementation plan, for the Tujunga Wash, the largest subwatershed of the Los Angeles River, over a wide range of climate and land use futures. We find that climate change could significantly reduce the ability of the Tujunga EWMP to meet water quality goals; however, meeting the city's goals for increasing permeable land cover offsets the risk of non-compliance in the face of climate change uncertainties. This study also introduces innovations in RDM analyses, including: treatment of the deeply uncertain incidence of extreme precipitation events, an explicit link between RDM scenario discovery methods and the specification of signposts for adaptive policy pathways, and the use of (imprecise) probabilistic climate projections to inform the choice among robust adaptive policy pathways. The paper also contributes to a larger debate over how to address climate and other uncertainties in regulatory processes involving water quality.																	0165-0009	1573-1480				OCT	2017	144	4					625	639		10.1007/s10584-017-2062-5								WOS:000411875800008

Intercomparison of regional-scale hydrological models and climate change impacts projected for 12 large river basins worldwide-a synthesis	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												An intercomparison of climate change impacts projected by nine regional-scale hydrological models for 12 large river basins on all continents was performed, and sources of uncertainty were quantified in the framework of the ISIMIP project. The models ECOMAG, HBV, HYMOD, HYPE, mHM, SWAT, SWIM, VIC andWaterGAP3 were applied in the following basins: Rhine and Tagus in Europe, Niger and Blue Nile in Africa, Ganges, Lena, Upper Yellow and Upper Yangtze in Asia, Upper Mississippi, MacKenzie and Upper Amazon in America, and Darling in Australia. The model calibration and validation was done using WATCH climate data for the period 1971-2000. The results, evaluated with 14 criteria, are mostly satisfactory, except for the low flow. Climate change impacts were analyzed using projections from five global climate models under four representative concentration pathways. Trends in the period 2070-2099 in relation to the reference period 1975-2004 were evaluated for three variables: the long-term mean annual flow and high and low flow percentiles Q(10) and Q(90), as well as for flows in three months high-and low-flow periods denoted as HF and LF. For three river basins: the Lena, MacKenzie and Tagus strong trends in all five variables were found (except for Q(10) in the MacKenzie); trends with moderate certainty for three to five variables were confirmed for the Rhine, Ganges and Upper Mississippi; and increases in HF and LF were found for the Upper Amazon, Upper Yangtze and Upper Yellow. The analysis of projected streamflow seasonality demonstrated increasing streamflow volumes during the high-flow period in four basins influenced by monsoonal precipitation (Ganges, Upper Amazon, Upper Yangtze and Upper Yellow), an amplification of the snowmelt flood peaks in the Lena and MacKenzie, and a substantial decrease of discharge in the Tagus (all months). The overall average fractions of uncertainty for the annual mean flow projections in the multi-model ensemble applied for all basins were 57% for GCMs, 27% for RCPs, and 16% for hydrological models.

THE EFFECT OF pH ON CHRONIC ZINC TOXICITY DIFFERS BETWEEN DAPHNID SPECIES: DEVELOPMENT OF A PRELIMINARY CHRONIC ZINC CERIODAPHNIA DUBIA BIOAVAILABILITY MODEL	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												In the present study, we observed that the chronic Zn Daphnia magna biotic ligand model (BLM) could not accurately predict the chronic Zn toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia in a series of (modified) field waters, although the intrinsic sensitivities of the D. magna BLM were specifically calibrated on the sensitivity of C. dubia. Moreover, it was observed that the D. magna BLM underestimated the effect of pH on the toxicity of the free Zn2+ ion. A preliminary species-specific chronic Zn C. dubia bioavailability model was developed based on the data. The preliminary Zn C. dubia bioavailability model was shown to predict Zn toxicity to C. dubia in a series of natural waters with pH ranging between 7 and 8.3 with reasonable accuracy. The difference in the effect of pH on Zn2+ toxicity between D. magna and C. dubia (2 phylogenetically closely related species) suggested by our results deserves further attention because of the importance of the cross-species application of bioavailability models in ecological risk-assessment procedures and environmental quality standard derivations for metals.

J	Pajunen, V; Luoto, M; Soininen, J				Pajunen, Virpi; Luoto, Miska; Soininen, Janne			Unravelling direct and indirect effects of hierarchical factors driving microbial stream communities	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: The diversity and distributions of organisms are jointly influenced by local environment and large-scale variables, such as land cover patterns, dispersal processes and climate. However, the drivers of microbial diversity are complex and the pathways of these drivers' effects are to date largely unresolved, especially in freshwaters. We disentangled the causal direct and indirect effects of climate, land cover and water chemistry on stream diatom communities using hierarchical settings. Location: Finland, a geographical gradient of c. 1200 km (60 degrees-70 degrees N). Methods: We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse patterns in diatom richness, composition and the uniqueness of species composition in 143 streams. The community composition was defined as the value of the first axis in non-metric multidimensional scaling and the uniqueness of species composition of each site as its local contribution to beta diversity. Results: Species richness was mainly affected directly by energy and resource availability, increasing with nutrients but decreasing with growing degree days (GDD). The community composition was strongly influenced directly by conductivity and mainly indirectly by anthropogenic land use but also to a lesser degree by GDD (directly and indirectly), indirectly by precipitation and directly by the amount of boreal wetlands. The uniqueness of species composition increased with conductivity but decreased with nutrient concentrations with high number of unique species in southernmost and northernmost sites. Main conclusions: Our SEM analyses revealed some of the important links between climate, land cover and water chemistry, all of which influenced the microbial diversity. Energy availability has varying indirect and direct effects on diatom communities regardless of local stream conditions, whereas land cover patterns affect aquatic communities most likely indirectly through water chemistry. Collectively, these results suggest that it is important to consider environmental variables simultaneously at different hierarchically ordered scales in macroecological and biogeographical research.

A hydrochemical study was performed in an area of SW Guatemala (Samala River basin), where water supply to population is groundwater-based and no systematic studies on its groundwater resources have been performed so far. Traditional hydrochemical analyses on major ions and some trace elements metals coupled with chemometric approach were performed, including principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. Results evidence that chemical differentiation is linked to the spatial distribution of sampled waters. The most common hydrochemical fades, bicarbonate calcium and magnesium, is linked to infiltration of meteoric waters in recharge areas represented by highlands surrounding Xela caldera, a wide plateau where most of population is concentrated. This trend undergoes chemical evolution in proximity of active volcanic complexes in the southern area, with enrichment in sulphate, chloride and magnesium. Chemical evolution also occurs towards the centre of Xela caldera due to slow circulation in aquifer and consequent sodium enrichment due to ion exchange with the porous medium. Water quality did not reveal severe concerns, even though some sources of contamination could be identified; in particular, agriculture and urban wastewater could be responsible for observed threshold exceedances in nitrate and lead. This integrated multi-approach to hydrochemical data interpretation yielded to the achievement of important information that poses the basis for future groundwater protection in an area where main water features were almost unknown.

Previous research in Indiana and Ohio has shown that two-stage ditches offer the potential to reduce sediment load and extend the interaction time between water, bench vegetation, and bench soil allowing larger uptake of nutrients by the vegetation and increasing the denitrification rates. A two-stage ditch was constructed that drains an area of approximately 267 ha of farmland used for corn and soybean production. Discharge, nitrate-N (NO3), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) and total suspended sediment (TSS) were monitored in the two-stage ditch and a control reach immediately upstream. The two-stage ditch was found to significantly decrease TP, SRP and TSS concentrations and loads. Although the two stage ditch decreased NO3 concentrations significantly, it did not have a significant impact on NO3 loads. More specifically, the two-stage ditch reduced the loads of TP by 40%, SRP by 11% and TSS by 22-40% depending on the stage of vegetation establishment on its floodplain benches, compared to an increase in load of 78%, 2% and 1%, respectively in the control reach.

Dissolved organic carbon loading from the field to watershed scale in tile-drained landscapes	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Subsurface tile drains influence watershed fluxes of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides, but few studies have examined the role of subsurface tile drains and drainage water management practices on watershed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export. The objective of this study was therefore to quantify the contribution of subsurface tile drains to watershed DOC export and to evaluate the effect of drainage water management of DOC concentrations and loads in tile-drained fields. Discharge and DOC concentration were measured at the outlet of an agricultural headwater watershed (3.9 km(2)) in Ohio, USA and all of the subsurface tile drains (6 total) within the watershed over an 8-year period. Results showed that DOC concentration in both subsurface tile drains and stream water were highly variable (0.1-44.4 mg L-1), with mean DOC concentrations ranging from 5.7 to 8.2 mg L-1. Intra-annual variability in subsurface tile drain and watershed hydrology yielded seasonal differences in DOC loading. Over the study period, 81.7% and 92.4% of watershed and subsurface tile drain DOC loading, respectively, occurred during 20% of the time, typically during winter and spring high flow events. Mean annual DOC loading from the drainage network was 19.6 kg ha(-1), while mean annual DOC loading at the watershed outlet was 43.9 kg ha(-1). On average, subsurface tile drainage comprised 33% of monthly watershed DOC export (<1-82%). Implementing drainage water management at one of the subsurface tile drains decreased discharge (179 mm; 22%) and DOC loading (6.8 kg ha(-1); 26%) compared to an adjacent free draining subsurface tile drain. Findings from this study demonstrate the utility of simultaneously monitoring solute fluxes from both field and watershed scales, and indicate that subsurface tile drains are a significant source of DOC to headwater agricultural streams. Further, results suggest that drainage water management can significantly decrease DOC losses from tile-drained fields.

In this study, the impacts of land use change from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to perennial grasses in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the Texas High Plains were assessed using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). While switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) was assumed to replace cotton in irrigated areas, dryland cotton was replaced by Miscanthus x giganteus under the hypothetical land use change scenarios. Climate change impacts were assessed based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projections of 19 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 during two 30-year periods of middle (2040-2069) and end (2070-2099) of the 21st century. Median irrigation water use of cotton was simulated to decrease by 41%-61% in the future when compared to historic (1994-2009) period based on projections by 19 GCMs. Under the future climate change scenarios, when compared to cotton, median annual irrigation water use by switchgrass reduced by 62%-89%. Simulated future median total nitrogen load decreased by 30%-40% under perennial grasses when compared to future cotton land use. The median irrigated switchgrass yield decreased by 16%-28%, but the median dryland Miscanthus yield increased by 32%-38% under the future climate change scenarios. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Using C-13 isotopic analysis to assess soil carbon pools associated with tile drainage management during drier and wetter growing seasons	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Controlled tile drainage (CTD) is an agricultural management practice with well-documented water quality and agronomic benefits. However, due to field water drainage abatement effects, the practice could potentially impact soil respiration. The delta C-13 of soil gas samples were analyzed from silt loam CTD and uncontrolled tile drained (UTD) fields cropped with corn, soybean, and forage to test whether CTD affects total soil respiration (RT) through altering residue decomposition and/or gas transport. We also examined whether CTD imparted an over tile (OT) and between tile (BT) locational effect on RT. All gas samples are from bulk rhizosphere and microbial sources; except for the forage crop measurements which included plants growing inside the sampling chamber collars. The mean values of delta C-13 for RT were not statistically different (p > 0.05) between four of the five CTD and UTD field pairs. Neither were the means of delta C-13 of RT different (p > 0.05) between OT and BT locations in four of the five CTD fields. The generalized lack of statistical differences in delta C-13 of RT observed, may have resulted from the drier and wetter seasonal conditions muting drainage management effects on surface soil water contents. The results could be used to help refine the carbon footprint of tile drainage management practices. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study aims at assessing the dynamics of hydrological processes and nitrate loads within inland valleys that are experiencing different land uses. To achieve this goal, an HRU-based interface (ArcSWAT2012) and a grid-based setup (SWATgrid) of the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model were applied to three headwater inland valley watersheds located in the commune of Djougou in central Benin that are characterized by different proportions of cultivated area. Satisfactory model performance was obtained from the calibration and validation of daily discharges with the values of R-2 and NSE mostly higher than 0.5, but not for nitrate loads. The annual water balance reveals that more than 60% of precipitation water is lost to evapotranspiration at all sites, amounting to 868 mm in Kounga, 741 mm in Tossahou, and 645 mm in Kpandouga. Percolation (302 mm) is important in the Kpandouga watershed which is dominated by natural vegetation at 99.7%, whereas surface runoff (105 mm) and lateral flow (92 mm) are the highest in the Kounga watershed having the highest proportion of agricultural land use (14%). In all the studied watersheds, nitrate loads are very low (not exceeding 4000 KgN per year) due to the low fertilizer application rates, and the water quality is not threatened if a standard threshold of 10 mg/I NO3-N is applied. The results achieved in this study show that SWAT can successfully be used in spatial,planning for sustainable agricultural development with limited environmental impact on water resources in inland valley landscapes.

Bank filtration in a coastal lake in South Brazil: water quality, natural organic matter (NOM) and redox conditions study	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY												Bank filtration (BF) was evaluated as new treatment or pre-treatment option for drinking water production in Brazil. General water quality parameters, natural organic matter (NOM) and redox conditions were evaluated in Lagoa do Peri, a costal lake in Santa Catarina, South Brazil. Studies in two periods at two bank filtrations well systems, in a 45-m-length column and in a test filter laboratory scale set-up, were performed. The well systems and the column showed the removal of turbidity and colour from around 7 NTU and 65 Pt-Co, respectively, to below the local regulations (1 NTU and 15 Pt-Co units). Both systems demonstrated a good removal of NOM and trihalomethanes (THM) precursors with a preference removal of THM precursors. The NOM and THM precursor removal in the large column and the test filter were effectively modelled. In both cases, an easily degradable organic matter fraction was modelled; in the large column a moderate degradable fraction was identified as well. The first fraction was removed during the first days of travel time of the bank filtrate. A change to reduced redox conditions was observed in the large column experiment. The same happened in the wells system, showing the dissolution of iron, manganese and sulphide in the bank filtrate. This was the principal drawback of BF comparing with the already existing direct filtration (DF) treatment plant. BF performed slightly better in THM precursor removal (52%) than DF (42%). Therefore, BF could be a pre-treatment for the DF treatment system, and the existing facility could be adapted for iron and manganese removal.

Influence of water quality on nutritional and sensory characteristics of green tea infusion	JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING												Impact of water quality on the nutritional and sensory characteristics of green tea infusion was studied. The total soluble tea solids, catechins and l-theanine concentrations were significantly higher in infusions prepared from water having lower total dissolved solids (TDS, 0.59 to 13.0 ppm), conductivity (1.12 to 26.20 mu S), and pH (6.04 to 6.90). The difference in extractability was explained using the mass transfer equation dN(T)/dt=k(L)A(s)(C-Te-C-TL); where dN(T)/dt-mass transfer rate, k(L)-mass transfer coefficient, A(s)-surface area, C-Te-equilibrium concentration, and C-TL-concentration in bulk liquid. The major catechins reduced (approximate to 84-93%) in the infusions prepared from water with higher TDS (315 to 338 ppm), conductivity (630 to 679 mu S), and pH (7.65 to 8.05), accompanied with undesirable color changes during storage following the first-order kinetics. Tea cream and turbidity were much higher with water having higher calcium concentration (51.60 mg/L). The study recommended water with low TDS, conductivity and pH for hot-infusions and beverages. Practical applicationsThe study was initiated to select a suitable type of water for the preparation of green tea infusion and ready-to-drink (RTD) beverages. For infusion, the extractability of the nutrients as well as the sensory characteristics are important. Accordingly, ultra-pure (UP), packaged drinking (PD), or reverse osmosis (RO) water may be used for the preparation. But, in the case of RTD beverages, the physical stability and visual appearance are also equally important for consumer acceptance, as they are held in storage and distribution before being consumed. Furthermore, the results indicated that stability of catechins need to be considered as a parameter for the selection of water. Even though UP, PD, or RO meets all these criteria, economic considerations propel RO water for RTD production. Thus the inferences obtained from this scientific study has practical relevance in the selection of appropriate quality of water for the preparation of green tea beverages.

Sensing soil and foliar phosphorus fluorescence in Zea mays in response to large phosphorus additions	PRECISION AGRICULTURE												Additions of large loads of phosphorus (P) enriched animal manure to soils and the persistence of their environmental impact have been associated with continued water quality impairment in regions of high density of confined animal feeding operations. Foliar P in corn (Zea mays L.) and changes in labile P in Aquic Hapludults were determined following P application of 0-560 kg P ha(-1) as KH2PO4 and an application of Fe3+ (150 mg Fe3+ kg(-1)) in field mini-lysimeters to develop calibrations of soil and plant nutritional responses. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning of uppermost leaves of plants at the V2, V5, and V8 stages showed that foliar P proportionally increased with addition rates. Exchangeable and enzyme-labile P forms were effective indicators of foliar XRFS-P for up to 30 days after emergence. Phosphorus calibration curves developed for flag leaves showed that spatial distribution of foliar P (3.6, 4.2, and 5.3 g kg(-1)) corresponded to field zones treated with 0, 15, and 30 kg P ha(-1) as dairy manure P for the past 18 years. Up-to-date crop uptake and availability of P in these Hapludults were best described by a square root function of soil XRFS-P and total exchangeable inorganic P (r(2) = 0.4; RMSE = 419 and 422 g ha(-1), respectively). Therefore, a timely knowledge of canopy P status and its linkage to actual soil P status supports in situ element-specific sensing and precision nutrient management in order to manage the declining use-efficiency in crops and reduce potential loss to the environment.																	1385-2256	1573-1618				OCT	2017	18	5					685	700		10.1007/s11119-016-9480-7								WOS:000411125400001

Long-term impact of a precision agriculture system on grain crop production	PRECISION AGRICULTURE												Research is lacking on the long-term impacts of field-scale precision agriculture practices on grain production. Following more than a decade (1993-2003) of yield and soil mapping and water quality assessment, a multi-faceted, 'precision agriculture system' (PAS) was implemented from 2004 to 2014 on a 36-ha field in central Missouri. The PAS targeted management practices that address crop production and environmental issues. It included no-till, cover crops, growing winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) instead of corn (Zea mays L.) for field areas where corn was not profitable, site-specific N for wheat and corn using canopy reflectance sensing, variable-rate P, K and lime using intensively grid-sampled data, and targeting of herbicides based on weed pressure. The PAS assessment was accomplished by comparing it to the previous decade of conventional, whole-field corn-soybean (Glycine max L.) mulch-tillage management. In the northern part of the field and compared to pre-PAS corn, relative grain yield of wheat in PAS was greatly improved and temporal yield variation was reduced on shallow topsoil, but relative grain yield was reduced on deep soil in the drainage channel. In the southern part of the field where corn remained in production, PAS did not lead to increased yield, but temporal yield variation was reduced. Across the whole field, soybean yield and temporal yield variation were only marginally influenced by PAS. Spatial yield variation of all three crops was not altered by PAS. Therefore, the greatest production advantage of a decade of precision agriculture was reduced temporal yield variation, which leads to greater yield stability and resilience to changing climate.																	1385-2256	1573-1618				OCT	2017	18	5					823	842		10.1007/s11119-016-9490-5								WOS:000411125400008

Influence of land use and lithology on sources and ages of nutritional resources for stream macroinvertebrates: a multi-isotopic approach	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Terrestrially-derived carbon (C) and organic matter (OM)-often of significant age-dominate in many streams and rivers, yet little is known about their potential nutritional contributions to aquatic macroinvertebrate consumers. Impacts of watershed characteristics (e.g., land use and lithology) on the sources and ages of C and OM utilized by aquatic consumers are also poorly understood. To assess these factors, macroinvertebrates were collected from six headwater streams having different watershed lithologies and land uses in the Hudson-Mohawk River system (New York, USA) and analyzed for natural delta C-13, delta N-15, delta H-2, and a dagger C-14. A Bayesian stable isotopic mixing model revealed that autochthonous primary production dominated (62-92%) the biomass of all functional feeding groups (FFGs) across all sites, with allochthonous sources being of secondary but still significant (21-31%) importance. Macroinvertebrates collected from streams in watersheds having low vs. high agricultural land use were estimated to assimilate 0-13 and 4-31% soil-derived C and OM, respectively. a dagger C-14 values and apparent ages of macroinvertebrates from shale-rich and shale-poor sites were also significantly different (mean a dagger C-14 = -75 and -34aEuro degrees; equivalent C-14 ages = 630 and 280 years B.P., respectively). Inclusion of a dagger C-14 data in mixing models confirmed the importance of autochthonous primary production, and also demonstrated indirect lithological control of nutritional resource utilization by influencing stream substrate type and potential retention of allochthonous C and OM. Findings from this study further showed that the relative magnitudes of autochthonous vs. allochthonous contributions to macroinvertebrates were dependent on FFG, land use type, and lithology.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				OCT	2017	79	4					925	939		10.1007/s00027-017-0542-3								WOS:000410781000011						
J	Wang, HB; Qin, J; Hu, YH				Wang, Hongbing; Qin, Jun; Hu, Yonghong			Are green roofs a source or sink of runoff pollutants?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Retention of rainwater runoff is a primary function of green roofs in their contribution as one of the main indicators of "Sponge City". However, the influence of green roofs on runoff quality and whether they are a source or sink of pollutants is ambiguous. A concept model of pollutant cycling is proposed in this paper, based on a systematic literature review, which includes the direct factors substrate and structure of the green roof system; and indirect factors such as plant species, irrigation, fertilizer, atmospheric deposition, and age of the green roof. In addition, the model identifies each factor as a pollutant source or sink and explores relations among the factors. Examples in the literature were drawn to demonstrate the factors and pollutant materials including metallic elements such as Zn, Pb, Cd, Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, and Ca; and nutrients such as N, NO3--N, NH4-N, DON, P, PO43--P, K, and DOC. The concept of "moderate growth vigor" is proposed; moderate growth is optimal for runoff quality and low and persistent fertility, and a low benchmark to control diseases and insect pests. The concept of "clean sources and pollutant retention" should be adopted, i.e., pollutant sources such as substrate, irrigation water, fertilizer, pesticide, and other local pollution sources should be removed or cleaned, and pollutants should be detained or decreased by plant degradation, slow-release material, filter layer, and actinic and microbial degradation. These results will aid understanding of the mechanism of runoff pollution and improve stormwater runoff quality from source to sink in green roofs.

Impacts of gravel jetting on the composition of fish spawning substrates: Implications for river restoration and fisheries management	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Fine sediments can impact river biota, with egg and larval stages of lithophilic fish particularly sensitive to deposition of sand- to clay-sized particles ('fines') in spawning gravels. Mitigation and restoration methods include jetting to cleanse gravels of fines. Despite wide application, impacts of jetting on gravel composition and quality have rarely been quantified. Here, gravel jetting impacts on sediment composition in the River Great Ouse (UK), were tested during an in-situ experiment completed at riffle (55.6 +/- 13.4 m(2)) and patch (0.3 m(2)) scales to determine its magnitude and persistence on surface and subsurface substrate conditions. Before-after (riffle) and control-impact (patch) designs were used, with bedload sediment traps installed downstream of experimental patches to investigate the sediments mobilised during jetting. At the riffle scale, surface grain size was significantly altered; fines were removed resulting in coarser and better-sorted sediments. Similar patterns were detected at the patch scale, although sediment sorting was not significantly altered. Despite reduced fine sediment content of subsurface gravels at the riffle scale, the overall grain size composition was not significantly altered. At the patch scale, no subsurface improvements were detected. Temporally, at the riffle scale, no changes in surface or subsurface sediments lasted more than 12 months; patch scale changes generally persisted for less than 3 months. Thus, whilst gravel jetting could improve spawning gravel quality for surface spawning fishes, including European barbel Barbus barbus, its effects are short-lived. Because subsurface sediments are not affected by gravel jetting, the benefits are limited for redd-building fishes, such as salmonids. Consequently, reducing fine sediment delivery to rivers, such as by changes in agricultural practices, is more sustainable for managing excessive river sedimentation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

N.; Abed, Suhail N.; Scholz, Miklas			Recycling of domestic wastewater treated by vertical-flow wetlands for irrigation of two consecutive Capsicum annuum generations	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Due to water scarcity, there is great interest in reusing various nutrient-rich wastewaters. The aim of this article is consequently to evaluate if domestic wastewater treated by various wetland systems can be successfully recycled to irrigate generations of commercial crops such as Chilli (Capsicum annuum) grown in compost within a laboratory environment to obtain a cultivar adapted to domestic wastewater. The corresponding objectives were to assess the irrigation water for long-term growth when applying recycled wastewater, the impact of various wastewaters subject to the wetland characteristics, the impact of treated wastewater volume for irrigation, and the economic return of different experimental set-ups in terms of marketable yields. The vertical-flow wetlands treated domestic wastewater well, meeting the irrigation water quality standards for most water quality parameters, except for phosphorus (4.2 +/- 0.48 mg/l), ammonia-nitrogen (4.2 +/- 2.64 mg/l), potassium (7.0 +/- 3.03 mg/l) and total coliforms (69647 +/- 64852.6 CFU/100 ml), which showed high values significantly (p < 0.05) exceeding common thresholds set for irrigation applications of 2 mg/l, 5 mg/l, 2 mg/l, and 1000 CFU/100 ml. Chilli generations were grown successfully when applying wastewater treated by wetlands and organic soil. High Chilli generation yields concerning economic return were linked with wetlands containing small aggregates with long contact and resting times and fed with a high inflow loading rate (undiluted wastewater), releasing more nutrients into their effluent producing the best fruit quality with respect to weight, length and width resulting in a greater marketable profit of about 46% compared with the others. First generation Chilli plants were grown with considerably shorter heights and produced abundant fruit numbers, which were harvested earlier than their mothers due to the reduction (approximately 55%) of irrigation water volume used for them compared to their mothers. However, excessive nutrients applied on mother plants via irrigation water resulted in better fruit quality regarding dimensions and weights compared with their corresponding first generation plants, leading to a greater marketable profit by about 25%.

J	Shrestha, S; Farrelly, J; Eggleton, M; Chen, YS				Shrestha, Sagar; Farrelly, John; Eggleton, Michael; Chen, Yushun			Effects of conservation wetlands on stream habitat, water quality and fish communities in agricultural watersheds of the lower Mississippi River Basin	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetland conservation programs (e.g., Wetland Reserve Program and Conservation Reserve Program) have been implemented throughout the Mississippi River Basin to reduce environmental impacts from agricultural activities. However, there is limited information on the overall effectiveness of these programs on improving stream ecological conditions. To address this issue, replicate streams from southeastern Arkansas draining watersheds containing predominately croplands (n = 4, termed "cropland") and created wetlands (n = 4, termed "wetland") were monitored monthly from August 2012 through July 2013. Although repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) detected many significant time x stream type interactions, several habitat parameters and total habitat scores exhibited a general improvement in wetland streams. Some water quality conditions were better in wetland streams (e.g., lower turbidity, total suspended solids, and nutrient) compared to cropland streams. The time (season) effect was significant (p < 0.05) for 13 of the 14 water quality parameters measured, meaning that water quality varied seasonally. Among the water quality parameters measured, three (water temperature, pH, and turbidity) exhibited significant (p < 0.05) time x stream type interaction, meaning that the stream type effect was not consistent through time (seasons). Fish community sampling collected 6543 specimens from 12 species during the study period; 4410 and 2133 fish specimens were collected from cropland and wetland streams, respectively. Fish community metrics such as species diversity, species evenness, and species richness index were not significantly (p > 0.05) greater in wetland streams. Overall, the conservation wetlands in the Lower Mississippi River Basin appear to have significantly improved stream habitat and moderately improved water quality, though no significant fish community effect was detected.

We present a case study of rural mining-agricultural communities in the Lake Poopo Basin, one of the poorest regions on the Bolivian Altiplano. Here, relatively low rainfall, high evaporation, salinization and unregulated mining activity have contributed to environmental degradation and water issues, which is a situation facing many Altiplano communities. Social data from 72 households and chemical water quality data from 27 surface water and groundwater sites obtained between August 2013 and July 2014 were used to develop locally relevant vulnerability assessment methodologies and ratings with respect to water availability and quality, and Chemical Water Quality Hazard Ratings to assess water quality status. Levels of natural and mining-related contamination in many waters (CWQHR >= 6; 78% of assessed sites) mean that effective remediation would be challenging and require substantial investment. Although waters of fair to good chemical quality (CWQHR <= 5; 22% of assessed sites) do exist, treatment may still be required depending on use, and access issues remain problematic. There is a need to comply with water quality legislation, improve and maintain basic water supply and storage infrastructure, build and operate water and wastewater treatment plants, and adequately and safely contain and treat mine waste. This study serves as a framework that could be used elsewhere for assessing and mitigating water contamination and availability affecting vulnerable populations.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2017	60	4					555	573		10.1007/s00267-017-0893-5								WOS:000410806800001	28597053

Public-Private Partnerships Working Beyond Scale Challenges toward Water Quality Improvements from Private Lands	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In recognition that Iowa agriculture must maintain long-term production of food, fiber, clean water, healthy soil, and robust rural economies, Iowa recently devised a nutrient reduction strategy to set objectives for water quality improvements. To demonstrate how watershed programs and farmers can reduce nutrient and sediment pollution in Iowa waters, the Iowa Water Quality Initiative selected the Boone River Watershed Nutrient Management Initiative as one of eight demonstration projects. For over a decade, diverse public, private, and non-profit partner organizations have worked in the Boone River Watershed to engage farmers in water quality management efforts. To evaluate social dynamics in the Boone River Watershed and provide partners with actionable recommendations, we conducted and analyzed semi-structured interviews with 33 program leaders, farmers, and local agronomists. We triangulated primary interview data with formal analysis of Boone River Watershed documents such as grant applications, progress reports, and outreach materials. Our evaluation suggests that while multi-stakeholder collaboration has enabled partners to overcome many of the traditional barriers to watershed programming, scale mismatches caused by external socio-economic and ecological forces still present substantial obstacles to programmatic resilience. Public funding restrictions and timeframes, for example, often cause interruptions to adaptive management of water quality monitoring and farmer engagement. We present our findings within a resilience framework to demonstrate how multi-stakeholder collaboration can help sustain adaptive watershed programs to improve socio-ecological function in agricultural watersheds such as the Boone River Watershed.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2017	60	4					574	587		10.1007/s00267-017-0905-5								WOS:000410806800002	28664235

Cully			Invertebrate-Based Water Quality Impairments and Associated Stressors Identified through the US Clean Water Act	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Macroinvertebrate community assessment is used in most US states to evaluate stream health under the Clean Water Act. While water quality assessment and impairment determinations are reported to the US Environmental Protection Agency, there is no national summary of biological assessment findings. The objective of this work was to determine the national extent of invertebrate-based impairments and to identify pollutants primarily responsible for those impairments. Evaluation of state data in the US Environmental Protection Agency's Assessment and Total Maximum Daily Load Tracking and Implementation System database revealed considerable differences in reporting approaches and terminologies including differences in if and how states report specific biological assessment findings. Only 15% of waters impaired for aquatic life could be identified as having impairments determined by biological assessments (e.g., invertebrates, fish, periphyton); approximately one-third of these were associated with macroinvertebrate bioassessment. Nearly 650 invertebrate-impaired waters were identified nationwide, and sediment was the most common pollutant in bedded (63%) and suspended (9%) forms. This finding is not unexpected, given previous work on the negative impacts of sediment on aquatic life, and highlights the need to more specifically identify the mechanisms driving sediment impairments in order to design effective remediation plans. It also reinforces the importance of efforts to derive sediment-specific biological indices and numerical sediment quality guidelines. Standardization of state reporting approaches and terminology would significantly increase the potential application of water quality assessment data, reveal national trends, and encourage sharing of best practices to facilitate the attainment of water quality goals.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				OCT	2017	60	4					598	614		10.1007/s00267-017-0907-3								WOS:000410806800004	28667407

Influence of grinding media and water quality on flotation performance of gold bearing pyrite	MINERALS ENGINEERING												Flotation performance is strongly dependent on the surface properties of the constituent mineral particles, and may therefore serve as a diagnostic tool to evaluate grinding chemistry interactions. The surface properties can be altered by numerous factors such as the type of grinding media used in the preparation of the flotation feed, the presence of chemical species in the process water, and the characteristics of flotation reagents added. This paper investigates the influence of grinding media (forged steel, 18% chromium and ceramic) and water quality (tap water and synthetic process water) on floatability of gold bearing pyrite using XPS and EDTA extraction technique. The grinding of pyrite ore was performed in a Magotteaux Mill which allowed better simulation of plant chemical conditions by controlling pH and pulp potential during the grinding. Cupric ions were added as an activator prior to the grinding. This work demonstrated that there is no significant effect of water quality on flotation performance of pyrite. The results also showed that the pyrite recovery was slightly higher when the grinding was performed with the forged steel media rather than with the chromium media or the ceramic media. XPS and EDTA extraction technique demonstrated that the forged steel media produced more iron hydroxide species than the 18% chromium or the ceramic media, indicating the high corrosion rate of the forged media. XPS technique failed to explain the influence of different grinding media on the floatability of pyrite from its ore probably due to the insensitivity of XPS technique to detect the presence of a low amount of copper species on the surface of the particles collected by flotation. The results obtained from this study confirmed that the selection of grinding media may be important to maximize pyrite recovery by flotation. The conclusions should be limited to ores low (< 2%) in pyrite content, and where there are no reactive sulfides present other than pyrite. From an economic perspective, the marginal impacts on flotation should be balanced against grinding media wear.																	0892-6875					OCT	2017	112						68	76		10.1016/j.mineng.2017.07.010								WOS:000410868200009

A completely randomized experimental design was used in a 2x3 factorial arrangement, with two carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratios (10:1 and 20:1) and three carbon sources (sugar, molasses and cassava starch). The C: N ratio and carbon source affected the variables alkalinity, settleable solids (SS), turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS), showing significantly higher values at C: N ratio of 20: 1 (P < 0.05). The best carbon source for microbial floc formation were the molasses and sugar, under C: N ratios of 10:1 and 20:1. The stability of the monitored water quality parameters occurred from 6 to 7 weeks of rearing. The growth performance of Nile tilapia in BFT system fertilized with different organic carbon sources was not significantly different (P < 0.05) between treatments. The use of molasses to fertilize BFT systems can reduce costs of production in regions where this product is available.																	0100-316X	1983-2125				OCT-DEC	2017	30	4					1017	1027		10.1590/1983-21252017v30n423rc								WOS:000410636300023

The main goal of this study was to assess the contamination levels of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb, Zn) in surface sediments and red mullet (Mullus barbatus) of the BIB and AB and to examine the possibility of the use of their enrichment factors (EFs) to track down the sources of metals (natural processes or human activity). The geoaccumulation index (I (geo)) was calculated as a criterion to indicate the contamination level for each heavy metal. Moreover, geographical information systems based on spatial analysis methods (inverse distance weighting (IDW)) and statistical approaches (the principal component (PCA)) were performed to assess the spatial influences of multiple anthropogenic sources in different sampled areas. The results of both EF and I (geo) revealed that the study area is exposed to various anthropogenic activities. The pollution load index (PLI) values of sediment samples in the different sites of Algiers and BIB ranged from 0.2 to 3.4 illustrating highly contaminated sediments. Significant bioaccumulation of Cd, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn (bioaccumulation factor > 100%) were observed in muscle and liver of red mullet, suggesting potential health risks through consuming this fish species.																	1420-2026	1573-2967				OCT	2017	22	5					473	490		10.1007/s10666-017-9550-x								WOS:000410832200006

Hydroperiod, inundation length, has been well studied in these systems that cycle between aquatic and terrestrial phases, but species' responses to other ecological processes are still poorly known. For example, temporal (plant thatch from the previous terrestrial phase) and spatial (nutrient runoff) factors may have strong effects on emergence and population densities during the aquatic phase. We examined the effects of hydroperiod stability, thatch, and nutrients on the emergence and density of 4 vernal pool endemic species: Branchinecta lynchi (Anostraca), Linderiella occidentalis (Anostraca), Lepidurus packardi (Notostraca), and Cyzicus californicus (Spinicaudata). A full factorial mesocosm experiment was conducted which measured species densities, along with water quality variables. Hydroperiod and thatch differentially affected 3 of the 4 species based on emergence timing and life cycle. Treatments had effects on many water quality variables, and these variables were correlated with densities. These results highlight how hydroperiod stability along with other processes can affect large branchiopod species in temporary freshwater ecosystems. California vernal pools are a greatly reduced habitat rich in endemic and endangered species (including Branchinecta lynchi and Lepidurus packardi), and therefore, these results have implications for conservation and management.

Waste water management and water quality of river Yamuna in the megacity of Delhi	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The present study aims at assessing water quality of river Yamuna in one of the world's most polluted and populated megacities, Delhi. Conductivity, salinity and sodium content were within the permissible categories. Chloride concentration exceeded acceptable levels of drinking water guidelines. Water quality was poor at all locations with respect to heavy metal contamination, especially along the lower section of the Delhi stretch. Heavy metal concentrations were manifold higher than the acceptable limits of drinking water according to the BIS guidelines and reached similar to 29, 4.9, 10, 31, 27, 83, 7.3 and 27 times higher, respectively, for metals aluminum, copper, chromium, cadmium, iron, lead, manganese and nickel. The Najafgarh and the Shahdara drains are major point sources. Low oxidation-reduction potential reflected high organic loads and traces of eutrophication together with significant levels of nitrate and total phosphate. Discharges from agriculture, sewage and power plants could be important sources of high metal concentration. This calls for urgent measures to be taken for prevention of metal contamination in the river, through both, technology as well as implementation of regulations in order to sustain huge populations in megacities like Delhi. Waste water treatment from point sources needs tremendous improvement on the city. Treatment of the entire waste generated up to the tertiary level is required for minimizing dissolved solids, especially toxic metals, and rendering reuse in agriculture suitable. Treatment plants need proper operation, maintenance, uninterrupted power supply and regular monitoring. Various measure and programmes need to be undertaken to ensure safe reuse of wastewater.																	1735-1472	1735-2630				OCT	2017	14	10					2109	2124		10.1007/s13762-017-1280-8								WOS:000410751800005

Mercury Uptake by Eastern Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) in Oyster Restoration Project of the New York Harbor	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The Billion Oyster Project is a New York City-wide effort to reintroduce eastern oysters back into the New York Harbor and help improve water quality by reducing heavy metal concentrations in the environment. In particular, the bioaccumulation of mercury in oyster tissue was investigated in the New York Harbor oysters acquired from two sites. Mercury levels exceed the standard Environmental Protection Agency-recommended levels as the New York Harbor oysters exhibit mercury levels ranging from 0.36 +/- 0.05 to 0.55 +/- 0.08 mu g Hg g(-1) dry weight. In an ideal scenario, one billion of these oysters are roughly projected to capture a maximum of 110 g of mercury from the New York Harbor by 2030, assuming an average uptake of 0.55 mu g Hg g(-1) dry weight for every oyster added to the reef. In addition to the bioaccumulation of mercury within the oyster tissue, stunted physical growth of the oysters and abnormal discoloration of the tissue indicate the presence of other heavy metals. This study demonstrates the promising role that eastern oysters play in removing heavy metals, such as mercury, from their water environment and preview significant and measurable impacts on the ecosystem.

The results showed that although the water column was typically net heterotrophic, the ecosystem as a whole displayed autotrophic characteristics. The mean net community production from the seagrass meadows was 99.31 +/- 45.13 mM C m(-2) d(-1), while the P/R ratio varied between 1.49 and 1.56. Oxygen produced through in situ photosynthesis, exhibited higher dependence over dissolved CO2 and available light. Apportionment of carbon stores in biomass indicated that nearly three-fourths were available belowground compared to aboveground. However, the sediment horizon accumulated nearly 40 times more carbon than live biomass. The carbon storage capacities of the sediments and seagrass biomass were comparable with the global mean for seagrass meadows. The results of this study highlight the major role of seagrass meadows in modification of seawater chemistry. Though the seagrass meadows of Palk Bay are increasingly subject to human impacts, with coupled regulatory and management efforts focused on improved water quality and habitat conservation, these key coastal ecosystems will continue to be valuable for climate change mitigation, considering their vital role in C dynamics and interactions with the overlying water column.

Comparison of EMA-, PMA- and DNase qPCR for the determination of microbial cell viability	APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												Ethidium monoazide (EMA) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), propidium monoazide (PMA)-qPCR and DNase treatment in combination with qPCR were compared for the determination of microbial cell viability. Additionally, varying EMA and PMA concentrations were analysed to determine which dye and concentration allowed for the optimal identification of viable cells. Viable, heat treated (70 degrees C for 15 min) and autoclaved cultures of Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were utilised in the respective viability assays. Analysis of the viable and heat-treated samples indicated that variable log reductions were recorded for both EMA [log reductions ranging from 0.01 to 2.71 (viable) and 0.27 to 2.85 (heat treated)], PMA [log reductions ranging from 0.06 to 1.02 (viable) and 0.62 to 2.46 (heat treated)] and DNase treatment [log reductions ranging from 0.06 to 0.82 (viable) and 0.70 to 2.91 (heat treated)], in comparison to the no viability treatment controls. Based on the results obtained, 6 mu M EMA and 50 mu M PMA were identified as the optimal dye concentrations as low log reductions were recorded (viable and heat-treated samples) in comparison to the no viability treatment control. In addition, the results recorded for the 6 mu M EMA concentration were comparable to the results obtained for both the 50 mu M PMA and the DNase treatment. The use of EMA-qPCR (6 mu M) may therefore allow for the rapid identification and quantification of multiple intact opportunistic pathogens in water sources, which would benefit routine water quality monitoring following disinfection treatment.

The organic matter (OM) composition is known to significantly influence biofilm formation, but few studies on this subject have been reported. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) allows direct monitoring of biofilm development on the membrane surface without the need for membrane autopsy. The purposes of the present study are 1) to quantify biofouling formation on a membrane surface using OCT; 2) to monitor the temporal variation of OM composition during membrane formation; and 3) to investigate the variation of OM composition. Substantial variations in thickness was observed from OCT images. It demonstrates that biovolume quantified from a single 2D cross-sectional image could result in inaccurate quantification. Here, we quantified foulants on the membrane surface using 3D images and validated the results using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). As well, variations in the OM composition driven by bacterial activity were observed by fluorescence excitation emission matrix analysis and size exclusion chromatography. The biovolume estimated by the OCT system was 103.7 mu m(3)/mu m(2). CLSM demonstrated that 10% of the foulants on the membrane surface was composed of live and dead bacteria.																	0011-9164	1873-4464				OCT 1	2017	419						125	132		10.1016/j.desal.2017.06.002								WOS:000410017800013						
J	Ji, XL; Xie, RT; Hao, Y; Lu, J				Ji, Xiaoliang; Xie, Runting; Hao, Yun; Lu, Jun			Quantitative identification of nitrate pollution sources and uncertainty analysis based on dual isotope approach in an agricultural watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Quantitative identification of nitrate (NO3--N) sources is critical to the control of nonpoint source nitrogen pollution in an agricultural watershed. Combined with water quality monitoring, we adopted the environmental isotope (delta D-H2O, delta O-18-H2O, delta N-18-NO3-, and delta O-18-NO3-) analysis and the Markov Chain Monte 'Carlo (MCMC) mixing model to determine the proportions of riverine NO3--N inputs from four potential NOT-N sources, namely, atmospheric deposition (AD), chemical nitrogen fertilizer (NF), soil nitrogen (SN), and manure and sewage (M&S), in the ChangLe River watershed of eastern China. Results showed that NO3--N was the main form of nitrogen in this watershed, accounting for approximately 74% of the total nitrogen concentration. A strong hydraulic interaction existed between the surface and groundwater for NO3--N pollution. The variations of the isotopic composition in NO3--N suggested that microbial nitrification was the dominant nitrogen transformation process in surface water, whereas significant denitrification was observed in groundwater. MCMC mixing model outputs revealed that M&S was the predominant contributor to riverine NO3--N pollution (contributing 41.8% on average), followed by SN (34.0%), NF (21.9%), and AD (2.3%) sources. Finally, we constructed an uncertainty index, UI90, to quantitatively characterize the uncertainties inherent in NO3--N source apportionment and discussed the reasons behind the uncertainties.

The response of soil and stream chemistry to decreases in acid deposition in the Catskill Mountains, New York, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The Catskill Mountains have been adversely impacted by decades of acid deposition, however, since the early 1990s, levels have decreased sharply as a result of decreases in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. This study examines trends in acid deposition, stream-water chemistry, and soil chemistry in the southeastern Catskill Mountains. We measured significant reductions in acid deposition and improvement in stream-water quality in 5 streams included in this study from 1992 to 2014. The largest, most significant trends were for sulfate (SO42-) concentrations (mean trend of -2.5 mu eq L-1 yr(-1)); hydrogen ion (H+) and inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al-im) also decreased significantly (mean trends of -0.3 mu eg L-1 yr(-1) for H+ and -0.1 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) for Al-im for the 3 most acidic sites). Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) increased by a mean of 0.65 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) for all 5 sites, which was 4 fold less than the decrease in SO42- concentrations. These upward trends in ANC were limited by coincident decreases in base cations (-1.3 mu eq L-1 yr(-1) for calcium + magnesium). No significant trends were detected in stream-water nitrate (NO3-) concentrations despite significant decreasing trends in NO3- wet deposition. We measured no recovery in soil chemistry which we attributed to an initially low soil buffering capacity that has been further depleted by decades of acid deposition. Tightly coupled decreasing trends in stream-water silicon (Si) (-0.2 NO3-) and base cations suggest a decrease in the soil mineral weathering rate. We hypothesize that a decrease in the ionic strength of soil water and shallow groundwater may be the principal driver of this apparent decrease in the weathering rate. A decreasing weathering rate would help to explain the slow recovery of stream pH and ANC as well as that of soil base cations.

Influence of land use configurations on river sediment pollution	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Land use is an influential factor in river sediment pollution. However, land use type alone is found to be inadequate to explain pollutant contributions to the aquatic environment since configurations within the same land use type such as land cover and development layout could also exert an important influence. Consequently, this paper discusses a research study, which consisted of an in-depth investigation into the relationship between land use type and river sediment pollution by introducing robust parameters that represent configurations within the primary land use types. Urban water pollutants, namely, nutrients, total carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and metals were investigated in the study. The outcomes show that higher patch density and more diverse land use development forms contribute relatively greater pollutant loads to receiving waters and consequently leading to higher sediment pollution. The study outcomes are expected to contribute essential knowledge for creating robust management strategies to minimise waterway pollution and thereby protect the health of aquatic ecosystems.

ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Soil heavy metal contents were measured in newly submerged areas of the Danjiangkou Reservoir, China. We aimed to determine the heavy metal distribution in this area and the associated ecological risk. Most of these heavy metal contents (except Pb and Mn) suggest enrichment compared with the background values of soils from Henan Province, especially As and Cd with mean geo-accumulation index (I-geo) values of 0.84 and 0.54. The spatial analysis results indicated that the highest heavy metal contents were distributed in the arable soils above 160 m elevation, whereas low heavy metal contents were observed under other land-use types above 160 m elevation. According to I-geo and EF values, Cd was the major heavy metal contaminant in the newly submerged area, Cr, Pb and Mn mainly originated from natural geochemical sources. In contrast, Ni, Cd, As, Cu, and Zn mainly originated from anthropogenic sources. Evaluation using the potential ecological risk (PER) method indicated that PER of individual elements were low in the studied soils, and the comprehensive PER index was at a moderate level, indicating heavy metals in the soils of newly submerged areas may not threaten the water quality of Danjiangkou Reservoir, especially in winter.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				OCT	2017	144						380	386		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.06.050								WOS:000408520100046	28647605

But water quality criterias (WQCs) of PPCPs for protecting aquatic environment are lacking, which hinders the environmental management of these emerging contaminants. In the present study, in order to support their WQC derivation, acute and chronic hazardous concentrations for 5% of species (HC(5)s) of some frequently detected PPCPs in China were calculated based on acute and chronic species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), respectively, using both parametric (log-normal and log-logistic) and nonparametric bootstrap approaches. The groups of aquatic species used in SSDs included planktons, zooplanktons, invertebrates and vertebrates. Acute and chronic predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived from the HC(5)s. The acute PNECs of the selected PPCPs were in a range from 1.1 to 4993 mu g/L. While the chronic PNECs were one or two orders of magnitude lower than the acute PNECs, with a range from 0.02 to 298 mu g/L. Among these PPCPs, the compound with the highest acute effect on the aquatic environment was clarithromycin while erythromycin was the one with the highest chronic toxicity effect. Among the studied PPCPs, erythromycin caused a relatively higher aquatic ecological risk in China. This study helps derive WQCs of PPCPs in the aquatic environment, which is essential for environmental managment of these emerging contaminants.

AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												The Mekong Delta is the most important rice- and shrimp-producing region for food and economic security in Vietnam. Rice-shrimp farming is practised where salinity fluctuates substantially between wet and dry seasons. Research points to several potential risk factors for rotational systems, but how these link directly to both rice and shrimp production remains poorly quantified for systems that stock and harvest animals year-round. We examined water and soil quality of 18 rice-shrimp-crab ponds, in which shrimp and crab are grown in both wet and dry seasons, in the Ca Mau Province of Vietnam. Multiple lines of evidence indicated that environmental conditions experienced by both rice and shrimp were suboptimal and contributed to low yields and survival. Year-round cropping of shrimp and crab was associated with sustained suboptimal salinity, intensified by drought, for the wet-season cultivation of rice. Although rice seedlings were sown in all 18 ponds, only three had a harvestable crop. Low shrimp production and survival was associated with sustained suboptimal water temperatures (too high), salinity (too high in the dry season and too low in the wet season) and dissolved oxygen concentrations (too low). Food availability and quality may also have affected shrimp production. Improving productivity of rice-shrimp-crab ponds in the study region may require (1) separation of rice and shrimp crops and improving efficiency of soil washing practices such that salinity conditions are more suitable for each when grown, and (2) management intervention to increase oxygenation of water, and the availability and quality of food for shrimp.

After acclimation, fish were placed in plastic bags and transported for 8hr on paved road at densities of 28, 45 and 64g/L. Water quality was monitored before and after transport. Blood was collected before, upon arrival (0hr), after 2 and 24hr of transport. Plasma cortisol, blood glucose, partial pressures of O-2 (pO(2)) and CO2 (pCO(2)), blood pH and HCO3- were evaluated. Blood smears were prepared for the verification of leucocyte profile and neutrophils:lymphocyte ratio (N:L). Blood pCO(2), pH and HCO3- increased significantly after transport for all treatments compared with pre-transport. Glucose levels increased at the higher density whereas no effects were observed on plasma cortisol and pO(2) levels. Upon arrival, all treatments showed lymphopenia and neutrophilia which increased N:L ratio. Although lymphopenia was observed in higher densities until 2hr after transport, haematological parameters were fully restored within 24hr post transport. Furthermore, no mortalities were observed throughout the experimental period. Based on the transient physiological changes observed in this study, juvenile dusky grouper can be safely transported in plastic bags for 8hr at a density of up to 64g/L.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				OCT	2017	48	10					5356	5362		10.1111/are.13349								WOS:000409471300018						
J	Michaletz, PH				Michaletz, P. H.			Variation in characteristics among gizzard shad populations: The role of impoundment size and productivity	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Population characteristics of gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum (Lesueur), an ecologically important fish species in Midwestern and southern USA impoundments, vary widely among water bodies. Impoundment productivity is known to influence population variables (e.g., recruitment, growth, mortality, size and age composition), but the role of impoundment morphometry (e.g., surface area, depth) is unknown. Differences in population characteristics of gizzard shad were compared between large and small impoundments across an impoundment-productivity gradient (indexed by total phosphorus [TP] concentration). Populations shifted from those comprised mostly of low abundances (indexed by catch per unit effort [CPUE], fish/hr of electric fishing) of long-lived, large adults to those comprised of high abundances of short-lived, small adults as TP increased. However, the trends in population variables across the TP gradient were less apparent in small impoundments than in large impoundments owing to considerable variation at a given TP level. Further analysis revealed that CPUE of gizzard shad was lowest in the smallest impoundments (<33ha surface area) regardless of TP concentrations, probably because of more frequent winter kills. Overall, population characteristics were influenced by both density-dependent effects and impoundment characteristics.

Trace element concentrations in the groundwater of the Tamiraparani river basin, South India: Insights from human health risk and multivariate statistical techniques	CHEMOSPHERE					18th International Conference on Heavy Metals in the Environment (ICHMET)	SEP 12-15, 2016	Ghent Univ, Ghent, BELGIUM		Ghent Univ			This study investigates the concentration of trace elements in the groundwater of Tamiraparani river basin, South India. 124 groundwater samples were collected representing diverse landuse condition over the study area. The results reveal that the mean concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn and Ni were 0.269, 0.02, 0.007, 0.007, 0.003, 0.066, and 0.004 ppm respectively. The decreasing trend of trace element content shows the'following order: Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb. Significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) is found between most of the variables such as water level and Fe, Pb; EC and Ni; Fe and Pb; Mn and Pb; Cu and Zn, Ni; Cr and Pb; Zn and Ni. The studied trace elements are found below the international drinking water guidelines except Fe, Mn, and Pb. The Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK) model is used to interpolate the studied metal concentrations in the groundwater of the study area. A health risk assessment was carried out using exposure dose index (CDI) and hazard quotient (HQ). The CDI values of trace elements for oral and dermal pathways shows the following order of Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb and Fe > Zn > Mn > Cr > Cu > Ni > Pb respectively. The Hazard quotients suggest that the risk of contamination through oral and dermal pathways is feeble as all the elements show values less than one. The multivariate statistical analysis reveals that the source of trace elements in the groundwater is through natural origin except copper, chromium and lead as these contaminants are derived from anthropogenic activities.

In the open ocean, algorithms can accurately estimate the surface POC concentration. However, no suitable POC-estimation algorithm based on MERIS bands is available for inland turbid eutrophic water. A total of 228 field samples were collected from Lake Taihu in different seasons between 2013 and 2015. At each site, the optical parameters and water quality were analyzed. Using in situ data, it was found that POC-estimation algorithms developed for the open ocean and coastal waters using remote sensing reflectance were not suitable for inland turbid eutrophic water. The organic suspended matter (OSM) concentration was found to be the best indicator of the POC concentration, and POC has an exponential relationship with the OSM concentration. Through an analysis of the POC concentration and optical parameters, it was found that the absorption peak of total suspended matter (TSM) at 665 nm was the optimum parameter to estimate POC. As a result, MERIS band 7, MERIS band 10 and MERIS band 12 were used to derive the absorption coefficient of TSM at 665 nm, and then, a semi-analytical algorithm was used to estimate the POC concentration for inland turbid eutrophic water. An accuracy assessment showed that the developed semi-analytical algorithm could be successfully applied with a MAPE of 31.82% and RMSE of 2.68 mg/L. The developed algorithm was successfully applied to a MERIS image, and two full-resolution MERIS images, acquired on August 13, 2010, and December 7, 2010, were used to map the POC spatial distribution in Lake Taihu in summer and winter.																	0303-2434					OCT	2017	62						69	77		10.1016/j.jag.2017.06.001								WOS:000408787100007

The auxiliary data (in-situ observations of the optical properties and water quality, buoy measurements of hydrodynamic data and water chemical parameters) were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variations in DOC. GOCI was. shown to be capable of successfully obtaining hourly variations in DOC, with a root mean square error percentage (RMSP) of 17.29% (RMSE = 0.69 mg/L) for the match-up data. The GOCI-derived DOC in Lake Taihu confirms that the highest DOC concentration is in northwest Lake Taihu, followed by Meiliang Bay, Gonghu Bay and northeast Lake Taihu. Hourly DOC variation is significant and presents a different trend for each lake segment due to the variety of influencing factors. Discharge of DOC from surrounding rivers is an important factor to the variation of DOC in northeast Lake Taihu. However, organic products of algae will be the primary contributor to DOC when algal bloom occurred. During the period of algal bloom, high DOC levels in Lake Taihu can lead to hypoxia when coupled with high temperatures and low disturbance.

J	Mullick, A; Neogi, S				Mullick, Aditi; Neogi, Sudarsan			A review on acoustic methods of algal growth control by ultrasonication through existing and novel emerging technologies	REVIEWS IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												The uncontrolled proliferation of algae and algal blooms due to excessive nutrient loading in natural and industrial water bodies is a major issue for water quality maintenance. It reduces usability of the water, imposes hazardous effects of algal toxins released from algal blooms, and creates nuisance in the operation of several industrial water units. Among several existing water treatment methods to diminish the post-algae growth effects, ultrasonication has emerged as an environmentally safe technology that does not involve any use of algaecide. The interaction of several parameters, including climatic and environmental conditions with algae growth rate, have been reviewed in this article. The effects of different acoustic operating conditions for inhibition of algae growth have also been discussed. Concern about high energy consumption led other technologies to be integrated with ultrasonication. It has enhanced the process efficiency and reduced the energy consumption as reported in some long-term field investigations and patent proposals. Several issues that require further research for making this technology widely applicable or to install an effective system design have been highlighted in this article.																	0167-8299	2191-0235				OCT	2017	33	5					469	490		10.1515/revce-2016-0010								WOS:000408795600002

Oude			Fast calculation of groundwater exfiltration salinity in a lowland catchment using a lumped celerity/velocity approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												To support operational water management of freshwater resources in coastal lowlands, a need exists for a rapid, well-identifiable model to simulate salinity dynamics of exfiltrating groundwater. This paper presents the lumped Rapid Saline Groundwater Exfiltration Model (RSGEM). RSGEM simulates groundwater exfiltration salinity dynamics as governed by the interplay between water velocity, gradually adjusting the subsurface salinity distribution, and pressure wave celerity, resulting in a fast flow path response to groundwater level changes. RSGEM was applied to a field site in the coastal region of the Netherlands, parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis were performed using generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation. The model showed good correspondence to measured groundwater levels, exfiltration rates and salinity response. Moreover, RSGEM results were very similar to a detailed, complex groundwater flow and transport model previously applied to this field site. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Nitrogen budget in integrated aquaculture systems with Nile tilapia and Amazon River prawn	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL												The present work aims to describe the nitrogen (N) budget in integrated aquaculture systems with Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Amazon River prawn (Macrobrachium amazonicum) in earthen ponds, with and without the addition of different substrates. The experimental design was completely randomized, with three treatments (without a substrate, with a geotextile fabric substrate, and with a bamboo substrate) and four replications. Diet was the major input of N in the systems, ranging from similar to 65 to 71% and followed by inlet water (similar to 26-31%). The portion retained in reared animals and periphyton ranged from similar to 21 to 25% (being similar to 21-24% in fish and prawns). The outputs that contributed most to the accumulation and release of N were, respectively, sediment (similar to 24-38%) and N2 (similar to 30-36%) emitted to the atmosphere. The addition of substrates did not improve the accumulation of nitrogen in the biomass of the target species. This suggests that the periphyton had a minor role on feed availability. In general, the systems were not efficient in using nitrogen since only similar to 22% of all available nitrogen was retained into prawn and tilapia biomass. On the other hand, the emission of N-2 (an inert gas) to the atmosphere almost compensated the nitrogen supplied in the diet that was not assimilated by the reared animals and periphyton. In addition, data suggest that the integrated aquaculture in stagnant ponds may sequester substantial amounts of nitrogen from nutrient-rich aquatic environments and could be used as a mitigation tool.

Immobilized enzymes are stable, recoverable and reusable in industrial processes. In this scenario G. lucidum IBL-05 LiP was entrapped in Ca-alginate beads using optimum concentrations of Na-alginate (4%), calcium chloride (0.2 M) and glutraldehyde (0.02%). Optimum pH (pH 5) and temperature (55 degrees C) for entrapped LiP were improved as compared to free LiP. Catalytic behavior of LiP also significantly enhanced, as K-m value (0.25 mM) decreased and V-max value (868.6 mu mol/min) increased after ca-alginate entrapment of LiP. Decolorization efficiencies of Sandal reactive dyes after treating with immobilized LiP were in the range of 80-93%. A significant reduction was observed in water quality parameters including, BOD (66.44-98.22%), COD (81.34-98.82%) and TOC (80.21-97.77%) values. The cytotoxicity values for heamolytic and brine shrimp lethality of dye solutions treated with Ca-alginate immobilized LiP reduced up to 2.10-5.06% and 5.43-9.23%, respectively. On the basis of reduced toxicity and cytotoxicity values, it was concluded that Ca-alginate beads entrapped LiP may be an effective biocatalyst for bioremediation of dye based textile industry effluents.

The experiment was performed for 120 days in 0.66 ha pond with and without addition of substrate i.e. treatment (periphyton based) and control pond (feed based), respectively having a stocking density of 20 m(-2) (PL 15). The significant (P < 0.05) reduction in concentration of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite-N, and biological oxygen demand (BOD) were found in substrate treated pond when compared with the control. About 39 genera of phytoplankton belonging to Bacillariophyceae (14 genera), Chlorophyceae (12 genera), Cyanophyceae (10 genera) and Euglenophyceae (3 genera) were found adhered on aquamat. Significant (P < 0.05) improvement in the growth parameters of L. vannamei and feed utilization (FCR = 1.02) were recorded in the substrate treated pond when compared to control (FCR = 1.31). At the end of the experiment, a significant reduction (12%) in the concentration of nitrogen present in the effluents (output water) was estimated in substrate treated pond. Significantly low level of nitrogen content was estimated in the sediment of substrate treated pond when compared with the control. Nitrogenous waste generated for producing one ton of shrimp, got reduced by 25% in the periphyton based aquaculture pond. Moreover, a significantly (P < 0.05) low total Vibrios counts (1.14 x 10(3) CFU mL(-1)) were enumerated when compared with the control pond (1.53 x 10(3) CFU mL(-1)) and ratio of total Vibrios counts (TVC) to total heterotrophic bacteria (THB) in the water of substrate treated pond and control was found to be 10.56 and 28.39, respectively. Higher survival rate (93%) of L. vannamei was recorded in the substrate treated pond in comparison to the control (84.4%). In general, addition of substrate to obtain periphyton significantly reduced nitrogenous waste in the effluent, by converting it into heterotrophic bacterial and algal biomass, improved the culture water quality and growth parameters and survival of the shrimp in comparison to the normal feed based aquaculture system.

Seaweeds were cultivated for 35 days in sterilized seawater enriched with 50% von Stosch solution (VS - v/v), 25% BFT effluent (BFT - v/v), or pulse-fed AMPEP (at 0.1 g L-1 for 30 min), and combinations of VS and AMPEP (VS + AMPEP) and BFT and AMPEP (BFT + AMPEP). As control, seedlings cultivated in sterilized seawater were used. K. alvarezii from VS and BFT showed significant higher growth rates, i.e., 1.70 +/- 0.14% day(-1) and 1.56 +/- 0.08% day(-1), respectively, while control (0.51 +/- 0.05% day(-1)) and AMPEP (0.57% +/- 0.07% day(-1)) showed lower growth rates. However, in all treatments, "ice-ice" disease was observed in some parts of the thalli. Total phenolic content (92.2 +/- 22.4 mu g g(-1)) and flavonoids (18.8 +/- 0.6 mu g g(-1)) were higher in BFT, and seedlings cultivated in BFT + AMPEP showed higher carotenoid content (239.3 +/- 9.3 mu g g(-1)). Higher DPPH radical inhibition was observed in VS (13.4 +/- 1.5%) and VS + AMPEP (13.4 +/- 0.6%). Results showed that all treatments affected K. alvarezii growth and secondary metabolism, particularly BFT, which could be consider as a good fertilizer of this species improving also the add-value, because of the increase of phenolics, flavonoids and carotenoids. Statement of relevance: This work presents the potential use of effluents from shrimp cultivation as fertilizers of the Kappaphycus alvarezii, improving the growth and the bioactive compounds production.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				OCT 1	2017	479						297	303		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.06.005								WOS:000408034700037

Use of environmental DNA (eDNA) and water quality data to predict protozoan parasites outbreaks in fish farms	AQUACULTURE												Globally, disease accounts for around 40% of lost aquaculture production. Commonly, disease occurs due to an inability of farm managers to accurately quantify disease risk due to the abundance of the pathogenic agent in their production systems, along with a poor understanding of how outbreaks are linked to changes in water quality parameters. Environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling methodology associated with molecular techniques is suited to rapidly assess the background presence of pathogens in fish farms, thereby providing managers with critical information that can be used to mitigate disease threats. Adopting the ciliate protozoan Chilodonella hexasticha as a model, this study examined the relationship between environmental DNA of C. hexasticha, critical water parameters and the occurrence of disease outbreaks on a commercial barramundi Lates calcarifer farm, where water was sampled monthly over a 1 year timeframe. A qPCR assay based on the small subunit ribosomal DNA gene was used to monitor the abundance of C. hexasticha in pond water (SSU-rDNA copies/mu L). Increased C. hexasticha eDNA levels were found to be highly correlated with occurrence of later fish mortality events (r = 0.402; P < 0.001) and also with size of fish (r = - 0.189; P < 0.05); smaller fish were more prone to being impacted by an epizootic of the parasite. However, no correlations were found between any of the water quality parameters measured (rainfall, water temperature and dissolved oxygen) and abundance of this parasite, although there were significantly more fish mortalities observed during the warmer, wetter monsoonal season compared to the cooler, dry season (1280 vs. 135 mortalities, respectively; P < 0.05). This study highlights the potential of an eDNA approach as a management tool to quickly assess parasite loads in water and minimise the risk of disease outbreaks in aquaculture systems.

Influence of stocking density and exposure to white spot syndrome virus in biological performance, metabolic, immune, and bioenergetics response of whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei	AQUACULTURE												The risk of disease in shrimp farming has been suggested to increase with stocking density, although it is not clear if this is related to an increased susceptibility to pathogens based on poor physiological condition or a lower capacity of immune response. This study analyzed the influence of stocking density on the metabolic and immune response to exposure to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) on whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Juvenile shrimp were submitted to two stocking densities (20 and 100 shrimp m(2)) for eight weeks; water quality, growth, and survival were recorded. Then, some shrimp were sampled for determining biochemical composition, adenylic nucleotides, arginine phosphate (Arg-P), total hemocyte count (THC), and clotting time to determine baseline values. Other shrimp were challenged with WSSV for 24 h and then analyzed for the same variables. Concentration of nitrogenous compounds and phosphorus were significantly higher in tanks with the higher shrimp density. Growth and survival were significantly lower by 42% and 18%, respectively, under high density conditions. No outstanding effect of stocking density on biochemical and immunological variables were observed, except for higher levels of hemocyanin in hemolymph and lactate in muscle in shrimp under low density conditions. In contrast, the WSSV challenge induced several metabolic disruptions, including a higher adenylic energy charge (AEC) in the hepatopancreas and higher content of Arg-P in muscle, higher content of triglycerides in hemolymph, hepatopancreas, and muscle, and higher content of glucose, protein, hemocyanin, and cholesterol in hemolymph. These responses correspond an increased energy demand caused by exposure to virus and/or a phase of metabolic depression. Conditions of high stocking apparently do not increase the susceptibility of shrimp to WSSV since no differences were observed in the severity of infection and THC. However clotting time, glucose, lactate and triglycerides were more importantly affected by WSSV in shrimp coming from the high density condition, suggesting a "dual stress" effect that could in turn affect susceptibility to pathogens.

Considering the potential of these systems for the production of tilapia, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different moments of the transfer of Nile tilapia fingerlings to the biofloc system. For this study, 1400 Nile tilapia fingerlings weighing 1.40 +/- 0.04 g were distributed into 20 rectangular 150 L tanks in a completely randomized design with five treatments (Control - clear water, T1 - transition on day 1, T2 - transition on day 15, T3 - transition on day 30, and T4 transition on day 45) and four replications. The study lasted 76 days, and the animals remained under the same control conditions until the time of transition into the biofloc system. The data obtained were subjected to analysis of variance, and the means were compared with the Student-Newman- Keuls test (p < 0.05). The average data of final weight (46.16 g), daily weight gain (0.59 g) and feed conversion rate (1.08) did not differ (p > 0.05) between treatments. The final density was higher in the control treatment (17.44 kg m(-3)). The densities in the T1, T2, T3 and T4 treatments were 10.20, 12.47, 12.68 and 11.49 kg m(-3), respectively. Survival did not differ according to the Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05); however, the body composition was affected by the biofloc system, with a greater deposition of lipids in T1. The water quality parameters varied over time, with N-NO2- peaks in the treatments transitioned to the biofloc system regardless of the time of transition. The results suggest that Nile tilapia fingerlings should be transitioned to the biofloc system at a weight of 1.4 g and that they do not require prior cultivation in another type of system. Statement of relevance: Considering the potential of biofloc systems for the production of tilapia, this study evaluated the effect of different transition times of juvenile Nile tilapia (O. niloticus) to this systems showing that this species did not require prior cultivation in another type of system after masculinization.

In this study, we investigated the use of poly-beta-hydroxybutyric (PHB) and polycaprolactone (PCL) as carbon sources to support a limited discharge tilapia aquaculture system conveniently. The water was not changed for 120 days. No significant differences in the final biomass were observed between the PHB group (37.93 +/- 8.87 kg m(-3)) and the PCL group (34.29 +/- 9.29 kg m(-3)) or between the PHB group and the group with glucose as an external carbohydrate (44.14 +/- 10.51 kg m(-3)). NH4+-N and nitrite nitrogen (NO2--N) were < 3.0 mg L-1 and 0.8 mg L-1 at steady state, respectively. The assimilation of NH4+-N and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), nitrification and denitrification were observed in the batch tests of the bioflocs taken from the fish tank. No significant differences were detected in the bioflocs' crude protein content (31-39%) between the PCL group and the PHB group or between the PHB group and the glucose group. Microbial analysis, assessed by high-throughput sequencing, revealed that the bacterial community was similar between the three groups. Although not every parameter was better than glucose, PHB or PCL was still considered preferable to glucose because of greater convenience. Collectively, our results showed that both PHB and PCL are favorable and convenient external carbohydrates for biofloc-based tilapia aquaculture systems.																	0044-8486	1873-5622				OCT 1	2017	479						732	741		10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.07.017								WOS:000408034700090

Zoea-2 syndrome of Penaeus vannamei in shrimp hatcheries	AQUACULTURE												Mortalities of Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei during zoea stages were investigated in fifteen Indian shrimp hatcheries located on the east coast of India. Popularly known as zoea-2 syndrome, is characterized by reduction in feeding rate of late zoea 1 and early zoea 2 stage larvae, impairment in metamorphosis followed by high mortalities. Microscopic studies revealed systemic abnormalities in affected larvae and pathological manifestation in hepatopancreas and intestine. Microbiological screening revealed the predominance of Vibrio alginolyticus in majority of the hatcheries (nine) affected by zoea-2 syndrome. Histological examination on the hepatopancreas and intestine revealed vacuolization, sloughing of epithelial cells and disintegration of peritrophic membrane of intestinal epithelium. OIE listed viral pathogens of shrimp were absent in affected larvae as confirmed by OIE polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. Ultrastructural observation of the pathological manifestation in hepatopancreas and intestine could not reveal presence of any pathogens. Data on the water quality parameters were in the normal ranges and did not seem to have any bearing on the outbreak of zoea-2 syndrome in the hatcheries. Feeding schedules (Skeletonema, Chaetoceros, Thalassia) were uniform throughout the larval cycles and found to be not associated with the zoea-2 syndrome. Pathological manifestations of hepatopancreas and intestine indicated impairment of capacity of digestion and absorption resulting in delayed moulting and subsequent death of larvae in a gradual, progressive manner with cumulative mortality reaching of 30-100% at zoea II stage. Continuous stocking of nauplii over three to four days within the same hatchery larval rearing unit was found to exacerbate the incidence in the nine affected hatcheries (OR-48, CI 2.5-932.9). It could be construed from our studies that aetiology of zoea syndrome may not be due to known infectious agents.

Roadside soil, stream sediment and background soil were also studied for comparison. Sequential extractions were carried out, and lead isotopic compositions of each extraction were determined to apportion Pb sources. Besides, particle size distribution of roadside soil, and metal concentrations and Pb isotopes of each size group were determined to characterize metal contamination. In result, Zn and Cu were enriched in sediment through roadside soil. The data on metal partitioning implied that Zn posed potential hazards for water quality. Meanwhile, the noticeable reduction of the Pb-206/(207) Pb isotopic ratio in the acid-soluble fraction in the size group 200 mu m - 2 mm of national roadside soil indicated that this size group was highly contaminated by automotive emission with precipitation of acid-soluble secondary minerals during evaporation. Based on the Pb isotopic ratios, the dry deposition of Asian dust (AD) and non-Asian dust (NAD) affected roadside soil, while the effects of AD and NAD on bottom sediment appeared to be low given the low metal concentrations in sediment. Metal concentrations and Pb isotopic compositions indicated that sediments were a mixture of background and roadside soil. Source apportionment calculations showed that the average proportion of traffic Pb in bottom and stream sediments was respectively 34 and 31% in non residual fractions, and 26 and 28% in residual fraction. The residual fraction of sediments appeared to be as contaminated as the non-residual fractions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Inhibition of phosphorus sorption on calcite by dairy manure-sourced DOC	CHEMOSPHERE												In confined animal feeding operations, such as dairies, manure is amended to soils at high rates leading to increases in P and organic matter in the soils. Phosphorus reacts with soil-Ca to form Ca-P minerals, which controls P availability for leaching and transport through the watershed. In this research, the effects of manure sourced dissolved organic matter (DOM) on P sorption on calcite were measured at different reaction times and concentrations. Reactions were monitored in 1% and 10% manure-to-water extract solutions spiked with P. When manure-DOM was present, a significant reduction in P sorption occurred (2-90% absolute decrease) compared to samples without manure-DOM. The greatest decrease occurred in the samples reacted in the 10% manure solution. XANES spectroscopic analysis showed that at 1% manure solution, a Ca-P phase similar to hydroxyapatite formed. In the calcite samples reacted in the 10% Manure solution, K-edge XANES spectroscopy revealed that P occurred as a Ca-Mg-P phase instead of the less soluble hydroxyapatite-like phase. Results from this study suggest that in manure amended calcareous soils, increased DOM from manure will decrease P sorption capacity and increase the overall P concentration in solution, which will increase the mobility of P and subsequently pose greater risks for impairment of surface water quality.

As yet, water quality criteria with respect to nonylphenol pollution have not been established in China. Here, the predicted "no effect concentration" of nonylphenol was derived from an analysis of species sensitivity distribution covering a range of species mainly native to China, as a means of quantifying the ecological risk of nonylphenol in surface fresh water. The resulting model, based on the log logistic distribution, proved to be robust; the minimum sample sizes required for generating a stable estimate of HC5 were 12 for acute toxicity and 13 for chronic toxicity. The criteria maximum concentration and criteria continuous concentration were, respectively 18.49 mu g L-1 and 1.85 mu g L-1. Among the 24 sites surveyed, two were associated with a high ecological risk (risk quotient > 1) and 12 with a moderate ecological risk (risk quotient > 0.1). The potentially affected fraction ranged from 0.008% to 24.600%. The analysis provides a theoretical basis for both short- and long-term risk assessments with respect to nonylphenol, and also a means to quantify the risk to aquatic ecosystems.

Case study: "Mar Piccolo" Taranto (South Italy)	CHEMOSPHERE												Almost all marine coastal ecosystems possess complex structural and dynamic characteristics, which are influenced by anthropogenic causes and natural processes as well. Revealing the impact of sources and factors controlling the spatial distributions of contaminants within highly polluted areas is a fundamental propaedeutic step of their quality evaluation. Combination of different pattern recognition techniques, applied to one of the most polluted Mediterranean coastal basin, resulted in a more reliable hazard assessment. PCA/CA and factorial ANOVA were exploited as complementary techniques for apprehending the impact of multi-sources and multi-factors acting simultaneously and leading to similarities or differences in the spatial contamination pattern. The combination of PCA/CA and factorial ANOVA allowed, on one hand to determine the main processes and factors controlling the contamination trend within different layers and different basins, and, on the other hand, to ascertain possible synergistic effects. This approach showed the significance of a spatially representative overview given by the combination of PCA-CA/ANOVA in inferring the historical anthropogenic sources loading on the area.

This results in a very heterogeneous pattern of mobility and bioavailability, which is difficult to capture reliably and in a cost effective manner. The diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) technique is a popular analytical tool for testing water quality, primarily because it provides a time integrated measurement. However, to date, the most widely used DGT configuration for oxyanion sampling, the slurry ferrihydrite binding layer (SF-DGT) has only been fully characterized for phosphate. Confirmatory testing of the functional range of ionic strengths, pH, deployment times and ionic competition effects, that the SF-DGT's operates within has not been carried out, but is addressed in this study for V-V, As-V, Sb-V and Mo-Vl. In this study SF-DGT Sb-V measurements functioned over the largest range of conditions (ionic strength, 0.1-500 mM; pH 3.86-9.90), while ionic strengths above 100 and 500 mM were found to be problematic for As-V and Mo-Vl, respectively. Low pH (below 4) caused inferences with V-V, conversely Asv and Mo-VI determination faltered/deviated from predicted responses in pH conditions of similar to 9. SF-DGT measurements adequately predicted up to weeklong averaged in situ metal oxyanion concentrations in a freshwater river. This study concludes that the SF-DGT configuration is highly suitable for pollution monitoring applications in freshwater systems for key oxyanion species. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shomar, B; Hawari, J				Shomar, Basem; Hawari, Jalal			Desalinated drinking water in the GCC countries - The need to address consumer perceptions	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries consist of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. These countries depend mainly on seawater desalination to meet their water needs. Although great emphasis is given to characterize desalinated water for its physicochemical and microbial properties, e.g. presence of metals, other organic contaminants and for bacteria, sensorial characteristics including smell, taste and color have not received the same attention. This is possibly attributed to the fact that inhabitants of GCC States do not use desalinated tap water for drinking consumption, rather they depend on locally produced or imported bottled water where color, taste and odor are not problematic. To address the consumer needs and perceptions of drinking desalinated water in GCC countries, water quality standards and guidelines, should respond to the public concern about other sensorial characteristics (organoleptic properties) including taste, odor, and trigeminal sensations. Often the root causes of color and smell in water are attributed to the presence of organic and inorganic contaminants and to bacterial growth which is frequently accompanied by the production of metabolites and byproducts that are obnoxious. The unpleasant sensorial problems associated with desalinated drinking tap water may constitute the driving force for most people in GCC countries to depend on bottled water. To encourage people in the GCC countries to consume desalinated tap water, it is essential that water testing include measurements of physicochemical properties, biofilm presence and organoleptic parameters to improve overall water quality. This review highlights the contribUtion of organoleptics for consumers of desalinated tap water. It extends water quality research to be addressed by standards for organoleptic parameters in desalinated drinking water. Accordingly, consumer awareness and outreach campaigns should be implemented to encourage people to drink tap water in the GCC countries.																	0013-9351	1096-0953				OCT	2017	158						203	211		10.1016/j.envres.2017.06.018								WOS:000408184700023	28651147

Effectiveness of table top water pitcher filters to remove arsenic from drinking water	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Arsenic contamination of drinking water is a serious threat to the health of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. In the United States similar to 3 million individuals drink well water that contains arsenic levels above the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 10 mu g/L. Several technologies are available to remove arsenic from well water including anion exchange, adsorptive media and reverse osmosis. In addition, bottled water is an alternative to drinking well water contaminated with arsenic. However, there are several drawbacks associated with these approaches including relatively high cost and, in the case of bottled water, the generation of plastic waste. In this study, we tested the ability of five tabletop water pitcher filters to remove arsenic from drinking water. We report that only one tabletop water pitcher filter tested, ZeroWater (R), reduced the arsenic concentration, both As3+ and As5+, from 1000 mu g/L to < 3 mu g/L, well below the MCL. Moreover, the amount of total dissolved solids or competing ions did not affect the ability of the ZeroWater (R) filter to remove arsenic below the MCL. Thus, the ZeroWater (R) pitcher filter is a cost effective and short-term solution to remove arsenic from drinking water and its use reduces plastic waste associated with bottled water.																	0013-9351	1096-0953				OCT	2017	158						610	615		10.1016/j.envres.2017.07.018								WOS:000408184700067	28719869

Public support for carrot, stick, and no-government water quality policies	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												Public support for environmental policy provides an important foundation for democratic governance. Numerous policy innovations may improve nonpoint source pollution, but little research has examined which types of individuals are likely to support various runoff reduction policies. We conducted a household mail survey of 1136 residents in southern Wisconsin. In general, residents were more likely to support water quality policies if they were communitarians, egalitarians, concerned about water pollution, and perceived water quality as poor. The majority of respondents somewhat to strongly supported all of the seven proposed water quality policies, but opposed relying on voluntary action without government involvement on farms. Residents had higher support for incentives and market-based approaches (carrot policies) than regulation and taxes (stick policies). A more complicated pattern emerged in within-subject comparisons of residents' views of carrot and stick approaches. Stick approaches polarized respondents by decreasing support among people with individualistic worldviews, while slightly increasing support among people with communitarian worldviews. Residents with an agricultural occupation were more likely to support voluntary, non-governmental approaches for reducing agricultural runoff, and were also more likely to support regulation for reducing urban lawn runoff. This research highlights the dominant role of cultural worldviews and the secondary roles of water pollution concern, perceived water quality, and self-interest in explaining support for diverse policies to reduce nonpoint source pollution.																	1462-9011	1873-6416				OCT	2017	76						82	89		10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.012								WOS:000407981300010

(Mel); Swamikannu, Xavier; Malloy, Timothy			Regulating oil and gas facility stormwater discharge: An assessment of surface impoundments, spills, and permit compliance	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												Contaminated stormwater runoff from oil and gas (O & G) operations can pose a significant threat to surface waters. The purpose of this study is to examine the extent of this threat and identify more specific permitting requirements to protect surface waters. To better understand the extent of the threat, this paper identified and characterized the use of waste surface impoundments at O & G facilities as well as the threat level from O & G spills in California. To assess the efficacy of the current federal and state-permitting regime, the paper evaluated stormwater permit compliance in two California counties. It also reviewed selected spill cases and associated Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans and Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans to identify the adequacy of current industry practices. The analysis showed that contaminated stormwater from O & G facilities can be better regulated. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does not require O & G facilities to file for an Industrial Stormwater General Permit even though many O & G industry practices have the potential to contaminate stormwater runoff from the site. When O & G facilities discharge a Reportable Quantity of a hazardous chemical or violate a water quality standard, they are required to enroll in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit program. Spills, although not a direct indication of stormwater runoff, can highlight polluted runoff discharges that should have been regulated. Medium and large spills that reached waterways were such a risk for which operators did not file for a permit. In California new filing requirements for the oil and gas industry require all facilities that discharge stormwater that has come into contact with any overburden, raw material, or intermediate products located on the site, to file for an Industrial Stormwater General Permit. As this study showed, there has been an increase in enrollment since the enactment of the new requirements. Having all facilities enroll in the general permit program, as done in California, would require minimum monitoring and maintenance that could help prevent spills. A further step to ensure better protocol is to require specific pollution control practices in addition to the current general permit requirements. Such permitting regimes not only can be implemented on the US federal level but also internationally.																	1462-9011	1873-6416				OCT	2017	76						139	145		10.1016/j.envsci.2017.06.016								WOS:000407981300016

In this study, using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC), principal component analysis (PCA), and discriminant function analysis (DFA) with the trophic index (TRIX) for reference, we developed an approach for rapidly assessing the eutrophication status of coastal waters using easy-to-measure parameters, including chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), fluorescence excitation-emission matrices, CDOM UV-Vis absorbance, and other water-quality parameters (turbidity, chlorophyll a, and dissolved oxygen). First, we decomposed CDOM excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) by PARAFAC to identify three components. Then, we applied PCA to simplify the complexity of the relationships between the water-quality parameters. Finally, we used the PCA score values as independent variables in DFA to develop a eutrophication assessment model. The developed model yielded classification accuracy rates of 97.1%, 80.5%, 90.3%, and 89.1% for good, moderate, and poor water qualities, and for the overall data sets, respectively. Our results suggest that these easy-to-measure parameters could be used to develop a simple approach for rapid in-situ assessment and monitoring of the eutrophication of estuarine and offshore areas.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				OCT	2017	16	5					781	792		10.1007/s11802-017-3203-1								WOS:000407615200008

The exploitation and utilization of S. nudus primarily occur in the coastal regions of the Beibu Gulf. However, wild resource of S. nudus is rapidly decreasing because of the overexploitation, which has led to considerable developments of artificial breeding techniques. The cultivation scale of S. nudus has increased in response to successful artificial breeding; however, methods for culturing S. nudus in tidal flats or ponds require further study. Most studies have focused on the breeding, nutrition, medical value and ecological impact of these worms. Studies on the distribution, sediment requirements, nutrition characteristics, breeding techniques and aquaculture ecology of this species are summarized in this paper to promote the development of the aquaculture industry for S. nudus. The high biomass of S. nudus in the Beibu Gulf is positively correlated with the sediment characteristics and water quality of the region. The production of peanut worm has improved to some extent through culturing; however, the nutrient value and ecological environment problems have been observed, which reflect the over exploitation of trace elements and the sediment. These problems will worsen unless they are resolved, and the release of organic materials, nitrogen and phosphorus during harvesting impacts the coastal environment. Moreover, genetic erosion is a potential risk for larvae in artificial breeding programs in tidal flats. Therefore, culturing and collecting methods should be improved and the wild resource conservation should be implemented to promote the sustainable development of the peanut worm.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				OCT	2017	16	5					823	830		10.1007/s11802-017-3310-z								WOS:000407615200012						
J	Caplenor, CA; Poudyal, NC; Muller, LI; Yoest, C				Caplenor, Carlotta A.; Poudyal, Neelam C.; Muller, Lisa I.; Yoest, Chuck			Assessing landowners' attitudes toward wild hogs and support for control options	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Wild hogs (Sus scrofa) are an invasive species with destructive habits, particularly rooting and wallowing, which can directly impact agricultural crops, pasture land, and water quality. Considering wild hogs are widely dispersed across the landscape, they are extremely difficult to control. Disagreements can arise among different stakeholders over whether and how their populations should be managed. The purpose of this article was to examine Tennessee, United States landowners' attitudes toward wild hogs, to compare acceptability of control methods, and to evaluate factors significantly influencing public support for regulations to control wild hogs. Logistic regression was employed to analyze data collected from a statewide survey of rural landowners in the fall of 2015. Landowners had overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards wild hogs, and were concerned about their impact on the natural environment and rural economy. Although landowners showed support for controlling wild hogs, levels of acceptability for management options varied. Respondents favored active management and supported education and incentive-based control programs to control wild hogs. Cognitive concepts such as social and personal norms and awareness of consequences, as well as demographic characteristics, significantly predicted landowners' support for state regulations to control wild hogs in Tennessee. Findings increase our understanding of the human dimensions of wild hog management and that of other similarly invasive animals, and may guide resource managers in designing effective and socially acceptable management strategies to control wild hog populations in Tennessee and elsewhere.

This study develops a remote sensing-based multiscale modeling system by integrating multi-sensor satellite data merging and image reconstruction algorithms in support of feature extraction with machine learning leading to automate continuous water quality monitoring in environmentally sensitive regions. This new Earth observation platform, termed "cross mission data merging and image reconstruction with machine learning" (CDMIM), is capable of merging multiple satellite imageries to provide daily water quality monitoring through a series of image processing, enhancement, reconstruction, and data mining/machine learning techniques. Two existing key algorithms, including Spectral Information Adaptation and Synthesis Scheme (SIASS) and SMart Information Reconstruction (SMIR), are highlighted to support feature extraction and content-based. mapping. Whereas SIASS can support various data merging efforts to merge images collected from cross-mission satellite sensors, SMIR can overcome data gaps by reconstructing the information of value-missing pixels due to impacts such as cloud obstruction. Practical implementation of CDMIM was assessed by predicting the water quality over seasons in terms of the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll-a, as well as water clarity in Lake Nicaragua, providing synergistic efforts to better monitor the aquatic environment and offer insightful lake watershed management strategies.

Proactive modeling of water quality impacts of extreme precipitation events in a drinking water reservoir	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Extreme precipitation events are of concern to managers of drinking water sources because these occurrences can affect both water supply quantity and quality. However, little is known about how these low probability events impact organic matter and nutrient loads to surface water sources and how these loads may impact raw water quality. This study describes a method for evaluating the sensitivity of a water body of interest from watershed input simulations under extreme precipitation events. An example application of the method is illustrated using the Wachusett Reservoir, an oligo-mesotrophic surface water reservoir in central Massachusetts and a major drinking water supply to metropolitan Boston. Extreme precipitation event simulations during the spring and summer resulted in total organic carbon, UV-254 (a surrogate measurement for reactive organic matter), and total algae concentrations at the drinking water intake that exceeded recorded maximums. Nutrient concentrations after storm events were less likely to exceed recorded historical maximums. For this particular reservoir, increasing inter reservoir transfers of water with lower organic matter content after a large precipitation event has been shown in practice and in model simulations to decrease organic matter levels at the drinking water intake, therefore decreasing treatment associated oxidant demand, energy for UV disinfection, and the potential for formation of disinfection byproducts.

Bacterial mobilization and transport through manure enriched soils: Experiment and modeling	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A precise evaluation of bacteria transport and mathematical investigations are useful for best management practices in agroecosystems. In this study, using laboratory experiments and modeling approaches, we assess the transport of bacteria released from three types of manure (cow, sheep, and poultry) to find the importance of the common manures in agricultural activities in soil and water pollution. Thirty six intact soil columns with different textures (sandy, loamy, and silty clay loam) were sampled. Fecal coliform leaching from layers of the manures on the soil surface was conducted under steady-state saturated flow conditions at 20 degrees C for up to four Pore Volumes (PVs). Separate leaching experiments were conducted to obtain the initial concentrations of bacteria released from the manures (Co). Influent (Co) and effluent (C) bacteria concentrations were measured by the plate-count method and the normalized concentrations (C/C0) were plotted versus PV representing the breakthrough curves (BTCs). Transport parameters were predicted using the attachment/detachment model (two-kinetic site) in HYDRUS-1D. Simulations fitted well the experimental data (R-2 = 0.50-0.96). The attachment, detachment, and straining coefficients of bacteria were more influenced by the soils treated with cow manure compared to the sheep and poultry manures. Influent curves of fecal coliforms from the manures (leached without soil) illustrated that the poultry manure had the highest potential to pollute the effluent water from the soils in term of concentration, but the BTCs and simulated data related to the treated soils illustrated that the physical shape of cow manure was more important to both straining and detachment of bacteria back into the soil solution. Detachment trends of bacteria were observed through loam and silty clay loam soils treated with cow manure compared to the cow manure enriched sandy soil. We conclude that management strategies must specifically minimize the effect of fecal coliform concentrations before field application, especially for the combination of poultry and cow manures, which has higher solubility and tailing behavior, respectively. Interestingly, the addition of sheep manure with all three soils had the lowest mobilization of bacteria.

A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of Enterococcus spp. in water	WATER RESEARCH												Faecal pollution of water and the resulting potential presence of human enteric pathogens is a predominant threat to public health. Microbiological water quality can be assessed by the detection of standard faecal indicator bacteria (SFIB) such as E. coil or certain Enterococcus species. In recent years, isothermal amplification methods have become a useful alternative to polymerase chain reaction (PCR), allowing molecular diagnostics with simple or no instrumentation. In this study, a novel screening method for the molecular detection of Enterococcus spp. by loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is described. A set of six specific LAMP primers was designed to amplify a diagnostic fragment of the Enterococcus 23S rRNA gene, which is present in several enterococcal species targeted by quantitative PCR (qPCR), which is the standard technique recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Sensitivity and specificity tests were performed using a set of 30 Enterococcus and non-target bacterial reference strains. It is shown that LAMP is equally sensitive and even more specific than the qPCR assay. A dilution series of Enterococcus faeons DNA revealed that the LAMP method can reliably detect 130 DNA target copies per reaction within 45 min. Additionally, enterococci isolated from Austrian surface waterbodies, as well as a set of DNA extracts from environmental waters, were tested. Contingency analysis demonstrated a highly significant correlation between the results of the developed LAMP assay and the reference qPCR method. Furthermore, a simple staining procedure with a fluorescence dye demonstrated the identification of amplified products by eye. In conclusion, this method is an important component for the efficient screening and testing of water samples in low-resource settings lacking sophisticated laboratory equipment and highly trained personnel, requiring only a simple heating block.

Two pilot-scale ozonation reactors (4-5 m(3) h(-1)), a 4-chamber reactor and a tubular reactor, were investigated by either conventional ozonation and/or the advanced oxidation process (AOP) O-3/H2O2. The effects of selected operational parameters, such as ozone dose (0.5-3 mg L-1) and H2O2 dose (O-3:H2O2 = 1:3-3:1 (mass ratio)), and selected water quality parameters, such as pH (6.5-8.5) and initial bromide concentration (15 200 Lig L-1), on micropollutant abatement and bromate formation were investigated. Under the studied conditions, compounds with high second-order rate constants k03>104 M-1 s(-1) for their reaction with ozone were well abated (>90%) even for the lowest ozone dose of 0.5 mg L-1. Conversely, the abatement efficiency of sucralose, which only reacts with hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), varied between 19 and 90%. Generally, the abatement efficiency increased with higher ozone doses and higher pH and lower bromide concentrations. H2O2 addition accelerated the ozone conversion to "OH, which enables a faster abatement of ozone-resistant micropollutants. Interestingly, the abatement of micropollutants decreased with higher bromide concentrations during conventional ozonation due to competitive ozone-consuming reactions, except for lamotrigine. due to the suspected reaction of HOBr/ORC with the primary amine moieties. In addition to the abatement of micropollutants, the evolution of the two main transformation products (TPs) of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and tramadol (TRA), chlorothiazide (CTZ) and tramadol N oxide (TRA-NOX), respectively, was assessed by chemical analysis and kinetic modeling. Both selected TPs were quickly formed initially to reach a maximum concentration followed by a decrease of their concentrations for longer contact times. For the studied conditions, the TP's concentrations at the outlet of the reactors ranged from 0 to 61% of the initial parent compound concentration, CTZ being a more persistent TP against further oxidation than TRA-NOX. Finally, it was demonstrated in both reactors that the formation of bromate (BrOi), a potentially carcinogenic oxidation by-product, could be controlled by H2O2 addition with a general improvement on micropollutant abatement. Post-treatment by granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration enabled the reduction of micropollutants and TPs concentrations but no changes in bromate were observed. The combined algae assay showed that water quality was				McArdell, Christa/R-9710-2017	McArdell, Christa/0000-0002-5251-7541												0043-1354					OCT 1	2017	122						234	245		10.1016/j.watres.2017.05.018								WOS:000407404300024	28601791

High pesticide loadings can potentially result in polluted stream water. The objective of this study was to determine the pesticide loadings and concentrations of three typical pesticides (atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane) in river water from a middle high latitude agricultural watershed in northern China. During this study, we evaluated the watershed pesticide loss patterns for two crop types over three decades. For this purpose, we integrated data from field investigations, laboratory experiments, and modeling simulations involving a distributed hydrological solute transport model (Soil and Water Assessment Tool, SWAT). SWAT was employed to compare the temporal spatial fate and behaviors of atrazine, oxadiazon, and isoprothiolane from 1990 to 2014 in a watershed area amounting to 141.5 km(2). The results showed that the three pesticides could be detected at different locations throughout the watershed, and isoprothiolane was detected at the maximum value of 1.082 mu g/L in surface runoff of paddy land. The temporal trend for the yearly loading of atrazine decreased slightly over time, but the trends for oxadiazon and isoprothiolane increased markedly over an 18-year analysis period. In regard to the pesticide concentrations in water, atrazine was associated with the largest value of nearly 1.4 mu g/L. July and August were the found to be prime periods for pesticide loss from paddy land, and the biggest monthly loss of atrazine from dryland appeared in June. Under similar usage conditions, isoprothiolane loading from paddy fields ranked as the largest one among the three types of pesticides and reached up to 17 g/ha. Limited monitoring data were useful for validating the model, which yielded valuable temporal-spatial data on the fate of pesticides in this watershed. With the expansion of paddy rice cultivation, risks for pesticide contamination of water bodies will increase. The results of this study should be valuable for future exposure and risk assessments aimed at protecting the environment and human health. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Winton, RS; River, M				Winton, R. Scott; River, Mark			The biogeochemical implications of massive gull flocks at landfills	WATER RESEARCH												Gulls have long been observed concentrating in flocks of tens to hundreds of thousands at the anthropogenic food sources provided by landfills. Yet, the biogeochemical implications of the landfill gull phenomenon have been largely ignored. This study has two goals: 1) to understand the magnitude and geographic extent of landfill gulls in North America, and 2) to quantify the amount of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) transported from landfills to gull roosting sites in order to understand their potential impacts on water quality and methane (CH4) emission. We synthesized and mapped data from the eBird Citizen Science database and found that 1.4 million gulls have been documented at landfills throughout North America, though the actual population is probably greater than 5 million. Using a carnivorous bird transport model we estimate that these gulls transport 39,000 to 139,000 kg of P and 240,000 to 858,000 kg of N y(-1) to neighboring water bodies and avoid roughly 1.1 to 3.9 Tg y(-1) of landfill CH4 emissions. The avoided CH4 emission mitigation is insignificant in the context of gross landfill emissions, but the transported nutrients may be relevant to water quality management at local and continental scales. For example, at the Jordan Lake reservoir in North Carolina, a flock of 49,000 Ring billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) annually deposits landfill feces containing 1070 kg P, an amount equivalent to approximately half of total maximum daily load reduction targets and worth roughly $2.2 million USD in nutrient credits. We estimate that continent-wide gull impacts are worth at least $100 million in nutrient offset credits. We conclude that mega-flocks of landfill gulls are common and widespread, and that their capacity to transport nutrients may be contributing to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and water supplies.

Information on the abundance and distribution of cyanobacteria is fundamental to support risk assessment and management activities. In the present study, an approach based on Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis was used to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chla) and the cyanobacterial biomarker pigment phycocyanin (PC) using data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in Lake Chaohu (China's fifth largest freshwater lake). The approach was developed and tested using fourteen years (2000-2014) of MODIS images, which showed significant spatial and temporal variability of the PC:Chla ratio, an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance. The results had unbiased RMS uncertainties of <60% for Chla ranging between 10 and 300 mu g/L, and unbiased RMS uncertainties of <65% for PC between 10 and 500 mu g/L. Further analysis showed the importance of nutrient and climate conditions for this dominance. Low TN:TP ratios (<29:1) and elevated temperatures were found to influence the seasonal shift of phytoplankton community. The resultant MODIS Chla and PC products were then used for cyanobacterial risk mapping with a decision tree classification model. The resulting Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was designed to assist authorities in the identification of possible intake areas, as well as specific months when higher frequency monitoring and more intense water treatment would be required if the location of the present intake area remained the same. Remote sensing cyanobacterial risk mapping provides a new tool for reservoir and lake management programs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Cd is a typical heavy metal leached from farmland that is related to phosphate fertilizers and carries serious environmental risk. The spatial-vertical pattern of Cd in soil and the vertical trend of Cd in the river sediment core were analyzed, which showed the migration and accumulation of Cd in the watershed. To prevent watershed Cd loss, biochar was employed, and leaching experiments were conducted to investigate the Cd loss from soil depending on the initial concentration. Four rainfall intensities, 1.25 mm/ h, 2.50 mmih, 5.00 mm/h, and 10.00 mm/h, were used to simulate typical rainfall scenarios for the study area. Biochar was prepared from corn straw after pretreatment with ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) and pyrolysis at 400 degrees C under anoxic conditions. To identify the effects of biochar amendment on Cd migration, the biochar was mixed with soil for 90 days at concentrations of 0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 3.0%, and 5.0% soil by weight. The results showed that the Cd leaching load increased as the initial load and rainfall intensity increased and that eluviation caused surface Cd to diffuse to the deep soils. The biochar application caused more of the heavy metals to be immobilized in the amended soil rather than transported into the waterbody. The sorption efficiency of the biochar for Cd increased as the addition level increased to 3%, which showed better performance than the 5% addition level under some initial concentration and rainfall conditions. The research indicated that biochar is a potential material to prevent diffuse heavy metal pollution and that a lower addition makes the application more feasible. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN PERCHED WATER AND GROUNDWATER QUALITIES AT AN OPEN SOLID WASTE DUMPSITE IN SRI LANKA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE												Open dumping of municipal solid waste is a common practice in many developing countries and contaminates surface and groundwater in the vicinity. In this study, long-term monitoring was conducted at an abandoned solid waste dumpsite to characterize temporal variations of perched water and groundwater qualities. The dumpsite was located at Udapalatha PS in Central Province of Sri Lanka and consisted of two sections (namely Old and New sections). The Old section was used for waste dumping for seven years from 2003 to 2010, and the New section was used for six months in 2011. Multiple wells were installed at each section and water qualities monitored for two years from May 2013 to March 2015. Water quality parameters such as pH, EC, BOD, COD, TN, TP, major cations, major anions, and heavy metals were measured monthly. Leachate pollution index (LPI) was used to quantify the leachate contamination potential of landfill site. Results showed that groundwater samples from both Old and New sections exhibited relatively low LPI during the monitoring period, whereas perched water samples from New section showed high LPI with fluctuations. At the monitoring site, perched water and groundwater seem to persist as two independent bodies for both Old and New sections. Especially, the dumped waste at lower layer at the Old section was fully washed out by rainfall and surface water after waste dumping and currently carries a low risk of groundwater contamination.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				OCT	2017	13	38					1	8		10.21660/2017.38.2761								WOS:000406909700001

The macro-tidal Gironde Estuary is characterized by a highly concentrated turbidity maximum zone (TMZ). Field observations show that hypoxia occurs in summer in the TMZ at low river flow and a few days after the spring tide peak. In situ data highlight lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations around the city of Bordeaux, located in the upper estuary. Interactions between multiple factors limit the understanding of the processes controlling the dynamics of hypoxia. A 3D biogeochemical model was developed, coupled with hydrodynamics and a sediment transport model, to assess the contribution of the TMZ and the impact of urban effluents through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and sewage overflows (SOS) on hypoxia. Our model describes the transport of solutes and suspended material and the biogeochemical mechanisms impacting oxygen: primary production, degradation of all organic matter (i.e. including phytoplankton respiration, degradation of river and urban watershed matter), nitrification and gas exchange. The composition and the degradation rates of each variable were characterized by in situ measurements and experimental data from the study area. The DO model was validated against observations in Bordeaux City. The simulated DO concentrations show good agreement with field observations and satisfactorily reproduce the seasonal and neap-spring time scale variations around the city of Bordeaux. Simulations show a spatial and temporal correlation between the formation of summer hypoxia and the location of the TMZ, with minimum DO centered in the vicinity of Bordeaux. To understand the contribution of the urban watershed forcing, different simulations with the presence or absence of urban effluents were compared. Our results show that in summer, a reduction of POC from SO would increase the DO minimum in the vicinity of Bordeaux by 3% of saturation. Omitting discharge from SO and WWTPs, DO would improve by 10% of saturation and mitigate hypoxic events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The multivariate analysis showed that although phytoplankton was inoculated largely by Pearl River water inputs and inflow among the system, the hydraulic architecture of the reservoir network shaped and modulated the composition and abundance of phytoplankton.

As Lake Kinneret is the only freshwater lake in Israel, it is vital to sustain the lake ecosystem over time. The KSI provides lake managers with a means for assessing the state of the lake. The KSI is based on nine ecosystem variables and provides information on each variable and the combined index. We present examples of application of the KSI to lake management and conduct a sensitivity analysis of the underlying assumptions demonstrating its robustness to the assumptions. While the index presented here is specific to Lake Kinneret, it is a general approach that can be readily applied to lakes worldwide and can assist, for example, in achievement of the required good status for European lakes.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2017	800	1					207	223		10.1007/s10750-017-3269-1								WOS:000406385800015

Faisalabad is the third populated city in Pakistan and is known for intensive textile processing activities. This study was aimed to evaluate the ecological risk of Paharang and Samana Main Drains receiving textile industries effluents and ground water arising from the activities of textile industries in vicinity of Faisalabad, Pakistan. Important quality parameters i.e., Pb and Cd, BOD, COD and cytotoxicity (heamolytic and brine shrimp bioassays) were considered for pollution load evaluation. Results showed that the water quality parameters were beyond the permissible limit and textile industries significantly contributed in contamination of ground water with Pb and Cd metals. The Pb concentration was found out to be in the range of 0.20-0.49 mg/L, 0.13-0.25 mg/L, 0.05-0.14 mg/L in Paharang drain, textile effluents and ground water, respectively, whereas these values were 0.25-0.39 mg/L, 0.25-0.34 mg/L and 0.10-0.23 mg/L in Samana Main Drain, connected textiles units and ground water, respectively. The Paharang Main Drain heamolyzed the RBC in the range of 12.51-84.59% and shrimp death rate was in the range of 22-72%, whereas wastewater from textile units heamolyzed the RBC in the range of 15.32-68.48% and shrimp death rate was in the range of 14.0-66.0%. Samana Drain showed less cytotoxicity as compared to Pagarang Main Drain and both heamolytic and brine shrimp tests showed good correlation of cytotoxicity with water quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional biotechnologies, such as ecological floating beds, or constructed wetlands, are not effective in removing nutrients present at low-concentration. However, microalgae-bacteria consortium is promising for advanced nutrient removal from wastewater. Suspended algal-bacterial systems can easily wash out unless the hydraulic retention time is long, attached microalgae-bacteria consortium is more realistic. This critical review summarizes the fundamentals and status of attached microalgae-bacteria consortium for advanced nutrient removal from surface water. Key advantages are the various nutrient removal pathways, reduction of nutrients to very low concentration, and diversified photobioreactor configurations. Challenges include poor identification of functional species, poor control of the community composition, and long start-up times. Future research should focus on the selection and engineering of robust microbial species, mathematical modelling of the composition and functionality of the consortium, and novel photobioreactor configurations.

Meadows of Crau (SE France), irrigated since the 16th century, were field monitored (2012-2015) and modelled. Except for N, the mineral requirements of hay are largely covered by dissolved elements brought by irrigation water with only slight deficits in K and P, which are compensated by P-K fertilizers and the winter pasture by sheep. N cycle results in a very small nitrate leakage. The main determinants of the chemical composition changes of water are: concentration by evaporation, equilibration with soil pCO(2), mineral nutrition of plants, input of fertilizers, sheep grazing, mineral-solution interactions in superficial formations till the aquifer, including ion exchange. Inverse modelling with PHREEQC allows for quantifying these processes. For groundwater, measured composition fit statistically very well with those computed, validating thus this approach. This long-term established agrosystem protects both soil and water resources: soil nutritional status remains constant with even some P and (minor) K fixation in soils; long-term decarbonatation occurs but it is greatly slowed by saturation of irrigation water by carbonate; P fixation in soil protects groundwater from eutrophication.

Performance of surface and subsurface flow constructed wetlands treating eutrophic waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Three medium size constructed wetlands (CWs) with a total surface of 90 ha are working since 2009 in the Albufera de Valencia Natural Park (Spain). Two of them are fed with eutrophic waters from l'Albufera Lake. Their objectives are both reduce the phytoplankton biomass and increase the biodiversity; consequently, improved water quality is returned to the lake. A "science based governance" of these CWs is ongoing inside the LIFE + 12 Albufera Project to demonstrate the environmental benefits of these features. In this paper, results and relationships among hydraulic operation, physicochemical variables and plankton in two different CWs typologies, five free water surface CW (FWSCW) and one horizontal subsurface flow CW(HSSFCW), were analysed showing that CWs were capable of improving the water quality and biodiversity but showing clear differences depending on the CW type. The CWs worked under different hydraulic load rates (HLR) from <0.12 to 54.75 m yr(-1). Inflow water quality was typical from eutrophic waters with mean values of chlorophyll a (Chl a) about 22-90 mu g Chl a l(-1) and mean total phosphorus (TP) between 0.122 and 0.337 mg l(-1). The main conclusion is that HSSFCW was much more efficient than FWSCW in the removal of organic matter, suspended solids and nutrients. The biological role of several shallow lagoons located at the end of the CWs has also been evaluated, showing that they contribute to increase the zooplankton biomass, a key factor to control the phytoplankton blooms.

In this study, the spatial and temporal variability in nitrate (NO3-), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was analyzed in the Selke (Germany) river continuum from three headwaters draining 1-3 km(2) catchments to two downstream reaches representing spatially integrated signals from 184-456 km(2) catchments. Three headwater catchments were selected as archetypes of the main landscape units (land use x lithology) present in the Selke catchment. Export regimes in headwater catchments were interpreted in terms of NO3-, DOC and SRP land-to-stream transfer processes. Headwater signals were subtracted from downstream signals, with the differences interpreted in terms of in-stream processes and contributions from point sources. The seasonal dynamics for NO3- were opposite those of DOC and SRP in all three headwater catchments, and spatial differences also showed NO3- contrasting with DOC and SRP. These dynamics were interpreted as the result of the interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes, for which riparian zones were hypothesized to play a determining role. In the two downstream reaches, NO3- was transported almost conservatively, whereas DOC was consumed and produced in the upper and lower river sections, respectively. The natural export regime of SRP in the three headwater catchments mimicked a point-source signal (high SRP during summer low flow), which may lead to overestimation of domestic contributions in the downstream reaches. Monitoring the river continuum from headwaters to downstream reaches proved effective to jointly investigate land-to-stream and in-stream transport, and transformation processes.

Contaminants of emerging concern in tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes: I. Patterns of occurrence	PLOS ONE												Human activities introduce a variety of chemicals to the Laurentian Great Lakes including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, flame retardants, plasticizers, and solvents (collectively referred to as contaminants of emerging concern or CECs) potentially threatening the vitality of these valuable ecosystems. We conducted a basin-wide study to identify the presence of CECs and other chemicals of interest in 12 U.S. tributaries to the Laurentian Great Lakes during 2013 and 2014. A total of 292 surface-water and 80 sediment samples were collected and analyzed for approximately 200 chemicals. A total of 32 and 28 chemicals were detected in at least 30% of water and sediment samples, respectively. Concentrations ranged from 0.0284 (indole) to 72.2 (cholesterol) mu g/L in water and 1.75 (diphenhydramine) to 20,800 mu g/kg (fluoranthene) in sediment. Cluster analyses revealed chemicals that frequently co-occurred such as pharmaceuticals and flame retardants at sites receiving similar inputs such as wastewater treatment plant effluent. Comparison of environmental concentrations to water and sediment-quality benchmarks revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations often exceeded benchmarks in both water and sediment. Additionally, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and dichlorvos concentrations exceeded water-quality benchmarks in several rivers. Results from this study can be used to understand organism exposure, prioritize river basins for future management efforts, and guide detailed assessments of factors influencing transport and fate of CECs in the Great Lakes Basin.

M.			Hydrological controls on DOC: nitrate resource stoichiometry in a lowland, agricultural catchment, southern UK	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The role that hydrology plays in governing the interactions between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen in rivers draining lowland, agricultural landscapes is currently poorly understood. In light of the potential changes to the production and delivery of DOC and nitrate to rivers arising from climate change and land use management, there is a pressing need to improve our understanding of hydrological controls on DOC and nitrate dynamics in such catchments. We measured DOC and nitrate concentrations in river water of six reaches of the lowland river Hampshire Avon (Wiltshire, southern UK) in order to quantify the relationship between BFI (BFI) and DOC: nitrate molar ratios across contrasting geologies (Chalk, Greensand, and clay). We found a significant positive relationship between nitrate and BFI (p < 0.0001), and a significant negative relationship between DOC and BFI (p < 0.0001), resulting in a non-linear negative correlation between DOC: nitrate molar ratio and BFI. In the Hampshire Avon, headwater reaches which are underlain by clay and characterized by a more flashy hydrological regime are associated with DOC: nitrate ratios > 5 throughout the year, whilst groundwater-dominated reaches underlain by Chalk, with a high BFI have DOC: nitrate ratios in surface waters that are an order of magnitude lower (< 0.5). Our analysis also reveals significant seasonal variations in DOC: nitrate transport and highlights critical periods of nitrate export (e.g. winter in sub-catchments underlain by Chalk and Greensand, and autumn in drained, clay sub-catchments) when DOC: nitrate molar ratios are low, suggesting low potential for in-stream uptake of inorganic forms of nitrogen. Consequently, our study emphasizes the tight relationship between DOC and nitrate availability in agricultural catchments, and further reveals that this relationship is controlled to a great extent by the hydrological setting.

Conventionally, phytoplankton analysis has been done using time consuming and partly subjective microscopic observations, but next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide promising potential for rapid automated examination of environmental samples. Because many phytoplankton species have tough cell walls, methods for cell lysis and DNA or RNA isolation need to be efficient to allow unbiased nucleic acid retrieval. Here, we analyzed how two phytoplankton preservation methods, three commercial DNA extraction kits and their improvements, three RNA extraction methods, and two data analysis procedures affected the results of the NGS analysis. A mock community was pooled from phytoplankton species with variation in nucleus size and cell wall hardness. Although the study showed potential for studying Lugol-preserved sample collections, it demonstrated critical challenges in the DNA-based phytoplankton analysis in overall. The 18S rRNA gene sequencing output was highly affected by the variation in the rRNA gene copy numbers per cell, while sample preservation and nucleic acid extraction methods formed another source of variation. At the top, sequence-specific variation in the data quality introduced unexpected bioinformatics bias when the sliding-window method was used for the quality trimming of the Ion Torrent data. While DNA-based analyses did not correlate with biomasses or cell numbers of the mock community, rRNA-based analyses were less affected by different RNA extraction procedures and had better match with the biomasses, dry weight and carbon contents, and are therefore recommended for quantitative phytoplankton analyses.																	1664-302X					SEP 26	2017	8								1848	10.3389/fmicb.2017.01848								WOS:000411751500001	29018424

To contribute in improving the monitoring activities in running waters, here we tested the validity of the new Micro Biological Survey (MBS) method to specifically assess the bacterial load in running waters focusing on Total Viable Counts (at 22 degrees C and 37 degrees C) and Escherichia coli (at 44 degrees C) in order to propose a new prognostic tool for watercourses. MBS method is an alternative colorimetric method for counting bacterial load in water and food samples that is easy to use and leads to a reliable and simple interpretation of results, being also faster and less expensive than traditional methods. Then, we compared MBS with the traditionally used reference method for the bacterial load, and with the most used biotic index for Italian watercourses based on the benthic invertebrates: the Extended Biotic Index (EBI). The last comparison was performed to validate the use of MBS in biomonitoring activities since the benthic invertebrate multi-species assemblage (and then EBI) alter own structure mainly depending on the organic component variation. During the first part of the study, the assessment of both linearity (regressions among bacterial concentrations) and accuracy (significant correlation between a measured value and a value used as reference) confirmed the validity of the MBS method. Second, the linear regressions between the three investigated microbial parameters vs. both physical-chemical descriptors and EBI, revealed the usefulness of MBS as a valid tool for routine microbiological analyses involved in rapid and easy field monitoring activities. This represents the first attempt to evaluate the river microbial status by exploiting the innovative MBS on running waters to propose it as new valuable monitoring tool in the biomonitoring field.					antonini, giovanni/0000-0002-2115-8961												1932-6203					SEP 25	2017	12	9							e0185156	10.1371/journal.pone.0185156								WOS:000411645100025	28945808					
J	Park, JY; Ale, S; Teague, WR				Park, Jong-Yoon; Ale, Srinivasulu; Teague, W. Richard			Simulated water quality effects of alternate grazing management practices at the ranch and watershed scales	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Inappropriate grazing management with high stocking rates can result in significantly higher levels of runoff, sediment and nutrient losses to surface water resources. An assessment of water quality effects of various grazing management practices enables the selection of appropriate management practices. The overall objective of this study was to assess the impacts of alternate grazing management practices including the heavy continuous (HC), light continuous (LC) and adaptive multi-paddock (MP) grazing, and no grazing (EX; exclosure) on water quality at the ranch and watershed scales in the rangeland-dominated (71% rangeland) Clear Creek Watershed (CCW) in north central Texas using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The SWAT model was calibrated and validated for water quality predictions using the measured data on county-level crop yield (1980-2013), and monthly sediment (1994-2009), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads (1986-2009) at the watershed outlet. The ranch-scale assessment results at two study ranches indicated that when the grazing management was changed from the baseline MP grazing to HC grazing, the simulated average (1980-2013) annual surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP losses increased within the ranges of 106%-117%, 6.0-8.1 ton ha(-1), 8.3-11.5 kg ha(-1), and 1.6-2.6 kg ha(-1), respectively. At the watershed-scale, shifting grazing management from the baseline HC grazing to the improved MP grazing decreased surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP loads by 47.0%, 39.7%, 35.1% and 34.1%, respectively. Thus, adaptive MP grazing was found to be the best grazing management practice for the CCW in terms of water quality protection and improvement in ecosystem functions such as reduced soil erosion and increased nutrient retention at both ranch and watershed scales. However, the magnitudes of water quality benefits due to adoption of MP grazing vary according to the extent of grazing lands in a watershed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We combined statistical (spectral analysis and Machine learning techniques) and physically based models to generate, for the first time in this system, a predictive tool of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a) and composition (morphology-based functional groups). The results, based on a 11-year time series, revealed two alternating phases in the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass. One phase is characterized by high inorganic turbidity and low phytoplankton biomass, and the other by low inorganic turbidity and variable (low and high) phytoplankton biomass. A threshold of turbidity (29 TNU), above which phytoplankton remains with low biomass (<15-20 ug/l) was established. The periods of high turbidity, which in total cover 30% of the time series, start abruptly and are related to external forcing. Meteorological conditions associated with the beginning of these periods were modeled through a regression tree analysis. These conditions consist of moderate to high wind intensities from the SW direction, in some cases combined with high antecedent precipitation or low water level. The results from the physically-based modeling indicated that the long decaying time-scale of turbidity and intermediate resuspension events could explain the prolonged length of the high turbidity periods (similar to 1.5 years). Random Forests models for the prediction of phytoplankton biomass and composition in periods of low turbidity resulted in a proportion of explained variance and a classification error over a test sample of 0.46 and 0.34 respectively. Turbidity, conductivity, temperature and water level were within the most important model predictors. The development and improvement of this type of modeling is needed to provide management tools to water managers in the current water supply situation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The model was calibrated and validated using pilot-scale experimental data, with satisfactory results. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values were 0.86 and 0.03 for TP, 0.71 and 0.38 for TN, 0.93 and 6.78 for Chl a, and 0.99 and 27.61 for submerged macrophyte biomass. The GBAEDM was then used to choose appropriate species and suitable initial plant biomass submerged macrophyte recovery in Gonghu Bay. The appropriate species at 1 m depth were Vallisneria spinulosa (1150 g/m(2)), Myriophyllum spicatum (525 g/m(2)), and V. spinulosa-M. spicatum mixed (600 g/m(2); 3:1) communities. At 2 m depth, the appropriate species were M. spicatum (1450 g/m(2)) and V. spinulosa M. spicatum mixed (1950 g/m(2); 12:1) communities. Only M. spicatum (1608 g/m(2)) was recommended at 3 m depth. Finally, the GBAEDM was used to determine the critical water transparency thresholds for submerged macrophytes in Gonghu Bay. A transparency value of 0.62 m at 2 m (the WT/H value of 0.31) was determined as the critical underwater light threshold for the recovery of submerged macrophytes in Gonghu Bay.

In the past two centuries, cholera has emerged and spread from the Ganges Delta six times and from Indonesia once to cause global pandemics. Rational approaches to the case management of cholera with oral and intravenous rehydration therapy have reduced the case fatality of cholera from more than 50% to much less than 1%. Despite improvements in water quality, sanitation, and hygiene, as well as in the clinical treatment of cholera, the disease is still estimated to cause about 100 000 deaths every year. Most deaths occur in cholera-endemic settings, and virtually all deaths occur in developing countries. Contemporary understanding of immune protection against cholera, which results from local intestinal immunity, has yielded safe and protective orally administered cholera vaccines that are now globally stockpiled for use in the control of both epidemic and endemic cholera.																	0140-6736	1474-547X				SEP 23	2017	390	10101					1539	1549		10.1016/S0140-6736(17)30559-7								WOS:000411337100028	28302312

Respiratory and Ocular Symptoms Among Employees of an Indoor Waterpark Resort - Ohio, 2016	MMWR-MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT												What is already known about this topic? Indoor waterparks are complex environments where problems with air and water quality can result in illness. Chloramines, formed when disinfectant chlorine reacts with nitrogen-containing substances (e.g., urine, sweat) from swimmers' bodies, are known causes of ocular and upper respiratory symptoms in aquatic facilities. What is added by this report? Investigation of reported illness in an indoor waterpark resort in Ohio found that waterpark employees were approximately four times more likely to have work-related ocular and respiratory symptoms than were employees in other resort areas. Environmental assessment found that levels of combined chlorine, of which chloramines are a subset, in water exceeded recommended guidelines, but levels of chlorine and chloroform (a representative disinfection byproduct) in air were low. Improperly functioning ventilation systems, resulting in accumulation of disinfection byproducts and temperature below and relative humidity above recommended ranges, likely contributed to the higher prevalence of symptoms among waterpark employees compared with nonwaterpark employees. What are the implications for public health practice? To prevent recreational water-associated illness caused by endotoxins and disinfection byproducts in indoor waterparks, vigilant monitoring and maintenance of ventilation and water systems are needed. Employees and patrons of indoor waterparks should promptly report symptoms, which might indicate that further attention to water and air quality and ventilation system functioning is needed. Showering before entering the water and taking regular bathroom breaks can reduce levels of disinfection byproduct precursors introduced into the water.

We analysed the effects of high densities of flamingos on nutrients and microbial dynamics in a saline lake during a wet and a dry hydrological year, and explored the effects of guano on prokaryotic growth. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, total phosphorus and total nitrogen in the surface waters were 2-3 fold higher during the drought and were correlated with salinity. Flamingos stimulated prokaryotic heterotrophic production and triggered cascading effects on prokaryotic abundance, viruses and dissolved nitrogen. This stimulus of heterotrophic prokaryotes was associated with soluble phosphorus inputs from guano, and also from sediments. In the experiments, the specific growth rate and the carrying capacity were almost twice as high after guano addition than in the control treatments, and were coupled with soluble phosphorus assimilation. Flamingo guano was also rich in nitrogen. Dissolved N in lake water lagged behind the abundance of flamingos, but the causes of this lag are unclear. This study demonstrates that intense droughts could lead to increases in total nutrients in wetlands; however, microbial activity is likely constrained by the availability of soluble phosphorus, which appears to be more dependent on the abundance of waterbirds.

J	Daryanto, S; Wang, LX; Jacinthe, PA				Daryanto, Stefani; Wang, Lixin; Jacinthe, Pierre-Andre			Impacts of no-tillage management on nitrate loss from corn, soybean and wheat cultivation: A metaanalysis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Although no-till (NT) has been promoted as an alternative land management practice to conventional tillage (CT), its impact on water quality, especially nitrate (NO3-) loss remain controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare NO3- concentration and load in NT and CT systems via two major transport pathways: runoff and leaching. Rainfall variability, aridity, soil texture, tillage duration, crop species, and fertilizer type were used as co-varying factors. In comparison to CT, NT resulted in an overall increase of runoff NO3- concentration, but similar runoff NO3- load. In contrast, leachate NO3- load was greater under NT than under CT, although leachate NO3- concentration was similar under both tillage practices, indicating that the effect of NT on NO3- load was largely determined by changes in water flux. Some deviations from these overall trends, however, were recorded with different covarying variables. In comparison to CT, NT, for example, generated lower leachate NO3- concentration and similar (instead of elevated) NO3- leachate load from soybean fields (no N fertilizer applied). These results suggest NT needs to be complemented with other practices (e.g., cover crops, reduced N rate, split N application) in order to improve soil N retention and water quality benefits.																	2045-2322					SEP 21	2017	7								12117	10.1038/s41598-017-12383-7								WOS:000411416700020	28935905

Results demonstrated that waters with concentrations as high as 150-200 mu g/I. of chlorophyll a and natural organic matter between 5 and 16 mg C/L presented removals higher than 80% for turbidity and chlorophyll a, 70-80% for dissolved organic matter and 80-90% for UV254nm. Moringa oleifera natural coagulant removed almost 80% of Microcystis aeruginosa cells in coagulation/flocculation/dissolved air flotation processes. The coconut palm activated carbon showed a high capacity to adsorb DOC from water with a maximum adsorbed capacity of 51.8 mg/g at equilibrium. The values obtained in treated water for the parameters measured are very encouraging, so this innovative integrated sequence may be used for improving water quality, benefiting human health and wellbeing.

J	Garcia, CA; Hodaifa, G				Agabo Garcia, Cristina; Hodaifa, Gassan			Real olive oil mill wastewater treatment by photo-Fenton system using artificial ultraviolet light lamps	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Large volume of untreated olive oil mill wastewater (OMW) is being stored in evaporation rafts. Given the high organic load and the presence of phenolic compounds in OMW, an effective treatment process should be implemented. In this work, an advanced oxidation process (photo-Fenton) operating in a batch reactor was used to treat OMW. All experiments were developed using FeCl3 as a catalyst. Different H2O2 concentrations (5.0, 8.0, 11.0, 15.0, 16.0, 21.0, 24.0 and 30.0 g/L) were studied as well as four commercial medium pressure UV-lamps (Standard, Z1, Z2 and Z3). The common operation conditions were: pH = 3, temperature 20 degrees C, [catalyst] = 3.0 and direct ultraviolet light (UV-light). The samples were analysed at different times during the experiments to determine water quality parameters. In general, high total carbon, total organic carbon, total phenolic compounds and turbidity removal percentages (>90%) were registered in all experiments, at all oxidant concentrations studied. Increasing oxidant concentrations did not imply a noticeable rise on the final removal percentages (approximately 5% at these experimental conditions). Total nitrogen content removal percentages were determined and varied in the range of 62.5 - 75.5%. UV-lamps presented virtually similar removal percentages with the following averages COD = 95.7 +/- 0.53%, total phenolic compounds = 93.6 +/- 2.5%, total carbon = 94.0 +/- 1.2%, total organic carbon = 96.3 +/- 0.6%, total nitrogen = 74.9 +/- 6.8% and turbidity 92.5 +/- 1.9%.

And aeration plays an important role in its sustainable operation, as well as economic and environmental feasibility. In this study, two patterns to reduce aeration intensity, i.e., semi aeration (SA) and intermittent aeration (IA) were used to improve the economic and environmental benefits of media-based aquaponics. Results showed that SA aquaponics, in which the energy efficiencies on culturing fish and crop were improved respectively by 78.20% and 77.61% compared with Control, had the potential to obtain higher economic benefits. Although both SA and IA could save half of the aeration cost by reducing aeration flux and time respectively, the product yields in SA weren't impaired seriously while in IA aquaponics they were. And the nitrogen utilization efficiency (NUE) of SA aquaponics was 113% higher than that of IA aquaponics, mainly attributed to the more stable dissolved oxygen concentration in SA. Better water quality was obtained in IA aquaponics, however, it was achieved at the cost of higher N loss (mainly in the form of N-2), which subsequently reduced the potential for further improvement of NUE. Both SA and IA could considerably reduce GHG emissions from aquaponics, due to lower energy requirement. IA aquaponics showed the lowest N2O emission, but the primary source (over 97%) of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from aquaponics was off-site indirect CO2 emission. Taking productivity and environmental impact into consideration, semi-aeration was believed to be a better choice when reducing aeration. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They play a key role in aquatic ecosystems and indicate water quality. The European Union Water Framework Directive requires that phytobenthos be used for the ecological quality assessment of water. This study evaluated the ecological status of various watercourses in the western Mediterranean basin of Turkey using a multivariate approach and presents a new trophic index Turkey (TIT) based on diatom assemblages. Twenty-five running water bodies were seasonally monitored for biological and physicochemical analyses from summer 2014 to summer 2015. A total of 102 species belonging to 22 genera were recorded. Cymbella excisa Kutzing, Gomphonella parvula (Kutzing) Rabenhorst, Ulnaria ulna (Nitzsch) Compere, and Cocconeis communis f. placentula (Ehrenberg) Chmielevski were the most commonly found species. A canonical correspondence analysis was used to examine the relationship between species and environmental factors. The most effective explanatory factors, including nitrate nitrogen, electrical conductivity, altitude, total nitrogen, orthophosphate, and calcium carbonate significantly influenced the ecological preferences of diatom species in the ecosystems. TIT values ranged between 1.53 in Kaya creek and 2.73 in Dalaman stream (A8). Ecological status of water bodies was assessed using an ecological quality ratio based on trophic index Turkey (EQR-TIT) for each of the stations. EQR-TIT ranged from 0.44 in Dalaman stream (A8) to 0.99 in Kocabuk creek during the study period. TIT had a high correlation coefficient (R-2 = 0.77) with log total phosphorus and may be an appropriate diatom metric to assess the ecological status of water bodies.																	0003-4088	2100-000X				SEP 19	2017	53						333	343		10.1051/limn/2017012								WOS:000412947400001

Line-Focused Optical Excitation of Parallel Acoustic Focused Sample Streams for High Volumetric and Analytical Rate Flow Cytometry	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Flow cytometry provides highly sensitive multiparameter analysis of cells and particles but has been largely limited to the use of a single focused sample stream. This limits the analytical rate to similar to 50K particles/s and the volumetric rate to similar to 250 mu L/min. Despite the analytical prowess of flow cytometry, there are applications where these rates are insufficient, such as rare cell analysis in high, cellular backgrounds (e.g., circulating tumor cells and fetal cells in maternal blood), detection of cells/particles in large dilute samples (e.g., water quality, urine analysis); or high throughput screening applications. Here we report a highly parallel acoustic flow cytometer that uses an acoustic standing wave to focus particles into 16 parallel analysis points across a 2.3 mm wide optical flow cell. A line-focused laser and wide-field collection optics are used to excite and collect the fluorescence emission of these parallel streams onto a highspeed: camera for analysis. With this instrument format and fluorescent microsphere standards, we obtain analysis rates of 100K/s and flow rates of 10 mL/min, while maintaining optical performance comparable to that of a commercial flow cytometer. The results with our initial prototype instrument demonstrate that the integration of key parallelizable components, including the line-focused laser, particle focusing using multinode acoustic standing waves, and a spatially arrayed detector, can increase analytical and volumetric throughputs by orders of magnitude in a compact, simple, and cost-effective platform. Such instruments will be of great value to applications in need of high-throughput yet sensitive flow cytometry analysis.

Effects of an Extreme Flood on Trace Elements in River Water-From Urban Stream to Major River Basin	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Major floods adversely affect water quality through surface runoff, groundwater discharge, and damage to municipal water infrastructure. Despite their importance, it can be difficult to assess the effects of floods on streamwater chemistry because of challenges collecting samples and the absence of baseline data. This study documents water quality during the September 2013 extreme flood in the South Platte River, Colorado, USA. Weekly time-series water samples were collected from 3 urban source waters (municipal tap water, streamwater, and wastewater treatment facility effluent) under normal-flow and flood conditions. In addition, water samples were collected during the flood at 5 locations along the South Platte River and from 7 tributaries along the Colorado Front Range. Samples were analyzed for 54 major and trace elements. Specific chemical tracers, representing different natural and anthropogenic sources and geochemical behaviors, were used to compare streamwater composition before and during the flood. The results differentiate hydrological processes that affected water quality: (1) in the upper watershed, runoff diluted most dissolved constituents, (2) in the urban corridor and lower watershed, runoff mobilized soluble constituents accumulated on the landscape and contributed to stream loading, and (3) flood induced groundwater discharge mobilized soluble constituents stored in the vadose zone.

J	Ransom, E; Bain, C; Bal, H; Shannon, N				Ransom, Elizabeth; Bain, Carmen; Bal, Harleen; Shannon, Natasha			Cattle as technological interventions: The gender effects of water demand in dairy production in Uganda	FACETS												Smallholder dairy production dominates the country of Uganda, with over 90% of the national herd owned by smallholders. To reduce hunger, malnutrition, and raise families out of poverty agricultural development, interventions in Uganda have focused on increasing milk production through the introduction of improved dairy cow breeds. Development actors, such as the East Africa Dairy Development (EADD) program in Uganda, see crossbreed dairy cows as a key technological intervention for improving production. Drawing on a multi-method study (spatial analysis, surveys, and qualitative interviews) of dairy smallholders, our paper examines the gendered effects of the introduction of crossbreed dairy cows. To ensure peak performance, improved breeds require more inputs (e.g., water, feed, and medicine), which are labor and time intensive with specific gendered outcomes. Our findings reveal that both men and women identify fetching water as one of the greatest challenges in maintaining dairy cows, but women and children disproportionately fetch the water and women have higher reported rates of time poverty. Water quality is also an issue, with smallholders struggling to provide clean water to cows, and our basic water testing reveals water sources with high nitrate levels that can be harmful for children and dairy cows.																	2371-1671					SEP 19	2017	2						715	732		10.1139/facets-2017-0031								WOS:000411122300001

The model included only systematic contamination routes (e.g. soil and irrigation water) and it was used to evaluate the potential impact of weather conditions, agricultural practices as well as bacterial fitness in soil on the E. colt levels present in the crop at harvest. The model can be used to estimate E. colt contamination of baby spinach via irrigation water, via soil splashing due to irrigation water or rain events, and also including the inactivation of E. colt on plants due to solar radiation during a variable time of culturing before harvest. Seasonality, solar radiation and rainfall were predicted to have an important impact on the E. colt contamination. Winter conditions increased E. colt prevalence and levels when compared to spring conditions. As regards agricultural practices, both water quality and irrigation system slightly influenced E. colt levels on baby spinach. The good microbiological quality of the irrigation water (average E. colt counts in positive water samples below 1 log/100 mL) could have influenced the differences observed among the tested agricultural practices (water treatment and irrigation system). This quantitative microbial contamination model represents a preliminary framework that assesses the potential impact of different factors and intervention strategies affecting E. colt concentrations at field level. Taking into account that E. colt strains may serve as a surrogate organism for enteric bacterial pathogens, obtained results on E. colt levels on baby spinach may be indicative of the potential behaviour of these pathogens under defined conditions.

Using physically based arguments, we refine the transfer of wind energy to basin-scale internal waves (BSIWs). We consider the properties of the basin, the characteristics of the wind time series and the stability of the water column to filter and thereby optimize the magnitude of wind energy transferred to BSIWs. We show that this filtering procedure can significantly improve the accuracy of modelled temperatures, especially in the deep water of lakes such as Lake Geneva, for which the root mean square error between observed and simulated temperatures was reduced by up to 40 %. The modification, tested on four different lakes, increases model accuracy and contributes to a significantly better reproduction of seasonal deep convective mixing, a fundamental parameter for biogeochemical processes such as oxygen depletion. It also improves modelling over long time series for the purpose of climate change studies.

Rooftop rainwater samples are collected between April and September 2015 from Ugbihioko village near Benin City, Nigeria. Heavy metal concentration and physicochemical quality are determined with the use of standard analytical techniques for water quality, and the results are compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) acceptable limits for drinking water. Of the different water quality parameters, the results show that temperature is within WHO drinking water standards for all locations, but pH, turbidity, sulfate, chloride, and nitrate concentrations vary considerably and do not meet the standards for all locations. Regarding the maximum acceptable concentration (MAC), electrical conductivity is well below the MAC for all cases; the heavy metals copper and iron are above the MAC for all cases; the light metals sodium and potassium are below the MAC for all cases. Lead is above the MAC for all locations, except for in one location; and selenium varied, with some sites having selenium concentrations above the MAC. The results from this study show that public health education or advising is vital for mitigating the possible risks that can be linked to the use of harvested rainwater without treatment.																	2056-6646					SEP 16	2017	1	6							1700011	10.1002/gch2.201700011								WOS:000419792800001

Existing measurement techniques, however, are not capable of resolving sediment-water fluxes of most constituents under in situ flow conditions. We investigated whether relaxed eddy accumulation (REA), a micrometeorological technique with conditional sampling of turbulent updrafts and downdrafts, can be adapted to the aquatic environment. We simulated REA fluxes by reanalyzing eddy covariance measurements from a riverine lake. We found that the empirical coefficient that relates mass fluxes to the concentration difference between both REA samples is invariant with scalar and flow and responds as predicted by a joint Gaussian distribution of linearly correlated variables. Simulated REA fluxes differed on average by around 30% from eddy covariance fluxes (mean absolute error). Assessment of the lower quantification limit suggests that REA can potentially be applied for measuring benthic fluxes of a new range of constituents that cannot be assessed by standard eddy covariance methods.

In this study, antibiotic and heavy metals resistance exhibited by strains isolated from different types of wastewater and freshwater receiving system were assessed. The results revealed that 40% of the isolates were resistant to AMC, 30% to KZ and TE, 25% to FOX and CAZ, 20% to CRO and SXT, 15% to ATM, CIP, PIP and IMP, 10% to NN, and 5% to CTX and AN. Majority of aquatic bacterial isolates showed multiple metal resistance (MMR), from two to six heavy metals in different combinations. The heavy metals resistance profile showed that 15% of the isolates were resistant to mercury, 40% to copper, 75% to chromium and 80% to zinc. All strains (100%) were resistant to cadmium and aluminium. Most of tested strains tolerated various concentrations of heavy metals and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranged from 15.6 mu g/ml for Hg to >= 125 mu g/ml for Cu, Zn, Cr, Al and Cd. These results of the present study have shown that different types of wastewater represent an important source of heavy metal and antibiotics resistant bacteria and contribute to the spread of biological emerging contaminants into aquatic ecosystems, highlighting the need for further measures of water quality monitoring.																	2069-5837					SEP 15	2017	7	5					2140	2144										WOS:000416250800003

Natural forcings on a transformed territory overshoot thresholds of primary productivity in the Guadalquivir estuary	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												A three year-long quasi continuum sampling dataset on the Guadalquivir estuary water quality was used to assess the role of light availability on its biological production. We found that inorganic nutrients within the estuary are very high (with mean values for inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous of 285 and 2.4 mu M respectively) while phytoplankton biomass remains low most of the time (with a mean value of 2.6 mg/m(3)). A strong relationship between phytoplankton biomass and water turbidity was found indicating that, indeed, light avail ability is the major constraint of primary production in this system. Most of the time this limitation of primary production is not associated to enhanced turbidity connected to fresh water inputs. Instead, our data indicate that, independently of freshwater inputs, the photosynthesis is restricted by tidal forcings enhancing turbidity in an estuary that has been highly modified. Our results match with classical theories on the functioning of well-mixed, estuarine ecosystems as well as with recent modeling exercises. We also discuss the potential impacts of this particular characteristic of some estuarine systems for their management and regulatory control.																	0278-4343	1873-6955				SEP 15	2017	148						199	207		10.1016/j.csr.2017.09.002								WOS:000413877700017

The potential impact of green agendas on historic river landscapes: Numerical modelling of multiple weir removal in the Derwent Valley Mills world heritage site, UK	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The exploitation of river systems for power and navigation has commonly been achieved through the installation of a variety of in-channel obstacles of which weirs in Britain are amongst the most common. In the UK, the historic value of many of these features is recognised by planning designations and protection more commonly associated with historic buildings and other major monuments. Their construction, particularly in the north and west of Britain, has often been associated with industries such as textiles, chemicals, and mining, which have polluted waterways with heavy metals and other contaminants. The construction of weirs altered local channel gradients resulting in sedimentation upstream with the potential as well for elevated levels of contamination in sediments deposited there. For centuries these weirs have remained largely undisturbed, but as a result of the growth in hydropower and the drive to improve water quality under the European Union's Water Framework Directive, these structures are under increasing pressure to be modified or removed altogether. At present, weir modifications appear to be considered largely on an individual basis, with little focus on the wider impacts this might have on valley floor environments. Using a numerical modelling approach, this paper simulates the removal of major weirs along a 24-km stretch of the river Derwent, Derbyshire, UK, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The results suggest that although removal would not result in significant changes to the valley morphology, localised erosion would occur upstream of structures as the river readjusts its base level to new boundary conditions. Modelling indicates that sediment would also be evacuated away from the study area. In the context of the Derwent valley, this raises the potential for the remobilisation of contaminants (legacy sediments) within the wider floodplain system, which could have detrimental, long-term health and environmental implications for the river system. Worldwide, rivers have a common association with industry being the focus of settlement and development since the earliest civilisations with channel engineering a common practice. Therefore, the conceptual issues raised by this study have global resonance and are particularly important where heritage protection is less robust and structures can be removed with little consideration of the environmental consequences.																	0169-555X	1872-695X				SEP 15	2017	293		A				37	52		10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.05.009								WOS:000412257100004

The treatment system is integrating the EC and sedimentation process for reducing the land occupations and carrying out the dynamic experiments without a circulatory system for standing closer to the removal process of oilfield. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of operating parameters such as current density and treatment flow rate by measuring oil content and turbidity. The removal efficiency was found to be enhanced with a higher current density and lower flow rate. At a given optimal operating parameters, the oil and the turbidity removal was found to be 90%, 97%, respectively. Electric energy and electrode consumption were calculated to be 5.09 kWh/kg and 0.45 g/g. Even more fascinating, it found that the use of inclined tubes after the electrolytic reaction of EC can improve the deposition efficiency. The oil removal was 95%, increased by 2%-3% compared to the situation which is conducted without the inclined tubes. Finally, the inner diameter of the inclined tubes was explored and found that the most rational inside diameter is 20 mm. To summarize, a new kind of continuous-flow EC apparatus was found to be cost-effective and feasible in this work.																	1572-6657	1873-2569				SEP 15	2017	801						14	21		10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.07.017								WOS:000411847500003

The conventional DOC determination method consists of on-site sampling and subsequent analysis in a stationary laboratory. However, this method is difficult to operate in cases where no or only poorly equipped laboratories are available in the vicinity of the sampling points. The objective of the present study is to investigate and to optimize a newly developed DOC determination method as a core element of a portable device. In addition, a first validation of a laboratory setup of this DOC analyzer is conducted. This analytical method is based on a miniaturized electrolysis decomposition cell equipped with a boron-doped diamond electrode (BDD). Within this study, the decomposition of different organic compounds (e.g. aromatic, aliphatic, and heterocyclic compounds) under galvanostatic conditions in an undivided electrolytic cell is systematically investigated. Experimental data, including studies on the influence of process and hydrochemical parameters, demonstrate the general suitability of the technical approach for practical on-site applications. The key features are: no need for extern ultra-pure gases, catalysts or burning technology, a low level of maintenance, and an analyzing time per sample below 7 min.																	1572-6657	1873-2569				SEP 15	2017	801						43	48		10.1016/j.jelechem.2017.07.006								WOS:000411847500007

Identifying the spatial pattern and importance of hydro-geomorphic drainage impairments on unpaved roads in the northeastern USA	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Roads have been widely studied as sources of runoff and sediment and identified as pollutant production sources to receiving waters. Despite the wealth of research on logging roads in forested, upland settings, little work has been conducted to examine the role of extensive networks of rural, low-volume, unpaved roads on water quality degradation at the catchment scale. We studied a network of municipal unpaved roads in the northeastern US to identify the type and spatial extent of hydro-geomorphic impairments' to water quality. We mapped erosional and depositional features on roads to develop an estimate of pollutant production. We also mapped the type and location of design interventions or best management practices (BMPs) used to improve road drainage and mitigate water quality impairment. We used statistical analyses to identify key controls on the frequency and magnitude of erosional features on the road network, and GIS to scale up from the survey results to the catchment scale to identify the likely importance of unpaved roads as a pollutant source in this setting. An average of 21 hydro-geomorphic impairments were mapped per kilometer of road, averaging 0.3m(3) in volume. Road gradient and slope position were key controls on the occurrence of these features. The presence of BMPs effectively reduced erosion frequency. Scaled up to the watershed and using a conservative estimate of road-stream connectivity, our results for the Winooski River watershed in the northeastern US suggest that roughly 16% and 6% of the average annual sediment and phosphorus flux, respectively, of the Winooski River may be derived from unpaved roads. Our study identifies an under-appreciated source of water quality degradation in rural watersheds, provides insights into identifying hot spots' of pollutant production associated with these networks, and points to effectiveness of design interventions in mitigating these adverse impacts on water quality.

Headwater stream length dynamics across four physiographic provinces of the Appalachian Highlands	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Understanding patterns of expansion, contraction, and disconnection of headwater stream length in diverse settings is invaluable for the effective management of water resources as well as for informing research in the hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry of temporary streams. More accurate mapping of the stream network and quantitative measures of flow duration in the vast headwater regions facilitate implementation of water quality regulation and other policies to protect waterways. We determined the length and connectivity of the wet stream and geomorphic channel network in 3 forested catchments (<75ha) in each of 4 physiographic provinces of the Appalachian Highlands: the New England, Appalachian Plateau, Valley and Ridge, and Blue Ridge. We mapped wet stream length 7 times at each catchment to characterize flow conditions between exceedance probabilities of <5% and >90% of the mean daily discharge. Stream network dynamics reflected geologic controls at both regional and local scales. Wet stream length was most variable at two Valley and Ridge catchments on a shale scarp slope and changed the least in the Blue Ridge. The density and source area of flow origins differed between the crystalline and sedimentary physiographic provinces, as the Appalachian Plateau and Valley and Ridge had fewer origins with much larger contributing areas than New England and the Blue Ridge. However, the length and surface connectivity of the wet stream depended on local lithology, geologic structure, and the distribution of surficial deposits such as boulders, glacially derived material, and colluival debris or sediment valley fills. Several proxies indicate the magnitude of stream length dynamics, including bankfull channel width, network connectivity, the base flow index, and the ratio of geomorphic channel to wet stream length. Consideration of geologic characteristics at multiple spatial scales is imperative for future investigations of flow intermittency in headwaters.

Hydrophilic filter paper soaked in agarose solution was bounded by hydrophobic solid wax and then was coated with unmodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). AuNPs aggregation caused by methiocarb served as colorimetric response. We demonstrated detection capability of methiocarb both in solution- and substrate-based sensor. A good linear relationship was obtained between the colorimetric response and the concentration of methiocarb ranging from 20 to 80 ng mL(-1) with a limit of detection of 5 ng mL(-1). Excellent selectivity toward methiocarb was observed among various pesticides and cationic and anionic ions. Furthermore, the proposed assay could successfully detect methiocarb in paddy and tap water with satisfactory results.

About 7 indicators are considered, including ecological degradation intensity (EDI), hydrodynamic disturbance (IHD), engineering types, water quality, economic investment, population growth, and reclaimed land area. Meanwhile, an integrated framework enhanced methods in terms of (a) measuring intensity of ecological degradation process under multi-scale impact, (b) developing the indicator system of CRI, and discussing the driving forces and trends of coastal reclamation, (c) determining fuzzy preference relations of weight and calculating the specific value of CRI with the case study areas of Yellow River estuary from 2000 to 2015. As the result, the CRI has been expanded unceasingly in recent years. The total growth rate from 2000 to 2015 is about 37.97%. It is concluded that CRI has climbed to a higher intensity level in resent 15 years.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					27	37		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.05.065								WOS:000408076900015	28633950

The lagoons have similar physical and hydrological characteristics, but differ substantially in the degree of watershed urban development and nutrient loading rates. In total the lagoons experienced 22 storm events during the period studied. Specifically, we examine (1) whether there are influences on water quality in the lagoons from watershed development, (2) whether there are influences on water quality in the lagoons from storm activity, and (3) whether water quality is affected to a greater degree by watershed development versus storm activity. The two urbanized lagoons typically showed higher water-column nitrate, dissolved organic nitrogen, and phosphate compared with the non-urbanized lagoon. One of the urbanized lagoons had higher water-column chlorophyll a concentrations than the other two lagoons on most sampling dates, and higher light extinction coefficients on some sampling dates. The non-urbanized lagoon had higher water-column dissolved oxygen concentrations than other lagoons on many sampling dates. Our results suggest long-term influences of watershed development on coastal water quality. We also found some evidence of significant storm effects on water quality, such as increased nitrate, phosphate, and dissolved oxygen, and decreased salinity and water temperature. However, the influences of watershed development on water quality were greater. These results suggest that changes in water quality induced by human watershed development pervade despite the storm effects. These findings may be useful for environmental management since they suggest that storms do not profoundly alter long-term changes in water quality that resulted from human development of watersheds.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					207	216		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.038								WOS:000408076900033	28662980

Elucidation of seasonal variations of physicochemical and biological parameters with statistical analysis methods in Puducherry coastal waters	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The present investigation aimed to study the effect of monsoonal and anthropogenic influences on the water quality parameters of Puducherry coastal waters. Surface water sampling was performed at three fixed stations in four distinct seasons during 2011. Physical water quality parameters such as salinity and TSM showed strong seasonal and spatial variability. Evaporation and monsoonal runoff seem to be the major controlling forces for these parameters in the coastal waters. Seasonal distribution of the parameters showed a random pattern for nitrate and a well-defined pattern for silicate. Chl-alpha was minimum during monsoon when high TSM was encountered in the system. Moreover, factors that regulated the phytoplankton biomass varied with seasons. Moreover, TSM was strongly correlated with silicate. The relationship between Chl-alpha and nutrients were more consistent throughout the year, and much weaker correlations were noticed between Chl-alpha and TSM. Cluster analysis depicted the existence of a marked seasonal heterogeneity.

The results show that while salinity has undergone several shifts, seawater temperature exhibited a steady increasing trend since the 1980s. The observed salinity shows strong correlation with Shatt Al-Arab River discharge indicating primary contribution of freshwater to salinity among other factors (evaporation and desalination effluent). Recent data show that salinity is at its highest level in the last 30 years with less pronounced seasonal variability in response to severe decline in the freshwater runoff into the northwestern Arabian Gulf. The changes in hydrographic conditions may have significant implications on hydrodynamics, water quality, and ecosystems in the Gulf. Thus, cooperation among the concerned countries - both coastal and riparian nations - would be essential for prevention of further major changes in the Gulf.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				SEP 15	2017	122	1-2					488	499		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.056								WOS:000408076900069	28697945

Water quality effects of short-rotation pine management for bioenergy feedstocks in the southeastern United States	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Growing interest in renewable and domestically produced energy motivates the evaluation of woody bioenergy feedstock production. In the southeastern U.S., woody feedstock plantations, primarily of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), would be intensively managed over short rotations (10-12 years) to achieve high yields. The primary differences in managing woody feedstocks for bioenergy production vs for pull/-sawtimber production include a higher frequency of pesticide and fertilizer applications, whole-tree removal, and greater ground disturbance (i.e., more bare ground during stand establishment and more frequent disturbance). While the effects of pulp/sawtimber production on water quality are well-studied, the effects of growing short-rotation loblolly pine on water quality and the efficacy of current forestry Best Management Practices (BMPs) have not been evaluated for this emerging management system. We used a watershed-scale experiment in a before-after, control-impact design to evaluate the effects of growing loblolly pine for bioenergy on water quality in the Upper Coastal Plain of the southeastern U.S. Intensive management for bioenergy production and implementation of current forestry BMPs occurred on similar to 50% of two treatment watersheds, with one reference watershed in a minimally managed pine forest. Water quality metrics (nutrient and pesticide concentrations) were measured in stream water, groundwater, and interflow (i.e., shallow subsurface flow) for a two-year pre-treatment period, and for 3.5 years posttreatment. After 3.5 years, there was little change to stream water quality. We observed a few occurrences of saturated overland flow, but sediments and water dissipated within the streamside management zones in over 75% of these instances. Stream nutrient concentrations were low and temporal changes mainly reflected seasonal patterns in nitrogen cycling. Nitrate concentrations increased in groundwater posttreatment to <2 mg N L-1, and these concentrations were below the U.S. drinking water standard (10 mg N L-1). Applied pesticides were almost always below detection in streams and groundwater. Overall, these findings highlight that current forestry BMPs can protect stream water quality from intensive pine management for bioenergy in the first 3.5 years. However, groundwater quality and transit times need to be considered in these low-gradient watersheds of the southeastern U.S. that are likely to become an important location for woody bioenergy feedstock production.

Previous research identified that the dominant vegetation communities in ABZs are wet grassland and scrub habitats and that the vegetation communities are broadly determined by the soil type (peaty or mineral). One of the primary management options available to forest managers is whether to plant native broadleaves in the ABZ or leave them to be naturally colonised. The present study sought to determine the degree to which the vegetation of ABZs influences the composition and structure of associated aquatic macroinvertebrate communities and how this might inform their future management in particular the decision of whether to afforest the ABZ with broadleaf trees. The macroinvertebrate communities from stream on peaty and mineral soils with ABZs dominated by four vegetation communities were sampled, streams bordered by grassland habitats, scrub habitats, no ABZ i.e. conifer trees planted to the streams edge and control streams with no conifer forests in the vicinity. The results of this study showed that the composition and structure of the macroinvertebrate community varied significantly between streams on peaty and mineral soils, but was largely unaffected by the ABZ type. The differences between communities across soil type can be attributed to the lower abundance and richness of Ephemeroptera and conversely the higher abundance and richness of Plecoptera in streams on peaty soils. The lack of a consistent effect of ABZ type on the macroinvertebrate community illustrates the more dominant effect of water chemistry driven by soil type particularly episodic acidity.

Modeling washoff of total suspended solids in the tropics	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Washoff behavior in the tropics is expected to behave differently from temperate areas due to differences in rainfall characteristics. In this study, rainfall, runoff and total suspended solids (TSS) were monitored from 9 catchments distinguished by different types of land use, in Singapore. The catchments ranged in size from 5.7ha to 85.2ha. Over 120 rain events were studied and more than 1000 storm samples were collected and analyzed. Monte Carlo analysis was applied to obtain the best fit values of the washoff model parameters consisting the washoff coefficient c(3), washoff exponent c(4) and initial mass on surface Bini. The exponent c(4) was found to be approximately unity for all the events monitored, in agreement with other studies. The values of c(3) and B-ini were found to vary between events. Among all the rainfall and runoff characteristics studied, rainfall depth of the current event (d) was found to be the single parameter that significantly influenced the values of c(3) and B-ini. Contrary to expectations, B-ini did not correlate well with antecedent dry period or with rainfall depth of the prior storm event. The results show that the common modeling practice where B-ini is assumed to vary with antecedent dry period and previous rainfall depth should be reassessed when applied to catchments in the tropics. ANCOVA analysis showed that land use was not significant, but rather the variation of c(3) and B-ini with d was found to correlate well with the catchment area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the key blackening and stinking pollutants and their sources are still unclear. In this study, water quality of a black-stinking urban river in Beijing, Dongsha River, was evaluated firstly; then the distribution of the blackening and stinking pollutants was investigated, and the key pollutants and their potential sources were identified; and finally, the health risk of those pollutants was assessed. The results showed that NH3-N, total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand ranged from 1.3 to 5.3 mg/L, 0.7 -3.0 mg/L, 1.0-3.2 mg/L and 29-104 mg/L, respectively. The value of TP-based trophic level index indicated that Dongsha River reached severe eutrophication level; the maximum value of chroma and odor level reached 32 and 4, respectively. The main dissolved organic compounds included aromatic protein II, soluble microbiological metabolites, fulvic acids and humic acids. The blackening pollutants Fe, Mn, Cu and S2- were extensively detected, with significantly spatial differences along the river. Dimethyl sulfide, beta-ionone, 2-methylisoborneol and geosmin were identified to be the stinking pollutants. Their concentrations covered wide ranges, and even the lowest concentration value was thousands of times higher than its olfactory threshold. Correlation analysis indicated that in the overlaying water S2- was the key blackening pollutant, while beta-ionone and geosmin were the key stinking pollutants. Principal components analysis combining with the site survey revealed their potential sources. S2- was mainly associated with the decomposition of endogenous sulfur-containing organics; beta-ionone might be generated by the endogenous beta-carotene bio-conversion and the exogenous discharges, while geosmin might originate from the endogenous humus bio-conversion and anthropic wastes. Furthermore, multi metals in the sediment posed health risks to children, while dimethyl sulfide had non-cancer health risk for adults and children. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Giri, S; Qiu, ZY; Zhang, Z				Giri, Subhasis; Qiu, Zeyuan; Zhang, Zhen			A novel technique for establishing soil topographic index thresholds in defining hydrologically sensitive areas in landscapes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Hydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) are useful for analyzing a watershed. However, correct delineation of HSAs is critical for conducting such analysis. Scientifically defensible methods for delineating HSAs are lacking. The objectives of this study are to identify threshold soil topographic indices (STIs) based on the relationship between the observed soil moisture and the calculated STI in two sites using a trellis plot approach, and validate the identified threshold STIs in delineating HSAs in 15 watersheds in North Central New Jersey based on a linear mixed modeling of the relationship between land use and water quality at the watershed and HSA scales. Field soil moisture data are collected during April, May, June, July, August, and September for three years at Christie Hoffman Park and Fairview Farm in Central New Jersey. The linear mixed models assess the relationship between land use metrics in terms of percentages of land uses and three water quality indicators including total suspended solids, total nitrogen and total phosphorus in streams at both watershed and HSA scales. Trellis plot analyses based on a polynomial regression model of order of two to four identify the threshold STIs ranging from nine to 15 for delineating HSAs. The linear mixed modeling results indicate that the relationships between land use and three water quality indicators at the HSA scales are similar to their relationships at the watershed scale. The predictive powers of these HSA and watershed scale models are very similar. These results suggest that it is appropriate for policymakers and watershed managers to use HSAs rather than entire watersheds to characterize watersheds and devise management strategies to optimize resource uses. The novel technique developed in this study can be used in other parts of the world.

J	Lee, M; Kim, M; Kim, Y; Han, M				Lee, Minju; Kim, Mikyeong; Kim, Yonghwan; Han, Mooyoung			Consideration of rainwater quality parameters for drinking purposes: A case study in rural Vietnam	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Rainwater, which is used for drinking purposes near Hanoi, Vietnam, was analysed for water quality based on 1.5 years of monitoring data. In total, 23 samples were collected from different points within two rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs). Most parameters met the standard except micro-organisms. Coliform and Escherichia coli (E. coil) were detected when the rainwater was not treated with ultraviolet (UV) light; however, analysis of rainwater after UV sterilisation showed no trace of micro-organisms. The RWHSs appear to provide drinking water of relatively good quality compared with surface water and groundwater. The superior quality of the rainwater suggests the necessity for new drinking rainwater standards because applying all of the drinking water quality standards to rainwater is highly inefficient. The traditionally implemented standards could cause more difficulties for developing countries using RWHSs installed decentralized as a source of drinking water, particularly in areas not well supplied with testing equipment, because such countries must bear the expense and time for these measures. This paper proposes the necessity of rainwater quality guideline, which could serve as a safe and cost-effective alternative to provide an access to safe drinking water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Citizen science for water quality monitoring: Data implications of citizen perspectives	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Citizen science, where citizens play an active role in the scientific process, is increasingly used to expand the reach and scope of scientific research while also achieving engagement and educational goals. Despite the emergence of studies exploring data outcomes of citizen science, the process and experience of engaging with citizens and citizen-lead groups through participatory science is less explored. This includes how citizen perspectives alter data outcomes, a critical upshot given prevalent mistrust of citizen versus scientist data. This study uses a citizen science campaign investigating watershed impacts on water quality to interrogate the nature and implications of citizen involvement in producing scientifically and societally relevant data. Data representing scientific outcomes are presented alongside a series of vignettes that offer context regarding how, why, and where citizens engaged with the project. From these vignettes, six specific lessons are examined towards understanding how integration of citizen participation alters data outcomes relative to 'professional' science. In particular, elements of participant social identity (e.g., their motivation for participation), and contextual knowledge (e.g., of the research program itself) can shape participation and resulting data outcomes. Such scientific outcomes are particularly relevant given continued concerns regarding the quality of citizen data, which could hinder scientific acceptance of citizen sciences. Importantly, the potential for meaningful engagement with citizen and participants within citizen groups - given significant capacity within the community - represents a substantial and under-realized opportunity.

Transcriptomic approach for assessment of the impact on microalga and macrophyte of in-situ exposure in river sites contaminated by chlor-alkali plant effluents	WATER RESEARCH												Water quality degradation is a worldwide problem, but risk evaluation of chronic pollution in-situ is still a challenge. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of transcriptomic analyses in representative aquatic primary producers to assess the impact of environmental pollution in-situ: the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii were exposed 2 h in the Babeni Reservoir of the Olt River impacted by chlor-alkali plant effluent release resulting in increased concentrations of Hg and NaCl in receiving water. The response at the transcriptomic level was strong, resulting in up to 5485, and 8700 dysregulated genes (DG) for the microalga and for the macrophyte exposed in the most contaminated site, respectively. Transcriptomic response was congruent with the concentrations of Hg and NaCl in the water of the impacted reservoir. Genes involved in development, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, nutrition, and RedOx homeostasis were dysregulated during in-situ exposure of both organisms. In addition, genes involved in the cell motility of C. reinhardtii and development of the cell wall of E. nuttallii were affected. DG were in line with adverse outcome pathways and transcriptomic studies reported after exposure to high concentrations of Hg and NaCl under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Transcriptomic response provided a sensitive measurement of the exposure as well as hints on the tolerance mechanisms of environmental pollution, and is thus promising as an early-warning tool to assess water quality degradation.

Seabed gallery intakes: Investigation of the water pretreatment effectiveness of the active layer using a long-term column experiment	WATER RESEARCH												Seabed gallery intake systems used for seawater reverse osmosis facilities employ the same principle of water treatment as slow sand filtration in freshwater systems. An investigation concerning the effectiveness of the active layer (top layer) in improving raw water quality was conducted by using a long-term bench-scale columns experiment. Two different media types, silica and carbonate sand, were tested in 1 m columns to evaluate the effectiveness of media type in terms of algae, bacteria, Natural Organic Matter (NOM) and Transparent Exopolymer Particles (TEP) removal over a period of 620 days. Nearly all algae in the silica sand column, 87% (sigma = 0.04) of the bacteria, 59% (sigma = 0.11) of the biopolymer fraction of NOM, 59% (sigma = 0.16) of particulate and 32% (sigma = 0.25) of colloidal TEP were removed during the last 330 days of the experiment. Total removal was observed in the carbonate sand column for algal concentration, while the bacterial removal was lower at 74% (sigma = 0.08). Removal of biopolymers, particulate and colloidal TEP were higher in the carbonate column during the last 330 days with 72% (sigma = 0.15), 66% (sigma =0.08) and 36% (sigma = 0.12) removed for these organics respectively. Removal of these key organics through the 1 m thick column, representing the active layer, will likely reduce the rate of biofouling, reduce chemical usage and minimize operating cost in SWRO systems. The data show that the media will require several months at the beginning of operation to reach equilibrium so that high organic removal rates can be achieved. No development of a "schmutzdecke" layer occurred. The experimental results suggest that unlike freshwater slow sand filtration wherein most water treatment occurs in the upper 10 cm, in seawater systems treatment occurs throughout the full active layer depth of 1 m. The results of this study will help in designing and operating seabed gallery intake systems in varied geological conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of methods to sample fecal indicator bacteria in foreshore sand and pore water at freshwater beaches	WATER RESEARCH												Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are known to accumulate in foreshore beach sand and pore water (referred to as foreshore reservoir) where they act as a non-point source for contaminating adjacent surface waters. While guidelines exist for sampling surface waters at recreational beaches, there is no widely-accepted method to collect sand/sediment or pore water samples for FIB enumeration. The effect of different sampling strategies in quantifying the abundance of FIB in the foreshore reservoir is unclear. Sampling was conducted at six freshwater beaches with different sand types to evaluate sampling methods for characterizing the abundance of E. coli in the foreshore reservoir as well as the partitioning of E. coli between different components in the foreshore reservoir (pore water, saturated sand, unsaturated sand). Methods were evaluated for collection of pore water (drive point, shovel, and careful excavation), unsaturated sand (top 1 cm, top 5 cm), and saturated sand (sediment core, shovel, and careful excavation). Ankle-depth surface water samples were also collected for comparison. Pore water sampled with a shovel resulted in the highest observed E. coli concentrations (only statistically significant at fine sand beaches) and lowest variability compared to other sampling methods. Collection of the top 1 cm of unsaturated sand resulted in higher and more variable concentrations than the top 5 cm of sand. There were no statistical differences in E. coli concentrations when using different methods to sample the saturated sand. Overall, the unsaturated sand had the highest amount of E. coli when compared to saturated sand and pore water (considered on a bulk volumetric basis). The findings presented will help determine the appropriate sampling strategy for characterizing FIB abundance in the foreshore reservoir as a means of predicting its potential impact on nearshore surface water quality and public health risk.

However, the development of reliable WQMS is fatally constrained by severe contamination and biofouling of sensors due to the hostile analytical environment of wastewaters, especially raw sewages, that challenges the limit of existing sensing technologies. In this work, we report a technological solution to enable the development of WQMS for real-time abnormal event detection with high reliability and practicality. A vectored high flow hydrodynamic self-cleaning approach and a dual-sensor self-diagnostic concept are adopted for WQMS to effectively encounter vital sensor failing issues caused by contamination and biofouling and ensure the integrity of sensing data. The performance of the WQMS has been evaluated over a 3-year trial period at different sewage catchment sites across three Australian states. It has demonstrated that the developed WQMS is capable of continuously operating in raw sewage for a prolonged period up to 24 months without maintenance and failure, signifying the high reliability and practicality. The demonstrated WQMS capability to reliably acquire real-time wastewater quality information leaps forward the development of effective wastewater source management system. The reported self-cleaning and self-diagnostic concepts should be applicable to other online water quality monitoring systems, opening a new way to encounter the common reliability and stability issues caused by sensor contamination and biofouling.

Incidence of gastrointestinal illness following wet weather recreational exposures: Harmonization of quantitative microbial risk assessment with an epidemiologic investigation of surfers	WATER RESEARCH												We modeled the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) illness associated with recreational exposures to marine water following storm events in San Diego County, California. We estimated GI illness risks via quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) techniques by consolidating site specific pathogen monitoring data of stormwater, site specific dilution estimates, literature-based water ingestion data, and literature based pathogen dose-response and morbidity information. Our water quality results indicated that human sources of contamination contribute viral and bacterial pathogens to streams draining an urban watershed during wet weather that then enter the ocean and affect nearshore water quality. We evaluated a series of approaches to account for uncertainty in the norovirus dose-response model selection and compared our model results to those from a concurrently conducted epidemiological study that provided empirical estimates for illness risk following ocean exposure. The preferred norovirus dose-response approach yielded median risk estimates for water recreation-associated illness (15 GI illnesses per 1000 recreation events) that closely matched the reported epidemiological results (12 excess GI illnesses per 1000 wet weather recreation events). The results are consistent with norovirus, or other pathogens associated with norovirus, as an important cause of gastrointestinal illness among surfers in this setting. This study demonstrates the applicability of QMRA for recreational water risk estimation, even under wet weather conditions and describes a process that might be useful in developing site-specific water quality criteria in this and other locations.

In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to model streamflow, sediment, and pesticide diuron loading in the San Joaquinwatershed, a major contributing area to the elevated pesticide levels in the downstream Delta. The Sequential Uncertainty Fitting version 2 (SUFI-2) algorithm was employed to perform calibration and uncertainty analysis. A combination of performance measures (PMs) and standardized performance evaluation criteria (PEC) was applied to evaluate model performance, while prediction uncertainty was quantified by 95% prediction uncertainty band (95PPU). Results showed that streamflow simulation was at least "satisfactory" at most stations, with more than 50% of the observed data bracketed by the 95PPU. Sediment simulation was rated as at least "satisfactory" based on two PMs, and diuron simulation was judged as "good" by all PMs. The 95PPU of sediment and diuron bracketed about 40% and 30% of the observed data, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between the diuron loads, and precipitation, streamflow, and the current and antecedent pesticide use. Results also showed that the majority (>70%) of agricultural diuron was transported during winter months, when direct exposure of biocontrol agents to diuron runoff is limited. However, exposure in the dry season could be a concern because diuron is relatively persistent in aquatic system. This study not only provides valuable information for the development of biological weed control plan in the Delta, but also serves as a foundation for the continued research on calibration, evaluation, and uncertainty analysisof spatially distributed, physically based hydrologic models.

Escherichia coli attachment to model particulates: The effects of bacterial cell characteristics and particulate properties	PLOS ONE												E. coli bacteria move in streams freely in a planktonic state or attached to suspended particulates. Attachment is a dynamic process, and the fraction of attached microorganisms is thought to be affected by both bacterial characteristics and particulate properties. In this study, we investigated how the properties of cell surfaces and stream particulates influence attachment. Attachment assays were conducted for 77 E. coli strains and three model particulates (ferrihydrite, Ca-montmorillonite, or corn stover) under environmentally relevant conditions. Surface area, particle size distribution, and total carbon content were determined for each type of particulate. Among the three particulates, attachment fractions to corn stover were significantly larger than the attachments to 2-line ferrihydrite (p-value = 0.0036) and Ca-montmorillonite (p-value = 0.022). Furthermore, attachment to Ca-montmorillonite and corn stover was successfully modeled by a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) using cell characteristics as predictor variables. The natural logarithm of the net charge on the bacterial surface had a significant, positive, and linear impact on the attachment of E. coli bacteria to Ca-montmorillonite (p-value = 0.013), but it did not significantly impact the attachment to corn stover (p-value = 0.36). The large diversities in cell characteristics among 77 E. coli strains, particulate properties, and attachment fractions clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of using a static parameter or linear coefficient to predict the attachment behavior of E. coli in stream water quality models.

J	Pochai, N				Pochai, Nopparat			Unconditional stable numerical techniques for a water-quality model in a non-uniform flow stream	ADVANCES IN DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS												Two mathematical models are used to simulate water quality in a non-uniform flow stream. The first model is the hydrodynamic model that provides the velocity field and the water elevation. The second model is an advection-diffusion-reaction model that provides the pollutant concentration field. Both models are formulated as one-dimensional equations. The traditional Crank-Nicolson method is also used in the hydrodynamic model. At each step, the flow velocity fields calculated from the first model are the inputs into the second model. A new fourth-order scheme and a Saulyev scheme are simultaneously employed in the second model. This paper proposes a remarkably simple alteration to the fourth-order method so as to make it more accurate without any significant loss of computational efficiency. The results obtained indicate that the proposed new fourth-order scheme, coupled to the Saulyev method, does improve the prediction accuracy compared to that of the traditional methods.																	1687-1847					SEP 13	2017									286	10.1186/s13662-017-1338-4								WOS:000410483500003

Diatom abundance changed with concurrent shifts in water chemistry with dominance-diversity curves markedly skewed from a log-normal pattern. Canonical correspondence analysis segregated chloride-loving and calcifilous species from N-and P-favoured taxa. Despite pollution-induced reduction of diatom diversity, TEP production continued to rise plausibly due to dominance transference of TEP producers. However, with further increase in nutrient pollution, TEP declined. Since TEP enhances sedimentation removal of carbon, nutrients and heavy metals, the present study confirms one of the fundamental mechanisms that underline the self-purification capacity of River Ganga and has relevance from a biodiversity/river conservation perspective.																	0011-3891					SEP 10	2017	113	5					959	964		10.18520/cs/v113/i05/955-959								WOS:000409953500042

In this study, we used the dataset from the Global Livestock Impact Mapping System (GLIMS) in conjunction with country-specific annual livestock populations to reconstruct the manure nitrogen production during 1860-2014. The estimated manure nitrogen production increased from 21.4 TgN yr(-1) in 1860 to 131.0 Tg N yr(-1) in 2014 with a significant annual increasing trend (0.7 Tg N yr(-1), p < 0.01). Changes in manure nitrogen production exhibited high spatial variability and concentrated in several hotspots (e.g., Western Europe, India, northeastern China, and southeastern Australia) across the globe over the study period. In the 1860s, the northern midlatitude region was the largest manure producer, accounting for similar to 52% of the global total, while low-latitude regions became the largest share (similar to 48 %) in the most recent 5 years (2010-2014). Among all the continents, Asia accounted for over one-fourth of the global manure production during 1860-2014. Cattle dominated the manure nitrogen production and contributed similar to 44% of the total manure nitrogen production in 2014, followed by goats, sheep, swine, and chickens. The manure nitrogen application to cropland accounts for less than one-fifth of the total manure nitrogen production over the study period. The 5 arcmin gridded global dataset of manure nitrogen production generated from this study could be used as an input for global or regional land surface and ecosystem models to evaluate the impacts of manure nitrogen on key biogeochemical processes and water quality. To ensure food security and environmental sustainability, it is necessary to implement proper manure management practices on cropland across the globe.

Persistent Urban Influence on Surface Water Quality via Impacted Groundwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Growing urban environments stress hydrologic systems and. impact downstream water quality. We examined a third-order catchment that transitions from an undisturbed mountain environment into urban Salt Lake City, Utah. We performed synoptic surveys during al range of seasonal baseflow conditions and utilized multiple lines of, evidence to identify mechanisms by which urbanization impacts water quality. Surface water chemistry did not change appreciably until several kilometers into the urban environment, where concentrations of solutes such as, chloride and nitrate increase quickly in a gaining reach: Groundwater springs discharging in this gaining system demonstrate the role of contaminated baseflow from an aquifer in driving stream chemistry. Hydrometric and hydrochemical observations were used to estimate that the aquifer contains approximately 18% water sourced from the urban area. The carbon and nitrogen dynamics indicated the urban aquifer also serves as a biogeochemical reactor. The evidence of surface water groundwater exchange on a spatial scale of kilometers and time scale of months to years suggests a need to evolve the hydrologic model of anthropogenic impacts to urban water quality to include exchange with the subsurface. This has implications on the space and time scales of water quality mitigation efforts.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				SEP 5	2017	51	17					9477	9487		10.1021/acs.est.7b00271								WOS:000410255800007	28730814

Trees and Streets as Drivers of Urban Stormwater Nutrient Pollution	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Expansion of tree cover is a major management goal in cities because of the substantial benefits provided to people, and potentially to water quality through reduction of stormwater volume by interception. However, few studies have addressed the full range of potential impacts of trees on urban runoff, which includes deposition of nutrient-rich leaf litter onto streets connected to storm drains. We analyzed the influence of trees on stormwater nitrogen and phosphorus export across 19 urban watersheds in Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN, U.S.A., and at the scale of individual streets within one residential watershed. Stormwater nutrient concentrations were highly variable across watersheds and strongly related to tree canopy over streets, especially for phosphorus. Stormwater nutrient loads were primarily related to road density, the dominant control over runoff volume. Street canopy exerted opposing effects on loading, where elevated nutrient concentrations from trees near roads outweighed the weak influence of trees on runoff reduction. These results demonstrate that vegetation near streets contributes substantially to stormwater nutrient pollution, and therefore to eutrophication of urban surface waters. Urban landscape design and management that account for trees as nutrient pollution sources could improve water quality outcomes, while allowing cities to enjoy the myriad benefits of urban forests.

Quantifying Lake Water Quality Evolution: Coupled Geochemistry, Hydrodynamics, and Aquatic Ecology in an Acidic Pit Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Assessment of water quality evolution in the thousands of existing and future mine pit lakes worldwide requires new numerical tools that integrate geochemical, hydrological, and biological processes. A coupled model was used to test alternative hypothesized controls on water quality in a pit lake over years. The evolution of pH, Al, and Fe were closely linked; field observations were reproduced with generic solubility equilibrium controls on Fe(III) and Al and a commonly reported acceleration of the abiotic Fe(II) oxidation rate by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Simulations indicated an ongoing acidity loading at the site, and the depletion of Al mineral buffering capacity after similar to 5 years. Simulations also supported the existence of pH limitation on nitrification, and a limitation on phytoplankton growth other than the commonly postulated P and DIC limitations. Furthermore, the model reproduced the general patterns of salinity, pH, Al, and Fe during an uncontrolled river breach in 2011, however, incorporating sediment biogeochemical feedbacks is required to reproduce the observed postbreach internal alkalinity generation in the lake. The modeling approach is applicable to the study of hydrological, geochemical, and biological interactions for a range of lake and reservoir management challenges.

However, the detailed benefits and costs associated with integrated RTC have yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Built on state-of-the-art modeling and analytical tools, a three-step framework is proposed to develop integrated RTC strategies which cost-effectively maximize environmental outcomes. Results from a case study show integrated RTC can improve river quality by over 20% to meet the "good status" requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive with a 15% reduced cost, due to responsive aeration with changing environmental assimilation capacity. The cost-effectiveness of integrated RTC strategies is further demonstrated against tightening environmental standards (to the strictest levels) and against two commonly used compliance strategies. Compared to current practices (seasonal/monthly based operation), integrated RTC strategies can reduce costs while improving resilience of the system to disturbances and reducing environmental risk.

Integration of Tidal Prism Model and HSPF for simulating indicator bacteria in coastal watersheds	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Coastal water quality is strongly influenced by tidal fluctuations and water chemistry. There is a need for rigorous models that are not computationally or economically prohibitive, but still allow simulation of the hydrodynamics and bacteria sources for coastal, tidally influenced streams and bayous. This paper presents a modeling approach that links a Tidal Prism Model (TPM) implemented in an Excel-based modeling environment with a watershed runoff model (Hydrologic Simulation Program FORTRAN, HSPF) for such watersheds. The TPM is a one-dimensional mass balance approach that accounts for loading from tidal exchange, runoff, point sources and bacteria die-off at an hourly time step resolution. The novel use of equal high-resolution time steps in this study allowed seamless integration of the TPM and HSPF. The linked model was calibrated to flow and E. Coli data (for HSPF), and salinity and enterococci data (for the TPM) for a coastal stream in Texas. Sensitivity analyses showed the TPM to be most influenced by changes in net decay rates followed by tidal and runoff loads, respectively. Management scenarios were evaluated with the developed linked models to assess the impact of runoff load reductions and improved wastewater treatment plant quality and to determine the areas of critical need for such reductions. Achieving water quality standards for bacteria required load reductions that ranged from zero to 90% for the modeled coastal stream. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, the prefocusing of a particle mixture into a stream is an essential process to ensure all particles are subjected to the same electric field geometry in the separation region. However, accomplishing this focusing process either requires hydrodynamic squeezing, which requires an encumbering peripheral system and a complicated operation to drive and control the fluid motion, or depends on dielectrophoretic forces, which are highly sensitive to the dielectric characterization of particles. An alternative focusing technique, induced charge electro-osmosis (ICEO), has been demonstrated to be effective in focusing an incoming mixture into a particle stream as well as nonselective regarding the particles of interest. Encouraged by these aspects, we propose a hybrid method for microparticle separation based on a delicate combination of ICE() focusing and dielectrophoretic deflection. This method involves two steps: focusing the mixture into a thin particle stream via ICEO vortex flow and separating the particles of differing dielectic properties through dielectrophoresis. To demonstrate the feasibility of the method proposed, we designed and fabricated a microfluidic chip and separated a mixture consisting of yeast cells and silica particles with an efficiency exceeding 96%. This method has good potential for flexible integration into other microfluidic chips in the future.

Benthic community structure on coral reefs exposed to intensive recreational snorkeling	PLOS ONE												Chronic anthropogenic disturbances on coral reefs in the form of overfishing and pollution can shift benthic community composition away from stony corals and toward macroalgae. The use of reefs for recreational snorkeling and diving potentially can lead to similar ecological impacts if not well-managed, but impacts of snorkeling on benthic organisms are not well understood. We quantified variation in benthic community structure along a gradient of snorkeling frequency in an intensively-visited portion of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef. We determined rates of snorkeling in 6 water sections and rates of beach visitation in 4 adjacent land sections at Akumal Bay, Mexico. For each in-water section at 1-3 m depth, we also assessed the percent cover of benthic organisms including taxa of stony corals and macroalgae. Rates of recreational snorkeling varied from low in the southwestern to very high (> 1000 snorkelers d(-1))in the northeastern sections of the bay. Stony coral cover decreased and macroalgal cover increased significantly with levels of snorkeling, while trends varied among taxa for other organisms such as gorgonians, fire corals, and sea urchins. We conclude that benthic organisms appear to exhibit taxon-specific variation with levels of recreational snorkeling. To prevent further degradation, we recommend limitation of snorkeler visitation rates, coupled with visitor education and in-water guides to reduce reef-damaging behaviors by snorkelers in high-use areas. These types of management activities, integrated with reef monitoring and subsequent readjustment of management, have the potential to reverse the damage potentially inflicted on coral reefs by the expansion of reef-based recreational snorkeling.																	1932-6203					SEP 5	2017	12	9							e0184175	10.1371/journal.pone.0184175								WOS:000409282800059	28873449

Prioritizing Crop Management to Increase Nitrogen Use Efficiency in Australian Sugarcane Crops	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Sugarcane production relies on the application of large amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer. However, application of N in excess of crop needs can lead to loss of N to the environment, which can negatively impact ecosystems. This is of particular concern in Australia where the majority of sugarcane is grown within catchments that drain directly into the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Multiple factors that impact crop yield and N inputs of sugarcane production systems can affect N use efficiency (NUE), yet the efficacy many of these factors have not been examined in detail. We undertook an extensive simulation analysis of NUE in Australian sugarcane production systems to investigate (1) the impacts of climate on factors determining NUE, (2) the range and drivers of NUE, and (3) regional variation in sugarcane N requirements. We found that the interactions between climate, soils, and management produced a wide range of simulated NUE, ranging from similar to 0.3 Mg cane (kg N)(-1), where yields were low (i.e., <50 Mg ha(-1)) and N inputs were high, to >5 Mg cane (kg N)(-1) in plant crops where yields were high and N inputs low. Of the management practices simulated (N fertilizer rate, timing, and splitting; fallow management; tillage intensity; and in-field traffic management), the only practice that significantly influenced NUE in ratoon crops was N fertilizer application rate. N rate also influenced NUE in plant crops together with the management of the preceding fallow. In addition, there is regional variation in N fertilizer requirement that could make N fertilizer recommendations more specific. While our results show that complex interrelationships exist between climate, crop growth, N fertilizer rates and N losses to the environment, they highlight the priority that should be placed on optimizing N application rate and fallow management to improve NUE in Australian sugarcane production systems. New initiatives in seasonal climate forecasting, decisions support systems and enhanced efficiency fertilizers have potential for making N fertilizer management more site specific, an action that should facilitate increased NUE.

N-P Fertilization Stimulates Anaerobic Selenium Reduction in an End-Pit Lake	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Selenium (Se), an essential micro nutrient, is toxic to aquatic life at slightly higher water concentrations. Watersheds receiving leachate from selenium rich sources require large-scale, long-term treatment to mitigate Se toxicity. We applied the principles of anaerobic bacterial bioreactors, previously successful in small scale Se mitigation, to a whole end-pit lake ecosystem. Fertilization of the lake with N and P increased primary production, creating a meromictic, anoxic layer, and enhanced the habitat for locally present, anaerobic, Se and sulfur reducing bacteria. Within two years, Se concentrations were reduced ten-fold, reaching water-quality guideline values. The successful experiment demonstrated a novel treatment of large volumes of Se-contaminated water, and introduced an inexpensive method to mitigate a persistent aquatic pollutant of global concern.

J	Laguela, EP; Flores, RM				Perez Laguela, Elena; Marban Flores, Raquel			The impact of transnational mining companies activity on the water footprint: The case of DET in Chile	REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS REGIONALES												Natural resource scarcity is causing environmental depletion. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of existing regulation to protect the environment, which allows multinational companies to reduce their manufacturing costs without taking responsibility for the impact of their activity on the environment. This is the case of transnational mining corporations in Latin America, which utilize large amounts of water without being obliged to monitor their production processes. Hence, this article aims to analyze the impact of this form of production in order to prove the need to implement policies that promote sustainable development within the region. To this end, this article tries to offer an initial approach to the economic valuation of water usage in the Division El Teniente (DET) copper mine in central Chile. The proposed methodology is based on the concept of the Water Footprint and its different indicators that, combined, help the reader get a better conception of the broad picture. On the basis of the study carried out by Garces Valenzuela, which is more focused on the engineering insights of the casuistry, we propose to supplement it with the analysis of the socio-economic impact of the production process within the mine. So, in calculating the economic value of the Water Footprint, we pretend to go beyond the economistic outlook brought forward by mainstream Economics, and to associate the ecological and socio-economic views on the case at issue. The economic value of the Water Footprint is calculated by linking the amount of blue and grey Water Footprint of the DET copper mine to the average monthly price of water along the three years covered by the study (2008, 2009 and 2010). As the value of the Water Footprint is very sensitive to the seasonal availability of water, its economic value should capture these cyclical specificities and the erratic evolution of water usage along a year, far from the image of strict stability of natural processes posited by mainstream Economics. Once the copper price is calculated with and without the effect of the Water Footprint in it, both cases can be compared, and we can proceed to evaluate the actual impact that the Water Footprint (which is a corollary of the impacts that human activities have on the environment) has on the final price of copper (which, with its market price, only considers the production costs, and not the environmental damage caused during its production process). From our results, it can be deduced that, indeed, there is a seasonal difference on water usage and, hence, that the mentioned seasonal difference should be taken into account when assessing the actual economic price of copper. Grey Water Footprint values are dominated by the hydrological cycle, generating higher values during austral winter months. Conversely, the Grey Water Footprint values register lower values during the austral summer, due to the effect of lower rainfall. Thus, the real copper price we propose fluctuates along with the water usage to depict a more realistic price trend: one that contains (at least) a dimension of environment depletion, such as water usage in production processes. The way the current economic model is designed, the price of copper worldwide ends up reaching a more or less stable number. However, if the cost of the Water Footprint is included in the final price, it makes the final price vary constantly depending on, on the one hand, climatic or environmental issues and, on the other hand, on the impact of the extraction processes on water quality. This implies that the price of copper increases as the impact on the Water Footprint of the industry at stake increases, or depending on the season of the year in which the mineral is extracted. Thus, the analysis presented here draws from the studies based on net income and user cost (insofar as they measure the depletion of resources by their use, discounting the net base of natural resources available for future years after that use) with an emphasis on hysteresis processes and the way it determines the price of copper, according to which the current price is defined by the way it has been reached. In other words: the dependence of the price on its history. Hence the importance of considering variables such as the Water Footprint that account for the available resource base, its depletion, existing reserves and degradation of the resource, measured in terms of environmental impact. Taking into account all of the above, the new "variable" price (which would include the Water Footprint) could have two indirect positive effects on supply and demand. On the one hand, increasing the price of copper in the international market could reduce its consumption (as long as the entire extractive industry of the world copper included the water footprint in the price). By increasing the price, the consumer could be more aware of the impact that the production of a good has on the environment, raising social awareness and turning its consumption into something more sustainable in the medium and long term. On the other hand, companies, by raising the price of copper, would be more interested in introducing new technologies to reduce water consumption, so that this would impact on the final price of the product and the environment. This reduction of total water consumption would positively revert in terms of productivity for these companies, which could even provide copper ore at more competitive prices while respecting the sustainability of the environment. All this leads us to think that these holistic valuation procedures could give way to a new reality, more in line with the scarcity of natural resources that could contribute to changing the current model of production and consumption. In this sense, we would approach the idea advocated by many economists on the need for a change in the economic model based on degrowth in a way that it reorganizes production and uses natural resources reasonably. However, the other possible output resulting from the normalization of the economic valuation of natural resources and their adoption by mainstream Economics is very similar to that embraced by other raw materials and natural resources that have been endowed with economic value: its absorption within the financializing tendencies of the capitalist system and its assimilation within the derivatives markets governed by speculation. In the end, choosing one outcome or another ends up being an option of politicy management. This is why, in the face of the threat of water becoming an object of commercialization in competitive markets (which would inhibit its characteristics as a special good, and would be dominated by those agents who could influence its price), policy makers should consider whether it would be ethical for water to go from being a common good to being a commodity.																	0213-7585					SEP-DEC	2017		110					133	173										WOS:000434068600005						
J	Singh, B; Sihag, P; Singh, K				Singh, Balraj; Sihag, Parveen; Singh, Karan			Modelling of impact of water quality on infiltration rate of soil by random forest regression	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												In this paper, Infiltration rate of the soil is investigated by using predictive models of Random forest regression and their performance were compared with Artificial neural network (ANN) and M5P model tree techniques. A dataset consists of 132 field measurements were used. Out of 132 observations randomly selected 88 observations were used for training, whereas remaining 44 were used for testing the model. Input variables consist of cumulative time (T-f), type of impurities (I-t), concentration of impurities (C-i), and moisture content (Wc) whereas the infiltration rate was considered as output. Correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative absolute error (RAE) and root relative square error (RRSE) were considered to compare the performance the both modelling approaches. The result of evolution suggests that Random forest regression approach works well than the other two models (ANN and M5P model tree). The estimated value of infiltration rate using Random forest regression lies within +/- 25% error lines. Sensitivity analysis suggests that cumulative time is an important parameter for predicting the infiltration rate of the soil.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				SEP	2017	3	3					996	1001		10.1007/s40808-017-0347-3								WOS:000432245400010

This deposited on soil, plants and in the water, further contributing to human exposure and It mixes in the blood and pumped all-around the body. The most important air pollutants found over Delhi were sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxides (NO2) and suspended particulate matter (SPM). Statistical and wavelet analysis of these air pollutants at three different sample sites two residential namely Janakpuri, Nizamuddin, and one industrial namely Shahazada Bagh over Delhi for the more than 20 year period from 1987 to 2010 in India have been studied. The results shown that the mean concentration of SO2 decreased for both residential (Janakpuri, Nizamuddin) as well as industrial (Shahzada Bagh) area, whereas NO2 increased but it is under the prescribed limits of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Janakpuri and Nizamuddin represent almost equal but lower mean values of SO2 concentration than Shahzada Bagh. SO2, NO2 and SPM at all sites depicts symmetrical and platykurtic behaviour except Shahzada bagh, for that it follows leptokurtic. Discrete wavelet analysis of air pollutants using Daubechies wavelet (level 5) have been calculated for the study. It is also observed that the values at five different levels of signal data for all air pollutants varies between -225 and +225.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				SEP	2017	3	3					1178	1189		10.1007/s40808-017-0366-0								WOS:000432245400025

It was considered specifically those located in "Agropecuaria Cantarrana", "Gualberto", "Cocollar", "Lisieux", and "Las Acacias" farms, in order to determine whether the evaluated parameters meet the allowed values for the current Venezuelan Legislation. Based on the results obtained, in general it was observed that all parameters evaluated comply with the permitted limits in terms of quality, except for microbiological analysis related to the levels of total coliforms fulfilled only for "Cantarrana" processor. While other producers fail to comply with this quality parameter, being quite evident in the case of the "Cocollar" processor whose water had the highest levels for these pathogens (240 for the Most Probable Number/100 mL index), which are indicative of microbiological contamination.																	1390-4272					SEP	2017	10	24			SI		99	108		10.29076/issn.2528-7737vol10iss24.2017pp99-108p								WOS:000424556400011

Thus, the central objective was to analyze the access to water, as a fundamental right, in the face of the concept of citizenship. The methodology was developed from access to secondary data and bibliographic research. Thus, it can be affirmed that the contemporary Democratic State of Law has not been able to universalize access to water, although legal instruments and public policies have been formulated and implemented, presenting a framework of injustice that imposes on the most vulnerable the lack of water supply, intermittent supply, poor water quality, and lack of basic sanitation.																	1806-3845	2179-8699				SEP-DEC	2017	14	30					269	291		10.18623/rvd.v14i30.1114								WOS:000423921100013

Environmental effects monitoring of surface marine sediments in Sydney Harbor indicated significantly higher PAH concentrations during the first year of remediation monitoring compared to baseline. This was equivalent to PAH loadings of similar to 2,000 kg over a 15-month period. Increases in sediment PAH concentrations raised serious concerns for regulators, who requested cessation of remediation activities early in the $400M (CAD) project. Historically, the STPs were reported as the primary source of PAH contamination in Sydney Harbor with estimated discharges of 300 to 800 kg/year between 1989 and 2001. Mass flux estimates of PAHs and metal(loid)s and PAH diagnostic ratios were used to evaluate if increases in PAH concentrations in marine sediments were the result of the STPs remediation activities. PAH mass flux estimates approximated that 17 to 97 kg/year were discharged from the STPs during three years of remediation and were corroborated by an independent PAH flux estimate of 119 kg in year 1. PAH fluxes to the Sydney Harbor were mostly surface water derived, with groundwater contributing negligible quantities (0.002-0.005 kg/year). Fluxes of metal(loid) s to harbor sediments were stable or declining across all years and were mirrored in sediment metal(loid) concentrations, which lacked temporal variation, unlike total PAH concentrations. Flux results were also corroborated using PAH diagnostic ratios, which found a common source of PAHs. Coal combustion was likely the principal source of PAHs and not migration from the STPs during remediation. Although short-term residual sediment PAH increases during onset of remediation raised concerns for regulators, calls for premature cessation of remediation early in the project were unwarranted based on only one year of monitoring data. Mass flux estimates and forensic assessments using PAH diagnostic ratios proved useful tools to inform remediation decision making that helped environmental protection and reduced costs associated with lost cleanup time.																	1051-5658	1520-6831				FAL	2017	27	4					9	17		10.1002/rem.21525								WOS:000423925100002

Valves must be closed, creating DMAs, resulting in hydraulic changes and increasing the number of dead ends. A field study of five pilot DMAs was conducted using an enhanced sampling program. Water quality was measured at different locations inside and outside DMA boundaries before and after implementation. Overall water quality did not change following DMA implementation. However, water quality (chlorine residuals, turbidity, and metals) was degraded at locations with elevated water residence times such as created dead ends, sites outside DMA boundaries, and extremities. An approach based on the combination of hydraulic modeling and water quality was developed to predict trihalomethane concentrations in the DMA using measurements only from an inlet site. Utilities can use a combination of hydraulic modeling and targeted monitoring to predict water quality changes after DMA implementation.																	2164-4535					SEP	2017	109	9					E363	E380		10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.0099								WOS:000422943100001

Influence of Different Habitat Factors on Creek Chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) within Channelized Agricultural Headwater Streams	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Natural history information on habitat relationships of Semotilus atromaculatus (Creek Chub) in channelized agricultural headwater streams in the northeastern region of North America is limited. We hypothesized that Creek Chubs within channelized agricultural headwater streams would be more strongly influenced by instream habitat than other physical and chemical habitat variables. We sampled Creek Chubs and measured watershed characteristics, riparian habitat characteristics, geomorphology, instream habitat characteristics, and water chemistry in 14 channelized agricultural headwater streams in central Ohio from 2006 to 2011. We found that the abundance, mean length, and biomass of Creek Chub were most strongly influenced by watershed characteristics (land use, soil type) and geomorphology (channel shape, channel size). Our results indicate that conservation and restoration practices designed to mitigate physical habitat degradation are most likely to benefit Creek Chub within channelized agricultural headwater streams.																	1092-6194	1938-5307				SEP	2017	24				8		18	44										WOS:000419391200003

Therefore, in this study, a hydrodynamics model of an actual dam reservoir in three dimensions for simulating a real dam reservoir flows for summer season is created. The model is developed using nonlinear and unsteady continuity, momentum, energy and k-epsilon turbulence model equations. In order to include the Coriolis force effect on the flow in a dam reservoir, Coriolis force parameter is also added the model equations. Those equations are constructed using actual dimensions, shape, boundary and initial conditions of the dam and reservoir. Temperature profiles and flow visualizations are used to evaluate flow conditions in the reservoir. The model successfully simulates the formation of density currents and the thermal characteristics of the reservoir system for seasonal heat exchanges. Model simulations results obtained for summer season are compared with field measurements obtained from gauging stations founded on the dam reservoir. The results are found to be in accordance with the actual values measured. This investigation can be also useful for sedimentation studies, water quality modeling and management, and habitat assessment in a reservoir.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				SEP	2017	16	9					2009	2024										WOS:000419141100009

There were evident spatial variations of the heavy metal concentrations downstream and upstream of the three cascade dams; the heavy metal pollutions were higher downstream of the Xiaowan Dam and upstream of the Manwan Dam. The mean concentrations of As, Cd, Pb, and Zn were higher than the background values in soil in Yunnan Province in China, and the maximum coefficient of variation of Cd reached 81%. Comparison results of two toxicity guidelines showed that the adverse effects in three cascade dams were not very high; there exists some relatively high pollution level sample sites, which were sufficiently high to cause adverse effects. The calculated geo-accumulation index (I-geo) results indicate that the investigated sediments can be classified as "unpolluted" with Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, and Pb, "moderately polluted" with Cd, and "unpolluted to moderately polluted" with As. Except for Cd (moderately pollution indices), all other six heavy metals varied more or less in the range of the local natural background concentrations. This pollution condition can be seen as a good sign for the dam environment. 44%, 26%, 30% of sample sites, which were located in the river center downstream of the Manwan Dam, exhibited low, moderate, and high ecological risks of heavy metal pollution and a decreasing trend of potential ecological risk Z(1) (downstream of Xiaowan and upstream of the Manwan Reservoir) were higher than those in Z(2) (downstream of Manwan and upstream of the Dachaoshan Reservoir). The calculated Eir mean values of the potential ecological risk for individual heavy metals is ordered as Cd>As>Pb>Cu>Ni>Zn>Cr. The principal component analysis result showed two primary components explaining 92.83% of the total variance. Zn, Cu, Cd, As, and Pb were considered to be "anthropogenic heavy metal loads,"while Cr and Ni were related to represent "natural heavy metal loads."																	1582-9596	1843-3707				SEP	2017	16	9					2075	2087										WOS:000419141100015

With the excess influx of nutrients from human activities, the eutrophication process begins and causes a breeding ground for algae. The amount of nutrients present in any given cycle will be higher than the levels present in previous cycles. Therefore, it is very important to manage water quality in lakes and dams to prevent and to slow or to reverse the eutrophication process. This can be ensured by using effective and comprehensive tools for prediction and modeling of eutrophication in a water resource. In this study, Support Vector Machines (SVM) were first used for eutrophication classification in the third largest dam (Dez) in the world. The technique of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as an input pre-processing method, was used to reduce the number of input variables in the model. The technique was found to be effective in reducing the number of input variables from 20 to 4 (TP, TN, DO, temperature). Subsequently, the model support vector machine classifier was developed using these four variables. The results showed the important role of preprocessing variables by PCA. An accuracy of 98% was achieved by the SVM classification method, which demonstrated the potential effect of eutrophication classification, and consequently showed its ability for pattern recognition of this phenomenon. Modeling with SVM technique can be attractive with high accuracy, especially for monitoring the quality of water in reservoirs. Additionally, the method can be used as a tool to develop new management approaches.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				SEP	2017	16	9					2139	2146										WOS:000419141100021

Therefore, samples were collected from76 wells, in this region, for the purpose of the aquifer water quality assessment, identification of changing process of pollution and statistical analysis of quality parameters included NTU, TDS, Nitrates and Chloride. Afterwards, maps for each parameter were produced in the geographic information system (GIS) using scientific methods. Thereupon, situation and condition of water quality was measured by quality mapping index of NSFWQ and was applied for whole the basin. This maps and database, which were created by the software, provide and offer an obvious view of what happened in the study area. As a result, it could be applied for a better management of these water resources and planning to prevent further pollution, by relevant organizations.																	2476-3055					SEP	2017	3	9					779	793		10.21859/cej-030914								WOS:000418087400014						
J	Buchanan, GA; Belton, TJ; Paudel, B				Buchanan, Gary A.; Belton, Thomas J.; Paudel, Bhanu			The Comprehensive Barnegat Bay Research Program	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												A comprehensive ecosystem research strategy was developed and initiated for the Barnegat Bay-Little Egg Harbor (BB-LEH) estuary in New Jersey, United States. This multiyear program (2011-15) examined several environmental management issues and questions involving concerns with water quality (e.g., nutrients) and the health of this ecosystem (e.g., eutrophication). Multiple projects ranging from the assessment of phytoplankton to fish to wetlands, as well as hydrodynamic/water quality and ecosystem modeling, were conducted each year to fill in critical data gaps and to define the bay's baseline condition for future comparisons (e.g., a nuclear generating station on the bay with a once-through cooling system will close in 2019). Issues of concern for environmental agencies and the public include nuisance jellyfish; excess nutrients; benefits of conservation zones; and the status of fish, crab, and shellfish populations. Three projects examined the potential for developing biological indicators of nutrient (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) effects. Three other projects studied the unique habitat features (i.e. salt marshes, sedge islands, submerged aquatic vegetation beds) in BB-LEH that may need protection and/or restoration. Ecosystem baseline conditions were examined by six projects, and data were used in the Ecopath-Ecosim model to predict potential future changes in the biomass of major biological groups and species using specific scenarios (i.e. closure of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, reducing nutrient inputs and fishery management plans). Noteworthy is the collection of these data pre- and post-Superstorm Sandy, which made landfall a few kilometers south of the estuary in 2012. The subsequent 19 papers in this special issue provide an in-depth examination of these areas of concern, the results of which are exceedingly relevant to the management of this and other estuarine systems.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		1	6		10.2112/SI78-001.1								WOS:000417480200001

Barnegat Bay and its tributaries were evaluated for multiple water quality metrics and from various perspectives. The nutrient concentrations and loadings from the tributaries in the northern watershed are higher than those from the tributaries in the southern portion of the watershed. Within Barnegat Bay, higher nitrogen concentrations were observed in the northern portion, while higher total phosphorus (TP) concentrations occurred in the southern portion. Daily variability of water quality at certain locations was observed from the results of intensive sampling events (six samples per day over 4 consecutive days of sampling). Analysis of multiple years of data suggests that water quality has not varied significantly year to year from 2011 to 2015. Violation of the existing applicable numeric criterion was identified for dissolved oxygen, TP, and turbidity within some assessment units in Barnegat Bay and its watershed. A comparison made between these data and the targets used by other estuaries in the NE United States related to nutrient criteria found that portions of the bay would not achieve the water quality thresholds used by these other estuaries.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		7	21		10.2112/SI78-002.1								WOS:000417480200002

Data evaluated spanned from the 1970s through July of 2013. Trends were evaluated after regionalizing sampling locations into 17 geographic zones. Over 1700 sampling stations within freshwater and Bay zones provided over 280,000 data results for 20 parameters. The parameters evaluated include: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, nutrients, indicator bacteria, and solids. Temperature data comparing the 1970s with the present show statistically significant increasing trends in 13 of 17 zones during the summer months. Seven of those zones also saw increasing temperatures in at least one other season. Increasing trends were also seen for salinity in 8 of the 10 estuarine zones for two or more seasons. Potentially related to the increasing trends in salinity and temperature, DO concentrations were often decreasing or unchanged. Significant decreases in DO concentration can be seen in 12 of the 17 zones for one or more seasons. The pH was shown to be increasing in 10 of the 17 zones during one to four seasons. Four zones experienced a decreasing trend in pH, but only during one to two seasons. The interpretation of the nutrient data over this long time period proved to be a challenge, with multiple species of nitrogen and phosphorus reported but often with insufficient data to draw significant conclusions. Where data were sufficient, nutrient results were mixed, with many zones showing no changes in trends.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		22	33		10.2112/SI78-003.1								WOS:000417480200003

Toward a Comprehensive Water-Quality Modeling of Barnegat Bay: Development of ROMS to WASP Coupler	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) has been coupled with the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) to be used in a comprehensive analysis of water quality in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. The coupler can spatially aggregate hydrodynamic information in ROMS cells into larger WASP segments. It can also be used to resample ROMS output at a finer temporal scale to meet WASP time-stepping requirements. The coupler aggregates flow components, temperature, and salinity in ROMS output for input to WASP via a hydrodynamic linkage file. The coupler was tested initially with idealized cases designed to verify the water mass balance and conservation of constituent mass using one-to-one and one-to-many connectivity options between segments. A realistic example from the Toms River embayment, a subdomain of Barnegat Bay, was used to demonstrate the functionality of the coupling. A WASP eutrophication model accounting for dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrogen, and constant phytoplankton concentrations was applied to explore the distribution and trends in DO and nitrogen in the embayment for the period of July-August 2012. Results of DO modeling indicate satisfactory agreement with measurements collected at in-bay stations and also indicate that this coupled approach, despite substantial differences in spatiotemporal discretization between the models, provides adequate predictive capabilities.

Synchronized phytoplankton and water-quality data collected between August 2011 and August 2013 from the Barnegat Bay Water Quality Monitoring Program were used as calibration data set. The results showed that one-fifth of samples were from the least-impaired habitat condition, with low turbidity and low concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and orthophosphate (PO4). Nearly 60% of samples were from undesirable conditions with poor water clarity and excess nutrients. Phytoplankton reference communities, in comparison with communities in impaired conditions, were characterized with low concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl a), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), low Chl a/C ratio, low summer picoplankton biomass, and high spring and summer dissolved oxygen. Thirty-four metrics were evaluated for their ability to discriminate between the least-impaired and impaired habitat conditions. Nine phytoplankton metrics and three physiological and chemical metrics, which showed strong discriminatory ability, were selected, and different combinations of these metrics were used to create phytoplankton indices for spring and summer mesohaline and polyhaline zones in BB-LEH. The current P-IBI was able to correctly classify 64-100% for spring samples and 68-88% for summer samples in the calibration data set. Our work is the first attempt to develop a P-IBI for this region. The calculated reference communities and P-IBI, though constrained because of limited data availability, were region specific and intended to facilitate water-quality assessment and management efforts in BB-LEH. The differences of TN and TP between the least-impaired and impaired conditions in most of season-salinity zones suggested that dual reduction of N and P are necessary to control eutrophication in BB-LEH. Further work on the refinement of the P-IBI is underway as additional phytoplankton and water-quality data are being collected and assessed.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		89	105		10.2112/SI78-009.1								WOS:000417480200009

Zooplankton Community Dynamics in a Western Mid-Atlantic Lagoonal Estuary	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Zooplankton are an integral component of the food web in estuarine ecosystems. The most recent studies of zooplankton in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, occurred almost 40 years ago. Since then, this coastal lagoon estuary has been affected by anthropogenic impacts that threaten its ecological integrity, including nutrient enrichment, algal blooms, alterations of freshwater inputs, and extensive development around the bay and its watershed. Assessing the zooplankton community in this ecosystem provided updated information on the status of this important component of the bay's living resources. Zooplankton samples were collected from the upper meter of the water column with horizontal surface net tows using bongo plankton nets monthly during the winter and twice a month during spring, summer, and fall. Sites were located along a longitudinal transect in the bay. Data included abundance and distribution of copepods, gelatinous macrozooplankton, bivalves, and decapods. The zooplankton community was characterized by strong spatial, seasonal, and interannual trends in abundance and diversity. Spatial variability is most apparent between the northern and southern sections of the bay. The northern bay was characterized by higher nitrogen and chlorophyll a; high abundances of copepods, ctenophores, and barnacle larvae; and lowest species diversity. Alkalinity, phosphate, and species diversity were higher in the southern bay. This was a typical pattern for the study, remaining stable even between seasons. It is apparent that direct and/or indirect effects of weather and climate affect zooplankton abundance in Barnegat Bay. Such sensitivity to changes in weather patterns has the potential to cause long- term shifts in the zooplankton community as a result of climate change.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				FAL	2017					78		141	168		10.2112/SI78-012.1								WOS:000417480200012

On the outflow of Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Lake Maracaibo, an important wet coastal area located in the Caribbean Sea, is connected to the Gulf of Venezuela by a narrow, shallow channel known as Barra de Maracaibo. The water quality of this is poor owing to the very low water rate exchange with the Gulf. The authors make use of sea surface temperature (SST) satellite imagery and numerical modelling to study the conditions of the outflow of Lake Maracaibo. The lake is found to be fully driven by the circulation out of the lake. Three different situations are considered: upwelling, no upwelling, and the transient state between them. The authors propose conceptual and numerical models to explain the conditions for outflow. Moreover, it is found that outflow is possible only when the tradewinds stop and before the warmer waters of the Caribbean have reached the Colombian coasts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

The water quality was assessed using the Water Quality Index by Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE-WQI) and classified according to the Malaysia Interim National Water Quality Standard (INWQS). Six water quality parameters embedded in the DOE-WQI were dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, ammoniacal nitrogen (AN) and total suspended solid (TSS). In addition, this study also examined the changes in water quality over the past 10 years by comparing the present water quality to the previous works. The overall mean WQI value obtained was 84.0 which indicate that the Sungai Setiu basin is in clean condition and all measured water quality parameters gave value within the permissible limits of the INWQS classification except for pH which fall in Class III. It can be concluded that water quality in Sungai Setiu does not varies greatly over a decade. Hence continuous monitoring is needed to improve the water quality and minimize water pollution.																	0126-6039					SEP	2017	46	9					1513	1520		10.17576/jsm-2017-4609-21								WOS:000417356900021

An Affordable Microsphere-Based Device for Visual Assessment of Water Quality	BIOSENSORS-BASEL												This work developed a prototype of an affordable, long-term water quality detection device that provides a visual readout upon detecting bacterial contamination. This device prototype consists of: (1) enzyme-releasing microspheres that lyse bacteria present in a sample, (2) microspheres that release probes that bind the DNA of the lysed bacteria, and (3) a detector region consisting of gold nanoparticles. The probes bind bacterial DNA, forming complexes. These complexes induce aggregation of the gold nanoparticles located in the detector region. The nanoparticle aggregation process causes a red to blue color change, providing a visual indicator of contamination being detected. Our group fabricated and characterized microspheres made of poly (epsilon-caprolactone) that released lysozyme (an enzyme that degrades bacterial cell walls) and hairpin DNA probes that bind to regions of the Escherichia coli genome over a 28-day time course. The released lysozyme retained its ability to lyse bacteria. We then showed that combining these components with gold nanoparticles followed by exposure to an E. coli-contaminated water sample (concentrations tested-10(6) and 10(8) cells/mL) resulted in a dramatic red to blue color change. Overall, this device represents a novel low-cost system for long term detection of bacteria in a water supply and other applications.																	2079-6374					SEP	2017	7	3							31	10.3390/bios7030031								WOS:000417385900008	28783063

As such, the overall goal of this study is to provide a better understanding of the changing trends in water supply and demand balance, their impacts on food production, and government policy responses. The results show that water scarcity in China is a regional issue, mainly in northern areas. This is reflected in the limited and uneven distribution of water resources, decline of surface water resources, depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of water quality and increasing water demand. Climate change has further aggravated water scarcity in several river basins in northern China, resulting in the reduction of irrigated areas and a fall in food production. Consequently, the Chinese government has tried to control total water withdrawal, improve water use efficiency, and control water pollution. While these policy responses are encouraging, their effectiveness in resolving the growing water scarcity in China needs to be examined.																	2211-9124					SEP	2017	14						9	17		10.1016/j.gfs.2017.01.003								WOS:000417151100002

This lake is one of the clear water lakes in Olsztyn, but the progressive deterioration of water quality has been observed during recent years. The phosphorus concentration in the water-sediment interface, phosphorus fractions quantity and the amount of components which can bind this element was investigated in the upper (0-5 cm) layer of deposits. The aim of study was to analyze the potential influence of bottom sediment on the lake water quality. The obtained results revealed that the bottom sediment of Tyrsko Lake can be classified as mixed, silica-organic type, with a relatively high content of iron (over 4% Fe in d.w.). The total phosphorus content was ca. 3.5 mg P g(-1) d.w. on average. Phosphorus in the bottom sediment was bound mainly with organic matter (NaOH-nrP fraction), which had over 50% share in TP. Highly mobile fractions (NH4-Cl-P and BD-P) together only included ca. 5% to 7% TP. The obtained results show that the bottom sediment of Tyrsko Lake can bind phosphorus quite effectively. The calculated internal mineral phosphorus loading during summer stagnation period was 10.9 kg and it was lower that the assessed annual external phosphorus load (22.6 kg). The assessed annual phosphorus loading from both sources was still lower than the critical load according to Vollenweider criteria. However, due to the fact that the internal loading phenomenon is occurring in the lake, it should be taken into consideration that the lake water quality can deteriorate gradually during the longer time perspective. These findings should be accounted for in the future if the potential protection and restoration procedures will be developed.

The main tasks of both reservoirs are to improve the water balance by means of regulating the levels and water outflow. Three characteristic measurement and control points were selected on both reservoirs in accordance to the water flow in the longitudinal section. The first and third points were located near the inflow and outflow of water, while the second in the middle of the reservoirs. Samples of water for the study were collected from the surface layer of the shore zone of the reservoirs once a month from March 2015 to February 2017 (water from two hydrological years was analyzed). Water samples were subject to determination of total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chlorophyll "a" concentrations, as well as turbidity. Contamination of the water reservoirs with biogenic compounds is a common problem and at the same time difficult to eliminate due to the scattered nature of external sources of pollution, especially in the case of agricultural catchments, as well as the inflow of untreated sewage from areas directly adjacent to the reservoirs. Based on achieved results, high values of TSI (TN), TSI (TP), TSI (Chl), and overall TSI, clearly indicate the progressive degradation of water quality in analyzed reservoirs. Appearing water blooms due to the mass development of phytoplankton adversely affect the quality of water in the reservoirs and biochemical processes occurring both in water and bottom sediments, are conditioned by progressive eutrophication.																	2299-8993					SEP	2017	18	5					160	167		10.12911/22998993/74627								WOS:000416835200020

Analyses of physicochemical indices revealed that waters along the whole length of the stream qualified for below good status due to the exceeded EC and nitrate nitrogen concentrations. It was found that among 21 analyzed physicochemical indices, statistically significant differences occurred for 5: total dissolved solids, SO42-, Mg2+, K+ and water pH. In the headwaters section values of four salinity indices were significantly higher in relation to the other part of the stream. Assessment of anthropogenic factors affecting the catchment water resources conducted on the basis of unitary and percent indices revealed that the dominant category shaping the physicochemical status of the Korzkiewka stream water is municipal economy. The intensity of the influence of the factors from this category was from medium to very high, while in case of sewage discharged through the sewage network, even to outlier intensity. Forestry and agriculture exerted medium pressure, whereas the factors from the industry category had hardly any influence on water in the stream.

Benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage along a pollution gradient in the Steelpoort River, Olifants River System	AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY												The Steelpoort River is affected by a wide range of pollutants resulting from mining, industrial and agricultural activities and domestic sewage. Benthic macroinvertebrates are often used to assess water quality as they respond to changes in the aquatic environment. The study was to assess the benthic macroinvertebrate communities in the Steelpoort River along a pollution gradient, from less polluted upstream to highly polluted downstream. The impacted downstream sites generally had the highest turbidity, total dissolved solids (TDS) and conductivity values but lowest dissolved oxygen. While the upstream sites generally exhibited low turbidity, TDS and conductivity values but high dissolved oxygen. The physical and chemical changes between sites were accompanied by shifts in macroinvertebrate community composition. The sensitive macroinvertebrate families such as Baetidae, Leptophlebiidae and Perlidae dominated the upstream sites with low water turbidity, low conductivity, low TDS, and high dissolved oxygen while the tolerant families such as Chironomidae, were abundant in highly impacted downstream sites with high water turbidity, high conductivity, high TDS, and low dissolved oxygen. The study revealed differences in physico-chemical parameters, and in the composition of the macroinvertebrate community. Hence, changes in the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates reflected the longitudinal pollution gradient in the river.																	1021-3589	1026-4914				SEP	2017	25	2					445	453		10.4001/003.025.0445								WOS:000416721900018

Data from 30 surveyed sampling sites over the lake water in June 2016 and May 2017 demonstrated the appropriateness of S2A green-red band ratio (band 3 versus band 4) for estimating Chla. This was shown through a strong correlation of corresponded field measured reflectance ratio with Chla by an exponential curve (r(2) = 0.68; the mean standard error of the estimates corresponding to 5% of the mean value of in situ Chla). The small error between in situ Chla, and estimated Chla from S2A acquired concurrently, confirmed the S2A green-red band ratio as the most suitable option for monitoring Chla in Lake Ba Be water. Resultant Chla distribution maps over time described a partially-seasonal pattern and also displayed the spatial dynamic of Chla in the lake. This allows a better understanding of the lake's limnological processes to be developed and provides an insight into the factors that affect lake water quality. The results also confirmed the potential of S2A to be used as a free tool for lake monitoring and research due to high spatial resolution data (10 m pixel size).

J	Alfredo, KA; Russo, TA				Alfredo, Katherine A.; Russo, Tess A.			Urban, agricultural, and environmental protection practices for sustainable water quality	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Sustainable water management often emphasizes water resource quantity, with focus on availability and use practices. However, only a subset of the available water may be usable when also considering water quality. Water quality management is examined within three broad sectors-urban, agriculture, and environmental systems-to investigate how water quality sustainability (WQS) is defined by each and across the three sectors. The definitions determined for both urban and agricultural WQS mention downstream human and ecosystem use; however, regulatory policy does not always support these definitions. This challenge of managing water quality locally and downstream, coupled with interactions across multiple sectors, has led to a fragmented approach to water quality management. Legislation typically divides water quality management into compartments without considering the entire system. Within the United States, there is an uneven distribution of responsibility regarding water quality protection, and notable policies which counteract efforts to improve water quality. The review suggests that despite a growing intention to use a single system approach where water is considered as a limited resource that must supply all competing interests, one does not yet exist and is even hindered by current policies and regulations. Recent policy is signaling a shift toward increasing interagency coordination; however, the basic definitions of WQS remain disconnected across sectors. It is the conclusion of this review that sustainable water quality is not currently practiced in the United States.

This study aimed to apply the P index model at the Posses catchment, south of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. We applied the P index for the current land use at the Posses catchment and for two hypothetical scenarios: scenario 1, in which P fertilizer was applied to all land uses, except for native forests; and scenario 2, which considered the use of P fertilizer as in scenario 1, and that the Environmental Protection Areas referring to the riparian forests and springs were totally restored. Considering current land use, almost the whole catchment area (91.4%) displayed a low P loss risk. The highest P index was associated to croplands and eucalyptus plantations. Regarding scenario 1, areas under pasture fell into the low (15.1%), medium (45.5%), high (27.1%) and very high (12.3%) P index categories. Environmental Protection Areas on scenario 2 decreased the P loss risk from the scenario 1 in 37.6%. Hence, the model outputs indicate that the reforestation of buffer zones can decrease P loss risk in the case increasing use of P fertilizer. The P index model is a potential support tool to promote judicious use of fertilizers and conservation practices at the Posses catchment.

In this study, totally, 270 samples were taken and analyzed for evaluating the amount of outcome nitrate. The results showed that the trend of removing nitrate decreased in terms of increasing the passing water volume and loading rate in both systems. While the altitude of ion-exchange column increased due to the up-flow, the removal efficiency of nitrate increased continuously. In the down-flow resin, the efficiency of the system was gradually reduced while increasing the height of resin up to 60 cm; whereas the system efficiency increased at the resin height of 60-90 cm. The efficiency of both ion-exchange systems were affected as a result of the some factors including volume of passing water, resin height, and loading rate at high, medium, and low levels, respectively. Overall, to achieve the sufficient water quality, it is required to consider the height of resin and amount of passing water volume to reach the cost and effectiveness of the system.					fazlzadeh, mehdi/0000-0001-9512-6025												1944-3994	1944-3986				SEP	2017	89						127	135		10.5004/dwt.2017.20942								WOS:000415823400014						
J	Jajaga, E; Ahmedi, L				Jajaga, Edmond; Ahmedi, Lule			C-SWRL: A Unique Semantic Web Framework for Reasoning Over Stream Data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEMANTIC COMPUTING												The synergy of Data Stream Management Systems and Semantic Web applications has steered towards a new paradigm known as Stream Reasoning. The Semantic Web standards for knowledge base modeling and querying, namely RDF, OWL and SPARQL, has extensively been used by the Stream Reasoning community. However, the Semantic Web rule languages, such as SWRL and RIF, have never been used in stream data applications. Instead, different non-Semantic Web rule systems have been approached. Since RIF is primarily intended for exchanging rules among systems, we focused on SWRL applications with stream data. This proves difficult following the SWRL's open world semantics. To overcome SWRL's expressivity issues we propose an infrastructure extension, which will enable SWRL reasoning with stream data. Namely, a query processing system, such as C-SPARQL, was layered under SWRL to support closed-world and time-aware reasoning. Moreover, OWLAPI constructs were utilized to enable non-monotonicity, while SPARQL constructs were used to enable negation as failure. Water quality monitoring was used as a validation domain of the proposed system.																	1793-351X	1793-7108				SEP	2017	11	3			SI		391	409		10.1142/S1793351X17400165								WOS:000412119100008

Using the standing, filtration and lab-designed multi-layer filtration methods, the feasibility of source water purification was investigated herein. The yield of BAC was 58.02 to 90.59%. The iodine value (362-891 mg/g) of BAC was higher than that (277 mg/g) of BC. After treatment by the standing and the nitration methods, except for turbidity and total bacterial count, the other tested items could reach drinking water quality standards. The lab-designed multi-layer filtration method designated with filter paper, BC, BAC and filter paper as the 1st, 2nd, 3 rd and 4th filter-layer individually located in the glass funnel with 5 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 2 mL/min of flow rate to purify the source water. The turbidity, total hardness, nitrite nitrogen, coliform, and total bacterial count of the treated water resulted in 1.30 NTU, 89.02 mg/L, 0.05 mg/L, 0.00 CFU/mL and 26.00 CFU/mL, and reached drinking water quality standards in Taiwan. In the Ames tests, the residual bacteria rate of the cytotoxicity for source water and the treated water was higher than 80% of the control, indicating a lack of cytotoxicity. The mutagenicity of both was not over spontaneous revertants of the control group by more than two times, signifying no mutagenicity. The BAC offers the potential development of water quality purification, and with the multi-layer filtration method has the consulted value of purification from source water.																	0023-6152					SEP	2017	62	2					459	467										WOS:000415393300021

The one from Korea is called the Yongdam dam watershed in the Geum river basin with watershed area of 930 km (2), the other from Japan is called the Nakama watershed in the Onga river basin with watershed area of 925 km (2). The 3 discharge, 2 water quality stations from Korea and 14 discharge, 2 water quality stations from Japan were selected and analyzed to determine flow durations. Korean data were collected during 2000 to 2013 from water management information system. Japanese rainfall and discharge data were collected during 1980 to 2013 from water information system. Numbers of station-year were 38 on Korea and 436 on Japan. Annual rainfalls were averaged to 1418.1 mm ranged from 778.2 mm to 2061.9 mm on Korea and 1972.5 mm ranged from 845.0 mm to 3623.0 mm on Japan, from which Japanese showed more 1.39 times than Korean. Streamflow data were generated daily by the ONE (One parametric New Exponential) hydrological model. Simulated annual streamflows were averaged to 854.2 mm ranged from 273.6 mm to 1571.4 mm on Korea and 1481.6 mm ranged from 360.6 mm to 3177.4 mm on Japan, from which Japanese showed 1.73 times more than Korean. The flow durations with 10 year frequency were compared, in which the 1st flows were 18.77 mm in Korea and 88.27 mm in Japan, the 95th flows of 0.43 and 3.97, the 185th of 0.13 and 1.92, the 275th of 0.06 and 0.93, and the 355th of 0.05 and 0.30, respectively. Japanese flows were 4 to 15 times more than Korean. On the other hand, mean flow durations showed the 1st flows of 67.11 mm and 88.27, the 95th of 1.58 and 3.97, the 185th of 0.51 and 1.92, the 275th of 0.21 and 0.93, and the 355th of 0.08 and 0.30, respectively. Japanese flows also showed 1.3 to 4.4 times more than Korean. Mean annual runoff ratios were 58.2% ranged from 35.2% to 76.2% on Korean river, and 73.7% from 42.6% to 90.0% on Japanese river. Japanese runoff ratio also showed 1.27 times more than Korean. This result shows some more necessities and difficulties on low flow management in Korean river than in Japanese river.																	0023-6152					SEP	2017	62	2					483	492										WOS:000415393300024

The one from Korea is called the Yongdam dam watershed in the Geum river basin, and the other from Japan is called the Nakama watershed in the Onga river basin. The 2 water quality stations from Korea and 2 stations from Japan within each watershed were selected and water quality concentration data were collected to determine load durations, respectively. The relationships between discharge and water pollution load on BOD, COD, SS, TN, and TP were derived, and water pollution loads were estimated on a daily basis in each water quality station. And means of LDCs in each country were drawn and compared with each other. Summarizing the estimated daily water pollution loads and the results of LDCs, it was concluded that TMDL showed 1.49 times higher BOD, 1.11 times higher COD, 4.95 times higher SS, 1.43 times higher TN in Korean and the same TP, and 1st load in LDC showed 1.81 to 6.14 times higher in Korean, and remaining 95th, 185th, 275th, and 285th loads in LDC showed 1.30 to 15.43 times higher in Japanese. Specific loads were expressed with daily mean in the period of each flow duration interval, and were compared with each other between Korea and Japan, of which results were shown with 1.836 similar to 8.063 times higher to Korea in high flows, and with 1.119 similar to 8.169 times higher to Japan in other flows except SS, TN values in moist conditions. Comparing an annual sum, BOD load was 1.16 times higher in Korea, COD 1.113 in Korea, SS 4.891 in Korea, TN 1.446 in Korea, and TP was same. Evaluating with 10 year frequency, Korea showed 1.041 similar to 2.360 times higher loads than Japan except TP in high flows, Japan 1.175 similar to 14.226 times higher than Korea except TN in low flows. Annual sum showed that BOD load was 1.517 times higher in Japan, COD 1.564 in Japan, SS 1.408 in Korea, TN 1.008 in Korea, and TP 2.383 in Japan. From the above result, it was concluded that Korean river was getting more water pollution loads than Japanese river in high flow interval, but in other flow interval was higher to Japan in general.																	0023-6152					SEP	2017	62	2					493	502										WOS:000415393300025

Detecting invertebrate species in archived collections using next-generation sequencing	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												Invertebrate biodiversity measured at mostly family level is widely used in biological monitoring programmes to assess anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems. However, next-generation sequencing (NGS) could allow development of new more sensitive biomonitoring tools by allowing rapid species identification. This could be accelerated if archived invertebrate collections and environmental information from past programmes are used to understand species distributions and their environmental responses. In this study, we take archived macroinvertebrate samples from two sites collected on multiple occasions and test whether NGS can successfully detect species. Samples had been stored in 70% ethanol at room temperature for up to 12 years. Three amplicons ranging from 197 to 274 bps within the DNA barcode region were amplified from samples and compared to DNA barcoding libraries to identify species. We were able to amplify partial DNA barcodes from most samples, and species were often detected with multiple amplicons. However, some singletons and taxa poorly covered by DNA barcoding were missed. This suggests additional DNA barcodes will be required to fill 'gaps' in current DNA barcode libraries for aquatic macroinvertebrates and/or that it may not be possible to detect all taxa in a sample. Furthermore, older samples often detected fewer taxa and were less reliable for amplification, suggesting NGS is best used on samples within 8 years of collection. Nevertheless, many common taxa with existing DNA barcodes were reliably identified with NGS and were often present at sites across multiple years, showing the potential of NGS for detecting common and abundant species in archived material.																	1755-098X	1755-0998				SEP	2017	17	5					915	930		10.1111/1755-0998.12644								WOS:000415921600008	27987268

One cave species, macroinvertebrates, represents a heterogeneous group of animal taxa which is in constant danger of extinction, principally due to anthropogenic activities. Macroinvertebrates have been widely used as bioindicators of the quality of biogeographic zones, ecosystems, and protected areas, as well as to determine protected species. The Boca del Rio Cave is located in the biogeographic transition zone in Mexico's Neotropical region, and is home to a large enclave of different biotic elements. Twenty-nine organisms were collected and grouped into 19 families based on their morphological and physiological characteristics. The coefficient of taxonomic work (CTW) indicates that the taxonomic level family is the most consistent for all of the organisms collected. The Coenagronidae family was the most abundant in the study. The BMWP, ASPT, and SCI biotic index scores indicate that the water in the Boca del Rio Cave is slightly contaminated, while the Family Biotic Index (FBI) indicates poor water quality with very substantial organic pollution. The diversity of macroinvertebrate families confirms that the Boca del Rio Cave serves as an important refuge for fauna in the transition zone located in Mexico's Nearctic biogeographic region. This report represents the first study to use bioindicators to analyze the water quality of a cave system, and contributes to the inventories of macroinvertebrate cave fauna.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				SEP-OCT	2017	8	5					5	17		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-05-01								WOS:000416180300001

Two samplings were conducted and their physicochemical and microbiological parameters were measured in order to obtain a pattern sample and a problem sample. The pollution level in the section of the basin studied was evaluated based on the water quality index (ICA, Spanish acronym), the National Sanitation Foundation Index (NSFI), and the Dinius Index. A comparative analysis of the indices demonstrated significant river deterioration from the burning of tires around the basin. The quality ranged from average to very poor, requiring treatment for human consumption and even specific treatment processes to remove hazardous pollutants such as phenolic compounds and heavy metals. In addition, the values of most of the parameters exceeded the acceptable limits established by Colombia's environmental regulations on water for human and domestic use, preservation of wildlife, and livestock and agriculture. The results of this study indicate that the water's physiochemical properties were greatly affected by the products that were generated by burning tires.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				SEP-OCT	2017	8	5					39	55		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-05-03								WOS:000416180300003

In Mexico, shrimp represents a significant source of the income generated by aquaculture. Since the success of shrimp farming depends on good water quality, its monitoring is essential. This work presents a new computational model to assess the water quality of large shrimp ponds (Litopenaeus vannamei). An artificial neural network (ANN) was used to create a water quality index, with which a mathematical relationship can be established between the dynamics of environmental parameters and different water quality conditions (excellent, good, average, and poor). Four parameters that were important for the habitat were selected: temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and pH. The results show that the proposed model performs well and efficiently, as compared to other evaluation models used for this purpose. The evaluations demonstrate that ANN is a good option for evaluating and detecting optimal and undesirable conditions, contributing to good water management for this type of farming.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				SEP-OCT	2017	8	5					71	89		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-05-05								WOS:000416180300005

The present paper uses Arima (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) to predict influent and effluent water quality in a constructed wetland, as well as its pollutant removal efficiency. The wetland is located on the campus of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogota, Colombia. Arima prediction values were based on time series obtained with UV-Vis spectrometry probes. These predictions were found to be adequate for the first 12 hours of the water quality time series for the three data sets analyzed: influent, effluent, and efficiency. Overall, none of the data had prediction errors over 15%. In separate analyses of the relative predictive errors in influent and effluent values, they were found to be less significant for UV wavelengths than for the visible range (Vis). In addition, the variability in this type of error was less for the UV range than for the Vis range, which indicates that Arima is a suitable prediction method for analyzing pollutants that fall in the UV range.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				SEP-OCT	2017	8	5					127	139		10.24850/j-tyca-2017-05-09								WOS:000416180300009						
J	Aryal, N; Reba, ML				Aryal, Niroj; Reba, Michele L.			Continuous Instream Monitoring of Nutrients and Sediment in Agricultural Watersheds	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS												Pollutant concentrations and loads in watersheds vary considerably with time and space. Accurate and timely information on the magnitude of pollutants in water resources is a prerequisite for understanding the drivers of the pollutant loads and for making informed water resource management decisions. The commonly used "grab sampling" method provides the concentrations of pollutants at the time of sampling (i.e., a snapshot concentration) and may under-or overpredict the pollutant concentrations and loads. Continuous monitoring of nutrients and sediment has recently received more attention due to advances in computing, sensing technology, and storage devices. This protocol demonstrates the use of sensors, sondes, and instrumentation to continuously monitor in situ nitrate, ammonium, turbidity, pH, conductivity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) and to calculate the loads from two streams (ditches) in two agricultural watersheds. With the proper calibration, maintenance, and operation of sensors and sondes, good water quality data can be obtained by overcoming challenging conditions such as fouling and debris buildup. The method can also be used in watersheds of various sizes and characterized by agricultural, forested, and/or urban land.																	1940-087X					SEP	2017		127							e56036	10.3791/56036								WOS:000415370200048	28994782

Diets consisted of replacing 209 g kg(-1) fishmeal at 0, 33, 66, and 100% SPC. Shrimp were raised in a biofloc system using twelve experimental units stocked with 250 shrimp m(-3) under constant aeration (O2>5mg L-1) and temperature (29 +/- 0.5 degrees C). No significant differences among treatments were observed based on water quality parameters. Shrimp fed diets with 0 and 33% substitution exhibited the highest weekly growth (1.88 and 1.79 g per week) and final weights (15.2 and 14.7 g) compared with shrimp fed the 66 and 100% replacement. A lower feed intake was observed for shrimp fed the 33% SPC diet (3.18 kg per experimental unit) compared with 0% replacement (3.62 kg). Shrimp fed the 33% replacement achieved a similar performance and lower feed intake than animals fed diet without replacement.																	1806-9290					SEP	2017	46	9					705	713		10.1590/S1806-92902017000900001								WOS:000415388200001						
J	Wang, ZJ; Yue, FJ; Zeng, J; Li, SL				Wang, Zhong-Jun; Yue, Fu-Jun; Zeng, Jie; Li, Si-ang			The influence of urbanization on karst rivers based on nutrient concentration and nitrate dual isotopes: an example from southwestern China	ACTA GEOCHIMICA												China is experiencing rapid urbanization that has changed the water quality of rivers, especially nutrient loads. In this study, a typical urban river located in a karst area, Chengguan River, was chosen to explore the influence of urbanization on river ecosystems based on nutrient concentration and nitrate isotopes. The results show monthly variability of water chemistry and nutrient concentration. Nutrient concentration in two tributaries and the mainstem showed significant spatial variability, with heavy N and P pollution in one tributary near a suburban area, indicating a response to different levels of urbanization. Measurements of nitrate dual isotopes suggest that volatilization, assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification all occur in the polluted river. Water chemistry and nitrate isotopes show that major nitrogen sources included domestic waste and agricultural input, such as chemical fertilizer and manure. The results suggest that urbanization increases nutrient concentrations and accelerates the riverine nitrogen dynamic, and point to the need to manage point sources of sewage effluents to improve the water quality of urban rivers in southwestern China.

This is especially true for Beijing, where groundwater is an important source for urban water supply. In this study, statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, principal component analysis, and Piper-Tri-linear diagram, were used in analyzing the temporal and spatial variations of the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater based on monitored data from the southern plain of Beijing, China. Results indicated consistent changes of groundwater's hydrochemical characteristics in different aquifers in the study area. The percentage of HCO3- in total anion increased significantly in the groundwater, and hydrochemical water type evolved gradually from Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4 based to Ca-Mg-HCO3 based from period 2005-2007 to period 2013-2015. In shallow groundwater, the concentration of Na+, Ca2+, SO42-, HCO3-, and total dissolved solids (TDS) increased from period 2005-2007 to period 2013-2015, and the greatest change came from HCO3-, rising from 428.93 to 528.96 mgL(-1). The changes of main ionic concentrations in the deep groundwater were consistent with those in the shallow groundwater for both periods. However, the variations in deep groundwater were less than those in shallow groundwater. The temporal and spatial variations of hydrochemical characteristics reflect the groundwater quality in the study area. This study could facilitate decision-making process on the protection of groundwater resources to ensure its sustainable utilization.																	2305-7068					SEP	2017	5	3					235	248										WOS:000415044100003

Egrinya			Extractability and bioavailability of phosphorus in soils amended with poultry manure co-composted with crop wastes	JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION												Intensive livestock production and poor agricultural management have resulted to excessive loading of soil with phosphorus (P), thereby contributing to environmental pollution and impairment of water quality. A study was carried out to determine the extractability and bioavailability of P in soils treated with poultry litter (PL) co-composted with sugarcane and cabbage wastes. The manure was applied based on total P contents at 200 and 400 kg P ha(-1), with maize (Zea mays L.) as the test crop. The co-composted PL increased maize growth relative to PL alone with the best growth occurring at the treatment rate of 400 kg P ha(-1). Maize biomass and available P in soil varied in the order PL co-composted with sugarcane waste and cabbage waste (%) 50 > 33 > 25 > 0. Phosphorus contents in maize shoot were higher in sandy clay than silt loam soil and its recovery was higher in soil treated with PL co-composted sugarcane waste than co-composted with cabbage waste. An amendment with co-composted PL increased the extractable P fractions and P availability in the soils. The P fractions in the postharvest soils varied in the order HCl-P > H2O-P > NaHCO3-P > NaOH-P and the fractions were significantly higher in the sandy clay than the silt loam soil. Also, the PL co-composted with sugarcane waste exhibited higher levels of P fractions in soils than co-composted with cabbage waste. Thus, co-composting poultry manure with crop wastes would better improve plant growth and P nutrition than sole-composted manure.																	0718-9516					SEP	2017	17	3					609	623										WOS:000414530300005

Temporal Variation of Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus in Surface Waters from the Lower Coruh River Basin, Turkey	ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A					3rd International Conference on Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering (ICCESEN)	OCT 19-24, 2016	Antalya, TURKEY					The aim of this study is to monitor and assess the surface water quality in the Lower Coruh River Basin, northeast Turkey. Several key water-quality indicators were measured: total nitrogen, total phosphate phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, and chlorophyll a (Chl a). In situ monitoring and the surface water sampling studies in the Coruh River, the Murgul Stream, and the Borcka Dam Lake were conducted monthly during a period of one year. On an annual basis, the Coruh River had a little bit higher total nitrogen concentration ranging from 0.335 mg/l to 1.300 mg/l, but a little bit lower chemical oxygen demand concentration varying between 2.66 mg/l and 9.12 mg/l, compared to Murgul Stream. Total phosphate phosphorus concentration was almost the same throughout the lower basin and was about 0.090 mg/l. Chl a concentration, which was 1.422 mu g/l in Coruh and 1.062 mu g/l in Murgul, had shown an increasing trend and reached 3.193 mu g/l in the Borcka Dam Lake. The measured results reveal that the Coruh River and the Murgul Stream have high-quality water, considering total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand, but slightly polluted water regarding total phosphate phosphorus, with reference to the Turkish Surface Water Quality Regulation. The Borcka Dam Lake was classified as oligotrophic in terms of Chl a, mesotrophic in terms of total nitrogen, and eutrophic in terms of total phosphate phosphorus. Considering the decrease in the annual average values of total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand, it is concluded that the Borcka Dam Lake had a positive effect on the surface water quality in the Lower Coruh River Basin.																	0587-4246	1898-794X				SEP	2017	132	3					712	716		10.12693/APhysPolA.132.712								WOS:000412881200084

Fluoride Levels in the Eastern Black Sea Basin Streams, Turkey	ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A					3rd International Conference on Computational and Experimental Science and Engineering (ICCESEN)	OCT 19-24, 2016	Antalya, TURKEY					The aim of this study is to monitor the fluoride ion (F-), as well as chloride ion (Cl-), variation in the Eastern Black Sea Basin streams, and to evaluate drinking water quality of these streams, with reference to national and international directives and guidelines. The water samples (240) were semimonthly collected from three surface water resources, namely from the Degirmendere and Galyan streams in Trabzon Province, the biggest city on the Southeastern Black Sea Coast with a total population of 768 417, and the Harsit Stream in Gumushane and Giresun provinces. The monitoring results have revealed that the average F- concentration had varied between 0.154 and 0.200 mg/l in the Degirmendere Stream and between 0.156 and 0.163 mg/l in the Galyan Stream, respectively. However, the treated stream waters had lower F- concentrations, varying between 0.010 and 0.080 mg/l, than the untreated stream waters. In the Harsit Stream, the average F- concentrations were at relatively higher values, which ranged from 0.211 to 0.296 mg/l, in the uppermost stations, however showed a steadily decreasing trend throughout the lowermost stations and fell from 0.230 to 0.141 mg/l due to the hydropower dam reservoirs, namely Torul, Kurtun, and Akkoy, operated in the watershed. The average Cl- concentrations have varied between 2.00 and 6.48 mg/l. On the one hand, the waters from the Degirmendere, Galyan, and Harsit streams are classified as high quality, considering the upper threshold values of 1.5 mg F-/l and 250 mg Cl-/l. On the other hand, these streams can be regarded as the fluoride-poor water resources.																	0587-4246	1898-794X				SEP	2017	132	3	2		SI		861	865		10.12693/APhysPolA.132.861								WOS:000413982900016

In the Lower Danube River, 77 fish species are currently recorded. In the Danube Delta arms and the adjacent running waters from the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (DDBR), 66 species are recorded, 2/3 of them of commercial value. The fish species are mostly native while six only are exotic species. A newly recorded species (in 2007) is Perccottus glenii. Most species are migratory, rheophilous or rheophilous-stagnophilous, a quarter are stagnophilous-rheophilous and another quarter are stagnophilous, which might reach incidentally as near as the headwaters of the Danube River in adjacent channels or in places away from water current, with more aquatic vegetation. Dominant in abundance is Alburnus alburnus, followed by Rutilus rutilus, Blicca bjoerkna and Neogobius spp., while dominant in biomass are Carassius gibelio, Cyprinus carpio, Esox lucius, Leuciscus aspius, Sander lucioperca, Silurus glanis and Blicca bjoerkna, with some differences for the three sampling types (shoreline, pelagic zone and bottom) studied by different methods. Alburnus alburnus is the eudominant and the most frequent species. Fish diversity parameters indicate a stable fish community, with the highest stability indicators in shoreline area.																	0324-0770					SEP	2017	69	3					349	360										WOS:000412259700008						
J	Pan, YJ; Zhang, XJ; Song, K; Da, LJ				Pan, Yingji; Zhang, Xijin; Song, Kun; Da, Liangjun			Applying trait-based method to investigate the relationship between macrophyte communities and environmental conditions in a eutrophic freshwater lake, China	AQUATIC BOTANY												Trait-based community assembly analysis, which links the plant traits to the variation of community composition along environmental gradients, has potential to improve the understanding of the impacts of eutrophication on macrophytes and responding process. In this article, we pioneered the use of RLQ and Fourth-Corner methods that establish in a quantitative way the link between macrophyte traits, macrophyte community and water quality in a eutrophic shallow lake, eastern China. A total of 9 environmental variables and 11 macrophyte traits were included in the analysis. We found that total phosphorus in water (25.7%, the contribution to total inertia in RLQ analysis), suspended solids (20.7%), water transparency (17.1%) and Chlorophyll a (14.0%) were the main environmental variables that were associated the macrophyte traits matrix. Among macrophyte traits, life form (15.7%), responded to the environmental conditions the most, followed by leaf nitrogen (13.8%) and specific leaf area (13.6%). The correlation between macrophyte traits and environmental gradients showed that macrophytes with higher leaf nitrogen and higher specific leaf area grew at locations with clear water condition, better water transparency and with less total phosphorus, Chlorophyll a and suspended solids in this shallow eutrophic lake. The results suggested that the leaf nitrogen and specific leaf area of macrophytes had a trend to decrease with the increasing environmental stresses caused by eutrophication. Moreover, we highlighted that total phosphorus in water should be prior considered for the future macrophyte conservation and restoration in this lake.

M.; Specken, Bart; Ottburg, Fabrice			Impact of invasive crayfish on water quality and aquatic macrophytes in the Netherlands	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Several species of invasive crayfish have become established in the Netherlands, the most recent addition being Orconectes virilis. Since crayfish are known to impact water quality and aquatic macrophytes in areas they invade, this study investigated whether this was also the case for this species under Dutch conditions and if so, whether a crayfish density producing "no effects" could be established. We focussed on the potential impact of O. virilis on water quality variables (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity), as well as their impact on submerged and emergent macrophytes. In a compartment experiment with different densities of O. virilis, statistically significant effects were observed at crayfish densities of 1.25 crayfish/m(2) on electrical conductivity, turbidity, submersed macrophyte biomass, and the emergent plant Sagittaria sagittifolia, due to crayfish actively severing plants and physically disturbing the sediment. No statistically significant differences with controls were observed at a density of 0.63 crayfish/m(2). Since densities of 0.03 to 5 crayfish/m(2) have been found in different water types in the Netherlands, this indicates that the water quality and macrophyte biomass in Dutch waters are being negatively impacted by invasive crayfish. As a consequence, attempts to reach a good ecological status as required in the Water Framework Directive will be frustrated by the presence of this invader.																	1798-6540	1818-5487				SEP	2017	12	3			SI		397	404		10.3391/ai.2017.12.3.12								WOS:000413823900012

Fluctuations of water temperature, water depth, Sechhi depth, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, free CO2, SRP, SRS and NO3-N were studied in three different stations for six months. Water temperature, water depth and Secchi transparency ranged from 28.0 - 34.2 degrees C, 5.13 - 7.01 m, 0.39 - 0.80 m, respectively. The range of pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), alkalinity, free CO2, SRP, SRS and NO3-N of water over dry to rainy period varied from 7.50 - 7.93, 422 - 650 mu S/cm, 86 - 212 mg/l, 7.31 - 7.9 mg/l, 1.0 - 4.3 meq/l, 3.8 - 6.5 mg/l, 4.02 - 5.04 mu g/l, 3.0 - 5.50 mg/l and 28.11 - 60.25 mu g/l, respectively. A total of 20 genera of phytoplankton were recorded which belonged to six classes, namely Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae. From Cryptophyceae, two genera were recorded namely, Cryptomonas and Rhodomonas. Among the members of Cyanophyceae Lyngbya limnetica Lemm. and Raphidiopsis indica Singh were dominated during the dry to rainy period. Dinophyceae was represented by Peridinium cinctum (Muller) Ehrenberg. Because of a higher pH and low nutrient concentration, the studied water body could be characterized as blue-green dominated, alkaline and meso-eutrophic type.																	0253-5416	2079-9926				SEP	2017	46	3					971	978										WOS:000412359100021

Effect of soil and water characteristics on yield and properties of 'Spunta' potatoes	CHILEAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Soil texture and its characteristics besides water characteristics can play an eminent role in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production. Therefore, a soil and water quality index (SWQI, %) was derived to investigate the effect of combination of soil and water characteristics (sodium adsorption ratio for water and soil, electric conductivity of water and soil, pH for water and soil, organic matter in the soil, and soil texture index) on yield and properties of 'Spunta' potatoes produced under center pivot irrigation system. This index was formed studying separately the effect of irrigation water quality and soil texture on yield, water use efficiency, tuber modulus of elasticity, and tuber shape index of 'Spunta' potatoes. Field results demonstrated that the lowest potato yield was approximately 34.12 t ha(-1) at SWQI 79.63%, and the highest potato yield was 37.79 t ha(-1) at SWQI of 30.93%. The lowest water use efficiency was approximately 6.09 kg m(-3) at SWQI 30.93%, and the highest water use efficiency was 6.83 kg m(-3) at SWQI 79.63%. The lowest tuber modulus of elasticity was approximately 3.98 N mm(-1) at SWQI 21.7%, and the highest tuber modulus of elasticity was 4.74 N mm(-1) at SWQI 79.63%. Finally, the tuber shape index was approximately 342% at SWQI 79.63%, 418% at SWQI 21.72%, and 403% at SWQI 30.93%, which belongs to long and very long shapes. The soil and water quality index could be a useful tool to get relationships among water and soil characteristics, yield, and other properties of the potato crop.																	0718-5839					SEP	2017	77	3					250	256		10.4067/S0718-58392017000300250								WOS:000413717900009

In previous studies of lake quality target management, the water quality targets were poorly correlated with watershed pollutant reduction, and most studies lacked visualized management platform that covered all elements including lakes, in-lake estuaries, rivers and watershed regions. In this study, a browser/server-based visualization platform for lake quality target management was developed. Five models that covered both the watershed and lake scales were integrated based on two critical functions. First, the proposed method can be used to determine watershed pollutant reduction amounts based on certain lake quality target parameters, such as those for TN, TP, NH3N and COD. Second, the method can simulate the lake quality trends associated with different watershed adjustment plans. The platform was deployed by the Taihu Basin Authority (TBA) of the Ministry of Water Resources. Overall, this platform is a useful tool for watershed-lake environmental management.																	1574-9541	1878-0512				SEP	2017	41						40	53		10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.07.008								WOS:000412261000005

Regarding water quantity management, many advances have occurred since the approval of the Brazilian Water Resources Policy in 1997. The competences and responsibilities of each entity of the system are defined in the relevant legislation. Regarding water quality management, however, there is a large number of applicable regulations and competent institutions to act in the supervision and regulation of the matter. Due to this range of information, the need to systematize and synthesize the legal/institutional framework is configured. For this finality, this work proposes to associate the institutional systematization matrix methodology with the environmental monitoring instruments already practiced in Ceara, Brazil. It is hoped that this association will allow the visualization of potentially polluting sources, relevant regulations and competent institutions. The methodology was applied to the Castanhao Reservoir, in the State of Ceara, Brazil. With this methodology, it was possible to identify that 50% of pollutant sources are generated by public entities (Companhia de Agua e Esgoto do Ceara CAGECE; Servico Autonomo de Agua e Esgoto - SAAE; or city halls) and the other 50% correspond to individuals or legal entities. This means that control actions over public entities could solve an important part of the hydrographic basin pollution. Regulatory agencies and the independent environment entities can contribute to reduce pollution sources.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				SEP-OCT	2017	22	5					877	887		10.1590/S1413-41522017160289								WOS:000413736100007

The data depicted that calcium and bicarbonates were dominating among the cations and anions. The results indicate the trend of cation dominance as Ca2+ > Na+>Mg2+ > K+, whereas anion dominance was in the order of HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-. Ratio of calcium to magnesium indicated the dissolution of Ca2+ from CaCO3, which results in an increased levels of Ca2+ in the groundwater. Interpretation of Piper Trilinear plot understands the various geochemical processes affecting the groundwater quality and shows groundwater was dominated by Ca-HCO3 type. The pH was recorded in the slightly alkalinity range 7.2-7.8 and was showing positive correlation with HCO3-. The chloro-alkaline indices revealed 86% of the sources exchange by a type of base-exchange reactions, rest by cation-anion exchange. Gibbs diagram revealed groundwater sources fall in the category of rock dominance. The concentration of the nitrogen compounds was in the progression of NO3-N > NH4- N > NO2-N, and the PO4- fluctuated from 0.12 to 0.22 mg/L. Moreover, corrosivity ratio indicated that water from the majority of sources (71%) is safe to supply using pipes without any corrosive effects, while 29% of sources are corrosive in nature and need non-corrosive pipes for transporting and lifting of groundwater. The results revealed, groundwater samples were within permissible limits as prescribed by International and National standards, for drinking purposes. The State government and NGO's can show their interest in utilizing such water resources to overcome the shortage of drinking water in a sustainable way for the daily consumption of the people living in the vicinity of Jhelum River.

The long-term research was performed at Kivesvaara experimental plots (64 degrees 28'N, 27 degrees 33'E) and Oijusluoma small catchments (65 degrees 50'N, 29 degrees 0'E), with a detailed snow observation at Paljakka (65 degrees 26'N, 26 degrees 26'E). Forestry practices included clear-cut, shelterwood and seed cutting with different techniques of soil preparation and reforestation. The clear-cut (particularly by the total biomass harvest including stump removal) has increased the water yield (a positive feedback). But, on the other hand, it has caused a drop in retention and lag-time, and an increase of peak-flows, as well as increasing mobility of nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, the clear-cut of mature spruce stands (Picea abies) increased the groundwater recharge by 63 mm (i. e., 24%), and the total biomass harvest of one-half of the experimental catchment increased the water yield by 44 mm (i. e., 15%) during three years after the harvest. A significant increase in contents of nitrogen persisted in groundwaters more than 25 years after the clear-cut, and 10 years after the natural regeneration (shelterwood or seed cutting). During the monitored period of 28 years, the total output of nitrogen from subsequent forest plantations ranged from 12 to 21 tons per hectare (i. e., exceeding 5-9 times the output from control mature spruce stands). By natural regeneration, the ten-year mean load of nitrogen exceeded 2.5-5 times the load at control plots. After the total biomass harvest (a whole tree and stump removal), the mean annual outflow of nitrogen and phosphorus was 5.4 and 0.11 kg ha(-1) (exceeding 2.5 and 1.8 times the pre-treatment stream-flow). These results confirmed the hypothesis of a significant impact of forest practices on water resource control in the boreal forest biome.

Mineral Processing Residue Use as Substrate in a Modular Engineered Wetland for Wastewater Treatment	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Safeguarding the water quality of Poyang Lake, China's largest freshwater lake, is essential for long-term regional water resource sustainability. The use of locally-available mineral processing residues as reactive substrate in engineered wetlands may provide a costeffective treatment alternative for mixed agricultural and domestic wastewaters entering Poyang Lake. In this study, Chinese iron-and steel-making slags and a titanium mineral processing residue with high nutrient removal capacity were identified in laboratory experiments. A pilot-scale modular wetland system consisting of free water surface, and vertical and horizontal subsurface flow units, all planted with locally-available vegetation, was constructed at the Poyang Lake Modelling Experiment and Research Base in Jiangxi Province. Assessment of nutrient removal efficiency and effluent water quality was undertaken to inform upscaling and optimization of the modular unit process wetland design. The pilot-scale wetland system removed 55% of inorganic N in influent wastewater and was particularly effective in P attenuation, removing 81% of total P. The environmentally-acceptable pH of wetland system effluents, along with low concentrations of dissolved metals and the absence of potential for either N-or Si-limitation, indicated that the modular wetland system examined was potentially suitable for treatment of mixed wastewater entering Poyang Lake. The use of the selected mineral processing residues as reactive substrate in engineered wetland systems enhanced pollutant removal processes in the modular engineered wetland system, effectively attenuating pollutants in mixed wastewater.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				SEP	2017	4	3					523	547		10.1007/s40710-017-0247-6								WOS:000414368400003						
J	Tiwari, K; Goyal, R; Sarkar, A				Tiwari, Kuldeep; Goyal, Rohit; Sarkar, Archana			GIS-Based Spatial Distribution of Groundwater Quality and Regional Suitability Evaluation for Drinking Water	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Hydrochemistry mapping of groundwater is one of the important aspects of water resources management of an area based on usages such as drinking water or irrigation, and their quality requirement. Such mapping could lead to optimal utilization and protection from quality deterioration. In this paper, a geospatial based water quality index is developed for preparing water quality class suitability map. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the spatial variation of groundwater quality parameters, i. e., Fluoride (F-), Nitrate (NO3-), Chloride (Cl-), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), pH and Total Hardness (TH) in the Khushkhera -Bhiwadi-Neemrana Investment Region (KBNIR). Groundwater samples were collected from 14 locations, tested in the laboratory and were analyzed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) techniques. Geospatial analyst tools were used to generate various thematic maps, and interpolation techniques were applied to identify the spatial distribution of groundwater quality parameters. Groundwater quality was analyzed in detail and compared with BIS and WHO water quality standards. Multivariate statistical techniques, such as Correlation Matrix Analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were carried out. The correlation coefficient showed TDS highly correlated with chloride (r = 0.725), and a negative correlation (r =-0.656) between pH and nitrate. It was observed that 36.02% of the populated area depends on excellent quality groundwater and 23.56% on good quality groundwater, while poor and moderately poor quality groundwater is available for respectively 6.26% and 34.16% of the populated area. Also, only 65.88% of the total geographical area within the KBNIR region is hydrochemically suitable for drinking purposes. Attempts are also made to compare these results with PCA results.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				SEP	2017	4	3					645	662		10.1007/s40710-017-0257-4								WOS:000414368400010

Variations of Drinking Water Quality Influenced by Seasons and Household Interventions: A Case Study from Rural Maharashtra, India	ENVIRONMENTS												The majority of people in rural villages in Maharashtra, India, have access to improved drinking water sources. Nevertheless, the water quality at the point of consumption often does not satisfy the drinking water standard. In this study, we assess changes in water quality from its source to the point of consumption and explore the ties between water management practices and water quality. Water samples were collected at the water source and from 135 households' drinking water storage tanks, and analyzed for fecal coliforms. In parallel, a survey was done to find out water treatment and storage interventions, sanitation and hygiene practices, and households' perception of, and satisfaction with, drinking water quality. Our results show that even though 98% of the households in this study received their drinking water from an improved source, on average only 50% of sources, and even less during the monsoon, showed acceptable levels of fecal bacteria. Households' engagement in treatment and storage interventions varied, but was considered crucial due to unreliable centralized chlorination at the village level. Further work is warranted to understand to what extent the different factors influence variations in water quality at the point of consumption and thus to determine what are the most effective interventions.																	2076-3298					SEP	2017	4	3							59	10.3390/environments4030059								WOS:000411968200016

Effects of domestic and industrial effluent discharges into the lake and their impact on the drinking water in Pandravedu village, Tamil Nadu, India	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Increasing demand for water from agriculture, industrial and domestic sectors, resulted in stress on the water resources both from quantity and quality perspectives. Due to urbanization many of the dyeing units have shifted from urban to nearby rural areas. Here safe disposal of untreated effluent from the dyeing units is a challenge and is often let into nearby water bodies. Pandravedu Lake, located in Thiruvallur district of Tamil Nadu, India is one such case were the present study is carried out. Water samples were collected from twelve locations during premonsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, in pre-cleaned polyethylene cans and analyzed for physicochemical parameters like pH, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, nitrate, chloride, fluoride and sulphate following the standard analytical procedures recommended by American Public Health Association (2005). The analytical results indicated that 40% to 70% of samples exceeded the drinking water quality standards prescribed by Bureau of Indian standards (BIS, 2012). Water quality index computed indicate that both the bore wells that supply drinking water to the village falls in very poor category (101 - 150) across three seasons. Correlation analysis indicated that seasonal changes in correlation among the parameters are linked to the fluctuations of wastewater discharge and its characteristics.																	1790-7632					SEP	2017	19	2					225	231										WOS:000412801100001

Macroalgal blooms occur worldwide and have negative consequences for coastal habitats and economies. Narragansett Bay (NB), Rhode Island, USA, is a medium sized estuary that is heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities and has been plagued by macroalgal blooms for over a century. Over the past decade, significant investment has upgraded wastewater treatment from secondary treatment to water-quality based limits (i.e. tertiary treatment) in an effort to control coastal eutrophication in this system. The goal of this study was to improve the understanding of multi-year macroalgal bloom dynamics through intensive aerial and ground surveys conducted monthly to bimonthly during low tides in May-October 2006-2013 in NB. Aerial surveys provided a rapid characterization of macroalgal densities across a large area, while ground surveys provided high resolution measurements of macroalgal identity, percent cover, and biomass. Macroalgal blooms in NB are dominated by Ulva and Gracilaria spp. regardless of year or month, although all three clades of macroalgae were documented. Chlorophyta cover and nutrient concentrations were highest in the middle and upper bay. Rhodophyta cover was highest in the middle and lower bay, while drifting Phaeophyceae cover was patchy. Macroalgal blooms of >1000 g fresh mass (gfm)/m(2) (max = 3510 gfm/m(2)) in the intertidal zone and >3000 gfm/m(3) (max = 8555 gfm/m(3)) in the subtidal zone were observed within a heavily impacted embayment (Greenwich Bay). Macroalgal percent cover (intertidal), biomass (subtidal), and diversity varied significantly between year, month-group, site, and even within sites, with the highest species diversity at sites outside of Greenwich Bay. Total intertidal macroalgal percent cover, as well as subtidal Ulva biomass, were positively correlated with temperature. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations were correlated with the total biomass of macroalgae and the subtidal biomass of Gracilaria spp. but not the biomass of Ulva spp. Despite seasonal reductions in the nutrient output of wastewater treatment facilities emptying into upper Narragansett Bay in recent years, macroalgal blooms still persist. Continued long-term monitoring of water quality, macroalgal blooms, and ecological indicators is essential to understand the changes in macroalgal bloom dynamics that occur after nutrient reductions from management efforts.

Forty-six water samples were collected over the drainage time from 2 to 2028 d from 12 coalbed methane wells in the Beier mining area of the Daxing Mine in the Tiefa Basin, which is a continental deposit in China. Nine ions, including chloride, nitrate, sulfate, bicarbonate, carbonate, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium, were tested using an Ion-chromatograph ICS-1500. The results indicate that the water quality of coproduced water has a close relationship with the drainage time. The variations of water quality are distinguished into three stages relative to the drainage time, wherein the major ions contributed to the TDS are different in each stage. The water contains Na-Cl in the first stage, after which the water type transforms to Na-HCO3-Cl and finally turns into Na-HCO3. Higher concentrations of chloride, sulfate, calcium, and magnesium, are the representative characteristics of the first stage, which are consequences of the impact of the fracturing fluid. The second stage is characterized by the decline of chloride, sulfate, calcium, and magnesium concentrations and an increase of bicarbonate and carbonate proportion in TDS. As the drainage time increases, the major components of the TDS in the third stage change to bicarbonate, sodium, and carbonate from the second stage ions of bicarbonate, sodium, chloride, and the variation of ionic concentration tends toward stability in the third stage. After long drainage periods, the water quality of coproduced water tends to be similar to that of the original formation water.																	0166-5162	1872-7840				SEP 1	2017	182						32	41		10.1016/j.coal.2017.08.010								WOS:000413882900003

Quantifying the impact of community-scale flood mitigation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION												Federal, State, and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and independent local community organizations spend billions of dollars on watershed management activities. The goals of watershed management projects may span a wide spectrum including, but limited to flood reduction, soil erosion reduction, water quality improvement or protection, and/or increase source of wood fiber for fuel or construction material. Accomplishing these goals is commonly done through revegetation campaigns, construction of small-scale hydraulic works, contour terracing, and urban development planning, among others. An ongoing challenge for these agencies, along with local stakeholders is to understand the various individual and combined impacts of different mitigation measures. The methodology and models developed and applied herein provide important tools for examining the feasibility of construction and the likely impacts of gabion dams and vegetation coverage applications (e.g., hillside and channel revegetation campaigns) in steep mountainous areas upstream of populated areas. The purpose of this investigation is to quantify the impact of changes in the size and location of the gabion dams and of changes in vegetation coverage in the Ravine Millet watershed near Port-au-Price, Haiti. This environment frequently experiences strong convective precipitation events, often the result of hurricane passage over the region. Intensity-Duration-Frequency curves were developed with available data, which were then used to develop design storms associated with different return period frequencies. Hourly satellite-derived precipitation was used to identify the shape and duration of various return period storm events. This investigation then applies some commonly available hydrologic and hydraulic models and various concomitant tools used to construct those models, along with a Kinematic Routing Model to assess the impact of various mitigation strategies. Storm events with multiple peaks of similar magnitude interact with channel geometry and other hydraulic characteristics and may result in peak delay or reduce the time of arrival and may increase or decrease the magnitude of flood peaks. Results indicate that hillslope revegetation impacts to flood peak and the time or arrival of flood peaks at the watershed outlet are limited to relatively low return period storms. Results also indicate that channel vegetation can reduce the peak discharge and significantly delay the arrival of flood peaks. The combined impacts of gabion dams and channel vegetation are highly non-linear, and depend on the shape and duration of storm peaks.																	2212-4209					SEP	2017	24						189	208		10.1016/j.ijdrr.2017.06.001								WOS:000413936100022

Together with known empirical relations, the model comprises a new formulation for resuspension due to fish activity. Experiments on erosion of natural sediments in the annular flume at Aachen University are used for model calibration. Empirical coefficients were evaluated with genetic algorithms to achieve the best agreement between the model results and the experimental data. The presented model shows sufficient flexibility to account for various sediment properties, including different sediment sources, natural and artificial contaminants, presence or absence of aquatic organisms, and results in an average coefficient of determination, R-2 = 90.5% between the model results and the experimental data. Model validation allows it to be assumed that different contaminants affect bed properties differently. Fish activity plays an essential role in correct resuspension prediction. Further sediment erosion experiments with carefully chosen conditions will allow a more comprehensive model evaluation. The presented model is intended to serve as a building block in the development of a hydraulic-sediment-biota model within the W-3-Hydro: Water Quality Event Detection for Urban Water Security and Urban Water Management Based on Hydrotoxicological Investigations project that aims to improve the knowledge concerning bioavailability, transport, fate, and effects of contaminants on the aquatic environment.

J	Makhlough, A; Saravi, HN; Ebrahimzadeh, M				Makhlough, Asieh; Saravi, Hassan Narollahzadeh; Ebrahimzadeh, Majid			The Water Quality of the Shahid Rajaee Reservoir (Mazandaran-Iran): Based on Phytoplankton Community	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTION A-SCIENCE												Shahid Rajaee reservoir (SRR) is one of the main reservoirs located in Mazandaran province. There is no published data of algal study and water quality deduction based on biotic parameter in this area. Therefore, SRR was chosen to study the water quality and water pollution based on the phytoplankton community. Samples were collected at four stations during the 6-month sampling occasions (June, July, August, September, November 2012 and February 2013). Results showed that the water quality of selected sampling stations based on the phytoplankton communities (Shannon-Weiner diversity index H', 0.92-1.37) were classified as slightly polluted to polluted. The H' values reflected excellent quality in June (2.80) and February (2.77), whereas the lowest quality was obtained in August (0.58). Based on the saprobic index values, the reservoir was categorized as beta-mesosaprobic class (moderate organic loading) except in August which was under alpha-mesosaprobic to beta-mesosaprobic (critical organic loading) classification. The water quality condition derived from the trophic classification (based on chlorophyll-a concentration) varied from good to poor class at different sampling months and stations. Based on the results obtained, the risk of pollution and water quality degradation was more noticeable at station 2 and during July and August 2012. In order to prevent the occurrence of eutrophication and algal bloom, it is necessary to conduct regular monitoring and human activities surrounding the SRR and the river tributaries should be monitored.																	1028-6276	2364-1819				SEP	2017	41	A3					627	635		10.1007/s40995-017-0299-5								WOS:000413785300012

Assessment of hydrogeoecological features of the Yesil River Basin	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: The aim of the present study was to examine the hydrochemical composition and geoecological features and to assess the level and nature of anthropogenic pollution in the Yesil river basin. Methodology : Field studies are an integral part of observation and analysis of landscape components. Sample analysis of chemical composition of the Yesil river basin water was conducted in July-August 2016 to ascertain the current state of geo-environmental pollution of the basin water. Results: Reduction of river water causes sharp deterioration in the sanitary condition of river. Great harm is caused by pollution by industrial, agricultural, municipal and domestic sewage. However, there is an increased content of SO4, NO, and NO2, Fe and total salinity of water. Interpretation: Systematic analysis of water quality in the Yesil indicates that the river copes with pollution mainly by the self-cleaning processes. Comparative analysis of qualitative and quantitative indicators of the Yesil river basin water surface indicates the presence of some of their relationship. The solution to the problem of stabilization and improvement of the ecological state of the Yesil river basin geosystems, under intensive anthropogenic impact, requires maximum consideration of the specific nature condition and the analysis of key factors and processes that affect its condition.

Rob; Krause, Stefan			High-frequency monitoring of catchment nutrient exports reveals highly variable storm event responses and dynamic source zone activation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Storm events can drive highly variable behavior in catchment nutrient and water fluxes, yet short-term event dynamics are frequently missed by low-resolution sampling regimes. In addition, nutrient source zone contributions can vary significantly within and between storm events. Our inability to identify and characterize time-dynamic source zone contributions severely hampers the adequate design of land use management practices in order to control nutrient exports from agricultural landscapes. Here we utilize an 8month high-frequency (hourly) time series of streamflow, nitrate (NO3-N), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and hydroclimatic variables for a headwater agricultural catchment. We identified 29 distinct storm events across the monitoring period. These events represented 31% of the time series and contributed disproportionately to nutrient loads (42% of NO3-N and 43% of DOC) relative to their duration. Regression analysis identified a small subset of hydroclimatological variables (notably precipitation intensity and antecedent conditions) as key drivers of nutrient dynamics during storm events. Hysteresis analysis of nutrient concentration-discharge relationships highlighted the dynamic activation of discrete NO3-N and DOC source zones, which varied on an event-specific basis. Our results highlight the benefits of high-frequency in situ monitoring for characterizing short-term nutrient fluxes and unraveling connections between hydroclimatological variability and river nutrient export and source zone activation under extreme flow conditions. These new process-based insights, which we summarize in a conceptual model, are fundamental to underpinning targeted management measures to reduce nutrient loading of surface waters.

J	Paerl, HW				Paerl, Hans W.			Controlling harmful cyanobacterial blooms in a climatically more extreme world: management options and research needs	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Cyanobacteria have a long evolutionary history that has been instrumental in allowing them to adapt to long-term geochemical and climatic changes, as well as current human and climatic alterations of aquatic ecosystems; e.g. nutrient over-enrichment, hydrologic modifications and warming. Harmful (toxic, hypoxia-generating, food web altering) cyanobacterial bloom (CyanoHAB) genera are particularly adept at taking advantage of these changes and perturbations. In addition, they have developed numerous mutualistic and symbiotic associations with other microbes and higher flora and fauna, and they modulate positive biogeochemical feedbacks, instrumental in their survival and dominance in diverse ecosystems. CyanoHABs are controlled by the combined and often synergistic effects of nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) inputs, light, temperature, water residence/flushing times, and biotic interactions. Accordingly, mitigation strategies are oriented towards manipulating these dynamic factors. Physical, chemical (nutrient) and biological manipulations can be effective in reducing CyanoHABs. However, these manipulations should also be accompanied by nutrient (both nitrogen and phosphorus in most cases) input reductions to ensure long-term success and sustainability. A major research and management goal for long-term control of CyanoHABs is to develop strategies that are adaptive to climatic variability and change, because nutrient-CyanoHAB thresholds are likely to be altered in a climatically more extreme world.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP-OCT	2017	39	5					763	771		10.1093/plankt/fbx042								WOS:000412300100001

Uncertain monitoring and modeling in a watershed nonpoint pollution program	LAND USE POLICY												Performance-based programs governing land use rely on environmental measurement, prediction, and assessment. Yet complex, nonlinear social and environmental change can lead to uncertainties in quantification and forecasting and create challenges for operationalizing programs. This research examines the roles that environmental monitoring and modeling uncertainty play in experimental land and water governance through an analysis of a regulatory water quality program in Wisconsin, USA. The case demonstrates how uncertainties in measurement and prediction of pollution runoff shape program design and participant perceptions. We draw on interviews, a survey, participant observation, and policy document analysis to illustrate how regulators and participants (including municipalities, sewerage treatment plants, farmers and nonprofit organizations) perceive and react to uncertainty. Because current and future water quality data are based largely on model estimates, but regulatory compliance will likely be based on measured in-stream outcomes, participants must evaluate potential risks of involvement. Stakeholders have relied on partnership building and legal modifications such as extended compliance timelines to reduce the risks associated with uncertainty. Experimentation under uncertainty led to sustained stakeholder dialogue, and an iterative process of deciding how monitoring and modeling should be used to track and prove program progress.																	0264-8377	1873-5754				SEP	2017	67						690	701		10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.07.016								WOS:000413280200059

In Ethiopia, most of this expansion has occurred in highland areas and involve deforestation of natural riparian vegetation. However, the impacts on the water quality of streams are poorly understood, especially with regard to the influence of land use patterns on highland streams. In this study, we investigated the effects of land use modifications on the water quality and riparian condition of highland streams and examined whether the preservation of riparian vegetation would help mitigate the negative impacts of intensive agriculture practices. Our results show significant differences in the water quality of streams with different land use. Several parameters commonly used to indicate water quality, such as the concentrations of orthophosphate, turbidity, and suspended solids were significantly higher in the agricultural streams than in the forest stream. The preservation of riparian vegetation in the surrounding highland streams was associated with overall better riparian condition, floristic quality, and water quality such as lower turbidity, total suspended solids, orthophosphate, and higher dissolved oxygen. We conclude, that increases in vegetation cover improved riparian condition and water quality relative to other non-vegetated areas. Therefore, we strongly recommend the preservation of riparian vegetation in tropical highland streams surrounded by intensive agriculture. More studies on the effects of best management practices in areas dominated by agriculture can greatly improve our capacity to prevent the degradation of water quality in tropical highland streams of Africa.																	0075-9511	1873-5851				SEP	2017	66						1	11		10.1016/j.limno.2017.07.001								WOS:000413882800001

Disturbance of meromixis in saline Lake Shira (Siberia, Russia): Possible reasons and ecosystem response	LIMNOLOGICA												Saline Lake Shira (Southern Siberia, Russia) was meromictic through the observation period 2002-2015. During the under-ice periods of 2015 and 2016, complete mixing of the water column was recorded for the first time, and hydrogen sulphide temporarily disappeared from the water column of the lake; i.e. in those years the lake turned to holomixis. In the summer of 2015, a sharp increase in chlorophyll a, organic carbon, zooplankton, and phytoflagellates was observed in the lake, which was probably due to the release of nutrients from the monimolimnion. Purple sulfur bacteria completely disappeared from the lake after the first mixing in 2015, and did not reappear despite the restoration of meromixis in 2017. Thus, it was demonstrated that purple sulfur bacteria are sensitive to the weakening of the stratification of Lake Shira. Based on the data of the seasonal monitoring of temperature and salinity profiles over the period 2002-2017, it was presumed that the main cause of deep mixing in 2015 was the weakening of the salinity gradient due to strong wind impact and early ice retreat in the spring of 2014. In addition, it was shown that in previous years a significant contribution to the maintenance of meromixis was made by an additional influx of fresh water, which caused a rise in the lake level in the period 2002-2007. Thus, we identified a relationship between the stratification regime of the lake and the change in its level, which provides valuable information both for the forecast of Water quality and for reconstruction of the Holocene climate humidity in this region of Southern Siberia from the sediment cores of Lake Shira.

Accordingly, we developed two species-specific and one Dreissena-specific qPCR-based environmental DNA (eDNA) assays designed as a single multiplexed reaction able to identify the presence of zebra mussel and infer the presence of quagga mussel in water samples from at-risk and invaded locations. In 2014, samples were collected from four invaded harbours on Lake Winnipeg during the early (May) and late (October) seasons. Zebra mussel eDNA was detected in 0-33.3% of samples per site early in the season, whereas late season sample detection ranged from 42.9 to 100%. In order to confirm that there was no nonspecific amplification of DNA from local biota, samples were also collected from sites where neither adult nor veliger-stage zebra mussels had been previously observed. These sites included three harbours on Lake Winnipeg and six sites within the Manitoban portion of the Red River. No amplification of eDNA was recorded at these sites except for that at a float-plane dock in the Red River upstream of Lake Winnipeg. Zebra mussels were subsequently detected at this location by sampling for transformed attached individuals. Thus, we demonstrate that eDNA is an early indicator of the presence of zebra mussels and is a useful detection tool at the forefront of their recent invasion in Manitoba. This work provides the foundation for the development of a zebra mussel eDNA monitoring program for waterbodies in Manitoba and western Canada.																	1989-8649					SEP	2017	8	3			SI		287	300		10.3391/mbi.2017.8.3.03								WOS:000412582000003

Phytoplankton dynamics in relation to physicochemical conditions in large, stratified Lake Charzykowskie (Northern Poland)	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The comparison of the latest and previous data on the structure of phytoplankton and chlorophyll a concentration in Lake Charzykowskie indicated long-term changes and fluctuations. The main objective of this study was to assess the phytoplankton communities in the lake with reference to hydrochemical conditions. Detailed hydrobiological studies were carried out in 2014-2015 to explain the improvement in the trophic status of the lake observed in 2008-2009. The research has shown that the phytoplankton community structure does not change significantly during the limnological cycle. The spring/autumn season is characterized by the highest contribution of diatoms and cryptophytes. Massive development of dinoflagellates was observed during the summer. Relative abundance of cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum and Microcystis) was significantly lower compared to the previous years. In August 2014, cyanobacteria accounted for 100% of the total phytoplankton at site 2. In the following year, cyanobacteria represented only 13% in the summer phytoplankton. The current research has confirmed the favorable trophic changes in the phytoplankton of the lake. Unfortunately, very poor oxygen conditions will continue to affect the trophic status of the lake through mobilization of the internal nutrient supply. The current conditions of the lake require further monitoring of changes in the ecosystem.																	1730-413X	1897-3191				SEP	2017	46	3					260	270		10.1515/ohs-2017-0028								WOS:000412129200002

Simple rules can guide whether land- or ocean-based conservation will best benefit marine ecosystems	PLOS BIOLOGY												Coastal marine ecosystems can be managed by actions undertaken both on the land and in the ocean. Quantifying and comparing the costs and benefits of actions in both realms is therefore necessary for efficient management. Here, we quantify the link between terrestrial sediment runoff and a downstream coastal marine ecosystem and contrast the cost-effectiveness of marine-and land-based conservation actions. We use a dynamic land-and seascape model to determine whether limited funds should be directed to 1 of 4 alternative conservation actions-protection on land, protection in the ocean, restoration on land, or restoration in the ocean-to maximise the extent of light-dependent marine benthic habitats across decadal timescales. We apply the model to a case study for a seagrass meadow in Australia. We find that marine restoration is the most cost-effective action over decadal timescales in this system, based on a conservative estimate of the rate at which seagrass can expand into a new habitat. The optimal decision will vary in different social-ecological contexts, but some basic information can guide optimal investments to counteract land-and ocean-based stressors: (1) marine restoration should be prioritised if the rates of marine ecosystem decline and expansion are similar and low; (2) marine protection should take precedence if the rate of marine ecosystem decline is high or if the adjacent catchment is relatively intact and has a low rate of vegetation decline; (3) land-based actions are optimal when the ratio of marine ecosystem expansion to decline is greater than 1:1.4, with terrestrial restoration typically the most cost-effective action; and (4) land protection should be prioritised if the catchment is relatively intact but the rate of vegetation decline is high. These rules of thumb illustrate how cost-effective conservation outcomes for connected land-ocean systems can proceed without complex modelling.

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Giardia infections afflict nearly 33% of people in developing countries, and 2% of the adult population in the developed world. This study describes the single cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) of G. lamblia and assesses PDE inhibitors as a new generation of anti-giardial drugs. Methods An extensive search of the Giardia genome database identified a single gene coding for a class I PDE, GlPDE. The predicted protein sequence was analyzed in-silico to characterize its domain structure and catalytic domain. Enzymatic activity of GlPDE was established by complementation of a PDE-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, and enzyme kinetics were characterized in soluble yeast lysates. The potency of known PDE inhibitors was tested against the activity of recombinant GlPDE expressed in yeast and against proliferating Giardia trophozoites. Finally, the localization of epitope-tagged and ectopically expressed GlPDE in Giardia cells was investigated. Results Giardia encodes a class I PDE. Catalytically important residues are fully conserved between GlPDE and human PDEs, but sequence differences between their catalytic domains suggest that designing Giardia-specific inhibitors is feasible. Recombinant GlPDE hydrolyzes cAMP with a Km of 408 mu M, and cGMP is not accepted as a substrate. A number of drugs exhibit a high degree of correlation between their potency against the recombinant enzyme and their inhibition of trophozoite proliferation in culture. Epitope-tagged GlPDE localizes as dots in a pattern reminiscent of mitosomes and to the perinuclear region in Giardia. Conclusions Our data strongly suggest that inhibition of G. lamblia PDE activity leads to a profound inhibition of parasite proliferation and that GlPDE is a promising target for developing novel antigiardial drugs.

Environmental health disparities in the Central Appalachian region of the United States	REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Health disparities that cannot be fully explained by socio-behavioral factors persist in the Central Appalachian region of the United States. A review of available studies of environmental impacts on Appalachian health and analysis of recent public data indicates that while disparities exist, most studies of local environmental quality focus on the preservation of nonhuman biodiversity rather than on effects on human health. The limited public health studies available focus primarily on the impacts of coal mining and do not measure personal exposure, constraining the ability to identify causal relationships between environmental conditions and public health. Future efforts must engage community members in examining all potential sources of environmental health disparities to identify effective potential interventions.																	0048-7554	2191-0308				SEP	2017	32	3					253	266		10.1515/reveh-2017-0012								WOS:000412134600005	28682789					
J	Islam, N; Rodriguez, MJ; Farahat, A; Sadiq, R				Islam, Nilufar; Rodriguez, Manuel J.; Farahat, Ashraf; Sadiq, Rehan			Minimizing the impacts of contaminant intrusion in small water distribution networks through booster chlorination optimization	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												Contaminant intrusion in a water distribution network (DN) has three basic pre-conditions: source of contaminant (e.g., leaky sewer), a pathway (e.g., water main leaks), and a driving force (e.g., negative pressure). The impact of intrusion can be catastrophic if residual disinfectant (chlorine) is not present. To avoid microbiological water quality failure, higher levels of secondary chlorination doses can be a possible solution, but they can produce disinfectant by-products which lead to taste and odour complaints. This study presents a methodology to identify potential intrusion points in a DN and optimize booster chlorination based on trade-offs among microbiological risk, chemical risk and life-cycle cost for booster chlorination. A point-scoring scheme was developed to identify the potential intrusion points within a DN. It utilized factors such as pollutant source (e.g., sewer characteristics), pollution pathway (water main diameter, length, age, and surrounding soil properties, etc.), consequence of contamination (e.g., population, and land use), and operational factors (e.g., water pressure) integrated through a geographical information system using advanced ArcMap 10 operations. The contaminant intrusion was modelled for E. Coli O156: H7 (a microbiological indicator) using the EPANET-MSX programmer's toolkit. The quantitative microbial risk assessment and chemical (human health) risk assessment frameworks were adapted to estimate risk potentials. Booster chlorination locations and dosages were selected using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The methodology was illustrated through a case study on a portion of a municipal DN.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				SEP	2017	31	7			SI		1759	1775		10.1007/s00477-017-1440-x								WOS:000412457300015						
J	Hering, JG				Hering, Janet G.			Managing the 'Monitoring Imperative' in the Context of SDG Target 6.3 on Water Quality and Wastewater	SUSTAINABILITY												Monitoring the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 for water and sanitation builds on monitoring frameworks that were developed for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), specifically the WHO/ UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP). Yet, since SDG 6 goes beyond the MDG focus on drinking water and sanitation, it also significantly expands monitoring and reporting responsibilities. The target to improve water quality (Target 6.3) calls for water quality monitoring and data reporting that are likely to pose a significant challenge to countries that lack an established monitoring program. At the same time, redundant burdens may be imposed on countries that already have established programs and report out water quality data to inter-or supranational agencies. In this context, there is a risk that the intention that water quality data should serve as a basis for evidence-based decision making will become subsidiary to the resource-intensive activities of data collection and management. Alternatively, policies could be designed based on historical experience with measures of proven effectiveness, prioritizing policies that could have multiple benefits. Policies could be implemented in parallel with the development of monitoring programs and conventional monitoring data could be complemented by information gained from sources such as remote sensing and unstructured data.																	2071-1050					SEP	2017	9	9							1572	10.3390/su9091572								WOS:000411621200175

The study area encompassed eight small catchments with areas ranging from 58.6 to 13,442.4 ha in the subtropical region of South China. On-site observations of P concentrations, stream fluxes, and social investigation of P input were conducted over a 3-year period. The regional variations of net anthropogenic phosphorus inputs (NAPI) and responses of riverine P export were quantitatively analyzed. Results showed that the total NAPI of catchments varied from 11.04 to 40.52 kg P ha(-1) year(-1), where cropland systems (NAPI(c)) were the largest P sources, accounting for 47.7-67.7% in total. Meanwhile, net food and feed P input varied from 3.87 to 30.73 kg P ha(-1) year(-1), accounting for 35.0-75.8% in total, followed by fertilizer and non-food P input with 4.65-10.48 and 0.63-2.89 kg P ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Riverine P export and the soil total P and Olsen P contents in croplands were all positively related to NAPI (p < 0.05). A simple empirical model was simulated to predict the annual riverine total P fluxes using NAPIc with greater accuracy than with using NAPI or NAPI for residential land (NAPI(r)). Gray relational analysis suggested that livestock density was the most important influencing factor for NAPI. It is concluded from these results that, although the livestock accounted for the largest part of the NAPI, the cropland contributed the greatest to catchment riverine P export. This probably due to recycling of animal manure for plant cropping systems. Therefore, maintaining a reasonable scale of livestock production, and reducing the internal cycle of manure or replacing part of the chemical fertilizer should be a major approach in reducing NAPI and corresponding riverine P export in the study area.																	2071-1050					SEP	2017	9	9							1480	10.3390/su9091480								WOS:000411621200004

In recent years, the Chinese government implemented several water resource protection policies to improve the river's water quality. In order to evaluate the influence of the new policies on the water quality in the Songhua River, water quality data from 2006 to 2015 were collected monthly from the nine sites along the mainstream of the Songhua River. Results show that the water quality in the Songhua River could be divided into two groups during the last 10 years. Before 2010, water quality in the Songhua River was primarily influenced by regional human activities. Industries were the major pollutant sources in the upstream of the Songhua River. After several new policies were implemented by the local government in 2010, water quality in the Songhua River improved. As a result, the biodiversity of fish and ecological health in the Songhua River improved.

However, sediment management such as flushing is needed to maintain storage capacity. Climate change is expected to increase sediment loads, but potential effects on their quality are scarcely known. In this context, sediment contamination by trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and organics (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons PAHs, Polychlorinated Biphenyls PCBs and C > 12 hydrocarbons) was analyzed in 20 reservoirs located in Italian Central Alps. A strong As and a moderate Cd, Hg and Pb enrichment was emphasized by I-geo, with potential ecotoxicological risk according to Probable Effect Concentration quotients. Sedimentation rate, granulometry, total organic carbon (TOC) and altitude resulted as the main drivers governing pollutant concentrations in sediments. According to climate change models, expected increase of rainfall erosivity will enhance soil erosion and consequently the sediment flow to reservoirs, potentially increasing coarse grain fractions and thus potentially diluting pollutants. Conversely, increased weathering may enhance metal fluxes to reservoirs. Increased vegetation cover will potentially result in higher TOC concentrations, which may contrast contaminant bioavailability and thus toxicity. Our results may provide elements for a proper management of contaminated sediments in a climate change scenario aiming at preserving water quality and ecosystem functioning.

It is an environmentally friendly drainage system that was designed to increase infiltration, reduce peak flow at outlet, improve water quality, through different BMPs, such as grass swale, retention pond, etc. A special feature of BIOECODS is ecological swale with on-line subsurface detention. This study attempted to create a model of ecological swale with on-line subsurface conveyance system with InfoWorks SD. The new technique has been used Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) model to describe overland flow routing and Soil Conservation Service Method (SCS) used to model infiltration or subsurface flow. The modeling technique has been proven successful, as the predicted and observed closely match each other, with a mean error of 4.58 to 7.32%. The calibrated model then used to determine the ratio of the flow exchange between the surface and subsurface drainage system. Results from the model showed that the runoff ratio exchange between the surface and subsurface is 60 to 90%.

The method takes into account nonlinearity and hysteresis effects during storm events, and hydrological conditions variability. High-frequency records of total P and reactive P originating from four contrasting European agricultural catchments in terms of P loads were used to test the method. The models were calibrated on weekly grab sampling data combined with 10 storms surveyed subhourly per year (weekly+ survey) and then used to reconstruct P concentrations during all storm events for computing annual loads. For total P, results showed that this modeling approach allowed the estimation of annual loads with limited uncertainties (approximate to -10%+/- 15%), more reliable than estimations based on simple linear regressions using turbidity, based on interpolated weekly+ data without storm event reconstruction, or on discharge weighted calculations from weekly series or monthly series. For reactive P, load uncertainties based on the nonlinear model were similar to uncertainties based on storm event reconstruction using simple linear regression (approximate to 20%+/- 30%), and remained lower than uncertainties obtained without storm reconstruction on weekly or monthly series, but larger than uncertainties based on interpolated weekly+ data (approximate to -15%+/- 20%). These empirical models showed we could estimate reliable P exports from noncontinuous P time series when using continuous proxies, and this could potentially be very useful for completing time-series data sets in high-frequency surveys, even over extended periods. Plain Language Abstract Phosphorus (P) loads transported by rivers and streams have to be estimated reliably, but this is a difficult task because P loads can be transported during very short period of time, like during storm events, and most P surveys are executed with low sampling frequencies. Because continuous surveys of P are costly, we tested a modeling approach using commonly used low-cost continuous records of turbidity and discharge as surrogate variables. This had to take into account nonlinear relationships and the fact that the relationship between P and turbidity or discharge is different during a rising phase or a descending phase. The model we developed estimates P concentration variations during storm events and provides continuous time series of P. From the model estimations, total annual loads of P could be predicted with low uncertainty ranges when using turbidity as a surrogate variable, showing its ability at estimating phosphorus exports values closer to the reality. The soluble reactive form was however less reliably predicted by discharge records, but our method could still be improved.

Calibration of a modified temperature-light intensity logger for quantifying water electrical conductivity	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The Stream Temperature, Intermittency, and Conductivity (STIC) electrical conductivity (EC) logger as presented by Chapin et al. (2014) serves as an inexpensive (similar to 50 USD) means to assess relative EC in freshwater environments. This communication demonstrates the calibration of the STIC logger for quantifying EC, and provides examples from a month long field deployment in the High Arctic. Calibration models followed multiple nonlinear regression and produced calibration curves with high coefficient of determination values (R-2=0.995-0.998; n=5). Percent error of mean predicted specific conductance at 25 degrees C (SpC) to known SpC ranged in magnitude from -0.6% to 13% (mean=-1.4%), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) ranged from 2.1% to 13% (mean=5.3%). Across all tested loggers we found good accuracy and precision, with both error metrics increasing with increasing SpC values. During 10, month-long field deployments, there were no logger failures and full data recovery was achieved. Point SpC measurements at the location of STIC loggers recorded via a more expensive commercial electrical conductivity logger followed similar trends to STIC SpC records, with 1:1.05 and 1:1.08 relationships between the STIC and commercial logger SpC values. These results demonstrate that STIC loggers calibrated to quantify EC are an economical means to increase the spatiotemporal resolution of water quality investigations.																	0043-1397	1944-7973				SEP	2017	53	9					8120	8126		10.1002/2017WR020634								WOS:000413484200035

Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the seasonal phytoplankton dynamics in two distinct streams located in an area of environmental protection in subtropical Brazil, and to identify the main drivers of community structure. Phytoplankton community and environmental variables were sampled on a monthly basis, between September 2012 and August 2013, in Apepu and Gualberto streams, located in Foz do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil. We verified that both streams presented a seasonal distinction regarding the precipitation levels. Regarding the others environmental variables (e.g., nutrients, light, temperature), a temporal similarity was observed in both streams. A high taxonomic diversity was recorded, including Bacillariophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Chloro-phyceae and Zygnematophyceae as the most representative groups. Low abundance, richness and diversity were recorded in Apepu and Gualberto streams, while high equitability was recorded in both streams due to the uniform distribution of the species. Low variability of phytoplankton was recorded with high temporal similarity between the two streams. This study shows that the factors determining phytoplankton diversity and dynamics in Apepu and Gualberto streams are related not only to hydrological and limnological conditions, but also to the local characteristics of the streams, such as low depth and small extension.																	1806-9959					SEP	2017	40	3					727	734		10.1007/s40415-017-0379-y								WOS:000411499800013						
J	Yang, H; Hassan, SG; Wang, L; Li, DL				Yang, Hao; Hassan, Shahbaz Gul; Wang, Liang; Li, Daoliang			Fault diagnosis method for water quality monitoring and control equipment in aquaculture based on multiple SVM combined with D-S evidence theory	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE												A water quality monitoring and control (WQMC) system is an important tool designed to maintain good water quality in aquaculture. A variety of events could cause WQMC equipment to malfunction. Such a problem would in turn result in the generation of unreliable monitoring information and reduced water quality control. The high-dimensional dataset generated by the WQMC equipment makes fault identification difficult. To solve the problem of fault identification, this paper reduced the effects of autocorrelation on the variables and determined feature space based on dynamic principal component analysis (DPCA). Based on cross-correlation analysis, 24 support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were developed for the multi-SVM model. A vote procedure was proposed to identify fault types and conflicts. To solve the conflicts and reduce incorrect diagnosis results, an amendment based on D-S theory determined which fault contributed more to causing the corresponding symptoms. Experimental results showed that the single-pass accuracy of the multi-SVM model in random sample tests varied from 90% to 94% and the combined method could effectively solve the conflicts. Furthermore, the fault identification accuracy could be improved by 3-5%. Incorrect fault diagnosis results remained, and the successful amendment ratio required further improvement. However, the proposed method was helpful for the maintenance and management of WQMC equipment.

In addition, nine qualitative variables were also considered as auxiliary input variables. Electrical conductivity (EC), sodium concentration (Na+),and sulfate concentration (SO42-) of the groundwater in the region were estimated using ANNs and SVMs with different input combinations. The results showed that both ANNs and SVMs work well when the only primary input variable is the well location. The ANN yielded an RMSE of 1.03 mEq/l for SO42-, 1.05 mEq/l for Na+, and 203.17 mu S/cm for EC, using the X and Y coordinates of the observation wells in the study area. In the case of SVM, these values were, respectively, 0.87, 0.87, and 176.68. Considering the auxiliary input variables (pH, EC, and the concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, and HCO3-) resulted in a significant decrease in the RMSE of both ANNs (0.22, 0.30, and 33.04) and SVMs (0.26, 0.34, and 36.23). Comparing these RMSE values with those of cokriging interpolation technique (0.59, 0.98, and 177.59) indicated that ANNs and SVMs produced more accurate estimates of the three qualitative parameters. The relative importance of auxiliary input variables was also determined using Gamma test. The output uncertainty of ANNs and SVMs were determined using p-factor and d-factor. The results showed that SVMs have less uncertainty than ANNs.

However, the driving forces of riverine N export that is closely related to water N pollution are still not well understood. In this study, we used a mass balance approach to quantify the sources of N discharge and analyzed the effect of land use composition on riverine N export, taking Zhejiang Province, China as a case study. We found that the total reactive N discharge to rivers in Zhejiang increased from 0.22 to 0.26 Tg yr(-1) from 2000 to 2015. At the watershed scale, our estimate of N export agrees well with the monitored riverine N concentration in the eight major watersheds in Zhejiang. Direct discharge of domestic wastewater and effluents from wastewater treatment plants are dominant sources of riverine N export, followed by agricultural non-point sources. Although riverine N export increases with the increasing proportion of urban and agricultural land uses, we did not find any relationship between land use change and changes in riverine N export. This suggests that the dominant factor affecting riverine N export should be human activities (e.g. wastewater discharge and fertilization level), while land use only mediates riverine N export.

Development of suspect and non-target screening methods for detection of organic contaminants in highway runoff and fish tissue with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Untreated urban stormwater runoff contributes to poor water quality in receiving waters. The ability to identify toxicants and other bioactive molecules responsible for observed adverse effects in a complex mixture of contaminants is critical to effective protection of ecosystem and human health, yet this is a challenging analytical task. The objective of this study was to develop analytical methods using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS) to detect organic contaminants in highway runoff and in runoff-exposed fish (adult coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch). Processing of paired water and tissue samples facilitated contaminant prioritization and aided investigation of chemical bioavailability and uptake processes. Simple, minimal processing effort solid phase extraction (SPE) and elution procedures were optimized for water samples, and selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) procedures were optimized for fish tissues. Extraction methods were compared by detection of non-target features and target compounds (e.g., quantity and peak area), while minimizing matrix interferences. Suspect screening techniques utilized in-house and commercial databases to prioritize high-risk detections for subsequent MS/MS characterization and identification efforts. Presumptive annotations were also screened with an in-house linear regression (log K-ow vs. retention time) to exclude isobaric compounds. Examples of confirmed identifications (via reference standard comparison) in highway runoff include ethoprophos, prometon, DEET, caffeine, cotinine, 4(or 5)-methyl-1H-methylbenzotriazole, and acetanilide. Acetanilide was also detected in runoff-exposed fish gill and liver samples. Further characterization of highway runoff and fish tissues (14 and 19 compounds, respectively with tentative identification by MS/MS data) suggests that many novel or poorly characterized organic contaminants exist in urban stormwater runoff and exposed biota.

Chad			Forestry Best Management Practices Relationships with Aquatic and Riparian Fauna: A Review	FORESTS												Forestry best management practices (BMPs) were developed to minimize water pollution from forestry operations by primarily addressing sediment and sediment transport, which is the leading source of pollution from silviculture. Implementation of water quality BMPs may also benefit riparian and aquatic wildlife, although wildlife benefits were not driving forces for BMP development. Therefore, we reviewed literature regarding potential contributions of sediment-reducing BMPs to conservation of riparian and aquatic wildlife, while realizing that BMPs also minimize thermal, nutrient, and chemical pollution. We reached five important conclusions: (1) a significant body of research confirms that forestry BMPs contribute to the protection of water quality and riparian forest structure; (2) data-specific relationships between forestry BMPs and reviewed species are limited; (3) forestry BMPs for forest road construction and maintenance, skid trails, stream crossings, and streamside management zones (SMZs) are important particularly for protection of water quality and aquatic species; (4) stream crossings should be carefully selected and installed to minimize sediment inputs and stream channel alterations; and (5) SMZs promote retention of older-age riparian habitat with benefits extending from water bodies to surrounding uplands. Overall, BMPs developed for protection of water quality should benefit a variety of riparian and aquatic species that are sensitive to changes in water quality or forest structure.					Bolding, M.

Use of Principal Components Analysis and Kriging to Predict Groundwater-Sourced Rural Drinking Water Quality in Saskatchewan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Groundwater drinking water supply surveillance data were accessed to summarize water quality delivered as public and private water supplies in southern Saskatchewan as part of an exposure assessment for epidemiologic analyses of associations between water quality and type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Arsenic in drinking water has been linked to a variety of chronic diseases and previous studies have identified multiple wells with arsenic above the drinking water standard of 0.01 mg/L; therefore, arsenic concentrations were of specific interest. Principal components analysis was applied to obtain principal component (PC) scores to summarize mixtures of correlated parameters identified as health standards and those identified as aesthetic objectives in the Saskatchewan Drinking Water Quality Standards and Objective. Ordinary, universal, and empirical Bayesian kriging were used to interpolate arsenic concentrations and PC scores in southern Saskatchewan, and the results were compared. Empirical Bayesian kriging performed best across all analyses, based on having the greatest number of variables for which the root mean square error was lowest. While all of the kriging methods appeared to underestimate high values of arsenic and PC scores, empirical Bayesian kriging was chosen to summarize large scale geographic trends in groundwater-sourced drinking water quality and assess exposure to mixtures of trace metals and ions.																	1660-4601					SEP	2017	14	9							1065	10.3390/ijerph14091065								WOS:000411574400117	28914824

The organisms that are more affected are fishes and marine mammals since they are at the top of the food chain. They are directly exposed to high levels of toxins in water and/or they feed on other fishes that are contaminated. Unfortunately, the main cause of the contaminations, and thus of the fish deaths, come from human activities, such as industry, agriculture, municipal wastewater and solid wastes. The present study is concerned with the effect of organic and inorganic pollutants on the survival of fish in water bodies. We introduce a nonlinear mathematical model by considering five interacting variables; organic pollutants, inorganic pollutants, bacteria, dissolved oxygen and fish in the water body. The model is analyzed using the stability theory of differential equations and to confirm the analytical findings, numerical simulations are performed. Our results suggest that to maintain water quality and to save fish life, the global community has to limit the release of organic and inorganic pollutants into the aquatic system.

The role of alluvial aquifer sediments in attenuating a dissolved arsenic plume	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In a crude-oil-contaminated sandy aquifer at the Bemidji site in northern Minnesota, biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons has resulted in release of naturally occurring As to groundwater under Fe-reducing conditions. This study used chemical extractions of aquifer sediments collected in 1993 and 2011-2014 to evaluate the relationship between Fe and As in different redox zones (oxic, methanogenic, Fe-reducing, anoxic-suboxic transition) of the contaminated aquifer over a twenty-year period. Results show that 1) the aquifer has the capacity to naturally attenuate the plume of dissolved As, primarily through sorption; 2) Fe and As are linearly correlated in sediment across all redox zones, and a regression analysis between Fe and As reasonably predicted As concentrations in sediment from 1993 using only Fe concentrations; 3) an As-rich "iron curtain," associated with the anoxic-suboxic transition zone, migrated 30 m downgradient between 1993 and 2013 as a result of the hydrocarbon plume evolution; and 4) silt lenses in the aquifer preferentially sequester dissolved As, though As is remobilized into groundwater from sediment after reducing conditions are established. Using results of this study coupled with historical data, we develop a conceptual model which summarizes the natural attenuation of As and Fe over time and space that can be applied to other sites that experience As mobilization due to an influx of bioavailable organic matter.

Optimized quantity-within-distance models of spatial welfare heterogeneity	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT												Spatial welfare heterogeneity is frequently modeled within stated preference analysis as a function of discrete or continuous distance between households and affected resources. A common example is distance-decay analysis. Although distance-based models such as these are easily estimated, the ubiquity of this paradigm can lead to analyses that overlook other forms of analysis with equal or greater relevance. This paper develops an alternative approach to spatial heterogeneity in stated preference willingness to pay (WIP) based on the quantity or area of an affected resource surrounding each respondent at an optimized distance band or radius, with distance bands optimized using a grid-search algorithm that maximizes model likelihood. Methods and results are illustrated using a choice experiment on riparian land restoration in Maine, USA. The resulting quantity-within-distance model identifies systematic spatial patterns that are undetectable using distance-based analysis and directly relevant for welfare analysis.

J	Chen, L; Sun, C; Wang, GB; Xie, H; Shen, ZY				Chen, Lei; Sun, Cheng; Wang, Guobo; Xie, Hui; Shen, Zhenyao			Event-based nonpoint source pollution prediction in a scarce data catchment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Quantifying the rainfall-runoff-pollutant (R-R-P) process is key to regulating non-point source (NPS) pollution; however, the impacts of scarce measured data on R-R-P simulations have not yet been reported. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive study of scarce data that addressed both rainfall-runoff and runoff-pollutant processes, whereby the impacts of data scarcity on two commonly used methods, including Unit Hydrograph (UH) and Loads Estimator (LOADEST), were quantified. A case study was performed in a typical small catchment of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR) of China. Based on our results, the classification of rainfall patterns should be carried out first when analyzing modeling results. Compared to data based on a missing rate and a missing location, key information generates more impacts on the simulated flow and NPS loads. When the scarcity rate exceeds a certain threshold (20% in this study), measured data scarcity level has clear impacts on the model's accuracy. As the model of total nitrogen (TN) always performs better under different data scarcity conditions, researchers are encouraged to pay more attention to continuous the monitoring of total phosphorus (TP) for better NPS-TP predictions. The results of this study serve as baseline information for hydrologic forecasting and for the further control of NPS pollutants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of wetland implementation strategies on phosphorus reduction at a watershed scale	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Excessive nutrient use in agricultural practices is a major cause of water quality degradation around the world, which results in eutrophication of the freshwater systems. Among the nutrients, phosphorus enrichment has recently drawn considerable attention due to major environmental issues such as Lake Erie and Chesapeake Bay eutrophication. One approach for mitigating the impacts of excessive nutrients on water resources is the implementation of wetlands. However, proper site selection for wetland implementation is the key for effective water quality management at the watershed scale, which is the goal of this study. In this regard, three conventional and two pseudo-random targeting methods were considered. A watershed model called the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was coupled with another model called System for Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis IntegratioN (SUSTAIN) to simulate the impacts of wetland implementation scenarios in the Saginaw River watershed, located in Michigan. The inter-group similarities of the targeting strategies were investigated and it was shown that the level of similarity increases as the target area increases (0.54-0.86). In general, the conventional targeting method based on phosphorus load generated per unit area at the subwatershed scale had the highest average reduction among all the scenarios (44.46 t/year). However, when considering the total area of implemented wetlands, the conventional method based on long-term impacts of wetland implementation showed the highest amount of phosphorus reduction (36.44 t/year).

Stormwater infiltration and the 'urban karst' - A review	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The covering of native soils with impervious surfaces (e.g. roofs, roads, and pavement) prevents infiltration of rainfall into the ground, resulting in increased surface runoff and decreased groundwater recharge. When this excess water is managed using stormwater drainage systems, flow and water quality regimes of urban streams are severely altered, leading to the degradation of their ecosystems. Urban streams restoration requires alternative approaches towards stormwater management, which aim to restore the flow regime towards pre-development conditions. The practice of stormwater infiltration achieved using a range of stormwater source-control measures (SCM5) is central to restoring baseflow. Despite this, little is known about what happens to the infiltrated water. Current knowledge about the impact of stormwater infiltration on flow regimes was reviewed. Infiltration systems were found to be efficient at attenuating high-flow hydrology (reducing peak magnitudes and frequencies) at a range of scales (parcel, streetscape, catchment). Several modelling studies predict a positive impact of stormwater infiltration on baseflow, and empirical evidence is emerging, but the fate of infiltrated stormwater remains unclear. It is not known how infiltrated water travels along the subsurface pathways that characterise the urban environment, in particular the 'urban karst', which results from networks of human-made subsurface pathways, e.g. stormwater and sanitary sewer pipes and associated high permeability trenches. Seepage of groundwater into and around such pipes is possible, meaning some infiltrated stormwater could travel along artificial pathways. The catchment-scale ability of infiltration systems to restore groundwater recharge and base flow is thus ambiguous. Further understanding of the fate of infiltrated stormwater is required to ensure infiltration systems deliver optimal outcomes for waterway flow regimes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hosseini, M; Kerachian, R				Hosseini, Marjan; Kerachian, Reza			A data fusion-based methodology for optimal redesign of groundwater monitoring networks	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In this paper, a new data fusion-based methodology is presented for spatio-temporal (S-T) redesigning of Groundwater Level Monitoring Networks (GLMNs). The kriged maps of three different criteria (i.e. marginal entropy of water table levels, estimation error variances of mean values of water table levels, and estimation values of long-term changes in water level) are combined for determining monitoring sub-areas of high and low priorities in order to consider different spatial patterns for each sub-area. The best spatial sampling scheme is selected by applying a new method, in which a regular hexagonal gridding pattern and the Thiessen polygon approach are respectively utilized in sub-areas of high and low monitoring priorities. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a S-T kriging models are used to simulate water level fluctuations. To improve the accuracy of the predictions, results of the ANN and S-T kriging models are combined using a data fusion technique. The concept of Value of Information (VOI) is utilized to determine two stations with maximum information values in both sub-areas with high and low monitoring priorities. The observed groundwater level data of these two stations are considered for the power of trend detection, estimating periodic fluctuations and mean values of the stationary components, which are used for determining non-uniform sampling frequencies for sub-areas. The proposed methodology is applied to the Dehgolan plain in northwestern Iran. The results show that a new sampling configuration with 35 and 7 monitoring stations and sampling intervals of 20 and 32 days, respectively in sub-areas with high and low monitoring priorities, leads to a more efficient monitoring network than the existing one containing 52 monitoring stations and monthly temporal sampling.

J	Qi, SQ; Hou, DY; Luo, J				Qi, Shengqi; Hou, Deyi; Luo, Jian			Optimization of groundwater sampling approach under various hydrogeological conditions using a numerical simulation model	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study presents a numerical model based on field data to simulate groundwater flow in both the aquifer and the well-bore for the low-flow sampling method and the well-volume sampling method. The numerical model was calibrated to match well with field drawdown, and calculated flow regime in the well was used to predict the variation of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration during the purging period. The model was then used to analyze sampling representativeness and sampling time. Site characteristics, such as aquifer hydraulic conductivity, and sampling choices, such as purging rate and screen length, were found to be significant determinants of sampling representativeness and required sampling time. Results demonstrated that: (1) DO was the most useful water quality indicator in ensuring groundwater sampling representativeness in comparison with turbidity, pH, specific conductance, oxidation reduction potential (ORP) and temperature; (2) it is not necessary to maintain a drawdown of less than 0.1 m when conducting low flow purging. However, a high purging rate in a low permeability aquifer may result in a dramatic decrease in sampling representativeness after an initial peak; (3) the presence of a short screen length may result in greater drawdown and a longer sampling time for low-flow purging. Overall, the present study suggests that this new numerical model is suitable for describing groundwater flow during the sampling process, and can be used to optimize sampling strategies under various hydrogeological conditions.

Coupling fine particle and bedload transport in gravel-bedded streams	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Fine particles in the silt- and clay-size range are important determinants of surface water quality. Since fine particle loading rates are not unique functions of stream discharge this limits the utility of the available models for water quality assessment. Data from 38 minimally developed watersheds within the United States Geological Survey stream gauging network in California, USA reveal three lines of evidence that fine particle release is coupled with bedload transport. First, there is a transition in fine particle loading rate as a function of discharge for gravel-bedded sediments that does not appear when the sediment bed is composed of sand, cobbles, boulders, or bedrock. Second, the discharge at the transition in the loading rate is correlated with the initiation of gravel mobilization. Third, high frequency particle concentration and discharge data are dominated by clockwise hysteresis where rising limb discharges generally have higher concentrations than falling limb discharges. These three observations across multiple watersheds lead to a conceptual model that fine particles accumulate within the sediment bed at discharges less than the transition and then the gravel bed fluidizes with fine particle release at discharges above the transition discharge. While these observations were individually recognized in the literature, this analysis provides a consistent conceptual model based on the coupling of fine particle dynamics with filtration at low discharges and gravel bed fluidization at higher discharges.

J	Zhang, YY; Gao, Y; Yu, Q				Zhang, Yongyong; Gao, Yang; Yu, Qiang			Diffuse nitrogen loss simulation and impact assessment of stereoscopic agriculture pattern by integrated water system model and consideration of multiple existence forms	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Agricultural nitrogen loss becomes an increasingly important source of water quality deterioration and eutrophication, even threatens water safety for humanity. Nitrogen dynamic mechanism is still too complicated to be well captured at watershed scale due to its multiple existence forms and instability, disturbance of agricultural management practices. Stereoscopic agriculture is a novel agricultural planting pattern to efficiently use local natural resources (e.g., water, land, sunshine, heat and fertilizer). It is widely promoted as a high yield system and can obtain considerable economic benefits, particularly in China. However, its environmental quality implication is not clear. In our study, Qianyanzhou station is famous for its stereoscopic agriculture pattern of Southern China, and an experimental watershed was selected as our study area. Regional characteristics of runoff and nitrogen losses were simulated by an integrated water system model (HEQM) with multi-objective calibration, and multiple agriculture practices were assessed to find the effective approach for the reduction of diffuse nitrogen losses. Results showed that daily variations of runoff and nitrogen forms were well reproduced throughout watershed, i.e., satisfactory performances for ammonium and nitrate nitrogen (NH4-N and NO3-N) loads, good performances for runoff and organic nitrogen (ON) load, and very good performance for total nitrogen (TN) load. The average loss coefficient was 62.74 kg/ha for NH4-N, 0.98 kg/ha for NO3-N, 0.0004 kg/ha for ON and 63.80 kg/ha for TN. The dominating form of nitrogen losses was NH4-N due to the applied fertilizers, and the most dramatic zones aggregated in the middle and downstream regions covered by paddy and orange orchard. In order to control diffuse nitrogen losses, the most effective practices for Qianyanzhou stereoscopic agriculture pattern were to reduce farmland planting scale in the valley by afforestation, particularly for orchard in the downstream regions, followed by fertilizer application optimization.

In the proposed approach, we use the spatially lumped catchment model StreamGEM to predict daily stream flow and nitrate concentration (mg L-1 NO3-N) in four contrasting mesoscale headwater catchments based on four years of daily rainfall, potential evapotranspiration, and stream flow measurements, and monthly or daily nitrate concentrations. Posterior model parameter distributions were estimated using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling code DREAMzs and a log likelihood function assuming heteroscedastic, t-distributed residuals. Despite high uncertainty in some model parameters, the flow and nitrate calibration data was well reproduced across all catchments (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency against Log transformed data, NSL, in the range 0.62-0.83 for daily flow and 0.17-0.88 for nitrate concentration). The slight increase in the size of the residuals for a separate validation period was considered acceptable (NSL in the range 0.60-0.89 for daily flow and 0.10-0.74 for nitrate concentration, excluding one data set with limited validation data). Proportions of flow and nitrate discharge attributed to near-surface, fast seasonal groundwater and slow deeper groundwater were consistent with expectations based on catchment geology. The results for the Weida Stream in Thuringia, Germany, usingmonthly as opposed to daily nitrate data were, for all intents and purposes, identical, suggesting that four years of monthly nitrate sampling provides sufficient information for calibration of the StreamGEM model and prediction of catchment dynamics. This study highlights the remarkable effectiveness of process based, spatially lumped modelling with commonly available monthly stream sample data, to elucidate high resolution catchment function, when appropriate calibration methods are used that correctly handle the inherent uncertainties.

The study area covers an area of 375 km(2) and lies in a semiarid climate. Groundwater is the major source for domestic and agricultural activity in this area. Groundwater samples were collected from 19 wells during dry and wet periods in 2012, and they were analyzed for major cations and anions and compared with drinking and irrigation specification standards. The concentration of the majority of chemical constituents exceeds the standards of WHO as a result of various sources of pollution. It indicates the dominance of groundwater types: Ca-Mg-Cl, and Ca-Mg-HCO3. Suitability of groundwater for drinking was evaluated based on the water quality index; it shows more than 60% of samples have very poor quality for dry and wet periods, which means water is severely contaminated and unsuitable for drinking purpose. In terms of the irrigation usage, generally groundwater is suitable for both periods in the major part of the plain. The Mineralization processes in this area is determined by the lithology of the aquifer (exchange water-rock), by anthropogenic factors (discharges of urban sewage, use of fertilizers) and also by evaporation (semi-arid climate).																	0016-7622	0974-6889				SEP	2017	90	3					347	356		10.1007/s12594-017-0723-7								WOS:000411210300011

A study of the effect of water quality-related variables on some age-related diseases adjusted for other well-known risk factors: a multivariate multilevel study	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												Mortality rates of some diseases are affected by water quality. This research examines the roles of two factors related to water quality, namely the quality of drinking water termed 'water' and the quality of sanitation termed 'sanitation'. Two age-related diseases, cardiovascular disease and diabetes (CDD) and chronic respiratory conditions (CRC) are considered while adjusting for personal health issues, environmental and geographical factors. The dataset consists of worldwide mortality rates of adults for the mentioned diseases in 195 countries. These countries are clustered within continents geographically and literature shows the importance of considering the geographical effect of a continent. Furthermore, the two diseases were highly related to each other. Accordingly, the multivariate multilevel model was fitted to the dataset. The results indicated that when the usage of improved drinking water sources and sanitation facilities decreases, the chance of mortality from the two diseases increases. Furthermore, the difference in the risk of the diseases was statistically significant between the continents. It showed that North America and Europe had a lower risk of having CDD and CRC compared to Asia and Oceania. Therefore, the results revealed that the factors 'water' and 'sanitation' play important roles for this macro geographical variation of CDD and CRC.																	2043-9083					SEP	2017	7	3					416	425		10.2166/washdev.2017.118								WOS:000411250500008

The impact of low-flow season on source drinking water quality, Rosetta branch, Egypt	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												The present work was conducted to document the problems raised regarding low-flow in the Rosetta branch, Egypt and to develop management options to protect drinking water sources. The water quality was monitored during low-flow periods at four drinking water intakes. Results showed an increase in electric conductivity (EC), ammonium(NH4), nitrite (NO2), phosphate (PO4), and total organic carbon (TOC) during the low-flow period. EC ranges from 454 to 1,062 mu S/cm and the mean value is 744. Ammonium ranges from 0.38 to 18.5 mg/L and the mean value is 5.45. NO2, PO4, and TOC have mean values of 0.73, 1.85, and 6.71 mg/L, respectively. Statistical evaluation revealed the association of NH4, EC, and PO4 that are good indicators for the load of wastewater. High ammonium often refers to a bad situation regarding oxygen while high nitrite indicates the first oxidation for wastewater through microbiological processes. The low-flow action has a serious impact on drinking water source. A high content of ammonium has delayed coagulation, enhanced algae growth, and prevented the breakpoint being reached during chlorination processes. Potential management options to deal with water scarcity and low-flow, meanwhile reducing the contaminant load in the source drinking water were proposed.																	2043-9083					SEP	2017	7	3					477	484		10.2166/washdev.2017.158								WOS:000411250500014

Microbiological contamination of water pans in Baringo County	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												Water pans constitute the main source of rural water supply in Baringo County. This study sought to assess the spatial-temporal variation of total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Fecal streptococcus and Salmonella species in the water pans. A sanitary survey was conducted to observe the potential sources of microbial contamination on the water pans. Water was sampled from one protected and five unprotected water pans (n = 6) in the study area for a period of 4 months (June-October 2015). A total of 72 water samples were sampled in triplicate from the water pans for microbial analyses, membrane filtration technique was used in assaying for microbial counts of total coliforms, E. coli, F. streptococcus and Salmonella species in water samples. The results show that there was a significant spatial variation in F. streptococcus amongst the protected and the unprotected water pan sampled sites (p = 0.008), and there was a statistically temporal significant difference (p = 0.001) for total coliforms and Salmonella species during the dry seasons, respectively. Given the prevalence of the selected diseases causing pathogens in water above the WHO drinking water quality guidelines, households are advised to treat the water before use.																	2043-9083					SEP	2017	7	3					485	494		10.2166/washdev.2017.258								WOS:000411250500015

When operations are located in sensitive regions with high biodiversity containing endangered or threatened species, it is possible to minimize impact on the environment by developing programs to scientifically monitor the impact on resident flora and fauna species in the early phases of operation so that effects can be mitigated whenever possible. This report presents the baseline health, nutrition, and trace mineral evaluation for 33 Avahi laniger (Eastern wooly lemur) and 15 Lepilemur mustelinus (greater sportive lemur) captured and given complete health evaluations that included the measurement of fat-soluble vitamins and trace minerals in addition to routine complete blood counts, serum chemistries, and parasite evaluations. All lemurs appeared healthy on physical examination despite the presence of minor wounds consistent with interspecies aggression in some individuals. Serum chemistry values were within expected ranges for other lemur species; however, A. laniger erythrocytes were significantly smaller than those of L. mustelinus. Serum nickel values were markedly higher than expected in both species, and selenium, copper, and cobalt levels were higher in L. mustelinus compared with A. laniger at the study site, as well as values for I. indri or P. diadema reported from other locations. Endoparasites and ectoparasites were typical of those reported in other wild lemur species, but load and diversity varied between A. laniger and L. mustelinus despite inhabiting the same forest ecosystem. This baseline assessment provides the foundation for ongoing monitoring.																	1042-7260	1937-2825				SEP	2017	48	3					794	803		10.1638/2016-0261.1								WOS:000411163100023	28920824

This technology could result in higher productivity with less impact to the environment. Furthermore, biofloc systems may be developed and performed in integration with other food production, thus promoting productive integrated systems, aiming at producing more food and feed from the same area of land with fewer input. The biofloc technology is still in its infant stage. A lot more research is needed to optimise the system (in relation to operational parameters) e.g. in relation to nutrient recycling, MAMP production, immunological effects. In addition research findings will need to be communicated to farmers as the implementation of biofloc technology will require upgrading their skills.																	1751-7915					SEP	2017	10	5			SI		1012	1016		10.1111/1751-7915.12836								WOS:000411491300007	28941177

The best method to include this data is not yet clear, especially in the case when few historical studies are available. This paper looks at the power prior technique afresh in a binomial setting and examines some previously unexamined properties, such as Box P values, bias, and coverage. Additionally, it proposes an empirical Bayes-type approach to estimating the prior weight parameter by marginal likelihood. This estimate has advantages over previously criticised methods in that it varies commensurably with differences in the historical and current data and can choose weights near 1 when the data are similar enough. Fully Bayesian approaches are also considered. An analysis of the operating characteristics shows that the adaptive methods work well and that the various approaches have different strengths and weaknesses.

This research was conducted under the descriptive method, employing survey technique and insitu measurement toward the parameters related to the condition of the water in the coast line of Atauro Island. The data obtained from the measurement were then evaluated based on the quality standards and were analyzed using the Geographic Information System (GIS). The results ot the measurement on the distribution of the water quality along the coast line of Atauro Island showed: temperature 29.5 - 30.5 degrees C, salinity 33 - 34 ppt, pH 8 - 8.3, brightness 1.22 - 6.4 m, depth 1.22 - 6.4 m, sea surface current 24.05 - 25.15 cm/s. Based on the result of this study, it can be concluded that 914 hectares of the water in Atauro Island is most suitable (S2) to use for seaweed farming, and 81 hectares is considered suitable (S2) for seaweed farming.																	0975-8585					SEP-OCT	2017	8	5					155	163										WOS:000410685200022						
J	Hagger, V; Dwyer, J; Wilson, K				Hagger, Valerie; Dwyer, John; Wilson, Kerrie			What motivates ecological restoration?	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Ecological restoration projects are motivated by diverse environmental and social reasons. Motivations likely vary between stakeholders or regions, and influence the approach taken to plan, implement, and monitor restoration projects. We surveyed 307 people involved in the restoration of native vegetation across Australia to identify their underlying motivations. We also elicited information on planning, implementation, and monitoring of restoration projects. We found that biodiversity enhancement is the main motivation for undertaking restoration, with biodiversity offsetting, water quality improvements, and social reasons as important secondary motivations. Motivations varied significantly by stakeholder type and region. Restoration projects primarily motivated by ecosystem service provision (e.g. water quality improvements and social reasons) sought less pristine ecological outcomes than projects motivated by biodiversity enhancement or offsetting. Rigorous monitoring designs (e.g. quantitative, repeatable surveys, and use of performance indicators) were rarely used in restoration projects, except for projects motivated by scientific research. Better alignment of different restoration motivations with the planning and monitoring of restoration projects should deliver greater benefits through setting appropriate objectives and evaluating outcomes against these objectives. These improvements will increase the capacity of the restoration practice to meet international biodiversity commitments and communicate restoration outcomes to stakeholders.

S.; Faustino, Maria Amparo F.; Almeida, Adelaide			Photodynamic Action against Wastewater Microorganisms and Chemical Pollutants: An Effective Approach with Low Environmental Impact	WATER												Wastewater (WW) from urban and industrial activities is often contaminated with microorganisms and chemical pollutants. To reduce the concentration of microorganisms in WW to levels comparable to those found in natural waters, the sewage effluent is usually subjected to disinfection with chlorine, ozone, or ultraviolet light, which may lead to the formation of toxic products and contribute to the selection of resistant genes. Moreover, the changing patterns of infectious diseases and the emerging of multidrug resistant microbial strains entail the development of new technologies for WW decontamination. Microbial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) with photosensitizers, oxygen, and visible light has demonstrated to be effective in the inactivation of microorganisms via photogeneration of reactive oxygen species able to induce microbial damage at the external structures level. The promising results of PDI suggest that this principle can be applied to WW treatment to inactivate microorganisms but also to photodegrade chemical pollutants. The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of PDI for the microbial and chemical decontamination of secondarily treated WW. To evaluate the efficiency of bacterial inactivation in WW, experiments were done in both phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and filtered WW with the bioluminescent Escherichia coli, using small and large volumes of WW. The potential of PDI to inactivate the native bacteria (E. coli and Enterococcus) present in WW was tested and assays without the adding of bacteria to the WW were performed. It was also tested if the same PDI protocol was able to induce phototransformation of phenol. The cationic porphyrin 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin tetra-iodide (Tetra-Py+-Me) was shown to be effective against both bacterial groups representing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria used as microbiological parameters to instigate water quality and even showing the power to photooxidate organic compounds. As the photosensitizer when immobilized on solid matrixes can be easily removed, recovered, and reused, an effective, less-expensive, easy-applicable, and environmentally friendly technology can be applied to treat WW, inactivating microorganisms and degrading chemical contaminants at the same time.

The Spatially Explicit Load Enrichment Calculation Tool (SELECT) was developed to estimate bacterially contaminated water bodies based on spatial factors such as land use, soil, and population density. SELECT was originally automated using Visual Basics for Applications (VBA), which is no longer supported by the current version of ArcGIS. The aim of this research was to develop a new SELECT interface, pySELECT, using the Python programming language and to incorporate a rainfall-runoff E. coli transport module to simulate E. coli loads resulting from urban sources, such as dogs and on-site wastewater treatment systems. The pySELECT tool was applied to Lavon Lake, a semi urban study watershed in Northeast Texas. The highest potential E. coli loads were in the areas closest to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, and the highest transported loads were located downstream from those identified hotspots or where the most runoff was generated. Watershed managers can use pySELECT to develop best management practices on the specific areas and fecal sources that contribute fecal contamination into a waterbody.

Assessing Thermally Stressful Events in a Rhode Island Coldwater Fish Habitat Using the SWAT Model	WATER												It has become increasingly important to recognize historical water quality trends so that the future impacts of climate change may be better understood. Climate studies have suggested that inland stream temperatures and average streamflow will increase over the next century in New England, thereby putting aquatic species sustained by coldwater habitats at risk. In this study we evaluated two different approaches for modeling historical streamflow and stream temperature in a Rhode Island, USA, watershed with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), using (i) original SWAT and (ii) SWAT plus a hydroclimatological model component that considers both hydrological inputs and air temperature. Based on daily calibration results with six years of measured streamflow and four years of stream temperature data, we examined occurrences of stressful conditions for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) using the hydroclimatological model. SWAT with the hydroclimatological component improved modestly during calibration (NSE of 0.93, R-2 of 0.95) compared to the original SWAT (NSE of 0.83, R-2 of 0.93). Between 1980-2009, the number of stressful events, a moment in time where high or low flows occur simultaneously with stream temperatures exceeding 21 degrees C, increased by 55% and average streamflow increased by 60%. This study supports using the hydroclimatological SWAT component and provides an example method for assessing stressful conditions in southern New England's coldwater habitats.

In parallel with change in water resource characteristics generated by physical, environmental and socio-economic challenges such as: (1) uncertainties about climate change (flooding and drought) including seasonal and regional variation in precipitation; (2) significant increase in water use caused by rapid urbanization and population growth in industrialized urban areas; (3) inadequate water pricing mechanism which covers only around 80% of the production cost and makes it harder to maintain water systems; and (4) recursive water quality degradation and conflicts over water rights between regions resulting from non-point source pollution in highland versus lowland areas, Korean water policies have been developed through diverse reforms over 100 years. Nevertheless, new challenges for sustainable water management are continuously emerging. To meet those challenges we provide two ideas: (i) provider-gets-principle (payment for ecosystem services) of cost-benefit sharing among stakeholders who benefit from water use; and (ii) water pricing applying full-cost pricing-principle internalizing environmental externalities caused by the intensive water use. Funds secured from the application of those methods would facilitate: (1) support for upstream (rural) low income householders suffering from economic restrictions; (2) improvement in water facilities; and (3) efficient water use and demand management in South Korea's water sectors. We expect that this paper can examine the lessons relevant to challenges that South Korea faces and offer some implications on the formulation of new integration and further reforms of the institutions, laws and organizations responsible for managing water resources in South Korea.

We monitored ten small (4 to 38 ha) tile-drained catchments in Czechia for three to five years (2012 to 2016). The discharge was measured continuously; a regular 14-day scheme of water quality monitoring was accompanied with event sampling provided by automatic samplers in 20 to 120 min intervals. A new semi-automated algorithm was developed for the identification of runoff events (RE) based on discharge and water temperature changes. We then quantified the share of RE on the total runoff and the N and P losses, and we compared six methods for nutrient load estimation on an annual and monthly basis. The results showed considerable differences among the monitored sites, seasons, and applied methods. The share of RE on N loads was on average 5% to 30% of the total annual load, whereas for P (dissolved and total), the share of RE was on average 10% to 80% on the total annual load. The most precise method for nutrient load estimation included the RE. The methods based on point monitoring of the discharge and water quality underestimated the loads of N by 10% to 20% and of P by 30% to 80%. The acquired findings are crucial for the improvement of nutrient load assessment in tile-drained catchments, as well as for the design of various mitigation measures on tile-drained agricultural land.

A "W" construction was proposed to arrange the weekly water quality data in a continuous logic, and qualitative colors were designed to identify the change in major pollutants throughout the period.

Water temperature (T) and dissolved oxygen (DO) in lakes are important controls of fish growth and reproduction and likely change with future climate warming. Built upon a previous study, this study uses a modified method to identify which of 620 cisco lakes in Minnesota can still support cisco populations under future climate and therefore be classified as cisco refuge lakes. The previous study used oxythermal stress parameter TDO3, the temperature at DO of 3 mg/L, simulated only from deep virtual lakes to classify 620 cisco lakes. Using four categories of virtual but representative cisco lakes in modified method, a one-dimensional water quality model MINLAKE2012 was used to simulate daily T and DO profiles in 82 virtual lakes under the past (1961-2008) and two future climate scenarios. A multiyear average of 31-day largest TDO3 over variable benchmark (VB) periods, AvgATDO3(VB), was calculated from simulated T and DO profiles using FishHabitat2013. Contour plots of AvgATDO3(VB) for four categories of virtual lakes were then developed to reclassify 620 cisco lakes into Tier 1 (AvgATDO3(VB) <11 degrees C) or Tier 2 refuge lakes, and Tier 3 non-refuge lakes (AvgATDO3(VB) > 17 degrees C). About 20% of 620 cisco lakes are projected to be refuge lakes under future climate scenarios, which is a more accurate projection (improving the prediction accuracy by similar to 6.5% from the previous study) since AvgATDO3(VB) was found to vary by lake categories.

Combined Coagulation and Ultrafiltration Process to Counteract Increasing NOM in Brown Surface Water	WATER												Membrane hybrid processes-coagulation coupled with ultrafiltration (UF)-have become a common method to comply with the legal, chemical, and microbiological requirements for drinking water. The main advantages of integrating coagulation with membrane filtration are the enhanced removal of natural organic matter (NOM) and reduced membrane fouling. With in-line coagulation, coagulants are patched into the feed stream directly prior to the membrane process, without removing the coagulated solids. Compared with conventional coagulation/sedimentation, in-line coagulation/membrane reduces the treatment time and footprint. Coagulant dosing could be challenging in raw water of varying quality; however, with relatively stable specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), dosing can be controlled. Recent studies indicate that UV absorbance correlates well with humic substances (HS), the major fraction to be removed during coagulation. This paper describes and evaluates a 30-month UF pilot trial on the surface water of Lake Neden (Sweden), providing drinking water to 60,000 residents. In this study, automatic coagulant dosing based on online measurement was successfully applied. Online sensor data were used to identify the current optimal aluminium coagulation conditions (0.5-0.7 mg L-1) and the potential boundaries (0.9-1.2 mg L-1) for efficient future (2040) NOM removal. The potential increase in NOM could affect the Al dose and drinking water quality significantly within 20 years, should the current trends in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) prevail. UV absorbance, the freshness index, and liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) measurements were used to optimise the process. Careful cross-calibration of raw and filtered samples is recommended when using online sensor data for process optimisation, even in low-turbidity water (formazin nephelometric unit (FNU) < 5).																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							697	10.3390/w9090697								WOS:000411567200070

Water intake from a river and a neighboring urban area led to eutrophication and a strong cyanobacterial water bloom. Both the water intake and recreation were threatened due to the possible influence of cyanobacterial toxins. The lake was subjected to three sustainable restoration methods: aeration of sediment-water; iron addition to precipitate P, and; biomanipulation. The goal of our study was to determine the changes in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and chemical water variables during restoration measures. A comparison of the data obtained during this research with the pre-restoration data showed that, as a result of the treatments orthophosphates decreased, rarely exceeding 0.06 mg P.L-1, and cyanobacterial water blooms disappeared. Cyanobacteria were found in the lake but they were not abundant. Chrysophytes and diatoms were the most abundant in springtime of each year. Green algae, desmids and chrysophytes were particularly abundant in summer, while cryptophytes predominated in autumn. Algae from all these groups do not pose a threat to either recreation or water intake. The deep chlorophyll maximum occurring in summer at a depth of 5 m as a result of restoration confirms the lower trophic status of the lake, alluding to mesotrophic conditions.

J	Li, H; Ding, LQ; Ren, ML; Li, CZ; Wang, H				Li, Hui; Ding, Liuqian; Ren, Minglei; Li, Changzhi; Wang, Hong			Sponge City Construction in China: A Survey of the Challenges and Opportunities	WATER												Rapid urbanization in China has caused severe water and environmental problems in recent years. To resolve the issues, the Chinese government launched a sponge city construction program in 2015. While the sponge city construction initiative is drawing attention and is spreading fast nationwide, some challenges and risks remain. This study surveyed progress of all 30 pilot sponge cities and identified a broad array of challenges from technical, physical, regulatory, and financial, to community and institutional. The most dominant challenges involve uncertainties and risks. To resolve the issues, this study also identified various opportunities to improve China's sponge city construction program. Based on the results, recommendations are proposed including urging local governments to adopt sponge city regulations and permits to alleviate water quality and urban pluvial flooding issues, fully measuring and accounting for economic and environmental benefits, embracing regional flexibility and results-oriented approaches, and focusing on a wider range of funding resources to finance the sponge city program. Coordination among other government agencies is critical, and this is true at all level of governments. Only through greater coordination, education, and broader funding could the sponge city program be advanced meaningfully and sustainably.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							594	10.3390/w9090594								WOS:000411567200001

Exploring the dynamics in the associated factors is essential for water pollution management and control. GIS interpolation, principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate statistical techniques were used to identify the main pollution sources in different areas of Honghu Lake. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphate (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), and permanganate index (CODMn) have similar characteristics and that their values gradually increased from south to north during the three seasons in Honghu Lake. The major influencing factors of water quality varied across the different areas and seasons. The relatively high concentrations of TN and TP, which might limit the growth of submerged aquatic plants, were mainly caused by anthropogenic factors. Our work suggests that spatial analyses combined with PCA are useful for investigating the factors that influence water quality and submerged aquatic plant biomass in different areas of a lake. These findings provide sound information for the future water quality management of the lake or even the entire lake basin.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							707	10.3390/w9090707								WOS:000411567200080

Adapting the Relaxed Tanks-in-Series Model for Stormwater Wetland Water Quality Performance	WATER												Across the globe, water quality standards have been implemented to protect receiving waters from stormwater pollution, motivating regulators (and consequently designers) to develop tools to predict the performance of stormwater control measures such as constructed stormwater wetlands (CSWs). The goal of this study was to determine how well the relaxed tanks-in-series (P-k-C*) model described the performance of CSWs in North Carolina. Storm events monitored at 10 CSWs in North Carolina were used for calibrating the model, and statistical evaluations concluded the model could adequately predict the performance for all pollutants except organic nitrogen. Nash-Sutcliff calibration/validation values were determined to be 0.72/0.78, 0.78/0.74, 0.91/0.87, 0.72/0.62, 0.88/0.73, and 0.91/0.63 for total nitrogen, total ammoniacal nitrogen, oxidized nitrogen, organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed only one calibration parameter with strong sensitivity, the Arrhenius coefficient (temperature dependent model coefficient). With this model, CSWs can be optimized to treat watershed-specific influent concentrations to meet effluent targets. In general, the current design technique used in North Carolina and many other locations (a first flush volume detention method) oversizes CSWs for water quality vis-a-vis the method herein, suggesting improved designs for water quality may be possible through scientifically-informed methods.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							691	10.3390/w9090691								WOS:000411567200064						
J	Nam, G; Choi, YH; Lee, N; Ahn, JW				Nam, Gnu; Choi, Young-Hoon; Lee, Namju; Ahn, Ji Whan			Effect by Alkaline Flocculation of Algae and Phosphorous from Water Using a Calcined Waste Oyster Shell	WATER												Alkaline flocculation has been considered as a potential candidate to remove algae and eutrophic substances from water. A number of researches using low-cost and environmentally friendly methods have been suggested to optimize removal efficiency. In this study, a calcium-containing waste oyster shell, as an environmentally friendly substance, has been used to treat phosphorous, a eutrophic substance, and to remove algae from the fresh water simultaneously. The X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis showed that CaO was a major phase in a raw oyster shell, which played an important role for flocculation of phosphorous as well as algae. In order to eliminate the algae or phosphorous effectively, oyster shell was calcined at 1000 degrees C and hydrated in water. The slurry of hydrated calcined oyster shell, from 5 g/L to 12.5 g/L, was utilized in this experiment, where the experimental results were compared with that of dolomite. A series of experimental investigations, such as pH and turbidity changes using the water quality analyzer and UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), demonstrated that the algae were efficiently removed. In addition, total phosphorous (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) analyses at different amounts of slurries of the hydrated calcined oyster shell showed that almost all the phosphorous was removed at 7.5 g/L of hydrated oyster shell, but due to the high solubility of nitrogen compounds, no obvious effect for the removal of nitrogen was observed. Furthermore, powder X-ray diffractions (PXRD) showed that Ca(OH)(2) compounds were transformed to the phosphate compound, suggesting that the oyster shell caused flocculation by chemically forming with phosphorous ions.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							661	10.3390/w9090661								WOS:000411567200034

The development of Watershed Protection Plans and Total Maximum Daily Loads require systematic monitoring of waterbodies. In this study, optimum water quality monitoring networks were selected to assess E. coli loads in the Guadalupe River and San Antonio River basins. A Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied to select monitoring stations using the mean annual E. coli flux from the Spatially Referenced Regression Model on Watershed Attributes (SPARROW). The objectives of the GA were to minimize the number of monitoring stations, include large values of the mean annual E. coli flux, and minimize uncertainty of the flux estimations. Constraints related to the monitoring of critical locations were included in a multi-objective optimization problem. The SPARROW model was applied to the optimized GA solution sets, which were compared using the objective values and statistical indices. The best GA-generated alternative set adequately represented the San Antonio River basin, in good agreement with a previous study conducted using only SPARROW. The application of the GA ensured the inclusion of the monitoring stations with large values of E. coli flux, which reflected high-risk areas within the watershed.

To explore the influences of sediments on the water quality of reservoirs, the spatial distribution, adsorption/release characteristics, and environment influence of sediment pollutants should be analyzed. In this paper, the spatial distributions of phosphorus (P) and P fractions in the Biliuhe reservoir (river valley reservoirs) sediments were investigated. The adsorption and release characteristics of sediments P were studied in the experiment, while its environmental influence was analyzed too. The results indicate that the concentration of P in sediments was higher at the dam and the Zhongling site, while lower at other entrances of the reservoir and the smallest in the water-level fluctuating zone. Total Phosphorus (TP) varied from 355.46 to 764.57 mg/kg. Inorganic Phosphorus (IP) was the main form of TP in sediments, making up a proportion of 56-75%, while the correlation coefficient of P bound to Al, Fe, and Mn oxides was 0.922. Hydroxide (Fe/Al-P) was the main form of IP, which accounted for 46-83% with a correlation coefficient of 0.888. The maximum adsorption capacity calculated by Langmuir model was between 714.29 and 3333.33 mg/kg. The adsorption efficiency obtained by the Freundlich model was within the range of 0.40-1.42, which indicated that P adsorption was more difficult in the water-level fluctuating zone. The critical adsorption and release concentration range was 0.1-0.2 mg/L for the majority of the sampling points. The amount of P released in 24 h (the initial concentration of TP in the overlying water was 0 mg/L) accounted for 1.15-4.16% of TP in sediments, which was higher than the average concentration in the reservoir. It is concluded that the sediment is the potential pollution source. The relationship between the change of environmental factors and the release of sediment contaminants should be considered in the future.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							724	10.3390/w9090724								WOS:000411567200096						
J	Wu, YF; Dai, HL; Wu, JY				Wu, Yifeng; Dai, Hongliang; Wu, Jianyong			Comparative Study on Influences of Bank Slope Ecological Revetments on Water Quality Purification Pretreating Low-Polluted Waters	WATER												To improve aquatic environmental quality and maintain channel stability against soil erosion, ecological bank slope revetments for surface water bodies were developed using a combination of prefabricated porous concrete spheres and vegetation methods, and a model set-up consisting of two equal-sized ditches with different types of bank slope revetments was constructed to evaluate the purification effects of ecological and hard revetments on water quality. The slope of one ditch was embanked with ecological revetments as an experimental treatment, while the other was embanked with hard revetments as a control. Pollutant removal from the ecological bank revetment ditch was significantly better in terms of the overall removal efficiencies of the chemical oxygen demand of manganese (CODMn), ammonia, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), with two-to four-fold greater removal compared with that from hard slope revetments under the same operational conditions. Nutrient pollutants, including ammonia, TN, and TP had higher removal efficiencies than that for CODMn in both experimental ditches. The dependence of the first-order rate constant (k(20)) and temperature coefficient (theta) obtained from the Arrhenius equation indicated that the removal efficiencies for ammonia, TN, and TP were higher with greater rate constants (k(20)) in the experimental ditch. In the ecological revetment ditch, the k(20) values for CODMn, ammonia, TN, and TP were 0.054, 0.378, 0.222, and 0.266 respectively, around three-fold the values observed in the hard revetment ditch, but there was no obvious difference in theta values between the two ditches. The k(20) values of TN and TP in both ditches showed significant positive correlations with seasonal shifts, as the removal of nutrient pollutants is highly sensitive to water temperatures.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							636	10.3390/w9090636								WOS:000411567200010						
J	Zhu, SL; Zhang, ZL; Liu, XB				Zhu, Senlin; Zhang, Zhonglong; Liu, Xiaobo			Enhanced Two Dimensional Hydrodynamic and Water Quality Model (CE-QUAL-W2) for Simulating Mercury Transport and Cycling in Water Bodies	WATER												CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) is a widely-used two-dimensional, laterally averaged, longitudinal/vertical, hydrodynamic and water quality model. This model was modified and enhanced to include a mercury (Hg) simulation module for simulating Hg transport and cycling in water bodies. The Hg simulation module in W2 is able to model the physical and biochemical processes including adsorption and desorption of Hg species on multi-solids, settling and resuspension, sediment burial of adsorbed Hg, diffusive exchange between water column and sediment layer, volatilization, and biogeochemical transformations among Hg species. This paper describes the Hg simulation module, W2 model validation and its application to the Xiaxi River, China, a historical Hg contaminated water body. The W2 model was evaluated using the Xiaxi River data collected in 2007 and 2008. Model results show that W2 was able to predict the total Hg and methylmercury concentrations observed for the Xiaxi River. The Xiaxi River W2 model also provides a foundation for the future investigations of Hg contamination in the Xiaxi River. This application demonstrated the W2 model capability in predicting complex transport and cycling of Hg species in water bodies.																	2073-4441					SEP	2017	9	9							643	10.3390/w9090643								WOS:000411567200017						
J	Zischg, J; Mair, M; Rauch, W; Sitzenfrei, R				Zischg, Jonatan; Mair, Michael; Rauch, Wolfgang; Sitzenfrei, Robert			Enabling Efficient and Sustainable Transitions of Water Distribution Systems under Network Structure Uncertainty	WATER												This paper focuses on the performance of water distribution systems (WDSs) during long-term city transitions. A transition describes the pathway from an initial to a final planning stage including the structural and functional changes on the infrastructure over time. A methodology is presented where consecutive WDSs under changing conditions are automatically created, simulated and then analyzed at specific points in time during a transition process of several decades. Consequential WDS analyses include (a) uncertain network structure, (b) temporal and spatial demand variation and (c) network displacement. With the proposed approach, it is possible to identify robust WDS structures and critical points in time for which sufficient hydraulic and water quality requirements cannot be ensured to the customers. The approach is applied to a case study, where a WDS transition of epic dimensions is currently taking place due to a city relocation. The resulting necessity of its WDS transition is modelled with automatically created planning options for consecutive years of the transition process. For the investigated case study, we tested a traditional "doing-all-at-the-end" approach, where necessary pipe upgrades are performed at the last stages of the transition process. Results show that the sole design of the desired final-stage WDS is insufficient. Owing to the drastic network deconstruction and the stepwise "loss of capacity", critical pipes must be redesigned at earlier stages to maintain acceptable service levels for most of the investigated future scenarios.

J	Truax, B; Gagnon, D; Lambert, F; Fortier, J				Truax, Benoit; Gagnon, Daniel; Lambert, France; Fortier, Julien			Riparian buffer growth and soil nitrate supply are affected by tree species selection and black plastic mulching	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Tree species selection in the design of agricultural riparian buffers is important to optimize particular ecosystem services, while vegetation management (weed treatment) is often critical in obtaining first-rate tree growth and survival. This farm-scale study took place along a 1 km section of a headwater stream in southern Quebec (southeastern Canada). Five tree species with contrasted ecological characteristics were planted (Populus x canadensis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Quercus macrocarpa, Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus), with black plastic (polyethylene) mulches as the vegetation management method, as well as a control with no vegetation management, all within a fenced herbaceous riparian buffer. Tree growth and survival were measured along with soil nutrient supply. Significant Species x Vegetation treatment interactions where observed for all growth variables (p < 0.001), but also for soil nitrate (NO3) supply (p < 0.01). All species benefited from the plastic mulch treatment, but varied greatly in their responses. After 5 years, mulched hybrid poplar produced 774 times more stem volume than red oak without mulch. Across all species/vegetation treatment combinations, a 13-fold variation in soil NO3 supply rate was observed during the 4th growing season. Compared to the other species, NO3 supply rate in hybrid poplar plots was 3987% lower in the plastic mulch treatment and 4862% lower in the control treatment. Significantly higher soil NO3 supply rates were observed beneath the mulches of non nitrophilous species (white pine and red oak). Red oak growth was negatively correlated with NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.57, p < 0.05) in the mulch treatment. Early-successional nitrophilous species (hybrid poplar and red ash) planted with the plastic mulch led to the lowest increase in soil NO3 and the greatest gains in buffer structural attributes (stem volume, diameter and height). Hybrid poplar growth was positively correlated with soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) in the control treatment. Natural abandoned field/grassland invaders (white pine and bur oak) grew well without black plastic mulch, while the growth of non-mulched red oaks was marginal. In the control treatment, stem volume was a strong negative predictor (across all species) of soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.05), indicating that under herbaceous vegetation competition larger trees have a greater ability to reduce soil NO3. This study provides evidence that particular tree species/vegetation management treatment combinations strongly influence early riparian buffer structural development and soil NO3 dynamics in agricultural riparian zones.

Finding the harvesting frequency to maximize nutrient removal in a constructed wetland dominated by submerged aquatic plants	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality is still poor in many freshwater ecosystems around the world as a result of anthropogenic nutrient loading. Constructed wetlands can be used to remove excess nutrients. In these wetlands, helophytes or free floating aquatic plants are traditionally used to absorb the nutrients. The nutrients are subsequently exported upon harvesting of the plants. However, rooted submerged plants may be more effective to extract nutrients from moderately eutrophicated ecosystems than helophytes or floating species. Here, we tested how the frequency of harvesting affected submerged biomass production, biomass nutrient content and the resulting amount of nutrients removed, as well as the vegetation composition and structure. Two Myriophyllum spicatum dominated shallow ponds, with moderately low surface water nutrient loading (similar to 5.6 mg N.m(-2).d(-1) and similar to 1.32 mg P.m(-2).d(-1)) were used. Each pond was subjected to four harvesting treatments: mowing lx, 2x, 3 x or 5 x between May and September 2015. Harvesting 2 x or 3 x removed most biomass and nutrients, while mowing either 5 x or only once at the end of the growing season removed the lowest amount of nutrients from the system. Furthermore, the dominance of M. spicatum in the vegetation was best maintained in plots mown 2 x, while its cover declined in plots mown more frequently, resulting in an increase of charophyte abundance. We conclude that harvesting at an intermediate frequency is best when aiming to remove the maximum amount of nutrients under a moderately low nutrient loading. Harvesting more frequently may be a suitable management method to reduce dominance of M. spicatum in situations where it causes nuisance problems due to massive growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A consistent investigation for three years about macrophyte, phy-toplankton, zooplankton and water quality has been conducted to explore the effect of macrophyte restoration on improving aquatic ecosystem. The results showed that macrophyte biomass and coverage after the restoration were as high as 821 g/m(2) and 55%, respectively, and the dominant species were Cer-atophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum verticillatum and Potamogeton crispus. Moreover, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total suspended solids (TSS) and nitrate nitrogen (NN) significantly decreased yearly, but the changes in total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (AN) were not significant during the investigation. Phytoplankton density and biomass significantly decreased, and the dominant species changed from blue-green algae to green algae. Zooplankton density and biomass, however, significantly increased yearly, and the small-sized dominant species (such as, Keratella cochlearis, Polyarthra trigla, etc.) were gradually replaced by the large-sized species (such as, Asplanchna priodonala, Alma guttata, etc.) during the restoration. In addition, macrophyte was negatively correlated with nutrients, but positively correlated with zooplankton. Phytoplankton was also positively related with TN. These correlations showed that restored macrophytes could decrease nutrition loading in water body, inhibit phytoplankton growth to decrease the risk of algae blooms, and support more large-sized zooplankton to strengthen the top-down control of phytoplankton. Therefore, our results showed that macrophyte restoration is a very potential and effective method to combat with the eutrophication and develop water quality in the eutrophic subtropical lakes, and deserves more attentions in future subtropical/tropical lake managements.

SWINE WASTEWATER: IMPACTS ON SOIL, PLANT, AND LEACHATE	ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA												The use of animal-origin residues as a nutrient source without prior and proper investigations on their positive and negative impacts can affect the quality of agricultural soils and the environment into which they are inserted. In this sense, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of swine wastewater and mineral fertilization application on soil, soybean crop, and leachate characteristics. The experiment was developed in drainage lysimeters under field conditions. The following doses of swine wastewater were applied: 0, 100, 200, and 300 m(3) ha(-1), both with and without mineral fertilization. Swine wastewater application contributed to increasing soil nutrients; however, a special attention should be paid to Cu+ and Zn+ accumulation, which may interfere with soil quality in the long-term. In addition, Na+, K+, and N can be leached into groundwater and cause impacts on water quality. Wastewater supplied soybean crop requirements with some nutrients such as K+ and Zn2+, without the need for an additional mineral supplementation. Thus, once the above conditions are monitored, swine wastewater can be applied to soil.

Income inequality and willingness to pay for environmental public goods	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT												We study how the distribution of income among members of society, and income inequality in particular, affects social willingness to pay (WTP) for environmental public goods. We find that social WTP for environmental goods decreases (increases) with income inequality if and only if environmental goods and manufactured goods are substitutes (complements). We derive adjustment factors for benefit transfer to control for differences in income distributions between a study site and a policy site. For illustration, we quantify how social WTP for environmental public goods depends on the respective income distributions for empirical case studies in Sweden and the World at large. We find that the adjustment for income inequality can be substantial. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Comparing A Bayesian and Fuzzy Number Approach to Uncertainty Quantification in Short-Term Dissolved Oxygen Prediction	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												A new autoregressive-type, updating fuzzy linear regression method is proposed to predict daily dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in a highly urbanized riverine environment. Results of this model are compared to results from an updating Bayesian regression model. Both methods use lagged daily DO (at four different lags) as the independent variable. Uncertainty in the models is represented by a fuzzy number based approach in the first case, and by a Bayesian framework in the second. Real-time data from the Bow River in Calgary, Canada is used to calibrate the models sequentially to mimic a real-time updating model. Four different performance metrics were used to measure the performance of each model. Lastly, the input data resolution is reduced to measure the impact on model performance. Results show that the physical system can be adequately characterized using only one year of data. Both approaches can capture the general trend of daily DO, but the fuzzy number based method can better capture the changes in observed variability. The metrics for both models are comparable, with the one-day lag case categorized as "very good"; however, the performance reduces at higher lags. The fuzzy number method captures more low DO events than the Bayesian approach, with a much lower mean squared error. A possibility to probability transformation is used to highlight the risk of low DO days for the fuzzy case. Lastly, reducing the input data resolution from 96 to 6 points per day has a minimal impact on model performance, suggesting the limited efficacy or utility in increasing sampling rates.																	1726-2135	1684-8799				SEP	2017	30	1					1	16		10.3808/jei.201700371								WOS:000412031900001

Long-Term Effects of Ecological Factors on Nonpoint Source Pollution in the Upper Reach of the Yangtze River	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Nowadays, nonpoint source pollution has been a dominant cause of water quality deterioration and eutrophication. For large basins, long-term effects of ecological factors on nonpoint source pollution are significant and have gained worldwide attention. Yangtze River is the largest river in China, and water environment protection of its upper reach is crucial to maintain the whole river health and the Three Gorges Project successful operation. The objective of this study is to reveal the effects of ecological factors on nonpoint source pollution in the upper reach of the Yangtze River during the period from 1960 through 2003 by the Improved Export Coefficient Model and the Nutrient Losses Empirical Model. The results indicated that during those decades the effects of ecological factors on dissolved pollutants were constant whereas those on sediment as well as absorbed pollutants changed slightly and decreased obviously after 2000. Comparing to anthropogenic factors, ecological ones had a dominant influence on sediment and absorbed pollutants. As for load intensities, long-term effects of ecological factors on dissolved pollutants hadn't changed much, while those on sediment as well as absorbed pollutants was increasingly significant and then reached an ultimate in 1980. Atmospheric deposition, grassland as well as forest were important sources of dissolved nitrogen export, nevertheless, grassland and forest were the main export areas of dissolved phosphorus, sediment as well as absorbed pollutants. The study would facilitate the source identification and nonpoint source pollution control in the upper reach of the Yangtze River to improve water quality.																	1726-2135	1684-8799				SEP	2017	30	1					17	28		10.3808/jei.201700370								WOS:000412031900002						
J	Daryanto, S; Wang, LX; Jacinthe, PA				Daryanto, Stefani; Wang, Lixin; Jacinthe, Pierre Andre			Meta-Analysis of Phosphorus Loss from No-Till Soils	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Agriculture is a significant contributor to phosphorus (P) enrichment in aquatic ecosystems. No-till (NT) farming has been proposed as an alternative approach to conventional tillage (CT) in reducing soil P export, but published data have shown contrasting impacts, likely due to the interacting effects of different physical (climate region, rainfall variability, transport pathway, slope gradient) and management variables (NT duration, crop species). We conducted a meta-analysis to understand the extent to which each of these variables controls the concentration and load of different P fractions (dissolved P, particulate P) in agricultural runoff and leaching. In comparison with CT, particulate P loss was significantly lower with NT adoption (45 and 55% reduction in concentration and load, respectively), but an increase in dissolved P loss was observed. The extent of the reduction or increase, however, varied with different physical and management variables. In comparison with CT, for example, NT was not effective in reducing particulate P concentration during wet years and particulate P load on steep slopes (4-9%). Total P concentration was also similar with CT at sites under prolonged NT duration (similar to 10 yr) and at NT fields planted with soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Our results underscore the need to consider the covarying physical and management factors when assessing the potential of NT farming in controlling P loss in the environment. The limited impact of NT on dissolved P loss remains a serious impediment toward harnessing the water quality benefits of this management practice.

Assessing the Yield and Load of Contaminants with Stream Order: Would Policy Requiring Livestock to Be Fenced Out of High-Order Streams Decrease Catchment Contaminant Loads?	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Catchment contaminant loads vary with stream order as catchment characteristics influence inputs and in-stream processing. However, the relative influence and policy significance of these characteristics across a number of contaminants and at a national scale is unclear. We modeled the significance of catchment characteristics (e.g., climate, topography, geology, land cover), as captured by a national-scale River Environment Classification (REC) system, and stream order in the estimation of contaminant yields. We used this model to test if potential regulation in New Zealand requiring livestock to be fenced off from large (high)-order streams would substantially decrease catchment contaminant loads. Concentration and flow data for 1998 to 2009 were used to calculate catchment load and yields of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) species, suspended sediment, and Escherichia coli at 728 water quality monitoring sites. On average, the yields of all contaminants increased with increasing stream order in catchments dominated by agriculture (generally lowland and pastoral REC land cover classes). Loads from low-order small streams (< 1 m wide, 30 cm deep, and in flat catchments dominated by pasture) exempt from potential fencing regulations accounted for an average of 77% of the national load (varying from 73% for total N to 84% for dissolved reactive P). This means that to substantially reduce contaminant losses, other mitigations should be investigated in small streams, particularly where fencing of larger streams has low efficacy.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2017	46	5					1038	1047		10.2134/jeq2017.05.0212								WOS:000411433900013	28991968

However, E. coli does not provide enough information to determine fecal source or public health risk. The stsudy objective was to determine factors influencing the presence of E. coli and host-specific markers (HSM) from upstream to downstream in Beaver Lake Reservoir (BLR). From February 2014 to September 2015, 420 base flow and rain event samples were collected from seven sites-two sites from streams (White River [WR] and War Eagle Creek) draining into BLR and five sites from within BLR. Each sample was analyzed for E. coli and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for HSM related to human, bovine, and poultry. The data indicate that overall levels of E. coli were significantly greater in the WR and significantly lower at the most downstream sampling location in BLR. Escherichia coli is more likely present during spring (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.86), at the WR sampling site (aOR = 3.39), or during a rain event (aOR = 2.73). Moreover, the HSM HumM2 is more likely present (aOR = 1.99) when E. coli is present. These same factors were associated with E. coli concentrations >126 most probable number 100 mL(-1) (aOR = 2.76-12.48), except the poultry marker CL was more likely associated (aOR = 3.81) than HumM2. This study revealed that both seasonal and locational factors are important variables for fecal pollution in BLR. Moreover, these same factors may apply to fecal pollution in manmade reservoirs within similar types of watersheds across the United States, as well as internationally.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2017	46	5					1048	1056		10.2134/jeq2017.03.0105								WOS:000411433900014	28991970

Tile Drainage Nitrate Losses and Corn Yield Response to Fall and Spring Nitrogen Management	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Nitrogen (N) management strategies that maintain high crop productivity with reduced water quality impacts are needed for tile-drained landscapes of the US Midwest. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of N application rate, timing, and fall nitrapyrin addition on tile drainage nitrate losses, corn (Zea mays L.) yield, N recovery efficiency, and postharvest soil nitrate content over 3 yr in a corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. In addition to an unfertilized control, the following eight N treatments were applied as anhydrous ammonia in a replicated, field-scale experiment with both corn and soybean phases present each year in Illinois: fall and spring applications of 78, 156, and 234 kg N ha(-1), fall application of 156 kg N ha(-1) + nitrapyrin, and sidedress (V5-V6) application of 156 kg N ha(-1). Across the 3-yr study period, increases in flow-weighted NO3 concentrations were found with increasing N rate for fall and spring N applications, whereas N load results were variable. At the same N rate, spring vs. fall N applications reduced flow-weighted NO3 concentrations only in the corn-soybean-corn rotation. Fall nitrapyrin and sidedress N treatments did not decrease flow-weighted NO3 concentrations in either rotation compared with fall and spring N applications, respectively, or increase corn yield, crop N uptake, or N recovery efficiency in any year. This study indicates that compared with fall N application, spring and sidedress N applications (for corn-soybean-corn) and sidedress N applications (for soybean-corn-soybean) reduced 3-yr mean flow-weighted NO3 concentrations while maintaining yields.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2017	46	5					1057	1064		10.2134/jeq2017.03.0109								WOS:000411433900015	28991986

Structural Equation Model of Total Phosphorus Loads in the Red River of the North Basin, USA and Canada	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Attribution of the causes of trends in nutrient loading is often limited to correlation, qualitative reasoning, or references to the work of others. This paper represents efforts to improve causal attribution of water-quality changes. The Red River of the North basin provides a regional test case because of international interest in the reduction of total phosphorus loads and the availability of long-term total phosphorus data and ancillary geospatial data with the potential to explain changes in water quality over time. The objectives of the study are to investigate structural equation modeling methods for application to water-quality problems and to test causal hypotheses related to the drivers of total phosphorus loads over the period 1970 to 2012. Multiple working hypotheses that explain total phosphorus loads and methods for estimating missing ancillary data were developed, and water-quality related challenges to structural equation modeling (including skewed data and scaling issues) were addressed. The model indicates that increased precipitation in season 1 (November-February) or season 2 (March-June) would increase total phosphorus loads in the basin. The effect of agricultural practices on total phosphorus loads was significant, although the effect is about one-third of the effect of season 1 precipitation. The structural equation model representing loads at six sites in the basin shows that climate and agricultural practices explain almost 60% of the annual total phosphorus load in the Red River of the North basin. The modeling process and the unexplained variance highlight the need for better ancillary long-term data for causal assessments.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				SEP-OCT	2017	46	5					1072	1080		10.2134/jeq2017.04.0131								WOS:000411433900017	28991977

Characterising urban zinc generation to identify surface pollutant hotspots in a low intensity rainfall climate	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Characterising stormwater runoff quality provides useful insights into the dynamics of pollutant generation and wash off rates. These can be used to prioritise stormwater management strategies. This study examined the effects of a low intensity rainfall climate on zinc contributions from different impermeable urban surface types. First flush (FF) and steady state samples were collected from seven different surfaces for characterisation, and the data were also used to calibrate an event-based pollutant load model to predict individual 'hotspot' surfaces across the catchment. Unpainted galvanised roofs generated very high concentrations of zinc, primarily in the more biologically available dissolved form. An older, unpainted galvanised roof had FF concentrations averaging 32,338 mu g/L, while the new unpainted roof averaged 4,782 mu g/L. Roads and carparks also had elevated zinc, but FF concentrations averaged only 822-1,584 mu g/L. Modelling and mapping expected zinc loads from individual impermeable surfaces across the catchment identified specific commercial roof surfaces to be targeted for zinc management. The results validate a policy strategy to replace old galvanised roof materials and avoid unpainted galvanised roofing in future urban development for better urban water quality outcomes. In the interim, readily-implemented treatment options are required to help mitigate chronic zinc impacts on receiving waterways.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2017	76	6					1370	1377		10.2166/wst.2017.306								WOS:000411845600009	28953463					
J	Chounlamany, V; Tanchuling, MA; Inoue, T				Chounlamany, Vanseng; Antonia Tanchuling, Maria; Inoue, Takanobu			Spatial and temporal variation of water quality of a segment of Marikina River using multivariate statistical methods	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Payatas landfill in Quezon City, Philippines, releases leachate to the Marikina River through a creek. Multivariate statistical techniques were applied to study temporal and spatial variations in water quality of a segment of the Marikina River. The data set included 12 physico-chemical parameters for five monitoring stations over a year. Cluster analysis grouped the monitoring stations into four clusters and identified January-May as dry season and June-September as wet season. Principal components analysis showed that three latent factors are responsible for the data set explaining 83% of its total variance. The chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, Cl- and PO43- are influenced by anthropogenic impact/eutrophication pollution from point sources. Total suspended solids, turbidity and SO42- are influenced by rain and soil erosion. The highest state of pollution is at the Payatas creek outfall from March to May, whereas at downstream stations it is in May. The current study indicates that the river monitoring requires only four stations, nine water quality parameters and testing over three specific months of the year. The findings of this study imply that Payatas landfill requires a proper leachate collection and treatment system to reduce its impact on the Marikina River.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				SEP	2017	76	6					1510	1522		10.2166/wst.2017.279								WOS:000411845600023	28953477					
J	Herojeet, R; Rishi, MS; Lata, R; Dolma, K				Herojeet, Rajkumar; Rishi, Madhuri S.; Lata, Renu; Dolma, Konchok			Quality characterization and pollution source identification of surface water using multivariate statistical techniques, Nalagarh Valley, Himachal Pradesh, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Sirsa River flows through the central part of the Nalagarh valley, belongs to the rapid industrial belt of Baddi, Barotiwala and Nalagarh (BBN). The appraisal of surface water quality to ascertain its utility in such ecologically sensitive areas is need of the hour. The present study envisages the application of multivariate analysis, water utility class and conventional graphical representation to reveal the hidden factor responsible for deterioration of water quality and determine the hydrochemical facies and its evolution processes of water types in Nalagarh valley, India. The quality assessment is made by estimating pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness, major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- and PO43-), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total coliform (TC) to determine its suitability for drinking and domestic purposes. The parameters like pH, TDS, TH, Ca2+, HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, NO3- are within the desirable limit as per Bureau of Indian Standards (Indian Standard Drinking Water Specification (Second Edition) IS:10500. Indian Standard Institute, New Delhi, pp 1-18, 2012). Mg2+, Na+ and K+ ions for pre monsoon and EC during pre and post monsoon at few sites and approx 40% samples of BOD and TC for both seasons exceeds the permissible limits indicate organic contamination from human activities. Water quality classification for designated use indicates that maximum surface water samples are not suitable for drinking water source without conventional treatment. The result of piper trillinear and Chadha's diagram classified majority of surface water samples for both seasons fall in the fields of Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- water type indicating temporary hardness. PCA and CA reveal that the surface water chemistry is influenced by natural factors such as weathering of minerals, ion exchange processes and anthropogenic factors. Thus, the present paper illustrates the importance of multivariate techniques for reliable quality characterization of surface water quality to develop effective pollution reduction strategies and maintain a fine balance between the industrialization and ecological integrity.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2137	2156		10.1007/s13201-017-0600-y								WOS:000411096700004

Relevance of water quality index for groundwater quality evaluation: Thoothukudi District, Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The present hydrogeochemical study was confined to the Thoothukudi District in Tamilnadu, India. A total of 100 representative water samples were collected during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon and analyzed for the major cations (sodium, calcium, magnesium and potassium) and anions (chloride, sulfate, bicarbonate, fluoride and nitrate) along with various physical and chemical parameters (pH, total dissolved salts and electrical conductivity). Water quality index rating was calculated to quantify the overall water quality for human consumption. The PRM samples exhibit poor quality in greater percentage when compared with POM due to dilution of ions and agricultural impact. The overlay of WQI with chloride and EC corresponds to the same locations indicating the poor quality of groundwater in the study area. Sodium (Na %), sodium absorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), residual sodium bicarbonate, permeability index (PI), magnesium hazards (MH), Kelly's ratio (KR), potential salinity (PS) and Puri's salt index (PSI) and domestic quality parameters such as total hardness (TH), temporary, permanent hardness and corrosivity ratio (CR) were calculated. The majority of the samples were not suitable for drinking, irrigation and domestic purposes in the study area. In this study, the analysis of salinization/freshening processes was carried out through binary diagrams such as of mole ratios of SO42-/Cl- and Cl-/EC that clearly classify the sources of seawater intrusion and salt-pan contamination. Spatial diagram BEX was used to find whether the aquifer was in the salinization region or in the freshening encroachment region.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2157	2173		10.1007/s13201-017-0594-5								WOS:000411096700005

Since the rivers pass through the cities, industrial and agricultural centers, these have been considered as place to dispose the sewages. This issue is more important when the river is one of the main sources of water supplying for drinking, agricultural and industrial utilizations. The goal of the present study was assessing the physicochemical characteristics of the Tireh River water. The Tireh River is the main river in the Karkheh catchment in the Iran. To this end, 14 sampling stations for measuring the physicochemical properties of Tireh River along the two main cities (Borujerd and Dorud) were measured. The results showed that (except SO4) Mg, Ca and other anions and cations have concentrations under WHO standard limitation. Almost all samples have suitable conditions for drinking with regard to the WHO standard and in comparison with agricultural standard (FAO Standard), and the potential of water is suitable for irrigation purposes. According to Wilcox diagram, 78 % of samples were at the C3-S1 and 21.5 % were at C2-S1 classes. The piper diagram shows that most of samples are bicarbonate and calcic facies.

The study was done for 105 days of culture period in zero water exchange. All of the organic loaded in the culture tanks identified comes from the shrimp feces, uneaten fed, and the decomposed macro- and microorganisms died in the culture tanks. All of the microscopic organisms in the biofloc were identified using Advance microscopes Nikon 80i. From the present study, there were abundances and high varieties of phytoplankton, zooplankton, protozoa, nematodes and algae species identified as aggregates together in the flocs accumulation. All of these microscopic organisms identified implemented the symbiotic process together for food supply, become the algae grazer, act as natural water stabilizer in regulating the nutrients in culture tank and serve as decomposer for dead organic matter in the water environment. Heterotrophic bacteria identified from Pseudomonas and Aeromonas family consumed the organic matter loaded at the bottom of culture tank and converted items through chemical process as useful protein food to be consumed back by the shrimp. Overall it can be concluded that the biofloc organisms identified really contributed as natural bioremediation agents in zero water exchange culture system to ensure the water quality in the optimal condition until the end of culture period.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2437	2446		10.1007/s13201-016-0421-4								WOS:000411096700029

Groundwater quality assessment using geoelectrical and geochemical approaches: case study of Abi area, southeastern Nigeria	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The electrical resistivity technique which involved the Schlumberger depth sounding method and geochemical analyses of water samples collected from boreholes was used to investigate the suitability of groundwater aquifers in Abi for drinking and irrigation purposes. Fifty randomly located electrical resistivity data were collected, modeled, and interpreted after calibration with lithologic logs. Ten borehole water samples were collected and analysed to determine anion, cation concentrations and some physical and chemical parameters, such as water colour, temperature, total dissolved solids, and electrical conductivity. The results show that the lithostratigraphy of the study area is composed of sands, sandstones (fractured, consolidated and loosed), siltstones, shales (compacted and fractured) of the Asu River Group, Eze-Aku Formation which comprises the aquifer units, and the Nkporo Shale Formation. The aquifer conduits are known to be rich in silicate minerals, and the groundwater samples in some locations show a significant amount of Ca2+,Mg2+, and Na2+. These cations balanced the consumption of H+ during the hydrolytic alteration of silicate minerals. The geochemical analysis of groundwater samples revealed dominant calcium-magnesium-carbonatebicarbonate water facies. Irrigation water quality parameters, such as sodium absorption ratio, percentage of sodium, and permeability index, were calculated based on the physico-chemical analyses. The groundwater quality was observed to be influenced by the interaction of some geologic processes but was classified to be good to excellent, indicating its suitability for domestic and irrigation purposes.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2463	2478		10.1007/s13201-016-0439-7								WOS:000411096700031

Evaluation of water quality and hydrogeochemistry of surface and groundwater, Tiruvallur District, Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Water quality of Tiruvallur Taluk of Tiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu, India has been analysed to assess its suitability in relation to domestic and agricultural uses. Thirty water samples, including 8 surface water (S), 22 groundwater samples [15 shallow ground waters (SW) and 7 deep ground waters (DW)], were collected to assess the various physico-chemical parameters such as Temperature, pH, Electrical conductivity (EC), Total dissolved solids (TDS), cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K), anions (CO3, HCO3, Cl, SO4, NO3, PO4) and trace elements (Fe, Mn, Zn). Various irrigation water quality diagrams and parameters such as United states salinity laboratory (USSL), Wilcox, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), sodium percentage (Na %), Residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Residual Sodium Bicarbonate (RSBC) and Kelley's ratio revealed that most of the water samples are suitable for irrigation. Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) values suggest that the water is slightly corrosive and non-scale forming in nature. Gibbs plot suggests that the study area is dominated by evaporation and rock-water dominance process. Piper plot indicates the chemical composition of water, chiefly controlled by dissolution and mixing of irrigation return flow.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2533	2544		10.1007/s13201-016-0447-7								WOS:000411096700037

The hydraulic performance of the tanks was assessed with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, which calculated the flow fields and the residence time distribution (RTD). RTDs were used to quantify the tanks hydraulic performance using hydraulic indexes that represent short-circuiting, mixing, and moment. These indexes were later associated with the effluent fraction of disinfectant (inlet and outlet disinfectant ratio). For small depth-to-diameter ratios, the inlet orientation and the inlet momentum were the most important factors regarding the hydraulic indexes and the effluent fraction of disinfectant, respectively. A poor correlation was obtained between the hydraulic indexes and the effluent fraction of disinfectant, indicating that they are not good predictors for water quality. For large depth-to-diameter ratios, the inlet orientation had the most significant effect on both the hydraulic indexes and effluent fraction of disinfectant. The short-circuiting and mixing indexes presented a good correlation with water quality for this case.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2545	2557		10.1007/s13201-016-0449-5								WOS:000411096700038

Bacteriological quality of drinking water in the Atebubu-Amantin District of the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The study was carried out to determine the bacteriological safety of water in hand-dug wells in the Atebubu-Amantin District of the Brong-Ahafo Region in Ghana. A total of 60 samples were collected from ten hand dug wells and analysed for total coliform (TC), faecal coliform (FC), E. coli (EC), Salmonella spp. (SP) and Enterococcus spp. (ES). Data was collected in both the rainy and the dry seasons. The results obtained showed that water from all the wells in the study area did not meet the World Health Organisation guideline and Ghana standard for drinking water of zero (0) coliform forming unit (cfu) per 100 ml for TC, FC, EC, SP and ES, respectively. Contamination was found to be high in the wells during the wet season as compared to the dry season. Wells (A1 to A5) which were close to septic tanks had high bacteria counts in both seasons. The total coliform counts ranged from 2.98 to 5.93 log cfu/100 ml in the wet season and 3.10-5.03 log cfu/100 ml in the dry season. There was drastic reduction of faecal coliform count from a range of 2.78-4.55 log cfu/100 ml in the wet season to 1.70-3.51 log cfu/100 ml in the dry season. The high bacteria count in wells A1 to A5 could be attributed to the closeness of the wells to the septic tank, and contaminant transport through the saturated underground zones. It is recommended that the water should be treated properly before drinking.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2571	2576		10.1007/s13201-016-0457-5								WOS:000411096700040

(As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) by hydrochemical and multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA). This study presents the first ever systematic analysis on toxic elements of water samples collected from 35 different surface water sources in both the dry and wet seasons for a duration of 2 hydrological years (2009-2011). Varimax factors extracted by principal component analysis indicates anthropogenic (domestic and agricultural run-off) and geogenic influences on the trace elements. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped 35 surfacewater sources into three statistically significant clusters based on the similarity of water quality characteristics. This study illustrates the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques for analysis and interpretation of complex data sets, and in water quality assessment, identification of pollution sources/factors and understanding temporal/spatial variations in water quality for effective surfacewater quality management.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				SEP	2017	7	5					2577	2586		10.1007/s13201-016-0453-9								WOS:000411096700041						
J	Waterton, C				Waterton, Claire			Indeterminacy and More-than-human Bodies: Sites of Experiment for Doing Politics Differently	BODY & SOCIETY												This article analyses research that has explored the potential of a focus on indeterminate bodies for decision making, policy and politics. Drawing on different ways of conceptualising indeterminacy in scientific and policy domains it describes the Loweswater Care Project, a participatory knowledge collective' that attempted to avoid converting the complexities of vital cyanobacterial bodies into a purely social or managerial set of questions around water quality. Through a commitment to opening out the nature of things', participants in this collective honed new questions and avenues of inquiry around cyanobacteria and its relations. The Loweswater Care Project was a kind of open' in Haraway's sense, where questions and demands are put to bodies, and to the apparatus that allows us to sense them, in ways that do not shy away from the probabilistic character of entities and their relations. The implications of generating indeterminacies in this setting are explored for environmental decision making, policy and politics.

Impact of extreme climate events on water supply sustainability in Egypt: case studies in Alexandria region and Upper Egypt	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												Water resources in Egypt have become stressed due to changes in climate patterns. Egypt is characterized by two seasons, a mild, wet winter and a hot, dry summer. In recent years, many areas have become vulnerable to the impact of extreme climate events. The impact of these events on water supplies has become more pronounced. This study states that there is a tangible impact of extreme climate events upon both water resources quality and water supplies. The Nile river water turbidity was investigated as an operational indicator for the water treatment plants (WTPs). The results illustrated that an unprecedented increase in average turbidity of raw water in Upper Egypt (from 4 up to 110 NTU) led to a cut in water supplies for up to 100 hours in some areas. While in Alexandria the turbidity did affect WTP operation efficiency, safe water could still be produced. Cuts in water supply would have an impact on hygiene and make people prone to use unsafe water sources. These consequences stimulate water supply bodies to develop action plans to mitigate and/or avoid such potential impacts on public health. This study suggests proposed steps to develop an appropriate plan to face such extreme events.																	2040-2244					SEP	2017	8	3					484	494		10.2166/wcc.2017.111								WOS:000410849900009

However, few studies have analyzed the spatio-temporal water quality distribution or investigated the causative factors of the long-term water quality variation of DJKR. In this study, we used multi-temporal Landsat images combined with the multiple linear stepwise regression (MLSR) method to retrieve long-term distributions of the main water quality parameters in DJKR, i.e., total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), permanganate index (CODMn), and five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5). Results indicated the heavily polluted regions and an alarming water quality deterioration trend between May 2006 and May 2014. A combination of land use/land cover (LULC) maps and socioeconomic data was considered to investigate the causative factors of the water quality distribution, as well as the deterioration. This study could provide a valuable reference for the decision-making for water quality conservation in DJKR.																	0099-1112	2374-8079				SEP	2017	83	9					643	652		10.14358/PERS.83.9.643								WOS:000411288000008

Effect of Land Cover Changes on the Sediment and Water Quality Characteristics of Brays Bayou Watershed	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Rapid increase in impervious surfaces due to urbanization often intensifies the frequency of flooding which in turn increases runoff of environmental pollutants. The Brays Bayouwatershed (BBW) is a heavily urbanized and densely populated watershed located mostly in Harris County, TX. The objectives of our study are (1) to analyze and interpret the spatial and temporal land use and land cover changes in BBW and (2) to determine nutrient, heavy metal, and bacterial contamination in the Brays Bayou. Water and sediment samples were collected from selected sampling locations along the Brays Bayou and analyzed for various nutrient and metal concentrations. Bacterial analysis was conducted to enumerate the fecal coliform bacteria in water samples. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite images sampled from over three decades (19802010) for the BBW study area were processed and analyzed for land use and land cover changes. Our remote sensing analysis revealed that the BBW lost about 28.4% (9463 acres) vegetation during the period of 1984 to 2010. The loss in vegetative areas resulted in increased impervious surface areas. In sediment samples, increasing trends for Al, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn were observed towards the downstream of Brays Bayou. Lead concentrations were found at the highest concentration (70 mg/kg) in certain Brays Bayou sampling locations. Escherichia coli concentrations decreased towards the downstream of Brays Bayou and were found below 200 maximum probable numbers/100 ml. Integration of remote sensing along with the chemical and biological analysis helped to understand the impact of land cover changes on the bayou water quality.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							336	10.1007/s11270-017-3538-7								WOS:000410827400019

Water Quality and Toxicological Impact Assessment Using the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans Bioassay in a Long-Term Intensive Agricultural Area	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Due to intensive agricultural activities to meet the growing needs for food, large volumes of water are consumed and an increasing amount of agrochemicals are released into the environment threatening the aquatic ecosystem. In order to ensure a sustainable agricultural management, it is crucial to develop an integrated water assessment plan that includes not only water quantity and quality but also toxicological assessments. The Pergamino River basin (province of Buenos Aires, Argentina) was selected as a representative case of study to monitor and assess the impact of both the long-term intensification of soybean production and fast-growing urban development on surface and ground-water sources. Physicochemical analyses and a Water Quality Index were determined and showed that water quality falls into the marginal category, compromising the irrigation purposes and threatening aquatic life. Glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid were detected at least once in all sites. Caenorhabditis elegans toxic bioassays were performed and a toxicological ranking was developed. This analysis proved to be useful to detect toxicity even when water parameters met regulatory requirements and water quality seemed to be satisfactory. This research constitutes a valuable model to be replicated in other river basins that have been impacted by intensive agriculture and growing urban development in order to assess water quality conditions and ensure sound water resources management.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							333	10.1007/s11270-017-3512-4								WOS:000410827400016

In order to control weeds in the plantations and increase productivity, the mixing of different herbicides during spraying operations is commonplace. This practice is unregulated, and the impact on water quality and nontarget tropical species is poorly understood. In the present work, exposure and recovery assays were used to evaluate antioxidant enzyme activity and histopathological alterations in the liver of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) following exposure to mixtures of the herbicides widely used in sugarcane crops: ametryn (AMT), tebuthiuron (TBUT), diuron (DIU), and hexazinone (HZN). The greatest biochemical changes were observed for the mixture (DIU+HZN)+AMT+TBUT at the highest concentration tested (1/10 96hLC50). This mixture caused a significant increase (p < 0.01) of approximately 82% in GST activity after 14 days of exposure. For three of the mixtures evaluated, GST and CAT could be considered potential biochemical biomarkers of exposure to the herbicide mixtures due to the frequency, intensity, and statistical significance of alterations in the assimilation phase. Although morphological changes were evident in the hepatic tissue, severe damage was only noted in a few samples, and there were no statistically significant differences, relative to the control. The results of hepatic lesion recovery assays suggested that the most sensitive individuals affected by the xenobiotics were unable to achieve full recovery. It is anticipated that the data obtained may assist in the selection of biomarkers for monitoring purposes, as well as in reinforcing standards of conduct in the use of agrochemical mixtures in agriculture.

J	Olofsson, B; Rasul, H; Lundmark, A				Olofsson, Bo; Rasul, Hedi; Lundmark, Annika			Spread of Water-Borne Pollutants at Traffic Accidents on Roads	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Traffic accidents sometimes lead to the spread of hazardous compounds to the environment. Accidental spills of hazardous compounds on roads in the vicinity of vulnerable objects such as water supplies pose a serious threat to water quality and have to be assessed. This study compared three different assessment methods, electrical resistivity measurements, analytical flow calculations, and 1D and 2D dynamic flow modeling, to describe rapid transport processes in the road shoulder and roadside verge after a major spill. The infiltration and flow paths of water-borne substances were described during simulated discharge of pollutants on different road types. Full-scale tracer tests using sodium chloride were carried out at nine different road locations in Sweden. Analysis of grain size distribution and infiltrometer tests were carried out at the road shoulder and verges. The pathways and travel times were traced using resistivity measurements and 3D inverse modeling. The resistivity measurements were compared to analytical flow calculations and 1D and 2D dynamic modeling. All measurement sites were highly heterogeneous, which caused preferential flow. Vertical flow velocities of 1.4-8.6 x 10(-4) m/s were measured. The results of the analytical calculations and flow modeling were of the same order of magnitude. The measurements showed that almost all infiltration goes directly into the road embankment, hence the composition and structure of the built-up road must be considered. The non-destructive resistivity measurements and 3D modeling provided useful information for clarifying the infiltration and flow pattern of water-borne compounds from road runoff.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							323	10.1007/s11270-017-3477-3								WOS:000410827400006	28845063

Influences of Coal Ash Leachates and Emergent Macrophytes on Water Quality in Wetland Microcosms	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The storage of coal combustion residue (CCR) in surface water impoundments may have an impact on nearby water quality and aquatic ecosystems. CCR contains leachable trace elements that can enter nearby waters through spills and monitored discharge. It is important, therefore, to understand their environmental fate in affected systems. This experiment examined trace element leachability into freshwater from fly ash (FA), the most common form of CCR. The effects on water quality of FA derived from both high and low sulfur coal sources as well as the influences of two different emergent macrophytes, Juncus effusus and Eleocharis quadrangulata, were evaluated in wetland microcosms. FA leachate dosings increased water electric conductivity (EC), altered pH, and, most notably, elevated the concentrations of boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), and manganese (Mn). The presence of either macrophyte species helped reduce elevated EC, and B, Mo, and Mn concentrations over time, relative to microcosms containing no plants. B and Mo appeared to bioaccumulate in the plant tissue from the water when elevated by FA dosing, while Mn was not higher in plants dosed with FA leachates. The results of this study indicate that emergent macrophytes could help ameliorate downstream water contamination from CCR storage facilities and could potentially be utilized in wetland filtration systems to treat CCR wastewater before discharge. Additionally, measuring elevated B and Mo in aquatic plants may have potential as a monitoring tool for downstream CCR contamination.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							344	10.1007/s11270-017-3520-4								WOS:000410827400027

WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Salt applied to roads for de-icing can persist for decades in watersheds, and understanding rates of salt accumulation and export is important for anticipating the magnitude and duration of its environmental impacts. Salt removal is affected by storm frequency and intensity, both of which are projected to change as a result of anthropogenic climate change. To examine the potential outcomes of changing storm regimes on rates of salt export from watersheds, we studied chloride concentrations in baseflow and surface runoff in 5 years of streamflow data (taken at 20-min intervals) in a headwater tributary of the Hudson River. Baseflow, with chloride concentrations of 200-230 mg/L year-round, dominated streamflow, except during and after large storms, and accounted for about 90% of chloride export from the watershed. Extreme precipitation events (e.g., tropical storms) increased salt export mainly by increasing baseflow discharge, which remained elevated long after storms ended. While intense events accomplished more salt export per storm, they did not produce disproportionately higher export per volume of precipitation, compared to smaller rain events. Chloride export in a wet year was almost twice that in a dry year, despite less than a doubling of rainfall. Under future climate conditions, if winter precipitation shifts toward a higher proportion of rainfall, or summers experience a greater frequency of tropical storms, then long-term residence time of road salt in watersheds may be shorter than previously anticipated. Conversely, if climate becomes drier, with increased evapotranspiration, reduced infiltration and baseflow discharge may prolong salt storage, which could exacerbate biotic stresses from high chloride concentrations in streams.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							362	10.1007/s11270-017-3455-9								WOS:000410827400045
