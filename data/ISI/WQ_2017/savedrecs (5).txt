Combined Use of Caffeine and Turbidity to Evaluate the Impact of CSOs on River Water Quality	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Several studies have demonstrated that the most effective way to control eutrophication is to reduce phosphorus input at the scale. Water quality monitoring programs need to separately evaluate the different polluting sources to provide a suitable estimate of their relative contributions and thus accurately prioritize possible restoration actions. Urban area cases, where a portion of untreated wastewater is often discharged directly into receiving surface waters by combined sewer overflows (CSOs) during rain events, remain unsolved. In this context, an urban watershed located in Northern Italy with 60 CSOs has been chosen as a case study, and four rainy events have been hourly monitored. The proposed monitoring program consists of the combined use of caffeine and turbidity to estimate the volume and phosphorus load spilled into the river from the CSOs, respectively. Caffeine proved to be a suitablemolecule to quantify the volume of wastewater discharged into water bodies, based on a per capita caffeine load of 10.8 mg inhab(-1) d(-1), estimated in the present work. This research showed that, on average, more than half of the total phosphorus loads transported by the river is due to the CSO discharges (56.5%). The knowledge of the prevailing responsibility of the CSO discharges for the Lambro River quality allows prioritizing effective restoration actions.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				SEP	2017	228	9							330	10.1007/s11270-017-3505-3								WOS:000410827400013						
J	Zhang, J; Hua, P; Krebs, P				Zhang, Jin; Hua, Pei; Krebs, Peter			The Influence of Surface Pavement on the Distribution of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Urban Watershed	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The presence of urban surface pollutants washed off by stormwater is a growing concern due to their adverse effects on receiving water quality. The stormwater quality mitigation strategies, therefore, should be based on the knowledge of the distribution and source apportionment of pollutants on urban surfaces. This study showcases the distribution of particulate-associated PAHs as a function of surface characteristic. Samples were obtained from six sites in the city of Dresden, Germany, using a wet vacuum sample-taking method. Both surface load (mg/m(2)) and solid-phase concentration (mg/g) of PAHs were determined. Results show that the highest surface load of Sigma 16(PAHs) was found at a natural stone-paved pedestrian path with 34.5 mu g/m(2). By contrast, the highest solidphase concentration occurred at a high traffic load road with 36 mg/kg. Through a combined qualitative diagnostic ratio and quantitative principal component analysis with stepwise multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) source apportionment, two significant contributors to PAH at vehicular roads were primarily identified as pyrogenic and petrogenic sources; 81.6% of the PAH burden was ascribed to pyrogenic sources including vehicle emission, coal, and wood combustions; 18.4% was attributed to petrogenic sources, such as spilled engine oil and vehicular tire debris. To minimize the adverse influence of surface sediments adsorbed PAHs to the receiving waters via stormwater runoff, a surface pavement-based city street sweeping strategy could be planned and optimized to remove hazardous materials from the impervious urban surfaces.

Characterising the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in intermittent and ephemeral streams using streambed thermal signatures	ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES												Ephemeral and intermittent flow in dryland stream channels infiltrates into sediments, replenishes groundwater resources and underpins riparian ecosystems. However, the spatiotemporal complexity of the transitory flow processes that occur beneath such stream channels are poorly observed and understood. We develop a new approach to characterise the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in dryland streams using pairs of temperature records measured at different depths within the streambed. The approach exploits the fact that the downward propagation of the diel temperature fluctuation from the surface depends on the sediment thermal diffusivity. This is controlled by time-varying fractions of air and water contained in streambed sediments causing a contrast in thermal properties. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method with multi-level temperature and pressure records of a flow event acquired using 12 streambed arrays deployed along a similar to 12 km dryland channel section. Thermal signatures clearly indicate the presence of water and characterise the vertical flow component as well as the occurrence of horizontal hyporheic flow. We jointly interpret thermal signatures as well as surface and groundwater levels to distinguish four different hydrological regimes: [A] dry channel, [B] surface run-off, [C] pool-riffle sequence, and [D] isolated pools. The occurrence and duration of the regimes depends on the rate at which the infiltrated water redistributes in the subsurface which, in turn, is controlled by the hydraulic properties of the variably saturated sediment. Our results have significant implications for understanding how transitory flows recharge alluvial sediments, influence water quality and underpin dryland ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses kinetic tests to evaluate the carbonation potential of ultramafic mine tailings from the Dumont project (RNC Minerals, Quebec, Canada) during their weathering, and to determine the impact of carbonation on the long-term quality of drainage waters. The weathering of awaruite [(Ni2.5Fe)], pentlandite [(Fe,Ni)(9)S-8], and heazlewoodite [(Ni3S2)], which are the main sources of Ni in the studied materials, were also investigated due to their potential to generate contamination. A column test and small-scale weathering cell tests were used to simulate the passive weathering of ultramafic mine wastes, as well as concentrates of awaruite and Ni sulfides. Results from the kinetics tests confirmed that the Dumont tailings have a significant carbon sequestration potential which ranged from 8.5 to 33.6 kgCO(2)/t. The surface-normalized carbonation rates varied from 600 to 2200 g of CO2/m(2)/year. Results demonstrated that brucite [Mg(OH)(2)] content is the main parameter controlling CO2 uptake by the Dumont wastes. Weathering of brucite and serpentine [Mg3Si2Os(OH)(4)] are driven by CO2 dissolution in pore water and by sulfide oxidation. The rapid dissolution of brucite results in leachates with alkaline pH values, thus preventing metal mobility. Metals such as Ni, Zn, Fe, and Cu are suggested to precipitate as hydroxide or carbonate species within the wastes immediately upon being released through sulfide oxidation. The Ni-Fe alloy awaruite is stable and does not release metals in kinetic tests. The Dumont tailings are found to be non-acid generating and CO2 sequestration is shown to play a significant role in drainage water quality which allow generation of significant alkalinity and the rise of pH.

J	Smedley, PL; Kinniburgh, DG				Smedley, Pauline L.; Kinniburgh, David G.			Molybdenum in natural waters: A review of occurence, distributions and controls	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Molybdenum is an essential trace element for human, animal and plant health and has played an important part in the evolution of life on earth. Nonetheless, exposure to the element can be harmful and although the evidence for symptoms in humans is sparse, it has been linked with a number of health conditions in animal models. Molybdenum is present in trace quantities (1-10 mg/kg) in most rocks and soils and at concentrations less than, and often orders of magnitude less than, 10 mu g/L in most fresh-waters. It is the most abundant transition metal in open seawater (10 mu g Mo/L) owing to the dominance, and low chemical reactivity, of the molybdate ion (MoO42-). The 2011 WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality (fourth edition) advised a health-based value of 70 mu g/L. for Mo but this is no longer promulgated as a formal guideline value as WHO consider such concentrations to be rarely found in drinking water. This is indeed usually the case, but there are instances where currently-used drinking waters do exceed 70 mu g Mo/L. We therefore recommend more routine measurement of Mo in water, at least on a reconnaissance scale, in order to improve knowledge on occurrence in water used for potable supply. Where multi-element analytical procedures are already used (e.g. ICP-MS), the marginal cost of adding Mo to the list of elements to be analysed should not be great. We have reviewed nine areas in the world where high concentrations of Mo in freshwater, and in some cases drinking water, have been found: Argentina, Jordan, Qatar, Ethiopia, UK, USA (three) and Chile. These represent a range of geochemical environments. A common theme of the high-Mo occurrences is (i) oxic, alkaline conditions where, as for seawater, the Mo occurs as the stable molybdate ion; groundwater in oxic, alkaline conditions within volcanogenic sediments can have exceptionally high Mo concentrations (up to hundreds of mu g/L) where felsic volcanic ash is present; (ii) anoxic, non-sulphidic waters where Mo can be released to solution by reductive dissolution of Mn and Fe oxides or by release from degradation of organic matter, notably within high-Mo organic-rich muds, black shales or oil shales; or (iii) surface waters or groundwater impacted by metal sulphide mining and/or mineralisation, in particular occurrences of porphyry deposits. Under such conditions, Mo concentrations can reach several tens to several hundreds of mu g/L and while not all are otherwise suitable for drinking water, some are. Much of the basic geochemistry of Mo in oxic natural environments is now quite well understood. Critically, its behaviour is redox-sensitive like its near neighbours in the Periodic Table, W and V. At the near-neutral pH values characteristic of most natural waters, Mo is rather weakly sorbed and formation of Mo minerals is either not indicated or is extremely slow. Molybdenum becomes less mobile when converted to thiomolybdates under the strongly reducing conditions found in some present-day ocean basins (e.g. the Black Sea), fjords, stratified lakes and confined aquifers. This leads to concentrations of around 100 mg Mo/kg or more in black shales and other organic-rich mudstones. However, despite the many studies of these water bodies and the importance of Mo as a palaeoredox indicator, the mechanism of the highly-efficient and diagnostic scavenging of Mo in euxinic (H2S-rich) waters remains uncertain. Possibilities include the formation of an as yet unidentified Mo-Fe-S mineral or solid solution, or the scavenging by some pre-existing solid such as a sulphide or oxide mineral, or organic matter. The possible role of dispersed and reduced natural organic matter has become more prominent in recent years but this has proven difficult to quantify and the mechanism of binding is poorly understood. Molybdenum isotope studies now play an important role in constraining reaction pathways. At a more fundamental level, there is a lack of up-to-date thermodynamic and kinetic data for many of the reactions of importance for Mo in the natural environment and this limits the ability of current geochemical models to predict its fate and transport. This is particularly true for the strongly reducing conditions where Mo partitions to the solid phase, leading to the formation of the Mo-rich shales, Even the existence of reduced aqueous Mo species (e.g. in the Mo(V) and Mo(111) oxidation states) in natural waters is uncertain. These uncertainties will only be resolved with focused laboratory experiments using the benefits of modern instrumentation, combined where necessary with supporting molecular dynamics calculations. The mobility of Mo in aqueous systems has to date received far more attention in the marine than the freshwater setting, The value of Mo speciation as an indicator of redox conditions and of stable-isotopic variations as a tracer, can have more value in the arena of environment and health, and studies of the element's mobility in aqueous systems can be useful for themes varying from radioactive waste disposal, sustainability of unconventional hydrocarbon exploitation and wider surficial pollution.

However, water quality prediction remains a key parameter for groundwater resources management and planning. The geochemical study of groundwater of a multilayered aquifer system in Tunisia is recognized by measurements of the pH, EC, total dissolved solids (TDS), major ion concentration and nitrates of 36 samples from pumping wells covering the aquifer extension and analyzed using standard laboratory and field methods. The calcite precipitation, gypsum, anhydrite and halite dissolution, and direct and reverse ion exchange are the principal process of chemical evolution in the Nadhour-Saouaf aquifer system. Using stepwise regression, the concentration groups of (Ca, Cl, and NO3), (Cl, SO4, and Mg), and (Ca and Na) exhibit significant prediction of TDS in Plio-Quaternary, Miocene, and Oligocene aquifer levels, respectively. The highest values of R-2 and adjusted R-2 close to 1 revealed the accuracy of the developed models which is confirmed by the weak difference between the measured and estimated values varying between -12 and 8%. The important uncertainty parameters that affected the estimated TDS are assessed by the sensitivity analysis method. The concentration of (Cl), (Ca and Cl), and (Na) are the major parameters affecting the TDS sensitivity of the Plio-Quaternary, Miocene, and Oligocene aquifer levels, respectively. Hence, the developed TDS models provide a more simple and easy alternative to other methods used for groundwater quality estimation and prediction as proven from external validation on groundwater samples unconsidered in the model construction.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				SEP	2017	10	17							382	10.1007/s12517-017-3170-2								WOS:000410814700006

Water management in the sugar factory: Balances and quality in different streams	INTERNATIONAL SUGAR JOURNAL					29th Congress of the International-Society-of-Sugar-Cane-Technologists (ISSCT)	DEC 05-08, 2016	Chiang Mai, THAILAND	Int Soc Sugar Cane Technologists				In the sugar production process, water requirements should be adjusted in order to reduce energy consumption and costs. In a typical mass balance of the process, around 24 m(3) of water per tonne of crushed cane is needed. With the implementation of a successful water management plan, a maximum of 5% of the required water needs to be added from an external source. This paper presents several cases of Colombian sugar mills that have implemented strategies to save water without affecting the normal process. Strategies have included issues such as adoption of water and condensate process accounting, the analysis of consumption indicators, characterization and quality monitoring of different streams, technological updating and commitment of production staff. Among the reported benefits are energy savings in transfer of fluids, less effluent to the treatment system, and compliance with new market requirements around sustainability issues. On average, the specific water consumption index in the Colombian sugar factories has decreased from 1.4 Wit crushed cane to 1.2 m(3)/t crushed cane over the last 3 years.																	0020-8841					SEP	2017	119	1425					718	723										WOS:000410878600032

Comparison of yield components and quality factors of sweet corn under different irrigation scheduling strategies	OUTLOOK ON AGRICULTURE												Rising energy costs, declining groundwater supplies, increasing competition for water resources between agricultural, industrial and domestic users and irrigation-induced water quality problems are providing considerable impetus to improving efficiency in irrigated agriculture. Much of the groundwater used for irrigation is found in closed underground basins. Water percolation is the only source of water available for recharge. In some basins, the pumping rate is much greater than the recharge from percolation and water mining' occurs. The aim of this study was to compare the yield components and quality factors of sweet corn grown under different irrigation scheduling strategies. The treatment with 426 mm of seasonal irrigation offered the largest commercial yields, with an appropriate quality production, good irrigation efficiency, the highest gross margin and the best break-even point irrigation strategy. Treatments with higher application produced lower irrigation efficiencies.

Connecting Teenagers to Coastal Sciences through Research and Education: Shark Fest Program	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												In 2010, the Marine Education Center collaborated with the Center for Fisheries Research and Development's Shark Research Program to design an educational program that combined research experiences and educational opportunities for teenage audiences. This program, Shark Fest, educates students about the sharks of the Mississippi Sound and engages them in scientific studies of shark populations and movements. This program has reached 398 participants in grades 7-12. During the program, students assist in conducting a population survey using a 152.4-m (500-ft) bottom longline with 50 hooks and fishing with a rod-and-reel. Students measure, weigh, determine sex, and identify to species all captured sharks, and tag those in good condition prior to release. Program participants also conduct water-quality sampling (salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and water clarity) at each sample site for addition to the database. Students take a pre-test and post-test to assess the level of knowledge gained during the program. Results of a paired-sample t-test on 2015 pre-test and post-test data reflected a significant difference in pre-test (mean = 6.16, SD = 2.36) and post-test (mean = 8.54, SD = 1.93) scores (t([83]) = -9.172, P < 0.0001), indicating an increase in content knowledge. Written and verbal post-participation assessments also highlighted a positive student experience. We conducted opportunistic interviews with several students 4 years after they were in the program and found evidence of retained knowledge along with positive overall impressions. Some participants stated that the experience influenced their career pursuits.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				SEP	2017	16				10		11	25		10.1656/058.016.0sp1006								WOS:000411136200004

The goal of the project is to provide a natural resource usable by the local community for education, and passive and active recreation, while safeguarding this unique and dwindling natural habitat. The environmental advocacy organization, Upstate Forever (Greenville, SC), secured an EPA grant for a hydrology assessment and long-range planning for the site. The long-range vision includes plans for construction of boardwalks, observation platforms, and a discovery center. Anderson University faculty and students have been surveying the site's flora and fauna and collecting water-quality data. Vertebrates documented include 21 species of fishes, 18 species of amphibians and reptiles, 120 species of birds, and 11 species of mammals. A tree-frog mark-recapture program has begun. Clearing of overgrown trails, opening sites for access to wetland margins, removal of trash, addition of trail signage, and trail enhancement are underway. Community and civic groups such as local garden clubs are being made aware of the resources available to them. The Anderson University Life-long Learning program, and local teachers have visited and used the site. Fund-raising, stepwise development without harming or altering the flora and fauna, and continuing to raise community awareness and buy-in of the value of this resource represent ongoing challenges.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				SEP	2017	16				10		109	131		10.1656/058.016.0sp1012								WOS:000411136200010

Organic sediment pulses impact rivers across multiple levels of ecological organization	ECOHYDROLOGY												Sedimentation is a pervasive environmental pressure affecting rivers globally. Headwaters draining catchments rich in organic soils (i.e., peat) are particularly vulnerable to enhanced sedimentation caused by land management and environmental change, yet many of the ecological consequences of peat deposition are poorly understood. We conducted a before-after-control-impact experiment in two rivers draining blanket peatland in Northern England to test the effect of sediment inputs on water quality, macroinvertebrate drift, macroinvertebrate community structure, and ecosystem metabolism. Sediment addition increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, total oxidised nitrogen and suspended sediment concentration in rivers, and intensified the total drift of macroinvertebrates particularly at night. By contrast, the abundance and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates were unaffected, except for declines in Coleoptera abundance in one river. The gross primary production of both rivers was strongly suppressed as the benthos was smothered by sediment. Community respiration also declined, albeit by different extents in the two rivers. Our experiment revealed that short-term pulses of organic sediment in rivers can have broad effects on water quality and biota, from influences on the dispersal of individual organisms to the modification of ecosystem processes. Organic sediments therefore warrant further examination, to include longer observation periods and more sites. It is particularly important to clarify the extent to which impacts extend from peatland streams into larger rivers downstream. Such studies are necessary to inform global management efforts to restore the integrity of river ecosystems under a range of water and biodiversity policy mechanisms.

Using Adaptive Processes and Adverse Outcome Pathways to Develop Meaningful, Robust, and Actionable Environmental Monitoring Programs	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												The primary goals of environmental monitoring are to indicate whether unexpected changes related to development are occurring in the physical, chemical, and biological attributes of ecosystems and to inform meaningful management intervention. Although achieving these objectives is conceptually simple, varying scientific and social challenges often result in their breakdown. Conceptualizing, designing, and operating programs that better delineate monitoring, management, and risk assessment processes supported by hypothesis-driven approaches, strong inference, and adverse outcome pathways can overcome many of the challenges. Generally, a robust monitoring program is characterized by hypothesis-driven questions associated with potential adverse outcomes and feedback loops informed by data. Specifically, key and basic features are predictions of future observations (triggers) and mechanisms to respond to success or failure of those predictions (tiers). The adaptive processes accelerate or decelerate the effort to highlight and overcome ignorance while preventing the potentially unnecessary escalation of unguided monitoring and management. The deployment of the mutually reinforcing components can allow for more meaningful and actionable monitoring programs that better associate activities with consequences. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This study focused on the dynamic properties of NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, and sulfide from the biochemical reactions point of view, and based on anaerobic respiration activities, such as denitrification, iron reduction, and sulfate reduction. The specific aims of this study were to quantitatively estimate the impacts of the oxidative/reductive state of the sediment surface and the high/low concentrations of dissolved organic matter on the dynamic properties of water quality under anaerobic conditions. The beaker-scale water quality monitoring was carried out through continuous measurements of dissolved oxygen and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), as well as periodic observations of water quality parameters for six cases that are composed from combinations of three experimental conditions: (1) concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC); (2) redox state of the sediment; and (3) concentration of NO3-N. As a result, the temporal changes in ORP under anaerobic conditions exhibited a five-step process of decline without these conditions. Also, high DOC concentrations and oxidative states of the bottom mud accelerated the release of PO4-P and sulfide generation through promoting biological iron reduction and sulfate reduction, because these conditions increase respiratory substrates for anaerobic microorganisms, such as iron and sulfate-reducing bacteria. It was concluded that our results would provide important information about the mechanisms of aqueous environmental deterioration due to organic pollution in closed water bodies.																	1611-2490	1611-2504				SEP	2017	15	4					889	906		10.1007/s10333-017-0600-4								WOS:000410721600016

J	Boyacioglu, H; Boyacioglu, H				Boyacioglu, Hulya; Boyacioglu, Hayal			Application of environmetric methods to investigate control factors on water quality	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												In the study, environmetric methods were successfully performed a) to explore natural and anthropogenic controls on reservoir water quality, b) to investigate spatial and temporal differences in quality, and c) to determine quality variables discriminating three reservoirs in Izmir, Turkey. Results showed that overall water quality was mainly governed by "natural factors" in the whole region. A parameter that was the most important in contributing to water quality variation for one reservoir was not important for another. Between summer and winter periods, difference in arsenic concentrations were statistically significant in the Tahtali, Urkmez and iron concentrations were in the Balcova reservoirs. Observation of high/low levels in two seasons was explained by different processes as for instance, dilution from runoff at times of high flow seeped through soil and entered the river along with the rainwater run-off and adsorption. Three variables "boron, arsenic and sulphate" discriminated quality among Balcova & Tahtali, Balcova & Urkmez and two variables "zinc and arsenic" among the Tahtali & Urkmez reservoirs. The results illustrated the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques to fingerprint pollution sources and investigate temporal/spatial variations in water quality.																	2083-4772	2083-4810				SEP	2017	43	3					17	23		10.1515/aep-2017-0026								WOS:000410003100003

Handling and disposal of sludge require careful attention from civic bodies, plant operators, and environmentalists. Quantification of the sludge produced at the treatment plants is important to develop suitable management strategies for its economical and environment friendly disposal. Present study deals with the quantification of sludge using empirical relation between turbidity, suspended solids, and coagulant dosing. Seasonal variation has significant effect on the raw water quality received at the water treatment plants so forth sludge generation also varies. Yearly production of the sludge in a water treatment plant at Ghaziabad, India, is estimated to be 29,700 ton. Sustainable disposal of such a quantity of sludge is a challenging task under stringent environmental legislation. Several beneficial reuses of sludge in civil engineering and constructional work have been identified globally such as raw material in manufacturing cement, bricks, and artificial aggregates, as cementitious material, and sand substitute in preparing concrete and mortar. About 54 to 60% sand, 24 to 28% silt, and 16% clay constitute the sludge generated at the water treatment plant under investigation. Characteristics of the sludge are found suitable for its potential utilization as locally available construction material for safe disposal. An overview of the sustainable management scenario involving beneficial reuses of the sludge has also been presented.

Estimation of tile drainage contribution to streamflow and nutrient loads at the watershed scale based on continuously monitored data	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Nitrogen losses from artificially drained watersheds degrade water quality at local and regional scales. In this study, we used an end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) together with high temporal resolution water quality and streamflow data collected in the 122 km(2) Otter Creek watershed located in northeast Iowa. We estimated the contribution of three end-members (groundwater, tile drainage, and quick flow) to streamflow and nitrogen loads and tested several combinations of possible nitrate concentrations for the end-members. Results indicated that subsurface tile drainage is responsible for at least 50% of the watershed nitrogen load between April 15 and November 1, 2015. Tiles delivered up to 80% of the stream N load while providing only 15-43% of the streamflow, whereas quick flows only marginally contributed to N loading. Data collected offer guidance about areas of the watershed that should be targeted for nitrogen export mitigation strategies.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							426	10.1007/s10661-017-6139-4								WOS:000410476500001						
J	Bereskie, T; Haider, H; Rodriguez, MJ; Sadiq, R				Bereskie, Ty; Haider, Husnain; Rodriguez, Manuel J.; Sadiq, Rehan			Small drinking water systems under spatiotemporal water quality variability: a risk-based performance benchmarking framework	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Traditional approaches for benchmarking drinking water systems are binary, based solely on the compliance and/or non-compliance of one or more water quality performance indicators against defined regulatory guidelines/standards. The consequence of water quality failure is dependent on location within a water supply system as well as time of the year (i.e., season) with varying levels of water consumption. Conventional approaches used for water quality comparison purposes fail to incorporate spatiotemporal variability and degrees of compliance and/or non-compliance. This can lead to misleading or inaccurate performance assessment data used in the performance benchmarking process. In this research, a hierarchical risk-based water quality performance benchmarking framework is proposed to evaluate small drinking water systems (SDWSs) through cross-comparison amongst similar systems. The proposed framework (RWQI framework) is designed to quantify consequence associated with seasonal and location-specific water quality issues in a given drinking water supply system to facilitate more efficient decisionmaking for SDWSs striving for continuous performance improvement. Fuzzy rule-based modelling is used to address imprecision associated with measuring performance based on singular water quality guidelines/standards and the uncertainties present in SDWS operations and monitoring. This proposed RWQI framework has been demonstrated using data collected from 16 SDWSs in Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec, Canada, and compared to the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment WQI, a traditional, guidelines/standard-based approach. The study found that the RWQI framework provides an in-depth state of water quality and benchmarks SDWSs more rationally based on the frequency of occurrence and consequence of failure events.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							464	10.1007/s10661-017-6176-z								WOS:000410476500039	28836091

The application of high temporal resolution data in river catchment modelling and management strategies	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Modelling changes in river water quality, and by extension developing river management strategies, has historically been reliant on empirical data collected at relatively low temporal resolutions. With access to data collected at higher temporal resolutions, this study investigated how these new dataset types could be employed to assess the precision and accuracy of two phosphorus (P) load apportionment models (LAMs) developed on lower resolution empirical data. Predictions were made of point and diffuse sources of P across ten different sampling scenarios. Sampling resolution ranged from hourly to monthly through the use of 2000 newly created datasets from high frequency P and discharge data collected from a eutrophic river draining a 9.48 km(2) catchment. Outputs from the two LAMs were found to differ significantly in the P load apportionment (51.4% versus 4.6% from point sources) with reducing precision and increasing bias as sampling frequency decreased. Residual analysis identified a large deviation from observed data at high flows. This deviation affected the apportionment of P from diffuse sources in particular. The study demonstrated the potential problems in developing empirical models such as LAMs based on temporally relatively poorly-resolved data (the level of resolution that is available for the majority of catchments). When these models are applied ad hoc and outside an expert modelling framework using extant datasets of lower resolution, interpretations of their outputs could potentially reduce the effectiveness of management decisions aimed at improving water quality.

It serves many people, especially low-income earners, by providing a more affordable access to safe drinking water when compared with table water. However, some of the producers of SW do not effectively treat raw water before packaging them for sale. This study investigates the presence and concentrations of heavy metals, such as chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), and zinc (Zn) in some samples of SW sold within Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. Samples of SW from nine different producers were purchased for four consecutive weeks and analyzed to determine the concentrations of these heavy metals in them. Furthermore, health risk indicators, such as chronic daily intake (CDI) and health risk indices (HRI) for children and adults, were calculated separately. The metal concentrations were compared with allowable limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO), Nigerian Industrial Standard (NIS), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). High concentrations of Cr, Fe, and Al were found in all the nine samples and exceeded the maximum allowable limits (MAL) of all the standards considered. However, the concentrations of Zn, Mn, and Cu were within permissible limits. The HRIs of heavy metals were in the order of Cu > Fe > Zn > Mn > Al > Cr, but since the standard limits set for some metals were exceeded, proper and effective treatment is required to safeguard the health of consumers.

By integrating a catchment model with a river model of water quality, we developed a method to estimate the effect of pollution sources on ambient water quality. Using integrated model simulations, we estimate (1) the relative contribution from point (industrial and domestic) and non-point sources (river catchment) to river water quality and (2) pollutant transfer coefficients for zones along the lower section of the river. Transfer coefficients provide the basis for policy analyses in relation to the location of new industries and the setting of priorities for industrial pollution control. They also offer valuable information to design socially optimal economic policy to manage industrialized river catchments.

Impact and ecosystem service of forest and sacred grove as saviour of water quantity and quality in Garhwal Himalaya, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The present study was conducted in environs of the sacred grove of Garhwal Himalaya, India, with a view to assess the impacts of sacred groves and forests on the quality and quantity of water and also to assess the effect of seasonality on perennial stream quality. Water samples were collected from three randomly selected stream spots of both the sacred grove dominated by deodar (Cedrus deodara) and the non-sacred patch dominated by oak (Quercus leucotrichophora). Water samples from both patches were within the World Health Organization (WHO) standard limits. Based on an already established water quality index, water quality of both patches was safe for domestic and irrigation purposes but needs treatment for drinking purposes. Results of the present study also showed a very prominent impact of forest type as well as management condition on water quality and quantity. The water discharge from an oak forest shows more consistency than the discharge from a deodar forest. Due to the presence of the sacred grove, the area has become the source of good quality water supply during lean season for the surrounding villages. Water quality and quantity differed along with the change in season. The sacred grove and the existing forest leave a great impression on local dwellers, as due to its presence, local dwellers never run out of water supply during the dry season. As a result, the villagers sincerely want to protect the area for the sake of their own well-being.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							477	10.1007/s10661-017-6173-2								WOS:000410476500052	28852894					
J	Khare, P				Khare, Peeyush			A large-scale investigation of the quality of groundwater in six major districts of Central India during the 2010-2011 sampling campaign	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This paper investigates the groundwater quality in six major districts of Madhya Pradesh in central India, namely, Balaghat, Chhindwara, Dhar, Jhabua, Mandla, and Seoni during the 2010-2011 sampling campaign, and discusses improvements made in the supplied water quality between the years 2011 and 2017. Groundwater is the main source of water for a combined rural population of over 7 million in these districts. Its contamination could have a huge impact on public health. We analyzed the data collected from a large-scale water sampling campaign carried out by the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), Government of Madhya Pradesh between 2010 and 2011 during which all rural tube wells and dug wells were sampled in these six districts. Eight hundred thirty-one dug wells and 47,606 tube wells were sampled in total and were analyzed for turbidity, hardness, iron, nitrate, fluoride, chloride, and sulfate ion concentrations. Our study found water in 21 out of the 228 dug wells in Chhindwara district unfit for drinking due to fluoride contamination while all dug wells in Balaghat had fluoride within the permissible limit. Twenty-six of the 56 dug wells and 4825 of the 9390 tube wells in Dhar district exceeded the permissible limit for nitrate while 100% dug wells in Balaghat, Seoni, and Chhindwara had low levels of nitrate. Twenty-four of the 228 dug wells and 1669 of 6790 tube wells in Chhindwara had high iron concentration. The median pH value in both dug wells and tube wells varied between 6 and 8 in all six districts. Still, a significant number of tube wells exceeded a pH of 8.5 especially in Mandla and Seoni districts. In conclusion, this study shows that parts of inhabited rural Madhya Pradesh were potentially exposed to contaminated subsurface water during 2010-2011. The analysis has been correlated with rural health survey results wherever available to estimate the visible impact. We next highlight that the quality of drinking water has enormously improved since 2011 in all six districts as a result of rigorous treatment of extracted subsurface water on the ground before supplying to rural habitations as well as efficient distribution from healthy wells. Our research could provide impetus to the state government to develop innovative solutions for improving groundwater quality in these areas as existing solutions are largely protective techniques. We have identified specific ions responsible for groundwater contamination in different districts which would allow the development of district specific effective mitigation strategies.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							429	10.1007/s10661-017-6130-0								WOS:000410476500004	28770431

Although the SE water had no adverse effects on the growth of the algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, it could lead to water quality degradation of rivers in terms of its toxic unit value, whereas the use of RO and NF permeates would not lead to such degradation. The recharge of rivers, into which domestic wastewater and livestock effluents might be discharged in southern Okinawa Island, with reclaimed water subjected to advanced treatment could dilute the concentrations of chemicals that cause biological effects and improve the water quality of the rivers, based on the results of the bioassay using P. subcapitata. Comparing the results of bioassays of reclaimed water with those of the ambient water at a site might be effective in assessing the water quality of reclaimed water for environmental use at the site.

Metal concentrations in American oyster Crassotrea virginica and adjacent sediments from harvestable and non-harvestable sites in the Southeastern USA	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Human population growth in coastal areas continues to threaten estuarine ecosystems and resources. Populations of Crassostrea virginica have declined across the USA due to water quality degradation, disease pressure, alteration of habitat, and other changes related to anthropogenic impacts. Metals that may be present in estuarine habitats can bioaccumulate in oysters, with potential consequences to the health of oysters and humans consumers. This study (1) evaluated the occurrence and relationships of metal concentrations in oyster tissue versus estuarine sediments, (2) examined oyster tissue concentrations in relation to state water quality designations, and (3) evaluated the potential risk for humans from oyster consumption related to metal concentrations from harvestable waters. Results indicated metal concentrations in sediments and oysters along coastal South Carolina remain low compared to other areas and that concentrations in oyster tissue and adjacent sediments were not highly correlated with each other. However, high concentrations of some metals occurred in oysters sampled from areas designated as Approved for Harvesting. This is important because most harvest area designation systems rely on regular bacterial monitoring when evaluating the safety of consumption. Others safety measurements may be necessary as part of routine monitoring.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							481	10.1007/s10661-017-6158-1								WOS:000410476500056	28861838

Groundwater is an important resource for drinking and agricultural purposes due to the lack of surface water resources in the region. The main objectives of the present study are to identify the hydrogeochemical processes and the potential sources of major, minor, and trace metals and metalloids such as Cr, Mn, Cd, Fe, Al, and As by using joint hydrogeochemical techniques and multivariate statistical analysis and to evaluate groundwater quality deterioration with the use of PoS environmental index. To achieve these objectives, 23 groundwater samples were collected in September 2015. Piper diagram shows that the mixed Ca-Mg-Cl is the dominant groundwater type, and some of the samples have Ca-HCO3, Ca-Cl, and Na-Cl types. Multivariate statistical analyses indicate that weathering and dissolution of different rocks and minerals, e.g., silicates, gypsum, and halite, ion exchange, and agricultural activities influence the hydrogeochemistry of the study area. The cluster analysis divides the samples into two distinct clusters which are completely different in EC (and its dependent variables such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, and Cl-), Cd, and Cr variables according to the ANOVA statistical test. Based on the median values, the concentrations of pH, NO3-, SiO2, and As in cluster 1 are elevated compared with those of cluster 2, while their maximum values occur in cluster 2. According to the PoS index, the dominant parameter that controls quality deterioration is As, with 60% of contribution. Samples of lowest PoS values are located in the southern and northern parts (recharge area) while samples of the highest values are located in the discharge area and the eastern part.

Assessment of the water quality monitoring network of the Piabanha River experimental watersheds in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using autoassociative neural networks	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water quality monitoring is a complex issue that requires support tools in order to provide information for water resource management. Budget constraints as well as an inadequate water quality network design call for the development of evaluation tools to provide efficient water quality monitoring. For this purpose, a nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) based on an autoassociative neural network was performed to assess the redundancy of the parameters and monitoring locations of the water quality network in the Piabanha River watershed. Oftentimes, a small number of variables contain the most relevant information, while the others add little or no interpretation to the variability of water quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used for this purpose. However, conventional PCA is not able to capture the nonlinearities of water quality data, while neural networks can represent those nonlinear relationships. The results presented in this work demonstrate that NLPCA performs better than PCA in the reconstruction of the water quality data of Piabanha watershed, explaining most of data variance. From the results of NLPCA, the most relevant water quality parameter is fecal coliforms (FCs) and the least relevant is chemical oxygen demand (COD). Regarding the monitoring locations, the most relevant is Poco Tarzan (PT) and the least is Parque Petropolis (PP).

J	Yadav, A; Pandey, J				Yadav, Amita; Pandey, Jitendra			Contribution of point sources and non-point sources to nutrient and carbon loads and their influence on the trophic status of the Ganga River at Varanasi, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												To determine the possible contributions of point and non-point sources to carbon and nutrient loading in the Ganga River, we analyzed N, P, and organic carbon (OC) in the atmospheric deposits, surface runoff, and in the river along a 37-km stretch from 2013 to 2015. We also assessed the trophic status of the river as influenced by such sources of nutrient input. Although the river N, P, and productivity showed a declining trend with increasing discharge, runoff DOC and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) increased by 88.05 and 122.7% between the Adpr and Rjht sites, indicating contributions from atmospheric deposition (AD) coupled with land use where agriculture appeared to be the major contributor. Point source input led to increased river concentrations of NO3-, NH4+, DRP, and DOC by 10.5, 115.9, 115.2, and 67.3%, respectively. Increases in N, P, and productivity along the gradient were significantly negatively correlated with river discharge (p < 0.001), while river DOC and dissolved silica showed positive relationships. The results revealed large differences in point and non-point sources of carbon and nutrient input into the Ganga River, although these variations were strongly influenced by the seasonality in surface runoff and river discharge. Despite these variations, N and P concentrations were sufficient to enhance phytoplankton growth along the study stretch. Allochthonous input together with enhanced autotrophy would accelerate heterotrophic growth, degrading the river more rapidly in the near future. This study suggests the need for large-scale inter-regional time series data on the point and non-point source partitioning and associated food web dynamics of this major river system.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP	2017	189	9							475	10.1007/s10661-017-6188-8								WOS:000410476500050	28849425

Sakarya River located in Turkey flows from the northeast of Afyonkarahisar City to the Black Sea. Nineteen different micropollutants including trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), endocrine disrupting compound (EDC) and pharmaceuticals personal care product (PPCP) groups, and water quality parameters such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm wavelength (UV254), hardness, and conductivity values were examined. To remove the micropollutants and improve the water quality, the treatment was performed with ozone, microfiltration (MF), and ultra-filtration (UF) membranes. The highest treatment efficiency was obtained with 1 mg/L ozone dosage and UP005 UF membrane. The trihalomethan formation potential (THMFP) and haloacetic acid formation potential (HAAFP) decreased with ozone + membrane at a concentration of 79 and 75%, respectively. After the treatment with ozone + membrane, the concentration of the micropollutants in the EDC and PPCP group remained below the detection limit. It was found that by using only membrane and only ozone, the maximum DOC removal efficiency achieved was 46 and 18%, respectively; and with ozone + membrane, this efficiency increased up to 82%. The results from the High-Pressure Size Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC) analyses pointed that the substances with high molecular weight were converted into substances with low molecular weight after the treatment. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis results showed that the aromatic and aliphatic functional groups in water changed after the treatment with ozone and that the peak values decreased more after the ozone + membrane treatment.

J	Yeh, TY; Chen, HC				Yeh, Tzung-Yuh; Chen, Ho-Chi			Conservative heavy metal total discharge schemes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Currently, according to Taiwan's Water Pollution Control Act, the environmental control of waterbodies and water quality depends on the effluent standards and the standard of water quality in the rivers. The Act demands that each stationary pollution source comply with the effluent standard before being discharged into the rivers, and that the overall water quality in the river shall not exceed the declared standard of water quality. To improve the condition of the waterbodies and water quality of the rivers, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in Taiwan has made stricter regulations concerning the discharge standard. Such regulations will help to reduce the weight of individual pollutants discharged; the discharged wastewater, however, will still gradually worsen the water quality of the rivers even after complying with the effluent standard since some of the pollutant dischargers may decrease the concentration of pollutants by diluting the water before discharging; thus, the total weight of metals discharged in the rivers will not be reduced, and the water quality in the areas where the pollutant sources are concentrated will not thereby be significantly improved. To protect the irrigation water and farmlands from being polluted by discharged heavy metals in industrial wastewater, the EPA started controlling the sources in accordance with the total quantity control (TQC) as defined in the Water Pollution Control Act, in the hope of perfecting the environmental protection of waterbodies and water quality, as well as ensuring clean water sources without any pollution for the rivers, land, and people.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	27					21517	21529		10.1007/s11356-017-9404-8								WOS:000409962200001	28836183

The concentrations of the heavy metals varied spatially, with most of the highest concentrations in the Raohe river-lake ecosystem (RH). All heavy metals except As, Cd, W, and Tl were enriched in sediments possessing high total organic carbon contents or in finer sediments. Based on enrichment factors and statistical methods, it was found that Cd in sediments in the Xiushui (XS), Ganjiang (GJ), Xinjiang (XJ) river-lake ecosystems, and RH; Mn in the XS, GJ, and RH; and Win the XS and GJ were greatly affected by anthropogenic inputs. Moreover, the origins of Cu, Zn, and As require more attention due to the high concentrations found. The high enrichment factor of Cd in the sediments indicated that this metal might cause significant pollution in the environment. The results of the modified potential ecological risk index revealed that the XS, GJ, RH, and XJ were at considerable ecological risk, while the sediments in the Fuhe river-lake ecosystem (FH) were at moderate ecological risk, with Cd contributing the highest proportion of risk. The hazard score fundamentally validated the modified potential ecological risk analysis and revealed a mean toxicity of 57.80% to the benthic organisms in the RH.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	27					21902	21916		10.1007/s11356-017-9855-y								WOS:000409962200036	28780687

Effect of first-flush device, roofing material, and antecedent dry days on water quality of harvested rainwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Two rainwater harvesting systems, which included first-flush diversion devices, connected to the roofs of two adjacent buildings, were monitored for water quality. The roofs were constructed from different materials, i.e., one roof was covered with ceramic tiles and the other was made of concrete. Water quality samples from the two storage tanks and the first-flush devices were collected and analyzed, showing satisfactory water quality in the tanks for residential non-potable use, while the water in the first-flush device was of poorer quality. Between the two collection surfaces, statistically significant differences were found only in the concentrations of NH4-N, orthophosphate, and Ca2+. Total coliforms were detected in both the storage tanks and the first-flush devices, indicating that disinfection of harvested rainwater may be necessary if it is collected for potable uses. Finally, first-flush water quality was related to antecedent dry days, showing that when the number of dry days increased, the accumulation of materials on the concrete roof was reduced while it was increased on the ceramic tile roof. This is attributed to the fact that the concrete roof is nearly horizontal (very slightly sloped), and the wind action easily removes various materials which accumulate on it.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	27					21997	22006		10.1007/s11356-017-9868-6								WOS:000409962200044	28785942

The aim of this study was to verify the presence of emerging pollutants in the IguaScu River, from source to mouth, such as: pharmaceuticals, including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), salicylic acid, ketoprofen (KET), naproxen (NAP), gemfibrozil and fenofibrate; female sex hormones, including estradiol (E1), ethinylestradiol (EET) and estrone (E2); UV filters, including 4-methylbenzylidene camphor and octylmethoxycinnamate; and caffeine (CAF). The extracted pollutants were purified using solid phase extraction and then analyzed by liquid chromatography with diode array detection and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. All analyzed compounds were detected in at least one site in one sample. The analysis revealed maximum concentrations of 27.0 mu g L-1 CAF, 5.17 mu g L-1 ASA, 0.34 mu g L-1 NAP, 0.62 mu g L-1 KET, 1.42 mu g L-1 E1, 1.48 mu g L-1 EET, and 0.94 mu g L-1 E2. The results indicated that IguaScu river water is contaminated with emerging pollutants and nutrients and that this may be due to domestic sewage and water from tributary rivers mixing with IguaScu river water. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the study of emerging environmental contaminants is a useful tool to determine if contamination is due to domestic sewage input once traditional physical, chemical and spectroscopic analyses have been insufficient to prove an anthropogenic influence.

Peak flows were released in the early part of the pulse to simulate a spring flood, with approximately 101.7 mcm released at Morelos Dam on the U.S.-Mexico border. The remainder of the pulse flow water was released to the riparian corridor via Mexicali Valley irrigation spillway canals, with 20.9 mcm released at Km 27 Spillway (41 km below Morelos Dam) and 9.3 mcm released at Km 18 Spillway (78 km below Morelos Dam). We used sequential satellite images, overflights, ground observations, water discharge measurements, and automated temperature, river stage and water quality loggers to document and describe the progression of pulse flow water through the study area. The rate of advance of the wetted front was slowed by infiltration and high channel roughness as the pulse flow crossed more than 40 km of dry channel which was disconnected from underlying groundwater and partially overgrown with salt cedar. High lag time and significant attenuation of flow resulted in a changing hydrograph as the pulse flow progressed to the downstream delivery points; two peak flows occurred in some lower reaches. The pulse flow advanced more than 120 km downstream from Morelos Dam to reach the Colorado River estuary at the northern end of the Gulf of California. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Winners and losers as mangrove, coral and seagrass ecosystems respond to sea-level rise in Solomon Islands	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												A 2007 earthquake in the western Solomon Islands resulted in a localised subsidence event in which sea level (relative to the previous coastal settings) rose approximately 30-70 cm, providing insight into impacts of future rapid changes to sea level on coastal ecosystems. Here, we show that increasing sea level by 30-70 cm can have contrasting impacts on mangrove, seagrass and coral reef ecosystems. Coral reef habitats were the clear winners with a steady lateral growth from 2006-2014, yielding a 157% increase in areal coverage over seven years. Mangrove ecosystems, on the other hand, suffered the largest impact through a rapid dieback of 35% (130 ha) of mangrove forest in the study area after subsidence. These forests, however, had partially recovered seven years after the earthquake albeit with a different community structure. The shallow seagrass ecosystems demonstrated the most dynamic response to relative shifts in sea level with both losses and gains in areal extent at small scales of 10-100 m. The results of this study emphasize the importance of considering the impacts of sea-level rise within a complex landscape in which winners and losers may vary over time and space.																	1748-9326					SEP	2017	12	9							094009	10.1088/1748-9326/aa7e68								WOS:000410458700002

Phosphorus fertilization, soil stratification, and potential water quality impacts	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Water quality experts have suggested that no-till induces phosphorus (P) stratification, which may exacerbate soluble P (SP) runoff from agricultural fields, contributing to eutrophication. Conservationists have been concerned about increased SP loading to Lake Erie, which has been partially blamed on adoption of no-till and the concomitant P stratification of no-till soils. This study was conducted to provide better insight into. the potential link between P stratification from no-till soils and P losses via runoff with the objective of exploring P fertilization strategies on P stratification and P runoff from a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation. Plots were established with nine treatments, including unfertilized, diammonium phosphate (DAP) applications, monoammonium phosphate (MAP) applications, surface applied, injecting fertilizer or tilling fertilizer in, and the use of cover crops. Fertilizer applications were made at 24.4 kg P ha(-1) (21.8 lb P ac(-1)) every other year or at 9.6 kg P ha(-1) (8.7 lb P ac(-1)) every year. Disking, which was intended to minimize P stratification, resulted in the greatest stratification, with significantly higher water SP and Mehlich 3 I) in the 0 to 5 cm (0 to 2 in) soil layer compared to the other treatments. There were no differences in SP or total P (TP) runoff from rainfall simulations between fertilizer source (MAP versus DAP) or fertilizer rate (annual versus biennial). The highest SP concentrations observed were from DAP applied to cover crops at the high application rate (24.4 kg P ha(-1) applied every other year). This may suggest cover crops are. not the ideal practice to decrease SP losses from agricultural fields. Incorporation of fertilizer reduced SP but increased erosion and could potentially increase TP loss. Injecting liquid fertilizer (polyphosphate [Poly]) at the time of planting resulted in lower SP and TP loads than surface applied fertilizers. We encourage other researchers to confirm these results at the field-to-watershed scale to ensure there are not unintended consequences of adopting this fertilization strategy. Further, fertilizer dealers, crop consultants, and farmers sholild be encouraged to consider liquid fertilizer applications 8 one option to minimize P losses.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					417	424		10.2489/jswc.72.5.417								WOS:000410019500004

Delivering on the potential of formal farmer networks: Insights from Indiana	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Several formal farmer networks have emerged throughout the midwestern United States to address issues of nitrogen (N) runoff and eutrophication. The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of these formal fanner networks through an evaluation of two networks in Indiana. The research was guided by two main questions: (1) Are farmers who participate in the networks actually implementing better nutrient management practices? (2) Are participating farmers spreading their knowledge of better nutrient management practices to other farmers outside the formal networks? Interviews with select network members were conducted in early 2014, and a mail survey of all network members was conducted in the summer of 2014. Survey results were compared to the results of a statewide Indiana Nutrient Management Survey conducted during the winter of 2014. The results show that network farmers vary significantly from nonnetwork farmers in multiple ways. Network farmers have more positive attitudes toward water quality, perceive water pollution as a more severe problem, and utilize more conservation practices than nonnetwork farmers. Network farmers also vary in demographic characteristics. Length of time in the network is positively associated with reporting a change in N management practices. Diffusion of nutrient management practices outside the networks seems very limited. The findings point to ways that formal farmer networks can be improved. One recommendation is to diversify the participants and include more farmers who have not already adopted conservation practices. Another recommendation is to increase the number of group meetings during the year. One meeting is insufficient to build the trust and rapport necessary for farmers to accept and adopt the technologies being shared by others. Finally, outreach should focus on economic arguments for improved N management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					463	470		10.2489/jswc.72.5463								WOS:000410019500008

Determining the number of measurements required to estimate crop residue cover by different methods	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Crop residue left after harvest plays an important role in controlling against soil erosion and in increasing soil organic matter content of agricultural soils. Crop residue management is a practice of great importance in southwestern Ontario, where soil management practices have an effect on Great Lakes water quality. The use of remote sensing data to measure and monitor crop residue can be fast and efficient. However, remote sensing based studies need calibration and validation using field observations. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal number of ground-truthing field measurements (i.e., digital photographs) required to estimate residue levels. To do so, we compared the residue estimates derived from digital photographs with those derived from the standard line-transect method. Residue was measured from 18 fields located in southern Ontario, and data collected included percentage of crop residue using line-transect and photographic grid methods. Results were analyzed using linear regression, correlation tests, ANOVA, and means tests. Analyses were also conducted to retrospectively determine the minimum number of line transects or digital photos required to estimate crop residue cover at specified levels of power. Results showed that (1) percentage of crop residue estimates derived from using digital photographs were strongly correlated (r = 0.91, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.83, and n = 90) to those derived from using line transects; (2) counting 50 to 100 points per digital photograph was sufficient to accurately estimate the percentage of residue cover; and (3) there was greater variability in the results for soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) than for corn (Zea mays L.), with the highest variability for medium-level soybean residue. Overall, the digital photograph method to estimate percentage of residue was found to be a suitable alternative to the line-transect method, which is more time consuming and labor intensive. Determining the optimal numbers of measurements to estimate crop residue cover is important to those wishing to use digital photo capture methods to record, archive, and measure residue for remote sensing calibration and validation or for handheld mobile device applications.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					471	479		10.2489/jswc.72.5471								WOS:000410019500009

Sedimentation in a small lake following conversion of bottomland forest to row cropping	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Areas of native bottomland hardwood forest in the lower Red River basin in Louisiana were cleared for row cropping around 1970. Erosion and sediment deposition in channels and lakes presumably, increased, affecting hydrologic connectivity and lake ecosystems: Sediment deposited in a representative small lake after land conversion was determined in 2000 from the distribution of cesium (Cs-137) with depth. Sediment consisted of low-density clay deposited above dense silt loam. Organic carbon (C) and Cs-137 profiles had lower and upper concentration maxima. The lower maxima established the circa 1970 lakebed at <= 0.9 m (3 ft) above the morphological discontinuity and from 2.1 to 1.3 m (6.9 to 4.3 ft) below the 2000 lakebed at positions midlake and halfway to the bank, respectively. The upper maxima were likely due to progressive land conversion around the lake, coupled with increasing clay content of sediment upwards to the 2000 lakebed. A quiescent settling model was used to estimate the composition of runoff water necessary to produce the depth, texture, and density of sediment above the lower Cs-137 maxima. The Annualized Agricultural Nonpoint Source water quality model was calibrated to match this composition, and sediment accumulation under alternative management scenarios was calculated. Compared to conventional-till. (CT) soybeans (Glycine max L.) for 30 years, CT with cover crop (CC), no-till (NT), NT with CC management, and forest might have reduced sedimentation in the lake by about 20%, 40%, 60%, and 98%, slowing changes in light penetration, temperature, turbidity, and chemistry that affect the lake ecosystem.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					530	538		10.2489/jswc.72.5.530								WOS:000410019500014

Construction of reliable calibration model requires significant investment of time and money. Once established, calibration model can be applied normally only together with that particular multisensor system, which was employed for its' construction - this can be a serious limitation for a wide adoption of multisensor systems in common laboratory practice. In order to address this issue we have studied the applicability of several calibration transfer techniques, such as direct standardization, single wavelength standardization and standardization with regularization coefficient for the data obtained from two potentiometric multisensor systems in analysis of complex lanthanide mixtures. It was found that mathematical correction of sensor array response using standardization with regularization coefficient allows for using the regression model derived for one sensor array together with the data obtained from another sensor array. The value of root mean squared error of prediction for total lanthanide concentration increased insignificantly (0.10 instead of 0.07 in log scale) compared with that provided by the first multisensor system.

J	Drever, MC; Hrachowitz, M				Drever, Mark C.; Hrachowitz, Markus			Migration as flow: using hydrological concepts to estimate the residence time of migrating birds from the daily counts	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Estimating the length-of-stay, the number of days a bird can be expected to stay at a site, at stopover sites is critical to understanding the migration ecology and estimating the population sizes of birds as they move between breeding and non-breeding sites. 2. Estimating the length-of-stay of migrating animals at stopover sites has an analogue in the hydrological concept of transit time, the amount of time that water spends in a reservoir, which can be calculated as a numerical integration of inflow and outflow rates with an underlying Storage Age Selection function. 3. We used this approach to estimate the lengths-of-stay of migrating Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina) based on the time series of daily counts at two sites in British Columbia, Canada. The approach yielded mean transit times for Western Sandpiper during southward migration at Sidney Island that ranged between 9.6 days and 3.8 days, and showed a significant decline over time, 1992-2001, and is consistent with the estimates obtained from the capture-mark-resight studies. Transit times during northward migration at Roberts Bank, Fraser River Delta, based on the best available information ranged from 1.8 to 3.2 days for Western Sandpiper, and had a median value of 2.0 days for Dunlin, which is consistent with the estimates obtained from the radio-telemetry studies. 4. These results indicate that the hydrological flow models may offer a means to estimate the length-of-stay from the daily counts of birds during migration. The models present an opportunity for testing the alternate hypotheses concerning the roles of behavioural-vs. habitat-related mechanisms driving shorebird population sizes.

We conducted this study to determine the effect of Bacillus consortium on Crassostrea gigas reared in contemned seawater with indigo dye priory treated with Bacillus or no treated. This effect was studied by assessing hemocytes death using flow cytometry analysis. We found that the percentage of decolorization of indigo dye in polluted seawater in presence of C. gigas increased from 41% to 90% when using Bacillus consortium. In these conditions, the hemocytes mortality of reared C. gigas decreased from 87% to 56%. We have demonstrated also that seawater contemned with priory treated indigo with Bacillus consortium is less toxic than seawater contemned with the no treated indigo. The percentage of hemocytes death is 81% for the contemned seawater with indigo and 56% for no contemned seawater. This consortium shows a protector effect of C gigas against Vibrio harveyi contemning reared seawater. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, improper lawn fertilizer applications can cause adverse environmental consequences, such as excessive chemical runoff into adjoining watersheds leading to water contamination. Currently, the importance of eco-friendly fertilizers to homeowners has not been assessed. This study uses a discrete choice experiment to test whether eco-friendly fertilizer attributes influence homeowners' preferences for sustainable landscape management. The findings show that eco-friendly fertilizer attributes positively influence homeowners' preferences and willingness to pay, supporting the premise that the promotion of eco-friendly fertilizer features could improve local ecosystems through increased adaptation. Furthermore, this study tests whether certain fertilizer attributes influence homeowners' preferences in states with and without fertilizer restrictions. Since the regulatory environment affects homeowners' preferences for sustainable landscaping, this study compares the results between regulated and unregulated states. The findings reveal that homeowners are more likely to use and are willing to pay higher premiums for sustainable fertilizers in states with residential fertilization regulations. This suggests that with strict fertilizer ordinances, homeowners are more geared toward eco-friendly landscaping options and that related educational programs should be made available.

Parameter sensitivity analysis is an efficient method to identify important model parameters. Through this method, a model's calibration process can be simplified on the basis of understanding the model's structure. This study investigated the sensitivity of the flow and nutrient parameters of HSPF using the DSA (differential sensitivity analysis) method in the Xitiaoxi watershed, China. The results showed that flow was mostly affected by parameters related to groundwater and evapotranspiration, including DEEPFR (fraction of groundwater inflow to deep recharge), LZETP (lower-zone evapotranspiration parameter), and AGWRC (base groundwater recession), and most of the sensitive parameters had negative and nonlinear effects on flow. Additionally, nutrient components were commonly affected by parameters from land processes, including MON-SQOLIM (monthly values limiting storage of water quality in overland flow), MON-ACCUM (monthly values of accumulation), MON-IFLW-CONC (monthly concentration of water quality in interflow), and MON-GRND-CONC (monthly concentration of water quality in active groundwater). Besides, parameters from river systems, KATM20 (unit oxidation rate of total ammonia at 20 degrees C) had a negative and almost linear effect on ammonia concentration and MALGR (maximal unit algal growth rate for phytoplankton) had a negative and nonlinear effect on ammonia and orthophosphate concentrations. After calibrating these sensitive parameters, our model performed well for simulating flow and nutrient outputs, with R-2 and E-NS (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency) both greater than 0.75 for flow and greater than 0.5 for nutrient components. This study is expected to serve as a valuable complement to the documentation of the HSPF model to help users identify key parameters and provide a reference for performing sensitivity analyses on other models.

J	Liu, JF; Zhang, X; Wu, B; Pan, GY; Xu, J; Wu, SF				Liu, Jianfeng; Zhang, Xiang; Wu, Bi; Pan, Guoyan; Xu, Jing; Wu, Shaofei			Spatial scale and seasonal dependence of land use impacts on riverine water quality in the Huai River basin, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Land use pattern is an effective reflection of anthropic activities, which are primarily responsible for water quality deterioration. A detailed understanding of relationship between water quality and land use is critical for effective land use management to improve water quality. Linear mixed effects and multiple regression models were applied to water quality data collected from 2003 to 2010 from 36 stations in the Huai River basin together with topography and climate data, to characterize the land use impacts on water quality and their spatial scale and seasonal dependence. The results indicated that the influence of land use categories on specific water quality parameter was multiple and varied with spatial scales and seasons. Land use exhibited strongest association with dissolved oxygen (DO) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentrations at entire watershed scale and with total phosphorus (TP) and fluoride concentrations at finer scales. However, the spatial scale, at which land use exerted strongest influence on instream chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels, varied with seasons. In addition, land use composition was responsible for the seasonal pattern observed in contaminant concentrations. COD, NH3-N, and fluoride generally peaked during dry seasons in highly urbanized regions and during rainy seasons in less urbanized regions. High proportion of agricultural and rural areas was associated with high nutrient contamination risk during spring. The results highlight the spatial scale and seasonal dependence of land use impacts on water quality and can provide scientific basis for scale-specific land management and seasonal contamination control.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	26					20995	21010		10.1007/s11356-017-9733-7								WOS:000409040700016	28726224

Sixteen diversion scenarios and five sewage interception scenarios were defined to assess the improvement of water quality parameters including ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) under different diverted water flows, diverting times, diverting points, diverting routines and sewage interception proportions. An index of pollutant removal rate per unit diverted water flow (PRUWF) was proposed to evaluate the effect of the clean water diversion. Results show that operating conditions played important roles in water quality improvement of medium-sized inland rivers. The optimal clean water diversion was operated under the conditions of a flow rate of 5 m(3)/s for 48 h with an additional constructed bridge sluice. A global sensitivity analysis using the Latin Hypercube One-Factor-at-a-Time (LH-OAT) method was conducted to distinguish the contributions of various driving forces to inland river water restoration. Results show that sewage interception was more important than diverted water flow and diverting time with respect to water quality improvement, especially for COD.

As a result, the dynamic balances among freshwater, brine, and seawater have been disturbed and the quality of groundwater has deteriorated. To fully understand the groundwater chemical distribution and evolution in the regional aquifers, hydrogeochemical and isotopic studies have been conducted based on the water samples from 102 observation wells. Groundwater levels and salinities in four monitoring wells are as well measured to inspect the general groundwater flow and chemical patterns and seasonal variations. Chemical components such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Cl-, SO4 (2-), HCO3 (-), NO3 (-), F-, and TDS during the same period are analyzed to explore geochemical evolution, water-rock interactions, sources of salt, nitrate, and fluoride pollution in fresh, brackish, saline, and brine waters. The decreased water levels without typical seasonal variation in the southeast of the study area confirm an over-exploitation of groundwater. The hydrogeochemical characteristics indicate fresh-saline-brine-saline transition pattern from inland to coast where evaporation is a vital factor to control the chemical evolution. The cation exchange processes are occurred at fresh-saline interfaces of mixtures along the hydraulic gradient. Meanwhile, isotopic data indicate that the brine in aquifers was either originated from older meteoric water with mineral dissolution and evaporation or repeatedly evaporation of retained seawater with fresher water recharge and mixing in geological time. Groundwater suitability for drinking is further evaluated according to water quality standard of China. Results reveal high risks of nitrate and fluoride contamination. The elevated nitrate concentration of 560 mg/L, which as high as 28 times of the standard content in drinking water is identified in the south region. In addition, the nitrate and ammonia data of the Wei River suggests decreasing nitrification rate in the study area from inland to estuary. High fluoride concentration, larger than 1 mg/L, is also detected in an area of about 50% of the study region. The saltwater intrusion is analyzed to be responsible for part of dissolution of minerals containing fluoride. Therefore, water treatment before drinking is needed in urgent to reduce the health expose risk.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	26					21073	21090		10.1007/s11356-017-9641-x								WOS:000409040700022	28730358

Except the concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in the influent and effluent that were measured, the removal mechanism of pollutants was discussed further. The results indicate that the surface materials influence the removal efficiency of pollutants greatly and have different effects on certain pollutant. Furthermore, the physical interception and adsorption would be the main mechanism for the removal of pollutants from runoff. For example, for all surface materials, the average removal efficiency of TSS is nearly about 90.0% because of physical interception. Due to the amount of iron oxide, the removal efficiency of COD, NO3-N, and TN of shale brick was 88.2, 35.1, and 17.5%, respectively. NH4-N and TN can be easily removed by porous asphalt due to the high content of organic matter. By lacking of useful adsorption sites, all the surface materials had little effect on the removal of TP from runoff. This research could offer useful guidelines for the better design of permeable pavement system and promote the insight into the removal mechanism of pollutants in permeable pavement system.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	26					21103	21110		10.1007/s11356-017-9750-6								WOS:000409040700024	28730361

This technique, however, presents a risk to surface water and groundwater resources, owing to the leakage of metals, anions, and organic compounds. The geochemical monitoring of water resources is therefore extremely important, since the leachate can compromise the quality and use of surface water and groundwater close to landfills. In this paper, the results of analyses of metals, anions, ammonia, and physicochemical parameters were used to identify possible contamination of surface water and groundwater in a landfill area. A statistical multivariate approach was used. The values found for alkali metals, nitrate, and chloride indicate contamination in the regional groundwater and, moreover, surface waters also show variation when compared to the other background points, mainly for ammonia. Thus, the results of this study evidence the landfill leachate influence on the quality of groundwater and surface water in the study area.

We analyse protest responses while investigating ecosystem services providers' preferences for incentive-based schemes. We use a choice experiment for olive farmers' preferences for agri-environmental scheme participation in southern Spain. Our two main objectives are: first, to identify and discuss a range of possible motives for protest responses that emerge in a WTA context; second, we analyse the impact on WTA estimates of censoring serial non-participation linked to protest or high compensation requirements (very high takers). Using a random parameter logit model in WTA space, we find that the inclusion or exclusion of serial non-participants in the analysis can have a significant impact on marginal and total WTA estimates. Based on the findings, the paper makes recommendations on how to reduce the incidence of protest responses through survey design, regarding the identification of protesters as opposed to very high takers, and regarding the treatment of both groups of respondents for WTA estimation.

The applied MST tools combined microbial analyses and molecular tests to detect and define the source(s) and dominant origin(s) of faecal water contamination. Faecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and host-specific Bacteroidales 16 s rRNA gene markers have been employed. The study revealed that the newly developed contribution profiling of faecal origin derived from the Bacteroidales DNA could quantitatively distinguish between human and non-human pollution origins. Further, the outcomes of the MST test have been compared with the results of both physicochemical analyses and tests of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs). A strong positive correlation was discovered between the human marker and PPCPs. Gabapentin was the most frequently detected compound and it showed the uppermost positive correlation with the human marker. The study demonstrated that the NBTS performs satisfactorily with the removal of E. coli but not PPCPs. Interestingly, the presence of PPCPs in the water samples was not correlated with high concentrations of E. coli. Neither has the latter an apparent correlation with the human marker.

Adapted optimization model for planning regional wastewater systems: case study	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Wastewater systems are of crucial importance to the promotion of sustainable development. Through an integrated planning approach, the costs can be minimized and the resulting benefits maximized. A planning approach at regional level exploits the economies of scale, while achieving a better environmental performance. In this paper we set out a decision support approach for the planning of regional wastewater systems. Optimization models are used, aimed at finding optimal configurations for the location, type and size of the system's infrastructure: sewers, pump stations, and wastewater treatment plants. Solutions are evaluated in terms of the cost of installing, operating and maintaining the infrastructure, and the water quality in the river that receives the treated wastewater. The river water quality varies in accordance with the effluent discharges, and is assessed using environmental parameters. The models are solved with a simulated annealing algorithm complemented by a local improvement procedure. Its application is illustrated through a case study in the Una river basin region, in Brazil.

Cavitation bubble oscillation period as a process diagnostic during the laser shock peening process	APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING												Laser shock peening (LSP) technology is a laser-induced shock process implemented as a surface enhancement technique to introduce beneficial compressive residual stresses into metallic components. The process employs water to confine and enhance the pressure pulse delivered to the target. For thick water layers, or fully water immersed LSP, a cavitation bubble is generated by the surface vaporization of the LSP laser pulse. This research shows that the first bubble oscillation period of the cavitation bubble can be used to characterize effective and repeatable energy delivery to the target. High-speed shadowgraphy is implemented to show that variations in the bubble period occur before visual observations of dielectric breakdown in water. The diagnostic potential of the first bubble oscillation period is used to identify the dielectric breakdown threshold of water, which shows an increase with increasing water quality measured by water conductivity.

Generally, nutrient contents gradually decreased from the estuary to the central bay, which confirmed that terrigenous inputs from Sanya River and Sanya Harbor were the primary nutrient sources. The results of K-means cluster analysis suggested the Luhuitou fringing reef is in danger of being affected by the pollution source. The results of nutrient diffusive fluxes at the sediment-seawater interface indicated diffusion from pore water to overlying water. Compared with other coral reef areas around the world, nutrient levels in Luhuitou fringing reef were at the medium level. Significant correlation between temporal variation of nutrients and living coral cover was not found, which suggests that low nutrient enrichment, ranging from 1.89 to 2.89 mu mol/L for DIN and from 0.1 to 0.49 mu mol/L for PO43-, may not be responsible for the coral reef decline on Luhuitou fringing reef from 2002 to 2014.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2017	33	5					1148	1160		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00190.1								WOS:000409252500014

In the studied soil environments, the average moisture content was 28.07%, soil salinity was 5.86 ppt, and total nitrogen was 1.02 mg/g. In water environments, the average dissolved oxygen was 9.04 mg/L, water salinity was 13.66 ppt, nitrate nitrogen (NOx-N) was 1.0712 mg/L, and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) was 0.3790 mg/L. The correlation analysis of P. australis communities revealed that there was a relatively strong negative correlation between soil salinity and annual production (r = -0.584, N = 22). The ordination using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of edaphic factors and water quality factors showed that soil salinity, water salinity, and water nitrate-nitrogen play important roles in types of P. australis communities. It was separated as three coastal habitat Phragmites community types by cluster analysis and three Phragmites community types including brackish water group in both freshwater and seawater groups by CCA. The understanding of Phragmites distribution in three habitat types would help inform successful management.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SEP	2017	33	5					1210	1216		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00065.1								WOS:000409252500020

The results show a significant willingness to pay for services such as drought mitigation, water quality and the environment and maintenance of rural lifestyles and rice landscapes. The iterative procedure developed to fully analyze the incidence of attribute nonattendance (ANA) improved the model fit when compared with a multinomial logit model or an ANA model with potentially only one attribute ignored at a time (ANA-1). Moreover, the inferred probability of the class of respondents having attended all attributes was 45%, compared to 9% with ANA-1 model. However, it also suggests that 55% of the respondents made their choices by considering only two of the five attributes. Finally, this research also suggests that failing to consider ANA does not change the public ranking of scenarios contrasted by the services they would provide but would overestimate the WTP for these scenarios.

Local environment and connectivity are the main drivers of diatom species composition and trait variation in a set of tropical reservoirs	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A metacommunity is defined as a set of local communities that are connected by dispersal and are controlled by environmental drivers operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Although diatom ecology has been studied extensively in temperate and lotic ecosystems, knowledge of tropical lentic systems is more limited. 2. We evaluated how planktonic and surface-sediment diatom communities, including trait-based communities, were structured by environmental, spatial and land-use variables in tropical reservoirs. Diatoms were sampled in seven reservoirs (31 sites in total) in south-east Brazil, from the surface sediment and the plankton in summer and winter. 3. Diatom communities responded primarily to a trophic gradient and secondarily to a light-availability gradient. Connectivity was also a strong predictor, whereas land use had a weaker influence on community variation. Our results further suggested that surface-sediment and planktonic diatom groups were structured by similar environmental variables. Trait-based analysis also indicated that these communities were related to environmental and spatial factors. 4. We conclude that (1) trophic state, light availability and connectivity were the main drivers of diatoms in this set of tropical reservoirs, resulting in spatially structured communities; (2) patterns for surface-sediment diatoms resembled both summer and winter diatom communities in the plankton; and (3) the effects of the explanatory variables (local environment, connectivity and land use) varied among the different biological datasets (i.e. when organised taxonomically, or according to growth morphology, cell size or trophic preference). We emphasize that studies in tropical reservoirs should take spatial variables into account, due to the connectivity of the sites.

This resulted in a flexible, objectively based design for a 1128-km(2) watershed without prior water quality data (La Miel River), and a network redesign of a 1052-km(2) watershed with historical water quality monitoring (Chinchina River). Monitoring design for the undocumented basin incorporated mathematical expressions for physical, anthropological, and historical factors-and was based on clear objectives for diagnosis and intervention of water pollution. Network redesign identified network redundancy, which resulted in a 64% reduction in the number of water quality monitoring stations along the channel, and a 78% reduction of stations throughout the basin. Most tropical drainage basins throughout the world have little to no prior water quality data. But even in well-studied drainage basins like the Chinchina River, which is among the most thoroughly studied basins in Colombia, redesign of historical and existing monitoring networks will become a standard tool to advance the restoration of polluted surface waters, not only in Colombia, but also throughout the world.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20134	20148		10.1007/s11356-017-9021-6								WOS:000408698700003	28432628

Especially in the Adriatic region, water used for drinking water supply purposes pass from many different countries, turning its management into a hard task to achieve. During the DRINKADRIA project, a common methodological framework has been developed, for efficient and effective cross-border water supply and resources management, taking into consideration different resources types (surface and groundwater) emphasizing in drinking water supply intake. The common methodology for water resources management is based on four pillars: climate characteristics and climate change, water resources availability, quality, and security. The present paper assesses both present and future vulnerability of water resources in the Adriatic region, with special focus on Corfu Island, Greece. The results showed that climate change is expected to impact negatively on water resources availability while at the same time, water demand is expected to increase. Water quality problems will be intensified especially due to land use changes and salt water intrusion. The analysis identified areas where water resources are more vulnerable, allowing decision makers develop management strategies.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20173	20186		10.1007/s11356-017-9732-8								WOS:000408698700006	28730364

However, after the occurrence of the two algae blooms in 1998 and 1999, the safety of water quality has been put into question. In order to study the historical deposition of nutrients, sediment cores were collected in different regions from the Xin'an Reservoir. The stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15, nutrients, total organic carbon (TOC), and inorganic carbon (IC) in the sediment cores were determined. Radiometric methods (Pb-210 and Cs-137) were used to obtain sediment chronologies. Spatially, it was found that the average total nitrogen (TN) content in the upper 5 cm of sediments increased from 0.21% in the riverine zone, to 0.33%, and then to 0.57% in the lacustrine zone. The average TP content in the upper 5 cm increased from 0.67 g kg(-1) in the riverine zone, to 1.03 g kg(-1) in the estuary region, and then to 1.65 g kg(-1) in the lacustrine zone. In addition, TOC levels showed a distinct increase from 1.42% in the bottom to 5.97% in the surface of the lacustrine zone. These results demonstrated that although primary productivity and the input of nutrients constantly increased in recent years, algae blooms rarely occurred in the Xin'an Reservoir, due to "depth effect" and an aquatic environment protection-oriented fishery policy. However, high TOC flux and high bio-available phosphorus and nitrogen in surface sediment demonstrated that the reservoir is still confronted with the potential risk of algae blooms.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20330	20341		10.1007/s11356-017-9537-9								WOS:000408698700017	28707236

Water quality parameters including total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite (NO2 (-)), nitrate (NO3 (-)), phosphate (PO4 (3-)), pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) were determined in outlet of the aquaponic system during a 60-day experimental period. Cherry tomato was planted at four densities of 0 (control), 3 (T1), 6 (T2), and 9 (T3) plants per aquaponic unit with a constant fish stock density. Each treatment was equipped with aquaponic systems containing fish tank and plant growing bed. Productivity of the system was measured by recording the fish and plant growth indices. The potential in removing nitrogen of the water was the highest in T3 (with nine plants) compared to other treatments (p < 0.05). The highest concentrations of TAN (6.59 +/- 0.241 mg/L), nitrite (0.42 +/- 0.005 mg/L), nitrate (0.45 +/- 0.162 mg/L), and phosphate (30.47 +/- 0.371 mg/L) were obtained in control group, while the lowest concentrations of TAN (0.05 +/- 0.091 mg/L), NO2 (-) (0.11 +/- 0.008 mg/L), NO3 (-) (29.77 +/- 0.205 mg/L), and phosphate (18.59 +/- 0.185 mg/L) were detected in T3 (p < 0.05). The maximum fish weight gain was recorded in T3 (26 +/- 0.014%) with 1.26 +/- 0.059 FCR, and the lowest fish weight gain was measured in the control group (15 +/- 0.024%) with 2.19 +/- 0.446 FCR (p < 0.05). Total plant length gain was reached at the maximum value in T3 (74.70 +/- 1.153 cm) in comparison to other groups (p < 0.05). It was concluded that small-scale aquaponic growing bed system can be created a sustainable ecosystem which both the plant and fish can thrive and suitable for home-made production system.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20634	20640		10.1007/s11356-017-9702-1								WOS:000408698700043	28712082					
J	Zolfagharipoor, MA; Ahmadi, A				Zolfagharipoor, Mohammad Amin; Ahmadi, Azadeh			Effluent trading in river systems through stochastic decision-making process: a case study	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The objective of this paper is to provide an efficient framework for effluent trading in river systems. The proposed framework consists of two pessimistic and optimistic decision-making models to increase the executability of river water quality trading programs. The models used for this purpose are (1) stochastic fallback bargaining (SFB) to reach an agreement among wastewater dischargers and (2) stochastic multi-criteria decision-making (SMCDM) to determine the optimal treatment strategy. The Monte-Carlo simulation method is used to incorporate the uncertainty into analysis. This uncertainty arises from stochastic nature and the errors in the calculation of wastewater treatment costs. The results of river water quality simulation model are used as the inputs of models. The proposed models are used in a case study on the Zarjoub River in northern Iran to determine the best solution for the pollution load allocation. The best treatment alternatives selected by each model are imported, as the initial pollution discharge permits, into an optimization model developed for trading of pollution discharge permits among pollutant sources. The results show that the SFB-based water pollution trading approach reduces the costs by US$ 14,834 while providing a relative consensus among pollutant sources. Meanwhile, the SMCDM-based water pollution trading approach reduces the costs by US$ 218,852, but it is less acceptable by pollutant sources. Therefore, it appears that giving due attention to stability, or in other words acceptability of pollution trading programs for all pollutant sources, is an essential element of their success.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				SEP	2017	24	25					20655	20672		10.1007/s11356-017-9720-z								WOS:000408698700045	28712084

Land-use changes, such as converting riparian vegetation to human use or changing the management practices of farm ponds, are assumed to be major factors that change such ecosystems from a clear-water state to a turbid state, leading to deterioration of water quality and biodiversity in such ponds. Using the database of a large-scale pond survey, we evaluated the effects of surrounding land use (landscape factors and modern pond management practices), fish abundance, and other environmental variables on total phosphorus concentration and taxonomic richness patterns of six biological indicators associated with changes in the trophic state. Local- and landscape-level vegetation structure associated with land use and total fish abundance were among the factors influencing the total phosphorus concentration of farm ponds, a main driver of trophic state changes. In addition, a transition from a clear-water state to a turbid state was associated with lower taxonomic richness of aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates, and adult Odonata, and a higher taxonomic richness of phytoplankton and fish. Based on these results, we discuss potential land-use and pond management strategies for conserving and/or restoring the water quality and biodiversity of farm ponds through maintenance of a clear-water state.

Relative role of transport and source -limited controls for estrogen, TDP, and DOC export for two manure application methods	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Developing successful mitigation strategies for emerging contaminants can be difficult due to incomplete understanding of factors controlling their fate and transport. A variety of data analysis techniques can be used to assess the fate and transport behavior of pollutants in runoff water. Here, we use concentration-discharge, load discharge, and coefficient of variation relationships to examine how two methods of dairy manure application (surface broadcast and shallow disk injection) affect the transport dynamics of estrogens, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Nine surface runoff events were sampled from Oct 2014 June 2015 from 12 research plots (six with each application method) in Central Pennsylvania after fall application. The plots received inorganic fertilizer for 15 years, but only four manure applications since 2012. Both TDP and DOC exhibited similar transport behavior under both manure application methods that indicate transport-limited control of export, potentially due to legacy sources in soils. However, estrogen loads exhibited dilution responses, a sign of source-limited controls. The strength of the dilution response for estrogens was greater for surface applied manure relative to the injected manure, suggesting that manure application methods can be used to control the mobilization potential of estrogens. Additionally, results suggest the longer-term application history of inorganic fertilizer led to the transport-limited dynamics exhibited by TDP, while the short-term application history of manure caused estrogen transport to be source-limited. Our findings provide insight into how anthropogenic drivers (application type, method, and history) and natural drivers (hydrology, biogeochemistry) are interconnected in agricultural fields, and point to opportunities for protecting, downstream water quality.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				SEP 1	2017	247						308	318		10.1016/j.agee.2017.06.045								WOS:000408597800034						
J	Vilmi, A; Karjalainen, SM; Heino, J				Vilmi, Annika; Karjalainen, Satu Maaria; Heino, Jani			Ecological uniqueness of stream and lake diatom communities shows different macroecological patterns	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim: To discover whether lake and stream diatom communities show different patterns in species richness and in their local (LCBD) and species (SCBD) contributions to beta diversity in relation to macroscale environmental characteristics. Location: Finland. Methods: As biological data, we used diatom samples collected from Finnish stream (n = 492) and lake (n = 290) sites. As explanatory variable data, we used information on macroscale environmental and historical aspects, such as bedrock, soil and post-glacial highest shoreline. We also accounted for catchment areas, different levels of isolation and relative centrality of the study sites. We ran multiple linear models and selected best models based on AICc values. Results: We found that macroscale factors affecting diatom richness and ecological uniqueness differed clearly between streams and lakes. LCBD and species richness of stream communities were more affected by regional environmental characteristics, whereas LCBD and species richness of lake communities were more often driven by spatial measures. The measures of LCBD and species richness showed a slightly negative relationship in streams, but no such relationship was detected in lakes. Also, we showed that, for both streams and lakes, SCBD was strongly determined by the number of sites occupied by a species and the overall abundance of a species. Main conclusions: Our findings related to the distinction between the determinants of lake and stream species richness or LCBD may be tied to the different hydrological connectivity levels occurring in freshwater lotic and lentic systems. Also, in streams, sites with exceptional ecological uniqueness seem to have a rather low number of species. Our findings may be applied to biological conservation and monitoring planning, emphasizing that not only species-rich but also unique low-richness sites may be valuable conservation goals.

An integrated approach for evaluation of groundwater quality in Korba district, Chhattisgarh using Geomatic techniques	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: The objective of the study was to evaluate and assess present groundwater quality scenario by developing groundwater quality index map for Korba district in Chhattisgarh. Methodology: For the study, well wise water quality data was collected for 719 villages over the period of six years from 2009 to 2015.The relative weights, quality rating scale and accordingly weighted values were calculated to estimate the overall groundwater quality index (GQI) and calculation of GQI was carried out for 10 parameters such as pH, turbidity, total hardness, chloride, calcium, nitrate, iron, magnesium, sulphate and fluoride. GQI map was developed by creating spatial reference to point locations for which the quality of groundwater is known using GIS software. Results: The concentration of the parameters in the study area was found in the following order: Turbidity > Iron > pH > Fluoride > Nitrate > Magnesium > Calcium > Chloride > Total Hardness > Sulphate. Groundwater quality index map show decrease in water quality from north to east in the study area. According to the classification of GQI, 8.86% of water sampling locations were found having GQI less than100 means bearing good quality water and 91.14% having GQI greater than100 indicating non potable water. Interpretation: Application of GQI in the present work communicates comparative information on groundwater quality of Korba district. Presence of low water quality in the study area may be attributed due to mining activities and overexploitation of groundwater. Analysis suggests that groundwater in the study area needs specific treatment before supply to the public as potable water.																	0254-8704					SEP	2017	38	5					865	872		10.22438/jeb/38/5/MRN-600								WOS:000407544700022

Urban nutrient loadings are expected to increase and become more variable under climate change (CC). In this study, a water quality simulation model (SWMM), land cover data layers, and mathematical programming models were used to compare costs of abating nutrient loads under CC in the Difficult Run Watershed located in Fairfax County, Virginia. Predicted costs of abating mean total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended sediment (TSS) loadings under current climate conditions were compared with those for CC under certainty with a Cost Minimization Model and under uncertainty with a Safety First Model. Total nitrogen loadings abatement had the highest cost followed by TP and TSS abatement in that order. Costs of controlling TP and TSS increased with CC, whereas there was little change in TN control costs. Introducing uncertainty of loadings caused control costs to increase substantially for all three pollutants. The preferred pollutant control strategy was urban stream restoration. Policy makers seeking to meet water quality goals over a multiyear horizon should consider frontloading supplemental best management practices (BMPs) to offset the changes in nutrient loadings predicted for CC.

An experimental facility was designed which is a scale model of an existing supply zone serving similar to 100,000 customers. The facility was designed for (1) investigating transport of water qualities and potential contaminations; (2) providing a fast and flexible testing ground for networks of real-time water quality and quantity sensors prior to installment in live distribution networks; and (3) training and demonstration purposes. A scale analysis was used to investigate the possibilities including in a single facility the processes turbulence, turbulent diffusion, particle transport mode, and shear stress in a way that represents the real-life network environment, and to determine the facility's spatial and temporal dimensions. Using hydraulic modeling, it was verified that the main flow patterns in the facility are representative for the real-life network. The final design includes a 4 x 8 m model, transparent PVC pipes, and a decentralized fast control system that includes 28 demand and 4 supply locations to simulate complex flow patterns. The setup is currently being prepared for experimentation. This paper describes the theoretical background and the design and construction process.

Reducing the phosphorous load to downstream areas can be of great importance for aquatic habitats associated with recipient waters, as well as for the overall health of coastal and estuary areas. This study demonstrates a combined operation of a network of reservoirs with the objectives of hydropower production and improvement of water quality in downstream areas using a multiobjective approach and incorporating the transport of phosphorous in the watershed. A genetic optimization method was used to determine the trade-off between power production and mitigation of phosphorous discharge in the reservoir network of the Dalalven River, Sweden. The phosphorous export can be reduced (-5%) with a limited loss of power production (-4.3%), but further reduction is associated with a significant loss in total power production. The trade-off between the two objectives is determined using Pareto diagrams and examined for varying particulate conditions.

Evaluation of sludge handling using acidification and sequential aluminum coagulant recovery: case study of El-Sheikh Zayed WTP	JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA												Huge amounts of water treatment sludge are wasted annually in Egypt. One common practice of sludge handling is to discharge into waterways or by disposal after drying into landfills. Currently, there is a critical need for sustainable solutions that provide environmental protection as well as benefits for water producers. Coagulant recovery is not new but is still a good solution for sludge handling and reduction of operational costs. This work aims at completing the picture on coagulant recovery from alum sludge in El-Sheikh Zayed water treatment plant (ESZ-WTP) by acidification using hydrochloric acid. This study also investigates the effect of sequential recovery on the efficiency of the coagulant and treated water quality. Sludge characterization was done through determination of metals' concentration and composition, water content and organic matter concentration. The influence of acid concentration, sludge mass, acid/sludge mass ratio, mixing speed, temperature, and mixing time on aluminum leaching was studied. At optimum values of these parameters, 82.4% aluminum recovery was obtained. In addition, repeated recoveries were carried out at laboratory scale using raw water from ESZ-WTP. Our research revealed that recovered coagulant can be used for three times' recoveries as the trihalomethanes remain within acceptable limits.

In this cross-sectional study, 879 samples were taken to evaluate the water quality characteristics during 12 months (2013-2014). Five indices, Langelier, Ryznar, Puckorius, Larson-Skold, and Aggressiveness, were programmed in Microsoft Excel. The results illustrated that the values of the Langelier saturation index, Ryznar stability index, Puckorius scaling index, Larson ratio, and Aggressiveness index were 0.33 (+/- 0.17), 7.36 (+/- 0.37), 7.4 (+/- 0.6), 2.1 (+/- 1.4), and 12.03 (+/- 0.18), respectively. According to the Ryznar index (RSI), the index for the water resources of Torbat city was 6.99 and RSI for the central part of Gonabad was 6.4 (consolidation grade). The average pH in the studied water wells was 8.03. The amounts of turbidity, calcium, magnesium, nitrate, and fluoride in the study areas have favorable and acceptable conditions. However, the values of sulfate, total dissolved solids, and chloride in a few cities were higher than the standards. Comparison of five stability indices demonstrated that water in some parts of the study area is corrosive. Based on the results, selecting the best method to prevent the corrosion process is required.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				SEP	2017	66	6					416	425		10.2166/aqua.2017.128								WOS:000408792400006

Assessment of the environmental quality of two urbanized lotic systems using multiple indicators	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Urbanization impacts ecosystems through loss and fragmentation of habitat, loss of diversity, increase in runoff, and contaminant discharges, and the invasion of exotic species. Potrero de los Funes Village (San Luis, Argentina) is experiencing not only a population increase during summer months due to tourism but also an accelerated growth of its permanent population. In order to evaluate the potential effects of urbanization, the environmental quality of Potrero de los Funes River and Las Chacras Stream was assessed, using physical-chemical and biological indicators. Macroinvertebrates, through the application of the Biotic Index for San Luis Sierras (BISLS), anuran amphibian richness and relative abundance, and riparian vegetation were used as bioindicators. While the Simplified Index of Water Quality (SIWQ) was used to characterize the physical-chemical quality of water at each site. SIWQ and BISLS scores were significantly different between sites (F-7,F-28=9.88, p<.001 and F-7,F-28=24.18, p<.001, respectively). SIWQ was significantly correlated with BISLS (Spearman correlation coefficient=0.8, p<.001). Four anuran species were registered along Potrero River, with no significant differences in the intensity of vocalizations between sites. No species were detected in Las Chacras Stream. Average total plant species richness, exotic plants richness, and vegetation cover were higher at the most impaired system, Las Chacras Stream. The principal component analysis showed that the first two principal components (PCs) explained 76.3% of the total variance. PC1, with strong loadings of SIWQ, BISLS, and amphibian richness, was principally driven by chemical water quality and biological conditions. PC2 was mainly determined by plant richness. The chemical and biological water quality of Potrero and Las Chacras is somewhat impaired, being the upper Las Chacras Stream the most compromised area. This study provides information that will certainly be used to manage future impacts of urbanization on aquatic resources.																	1535-1459	1535-1467				SEP	2017	33	7					1119	1129		10.1002/rra.3160								WOS:000409105100014

The RDA analysis of environmental parameters showed that the system is mostly temperature-driven. The phytoplankton community was mainly composed of diatoms and less with dinoflagellates. Pseudo-nitzschia was the dominant diatom, present in 88.40 % of samples, with a maximum (of 1.85 x 10(5) cells/l). Among toxic dinoflagellates, frequent were Dinophysis acuminata (with frequency of 33.33%), D. fortii (with frequency of 23.19%) and Prorocentrum cordatum (with frequency of 21.74%). The RDA analysis showed that diatoms correlated slightly positively with nutrients and negative correlation was recorded with temperature and salinity. Dinoflagellates showed strong positive association, indicating a positive correlation with oxygen concentration, chl a, SiO4- and NO3- concentrations and negative correlation with temperature and salinity.																	1303-2712					SEP	2017	17	5					885	900		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_5_05								WOS:000406777500005

The karstic features of the KSD including vertical shafts, sinkholes, caves and brine springs, were investigated in order to characterize groundwater flow system in the diapir. KSD drains by three perennial and several temporary brine springs saturated with respect to halite. Electrical conductivity and chemical composition of three perennial brine springs were measured in wet and dry hydrological seasons. KSD consists of two hydrogeological units of Plug and Glacier districts. A conduit karst flow system is characterized for the Plug district including point recharge through sinkholes and discharge as several temporary brine springs. For the Glacier district, a diffuse flow system is proposed. Rainfall recharged to Glacier district discharges mainly via three brine springs throughout the year. The higher elevation of the springs of the diapir indicates that the elevation of base level of karstification is higher than the surrounding area, i.e. subsurface discharge of brine to the adjacent aquifers is unlikely. In this condition, construction of evaporite basins is proposed to prohibit re-infiltration of the emerged brine of the diapir into the surrounding aquifers which would increase water quality of the aquifers.																	0891-2556	1878-5212				SEP	2017	32	3					315	323		10.1007/s13146-016-0298-1								WOS:000408344200004

Until now, general end-users have had no effective method to measure the drinking water quality in situ and identify first-hand any violation. In return, there has been no feedback closed-loop of water quality monitoring and a control regime along distribution systems to provide real-time in situ early-warning for water treatment plants. This study targeted this crucial challenge by developing flat flexible thin micro-electrode array (MEA) sensors that integrate multiple types of mm-sized sensors to simultaneously monitor critical water quality parameters (temperature, conductivity, pH, Cl- and ClO-). MEA films were directly mounted onto a water tube that simulated a distribution system. Each type of sensor showed high accuracy with an R-2 value higher than 0.95 in the calibration tests. The shock tests clearly demonstrated the higher sensitivity of the MEA sensors than commercial sensors, and the advantage of integrating multiple types of sensors on a single film for autocorrection. More importantly, the Ag nanoparticle-modified ClO- MEA sensors showed high selectivity in the presence of competing elements (Cl-). Four-week tests in tap water revealed the intact structure of the MEA sensors and stable signal output. Overall, the MEAs possessed high accuracy, sensitivity, and selectivity for monitoring water quality. The flat flexible thin material and integrated configuration make the deployment of the sensors easy along distribution systems and at end-user points, and ultimately enable the in situ assessment of water quality in the water infrastructure.																	2053-1400	2053-1419				SEP 1	2017	3	5					865	874		10.1039/c7ew00103g								WOS:000408431500008						
J	Yuan, PY; Kim, Y				Yuan, Pengyi; Kim, Younggy			Accurate and rapid organic detection by eliminating hysteresis in bioanode sensor applications	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Bioanode sensors utilizing exoelectrogenic bacteria can be used for real-time and in situ assessment of water quality. The main challenges for practical applications of bioanode sensors in water quality assessment include their narrow detection range, long analysis time, and hysteresis effects. To overcome these limitations, a new operation method was proposed and examined in microbial electrolysis cell (MEC)-based bioanode sensors. The new operation method consists of normal operation (0.6 V application), a reset step (1.8 V application for 1 min), and a test step (1.2 V application for 2 min). The inclusion of the reset step in the sensor operation eliminated potential hysteresis effects and thus resulted in accurate correlations between readily biodegradable COD (chemical oxygen demand) and electric current with consistent R-2 values of 99% in triplicated sensor experiments. The high voltage application (1.2 V) during the test step not only enhanced sensor accuracy but also extended the detection range up to 130 mg-COD L-1. The combination of a reset step and a test step was proven to allow reliable sensor applications of MECs and other bioelectrochemical systems. Even with the greatly improved sensor accuracy, the correlation between readily biodegradable COD (acetate) and electric current varied substantially in 2 days. The findings indicate that bioanode sensors can be used for rapid organic detection in 3 min with very high accuracies but require frequent sensor calibration.

Experiments aimed at increasing of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in water were carried out in laboratory scale fluidized-bed reactor. This technique offers potential for increasing of reaction surface area and overall reaction rate, and represents a new approach in drinking-water industry. Measurements of hydraulic characteristics of the fluidized bed were performed. The results of comparison of two different recarbonization agents, dolomite and half-calcined dolomite, show that half-calcined dolomite is more efficient for increasing concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ from value below the recommended limit to 3.4 mmol L-1. Effect of carbon dioxide on enrichment of water by calcium and magnesium was also investigated and positive effect was observed.

This paper provides a review concerning AFIs in terms of their development, classification, and applications in the removal of nutrients, heavy metals, and chemical oxygen demand on waterways. The role of microorganisms, aquatic plants, and aquatic animals in AFIs for water decontamination and purification was also discussed. Additionally, some key factors influencing the AFIs' performances were discussed and comparisons between AFIs and constructed wetlands were reviewed. Finally, further perspectives of artificial floating islands were identified to possibly improve their performances. The understanding of the mechanisms in AFIs that drive removal of various contaminants to improve water quality is crucial, and is also highlighted in this paper.																	1208-6053	1181-8700				SEP	2017	25	3					350	357		10.1139/er-2016-0038								WOS:000408543800009

Assessing ecological impairments in Neotropical rivers of Mexico: calibration and validation of the Biomonitoring Working Party Index	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Freshwater ecosystems are one of the most endangered and threatened ecosystems worldwide, particularly in developing countries, where population growth, industrialization, urbanization, and changes in land use are increasing. In Mexico, water ecosystems are severely impacted and an easy-to-use tool is needed for monitoring freshwater ecosystems. This study presents the development of a calibration and validation procedure for the Biological Monitoring Working Party Index using physical-chemical and biological data from Neotropical rivers in Mexico (Apatlaco and Chalma-Tembembe). Water quality and macroinvertebrates were monitored in four campaigns including the dry and rainy seasons (2012-2013). Calibration of the index was performed in the following steps: determination of a physicochemical quality index, identification of the abundance class for each family of macroinvertebrates, incorporation of abundances in the corresponding physicochemical quality index interval, and determination of bioindication values for each macroinvertebrate family. With the calibrated values, the index was assessed for each study site and period. The calibrated index was validated by a statistical test. Ranges for water quality categories were defined by three statistical procedures. The range of the Biological Monitoring Working Party Index was tested with study sites from adjacent sub-basins. The Chalma-Tembembe River in agricultural areas comprised the categories "Bad polluted" to "regular and moderately polluted," whereas the largest portion of the Apatlaco River in urban zones comprised "Bad, very polluted" to "Bad, extremely polluted." Thus, the calibrated index is a suitable biomonitoring tool, allowing the detection of zones that need urgent management and a recovery plan.

J	Tian, Y; Xu, YP; Ma, C; Wang, GQ				Tian, Ye; Xu, Yue-Ping; Ma, Chong; Wang, Guoqing			Modeling the Impact of Climate Change on Low Flows in Xiangjiang River Basin with Bayesian Averaging Method	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												This paper investigates the impact of climate change on low flows in Xiangjiang River Basin in central China. Projections from four global climate models (GCMs) under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 are used to drive the hydrological models. An ensemble prediction in the future period (2021-2050) from three competing hydrological models is generated using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. Though hydrological models do well in simulating daily discharges, all underestimate the observed low flows to some extent. Such underestimation of low flows could be compensated by application of the BMA method. Uncertainty from GCMs is a predominating source for monthly mean discharges. An increase in intensity of 7Q10, 7Q20, and 7Q30 is found under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for most cases. The increase of 7Q10, 7Q20, and 7Q30 could be more related to minimum monthly precipitation rather than the amount of monthly mean precipitation. The magnitude of the increase is smaller under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5, which could be explained by the higher temperature increase under RCP8.5. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Therefore, a complementary effect-based risk assessment by bioanalyses on mixtures of bioavailable micropollutants is proposed: the Smart Integrated Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy. The goal of this strategy is to obtain more reliable information on the water quality to select optimum measures for improvement. The SIMONI strategy is 2-tiered. Tier 1 is a bioanalytical hazard identification of sites. A tier 2 ecological risk assessment is carried out only at a limited number of sites where increased hazards are detected in tier 1. Tier 2 will be customized, based on tier 1 evaluation and additional knowledge of the aquatic system. The present study focuses on the tier 1 bioanalytical hazard identification to distinguish "hot spots" of chemical pollution. First, a selection was made of relevant and cost-effective bioanalytical endpoints to cover a wide spectrum of micropollutant modes of action. Specific endpoints may indicate which classes of chemicals might cause adverse effects. Second, effect-based trigger values (EBT) were derived for these bioassays to indicate potential ecological risks. Comparison of EBT with bioassay responses should discriminate sites exhibiting different chemical hazards. Third, a model was designed to estimate the overall risks for aquatic ecosystems. The associated follow-up for risk management is a "toxicity traffic light" system: green, low hazard (no action required); orange, potential risk (further research needed); and red, high risk (mitigation measures). Thanks to cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and relevance, the SIMONI strategy has the potential to become the first bioanalytical tool to be applied in regular water quality monitoring programs.

The first tier of the Smart Integrated Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy, which was described in part I, is based on the combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical measurements. Bioassay responses are compared with effect-based trigger values (EBT), and an overall SIMONI score on all bioassay data was designed to indicate environmental risks. The present study is focused on analyzing the feasibility of the hazard identification tier by evaluating results of 45 field campaigns at sites with different pollution profiles near the city of Amsterdam. A Daphnia assay was performed in situ, while silicon rubber or polar organic chemical integrative sampler (POCIS) extracts were tested with 4 nonspecific (daphnids, algae, bacteria, and cell culture) and 10 specific (9 Chemical Activated Luciferase Gene Expression [CALUX] assays and antibiotics scan) bioassays. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the relevance of 2 classification variables in the SIMONI score formula on all bioanalytical data. The model indicated increased risks for the ecosystem at surface waters in greenhouse areas and undiluted wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. The choice of testing specific bioassays on either polar or nonpolar passive sampling extracts is cost-effective and still provided meaningful insights on micropollutant risks. Statistical analyses revealed that the model provides a relevant overall impact assessment based on bioassay responses. Data analyses on the chemically determined mixture toxic pressure and bioanalytical methods provided similar insights in relative risk ranking of water bodies. The SIMONI combination of passive sampling and bioanalytical testing appears to be a feasible strategy to identify chemical hazards.

LENTIC, LOTIC, AND SULFATE-DEPENDENT WATERBORNE SELENIUM SCREENING GUIDELINES FOR FRESHWATER SYSTEMS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												There is consensus that fish are the most sensitive aquatic organisms to selenium(Se) and that Se concentrations in fish tissue are the most reliable indicators of potential toxicity. Differences in Se speciation, biological productivity, Se concentration, and parameters that affect Se bioavailability (e.g., sulfate) may influence the relationship between Se concentrations in water and fish tissue. It is desirable to identify environmentally protective waterborne Se guidelines that, if not exceeded, reduce the need to directly measure Se concentrations in fish tissue. Three factors that should currently be considered in developing waterborne Se screening guidelines are 1) differences between lotic and lentic sites, 2) the influence of exposure concentration on Se partitioning among compartments, and 3) the influence of sulfate on selenate bioavailability. Colocated data sets of Se concentrations in 1) water and particulates, 2) particulates and invertebrates, and 3) invertebrates and fish tissue were compiled; and a quantile regression approach was used to derive waterborne Se screening guidelines. Use of a regression-based approach for describing relationships in Se concentrations between compartments reduces uncertainty associated with selection of partitioning factors that are generally not constant over ranges of exposure concentrations. Waterborne Se screening guidelines of 6.5 and 3.0 mg/L for lotic and lentic water bodies were derived, and a sulfate-based waterborne Se guideline equation for selenate-dominated lotic waters was also developed.

Toxic trauma: Household water quality experiences predict posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms during the Flint, Michigan, water crisis	JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY												We examined the relationship between perceptions of household tap water quality and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms during the Flint, Michigan, water crisis in 2015-2016. The Speak to Your Health Community Survey is a community-based participatory component of the health surveillance system in Genesee County, Michigan. Perceptions of household tap water quality was added to the 2015-2016 survey wave after inadequate official response to concerns over water quality after a change in Flint's municipal water supply. Respondents (N = 786) also completed a brief PTSD screening tool. We examined the relationships of perceived household tap water quality to PTSD symptomatology and positive screening criteria for PTSD, controlling for sociodemographics. Perceived tap water quality predicted PTSD symptomatology and positive screening criteria for PTSD, independent of sociodemographics. The adverse mental health impact of municipal toxic contamination may generalize to other similar environmental contamination incidents.																	0090-4392	1520-6629				SEP	2017	45	7					957	962		10.1002/jcop.21898								WOS:000408493600009

A screening model for assessing water quality in small, dynamic estuaries	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Despite mounting evidence of the harm associated with excessive nutrient loading to estuaries, tools to translate this body of knowledge into sound environmental management and planning practices in data poor environments are lacking. In this paper, a design science approach is adopted to develop a screening (box) model for the water quality assessment of South African estuaries. The key design principles are first distilled from literature on the nutrient dynamics and hydro-morphological functioning of small, dynamic, bar-blocked estuaries. The proportional volume contribution of land-based flows (river inflows, diffuse inflows from the peri-catchment, point source discharges) is determined; a water quality class is allocated to each of the inflows, and the overall water quality class for the land-based inflows to an estuary is determined. Taking the percentage mouth closure and the perched nature of the estuaries into account, a WQ Similarity rating is allocated. This similarity rating reflects the degree of similarity of the water quality in the estuary to the reference (natural) water quality. The entire water quality assessment uses readily available information such as land-cover data, legal limits for disposal and water quality monitoring data where they exist, making it suitable for a data-poor environment. The screening model is calibrated and validated on a selection of South African estuaries for which official health condition assessments exist. Results are promising, and the screening model is deemed appropriate for assessing the water quality of individual estuaries and for comparing the sensitivity of multiple estuaries to changes in the volume and nutrient loading of land-based inflows. As such, the screening model can be employed at a regional or national scale for strategic assessments of water quality in small, dynamic estuaries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An assessment of water quality parameters and survival of indicator in pilgrimage place of Velankanni, Tamil Nadu, India	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Velankanni is anthropogenically highly vulnerable due to unregulated religious activities and intensive tourist density. The present study focuses on the impact of holy water bathing on water quality parameters and microbiological indicators. Water samples were collected at three different stations in a monthly interval starting before the onset of festival, during the festival and after festival season from August to October, 2013. The following indicators were analyzed: surface seawater temperature (30 -33 degrees C), hydrogen ion concentration (7.4-8.3), electrical conductivity (6.9-11.4 mS/cm), salinity (16.2 -37.0 ppt), total suspended solids (1080-2920 mg/l), total dissolved solids (20450-51880 mg/l), total solids (22650-53120 mg/l), dissolved oxygen (3.4-5.7 mg/l) and microbiological indicators (total heterotrophic bacteria (1-61 x 10(-3) cfu/ml), total coliform bacteria (1-57 x 10(-2) cfu/ml) and total Enterococcus bacteria (1-41 x 10(-2) cfu/ml). Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between season and water quality (p < 0.05). This study strongly supports the necessity to implement water quality monitoring, coastal management policy and regulation of ritual activities, including the prevention of the waterborne diseases. Implementing these ideas would increase coastal water quality and maintenance of the beauty of the beach, which in turn promotes pilgrimage and tourism activities thereby benefiting the local communities and improving the regional economy.

We focus on child health and offer the first spatially explicit analysis of the interaction between water source and food insecurity on children's health in Burkina Faso, an African nation that continues to struggle with poor children's health. We combine data from the 2010 Demographic and Health Survey, a small USAID water quality survey collected from community wells, and remotely sensed imagery. Results suggest that, in a few cases, reliable and clean water sources are positively correlated to children's linear growth and weight gain, although in many regions, the interaction with community-level food production is critical to understanding health outcomes. The results also suggest that maternal health and nutrition during pregnancy and breastfeeding are foundational to the healthy development of young children. In all, the findings provide evidence of the importance of multi-sectoral interventions targeted at improving children's health.																	0199-0039	1573-7810				SEP	2017	39	1					26	46		10.1007/s11111-017-0270-6								WOS:000408421800002

Staphylococcus aureus Strain Newman Photoinactivation and Cellular Response to Sunlight Exposure	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Sunlight influences microbial water quality of surface waters. Previous studies have investigated photoinactivation mechanisms and cellular photostress responses of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), including Escherichia coli and enterococci, but further work is needed to characterize photostress responses of bacterial pathogens. Here we investigate the photoinactivation of Staphylococcus aureus (strain Newman), a pigmented, waterborne pathogen of emerging concern. We measured photodecay using standard culture-based assays and cellular membrane integrity and investigated photostress response by measuring the relative number of mRNA transcripts of select oxidative stress, DNA repair, and metabolism genes. Photoinactivation experiments were performed in both oxic and anoxic systems to further investigate the role of oxygen-mediated and non-oxygen-mediated photoinactivation mechanisms. S. aureus lost culturability much faster in oxic systems than in anoxic systems, indicating an important role for oxygen in photodecay mechanisms. S. aureus cell membranes were damaged by sunlight exposure in anoxic systems but not in oxic systems, as measured by cell membrane permeability to propidium iodide. After sunlight exposure, S. aureus increased expression of a gene coding for methionine sulfoxide reductase after 12 h of sunlight exposure in the oxic system and after 6 h of sunlight exposure in the anoxic system, suggesting that methionine sulfoxide reductase is an important enzyme for defense against both oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent photostresses. This research highlights the importance of oxygen in bacterial photoinactivation in environmentally relevant systems and the complexity of the bacterial photostress response with respect to cell structure and transcriptional regulation. IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus is a pathogenic bacterium that causes gastrointestinal, respiratory, and skin infections. In severe cases, S. aureus infection can lead to life-threatening diseases, including pneumonia and sepsis. Cases of community-acquired S. aureus infection have been increasing in recent years, pointing to the importance of considering S. aureus transmission pathways outside the hospital environment. Associations have been observed between recreational water contact and staphylococcal skin infections, suggesting that recreational waters may be an important environmental transmission pathway for S. aureus. However, prediction of human health risk in recreational waters is hindered by incomplete knowledge of pathogen sources, fate, and transport in this environment. This study is an in-depth investigation of the inactivation of a representative strain of S. aureus by sunlight exposure, one of the most important factors controlling the fate of microbial contaminants in clear waters, which will improve our ability to predict water quality changes and human health risk in recreational waters.																	0099-2240	1098-5336				SEP	2017	83	17							UNSP e01052	10.1128/AEM.01052-17								WOS:000408259000021	28646114

Fate of water and nitrate using drainage water management on tile systems in east-central Illinois	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Drainage water management (DWM) is a potential edge-of-field technique that is being studied as a method to improve soil water management in agricultural fields, which may reduce nitrate losses to surface waters during the non-growing season. Inline water level control structures were installed on two adjacent tile systems draining a 34 ha field located in the Upper Salt Fork of the Vermillion River Watershed in central Illinois to evaluate DWM from 2011 through 2013. The overall objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of DWM in reducing nitrate losses from fields in a corn and soybean production system in east-central Illinois, as well as to investigate the fate of the retained water. A paired watershed approach was used to determine the impact of DWM on tile flow and nitrate load compared to a control treatment or free drainage (FD) tile system. The entire 34 ha field was under a corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation with continuous no-till. During 2011 and 2012, DWM was able to greatly reduce tile flow compared to the FD tile system. However, based on runoff and nitrate yields from the entire field, there was no measureable reduction in nitrate loss and shallow ground-water wells showed little area of influence in the field (similar to 2 ha). Water from the DWM tile system flowed laterally to the nearby FD tile system, increasing flow and nitrate loss from the FD system. In 2013, when both tiles were under DWM, water was retained and the water table level was increased in a larger area of the field (similar to 6 ha). However, at the end of the experiment when the control stoplogs were lowered the retained water was discharged through the tiles lines with little apparent reduction (10%) in overall water and nitrate loss for the year. Measurements of tile and well nitrate concentrations suggested that nitrate was not denitrified in the shallow groundwater of the field during the three-year study. Nitrate losses were directly proportional to tile flow each year of the study. Retrofitting DWM on an existing tile system was found to have a limited water quality benefit. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J	Asner, GP; Tupayachi, R				Asner, Gregory P.; Tupayachi, Raul			Accelerated losses of protected forests from gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Gold mining in Amazonia involves forest removal, soil excavation, and the use of liquid mercury, which together pose a major threat to biodiversity, water quality, forest carbon stocks, and human health. Within the global biodiversity hotspot ofMadre de Dios, Peru, gold mining has continued despite numerous 2012 government decrees and enforcement actions against it. Mining is now also thought to have entered federally protected areas, but the rates of miner encroachment are unknown. Here, we utilize high-resolution remote sensing to assess annual changes in gold mining extent from 1999 to 2016 throughout theMadre de Dios region, including the high-diversity Tambopata National Reserve and buffer zone. Regionally, gold mining-related losses of forest averaged 4437 ha yr(-1). A temporary downward inflection in the annual growth rate of mining-related forest loss following 2012 government action was followed by a near doubling of the deforestation rate from mining in 2013-2014. The total estimated area of gold mining throughout the region increased about 40% between 2012 and 2016, including in the Tambopata National Reserve. Our results reveal an urgent need for more socio-environmental effort and law enforcement action to combat illegal gold mining in the Peruvian Amazon.

This paper presents an analytical model aimed to predict the temporal evolution and spatial distribution in the far field of the suspended sediments concentration increase related to dredging activities or open water sediments disposal. In particular, whatever the dredging source strength and geometry can be considered to define the suspended sediments concentration leaving the immediate vicinity of the resuspension source. Indeed, a feature of the model is the removing of the hypotheses of continuous source and steady state, peculiar to the majority of available theoretical models. Hence, the proposed model is able to describe different dredging resuspension sources and to provide the temporal and spatial picture of the resulting plume. Of course, some hypotheses have to be assumed in order to make possible to achieve the analytical solution of the governing equation: the model is two dimensional in the horizontal plane; the ambient currents are assumed to be homogeneous in space and slowly time varying; the turbulent diffusion coefficients and flocculent settling velocity are homogeneous in space; the water depth is constant; the domain is infinite. Even with its limitations, the model is still able to provide a worst case preliminary assessment of sediments plume migration very useful to guide more detailed numerical analysis and to select the more appropriate simulation scenarios. The analytical model is detailed in order to be used for numerical model testing purposes. A series of practical applications is described through the paper (i) to catch the general features of the involved far field phenomena, (ii) to compare the model results to those of previous researches and (iii) to provide a series of benchmark cases useful for the testing of numerical models. The proposed model may be also used as a first rough prediction of the area affected by plume dispersion by considering different dredging scenarios (i.e. different equipment and operational techniques and forced by site-specific environmental conditions), and thus to provide a basis for more sophisticated modeling aimed to support dredging projects planning and management.

J	Hanlon, JW				Hanlon, Jeffrey W.			Complementary safeguards for robust regional watershed governance in a federation: New York City and its municipal water supply	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												In federations such as the United States, governments at various levels are experimenting with new watershed governance arrangements to protect water quality for both ecosystem health and human consumption. Such arrangements may bring previously uncooperative governments together to credibly commit to resource protection under the auspices of new and intricate formal institutions. Given the risks of cooperation, theory indicates that a robust arrangement will contain means of holding governing actors accountable to each other. This paper examines a purportedly successful case, the New York City watershed governance arrangement, to identify how safeguards against intergovernmental opportunism promote lasting cooperation. Using the qualitative method of process tracing, this paper finds that the New York City watershed governance arrangement uses structural, judicial, and popular safeguards against opportunistic behaviors by governing actors that might threaten the resource or the arrangement. The results indicate that such safeguards are present and interact with other safeguards and rule institutions at the state and federal level to maintain compliance.																	1462-9011	1873-6416				SEP	2017	75						47	55		10.1016/j.envsci.2017.04.014								WOS:000407869500006

Data from spiking studies quantifying the viral filtration performance of cellulosic filters are detailed, i.e., first, the virus reduction capacity of regenerated cellulose hollow fiber filters in the manufacturing process of blood products and, second, the efficiency of virus recovery/concentration from water samples by the viradel (virus adsorption-elution) method using charge modified, electropositive cellulosic filters or conventional electronegative cellulose ester microfilters. Viral analysis of field water samples by the viradel technique is also surveyed. This review then describes cellulose-based filter media used in individual protection equipment against airborne viral pathogens, presenting innovative filtration media with virucidal properties. Some pros and cons of cellulosic viral filters and perspectives for cellulose-based materials in viral filtration are underlined in the review.																	1569-1705	1572-9826				SEP	2017	16	3					455	489		10.1007/s11157-017-9434-1								WOS:000407961300004

Carbon and nitrogen environmental trade-offs of winter rye cellulosic biomass in the Chesapeake Watershed	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												Cellulosic biomass from winter crops can complement maize stover harvested from maize (Zea mays L.) - soy-bean (Glycine max L.) rotations. In this study, we assessed on-field environmental impacts related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) by modeling representative agro-ecological conditions prevalent in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. We used the biophysical model Cycles to simulate management scenarios for maize-soybean cropping systems that included winter rye (Secale cereale L.). The model was used to quantify changes in N losses via nitrate leaching (NO3), emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3), changes in soil organic carbon, and carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per megajoule (CO2eq MJ(-1)). Including winter rye in the rotation reduced NO3 leaching over a winter fallow control (77% on average), even when the winter rye was fertilized and regardless of whether stover, winter rye, or both cellulosic feedstocks were harvested. Applying fertilizer to winter rye did however increase NO3 leaching as well as NH3 and N2O emissions. Model results consistently showed fertilizing the winter rye improved both biomass yield and soil C levels compared to unfertilized winter rye, regardless of location, soil, fertilizer type or stover harvest. While it is difficult to simultaneously reduce agricultural nitrogen losses, produce renewable energy and increase soil carbon, results can guide management of these trade-offs while tapping into an abundant energy resource and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Fraction of young water as an indicator of aquifer vulnerability along two regional flow paths in the Mississippi embayment aquifer system, southeastern USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Wells along two regional flow paths were sampled to characterize changes in water quality and the vulnerability to contamination of the Memphis aquifer across a range of hydrologic and land-use conditions in the southeastern United States. The flow paths begin in the aquifer outcrop area and end at public supply wells in the confined parts of the aquifer at Memphis, Tennessee. Age-date tracer (e.g. SF6, H-3, C-14) data indicate that a component of young water is present in the aquifer at most locations along both flow paths, which is consistent with previous studies at Memphis that documented leakage of shallow water into the Memphis aquifer locally where the overlying confining unit is thin or absent. Mixtures of young and old water were most prevalent where long-term pumping for public supply has lowered groundwater levels and induced downward movement of young water. The occurrence of nitrate, chloride and synthetic organic compounds was correlated to the fraction of young water along the flow paths. Oxic conditions persisted for 10 km or more down dip of the confining unit, and the presence of young water in confined parts of the aquifer suggest that contaminants such as nitrate-N have the potential for transport. Long-term monitoring data for one of the flow-path wells screened in the confined part of the aquifer suggest that the vulnerability of the aquifer as indicated by the fraction of young water is increasing over time.

J	Jurado, A; Vazquez-Sune, E; Pujades, E				Jurado, Anna; Vazquez-Sune, Enric; Pujades, Estanislao			Potential uses of pumped urban groundwater: a case study in Sant AdriA del Bess (Spain)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Urban groundwater has often been over-exploited for industrial uses. Now, this usage tends to be reduced or the resource abandoned due to pollution and/or changes in land use. The use and the subsequent disuse of groundwater has resulted in rising water tables that damage underground structures (e.g., building basements and underground car parks and tunnels), leading to the need for additional pumping in urban areas. In the case of the underground parking lot of Sant AdriA del Bess (Barcelona, NE Spain), large amounts of urban groundwater are pumped to avoid seepage problems. Can this pumped groundwater be used for other purposes (e.g., drinking water and urban irrigation) instead of wasting this valuable resource? To answer this question, it was necessary to quantify the groundwater recharge and to assess the evolution of groundwater quality. The limiting factor at this study site is the groundwater quality because ammonium and some metals (iron and manganese) are present at high concentrations. Hence, further treatment would be needed to meet drinking water requirements. The pumped groundwater could also be used for supplementing river flow for ecological benefit and/or for mitigating seawater intrusion problems. Currently, only a small amount of this urban groundwater is used for cleaning public areas and watering public gardens. This situation highlighted the urgent need to manage this resource in a responsible and more efficient manner, especially in moments of high water demand such as drought periods.

Inventory of managed aquifer recharge sites in Europe: historical development, current situation and perspectives	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Different types of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) schemes are widely distributed and applied on various scales and for various purposes in the European countries, but a systematic categorization and compilation of data has been missing up to now. The European MAR catalogue presented herein contains various key parameters collected from the available literature. The catalogue includes 224 currently active MAR sites found in 23 European countries. Large quantities of drinking water are produced by MAR sites in Hungary, Slovakia, the Netherlands, Germany, Finland, Poland, Switzerland and France. This inventory highlights that, for over a century, MAR has played an important role in the development of European water supply and contributes to drinking-water production substantially. This development has occurred autonomously, with "trial-and-error" within the full range of climatically and hydrogeologically diverse conditions of the European countries. For the future, MAR has the potential to facilitate optimal (re)use and storage of available water resources and to take advantage of the natural purification and low energy requirements during MAR operations. Particularly with respect to the re-use of wastewater treatment-plant effluent and stormwater, which is currently underdeveloped, the use of MAR can support the public acceptance of such water-resource efficient schemes. Particularly for the highly productive and urbanized coastal zones, where the pressure on freshwater supplies increases by growing water demand, salinization and increased agricultural needs for food production (such as along the Mediterranean and North Sea coasts), MAR is expected to be increasingly relied on in Europe.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2017	25	6					1909	1922		10.1007/s10040-017-1554-8								WOS:000407923900025

Hydrologic Performance of Regenerative Stormwater Conveyance in the North Carolina Coastal Plain	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Regenerative stormwater conveyance (RSC) is an open channel, sand-filtering system composed of a series of shallow aquatic pools, riffle weirs, native vegetation, and underlying media beds. Surface runoff entering an RSC is conveyed as nonerosive surface flow or subsurface seep through the media, and exits the system as surface flow, seep out, exfiltration into parent soil, or evapotranspiration (ET). Regenerative stormwater conveyances are expected to perform similar to other sand-media-based low-impact development (LID) stormwater control measures (SCMs), but the hydrological and water quality efficiencies of RSC have not been sufficiently validated in a variety of hydrogeological conditions to date. A RSC was installed in the coastal plain of North Carolina, receiving runoff from 5.2 ha. Surface flow was reduced substantially through the RSC, with 84% of inflow converted to a shallow interflow-like seep, referred to in this paper as seep out. High groundwater levels resulted in small overall exfiltration rates, but increased evaporation rates due to extended ponding. The conversion of surface runoff to seep out has significant implications for stormwater mitigation, releasing filtered water at slower rates than conventional conveyance channels, similar to undeveloped watersheds. The Brunswick RSC released similar fraction of seep out to that of shallow interflow observed in undeveloped watersheds.

Correcting Systematic Underprediction of Biochemical Oxygen Demand in Support Vector Regression	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a variable that is missing or inaccurate in many water quality data sets because of difficulties in diluting highly polluted water samples. Machine learning algorithms, particularly support vector regression (SVR), are useful to build regression models to fill gaps in these data sets. The SVR can underpredict extreme-high values when they are few in number and underrepresented. This paper evaluates two methods, bootstrapping and data expansion, to mitigate the problem by increasing the proportion of extreme-high BOD in the data set before training the gap-filling model. Both methods were tested on the water quality data of Yuen Long Creek, Hong Kong, for the years 2000-2014. Both methods were effective in mitigating systematic underprediction and reducing their residual errors when the proportion of extreme-high values in the data set were increased from 3 to 30-40%. Both methods were useful for gap filling on BOD time series because extreme-high values are often the ones missing or inaccurate when highly polluted samples are diluted.

Evaluation of Bioretention Cell Performance Seven Years Postconstruction	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Bioretention cells (BRCs) are stormwater control measures that integrate water quantity and quality management. Previous research primarily focused on the performance of cells less than two years old, before potential clogging and sorption site saturation. To assess long-term effectiveness, this project evaluated the performance of a BRC after seven years to determine reductions in flow rate, flow volume, suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). These observations were compared with analyses conducted immediately postconstruction. Inflow and outflow water samples were collected for sediment, nutrients, and FIB. Soil media samples were collected from multiple depths and analyzed for denitrifying bacteria. Results indicate the BRC remains effective at reducing storm flows, nutrients, and FIB. These reductions were correlated to outflow volume, rather than storm characteristics. The majority of denitrifying bacteria were present in the top media layers, despite the presence of an internal water storage layer for denitrification. This finding suggests denitrification primarily occurs at anoxic microsites in the upper layers and that a lack of carbon at deeper depths may limit significant microbial growth.

J	Haider, H; Al-Salamah, IS; Ghumman, AR				Haider, Husnain; Al-Salamah, Ibrahim Saleh; Ghumman, Abdul Razzaq			Development of Groundwater Quality Index Using Fuzzy-Based Multicriteria Analysis for Buraydah, Qassim, Saudi Arabia	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Saudi Arabia is currently facing serious challenges related to both the quality and quantity of its limited groundwater sources. Deep confined aquifers are being contaminated due to presence of naturally occurring minerals and radionuclides in soil and rocks, while the shallow aquifers have been affected due to anthropogenic activities. Generally, groundwater is extracted through several wells having varying concentrations of pollutants with consequential impacts on the performance of treatment processes, human health, and the natural environment. Assessing each parameter individually for raw and treated water all the time is a time-consuming and tedious job for decision-makers. In this research, a framework is developed for groundwater quality assessment based on aggregated water quality indices. Fuzzy set theory is applied to address the uncertainties associated with limited observations, measurement errors, and vagueness in expert opinion. Fuzzy analytical hierarchical process is used to establish the weighting scheme while the fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution has been employed for aggregation. The framework has been implemented on groundwater extracted for the city of Buraydah (Qassim) to evaluate its pragmatism. Twenty-four groundwater wells are ranked on the basis of their water quality; subsequently an overall index is developed to linguistically (i.e., very low, low, medium, high, very high) define the groundwater quality in the well field. The proposed hierarchical-based framework may include additional parameters and can be used to evaluate the performance of different treatment processes in future depending on data availability.																	2193-567X	2191-4281				SEP	2017	42	9					4033	4051		10.1007/s13369-017-2578-z								WOS:000407901600028

Water quality in forest and village ponds in Burkina Faso (western Africa)	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Forest ecosystems help conserve the quality of water resources in aquatic habitats. The conservation of biological diversity in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems remains a communal concern. Aquatic ecosystems and resources are vulnerable but can be preserved and protected by forests. In sub-Saharan regions of Africa, water from ecosystems such as ponds still play important role in the livelihood of local populations. Water from temporary ponds is used by local populations for multiple needs; however, in this part of the world, the population is increasing, thus increasing human needs and activities and land use in the region. Land-use changes lead to deforestation, land degradation and the decline in freshwater, affecting human health and well-being. Forest degradation leads to the decline in ecosystem goods and services, particularly those related to watersheds. This study conducted in eastern Burkina Faso aimed to assess water quality of temporary ponds in protected forest areas (reserves) and surrounding villages. It was conducted in 61 temporary ponds where physical, chemical and biological variables were measured, such as water surface area, depth, transparency, macrophyte cover, pH, dissolved O-2, conductivity, nutrient concentrations and algae biomass. The results showed that at p < 5%, water surface area (p = 0.02), depth (p = 0.00), nutrient content (p = 0.00), and algae biomass (p = 0.04) were significantly higher outside reserves than inside reserves. In contrast, macrophyte cover (mean cover percentages 53 vs. 44.5%) and water transparency (p = 0.02) were higher inside reserves. The variations in conductivity and pH were not significant. All trends showed the influences of human activities on water characteristics and the role forests and land cover had in preventing negative human impacts and disturbance of temporary ponds. Forests and land cover are important to water quality conservation and algae biomass regulation in temporary ponds. Protecting and managing forests is therefore an essential part of future strategies for limiting algal blooms and their negative consequences, maintaining water quality and providing clean water to citizens.																	1007-662X	1993-0607				SEP	2017	28	5					1039	1048		10.1007/s11676-017-0369-8								WOS:000408011700018

The investigated post-mining lakes were very young compared to glacial lakes and represent early stages of ecosystem succession. Despite their different ages and morphometries, they are all mesotrophic and have good water quality. They have not been supplied with phosphorus and nitrogen, which can cause excessive development of pelagic phytoplankton; as a result, they share low chlorophyll a (Chl a) content, low phytoplankton biomass, and relatively high water transparency. Low abundance and species richness of zooplankton indicate low trophic levels in all of the lakes. Chl a in Lakes Przykona and Bogdaw were within the range typical of mesotrophic lakes, while Lake Janiszew had very low Chl a, typical of an oligotrophic water body. The low N:P ratios (4-6), especially in summer, indicates nitrogen limitation of primary production. There is a risk that such a proportion of the major biogenic elements could lead to harmful cyanobacterial blooms. The lake basins were formed using quaternary deposits (sand, clay) at their bottoms; as a result, the lakes had a slightly alkaline pH (> 8), which favors the development of aquatic organisms. Optimum depth helps establish lake stratification and ensures ecological stability. This applies to post-mining lakes as well; an optimum depth should be determined to ensure the development of thermal stratification, which affects lake processes.

Environmental Escherichia coli: ecology and public health implicationsa review	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Escherichia coli is classified as a rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacterium in the family Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterium mainly inhabits the lower intestinal tract of warm-blooded animals, including humans, and is often discharged into the environment through faeces or wastewater effluent. The presence of E.coli in environmental waters has long been considered as an indicator of recent faecal pollution. However, numerous recent studies have reported that some specific strains of E.coli can survive for long periods of time, and potentially reproduce, in extraintestinal environments. This indicates that E.coli can be integrated into indigenous microbial communities in the environment. This naturalization phenomenon calls into question the reliability of E.coli as a faecal indicator bacterium (FIB). Recently, many studies reported that E.coli populations in the environment are affected by ambient environmental conditions affecting their long-term survival. Large-scale studies of population genetics revealed the diversity and complexity of E.coli strains in various environments, which are affected by multiple environmental factors. This review examines the current knowledge on the ecology of E.coli strains in various environments with regard to its role as a FIB and as a naturalized member of indigenous microbial communities. Special emphasis is given on the growth ofpathogenic E.coli in the environment, and the population genetics of environmental members of the genus Escherichia. The impact of environmental E.coli on water quality and public health is also discussed.																	1364-5072	1365-2672				SEP	2017	123	3					570	581		10.1111/jam.13468								WOS:000407808100001	28383815

Environmental Characteristics Associated with Settlement of Reintroduced Chinese Giant Salamanders	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Captive breeding and reintroduction have been increasingly used to restore endangered amphibians worldwide. Knowing habitat requirements for targeted species will help to enhance post release settlement and contribute to the success of reintroduction projects. To collect critical information on habitat requirements of the poorly documented Chinese Giant Salamanders (Andrias davidianus), we reintroduced 31 juveniles at two streams in central China and monitored them through radio telemetry from May 2013 to September 2014. We recorded 14 environmental variables twice a month (except during winter) at salamander locations and random locations. We also conducted transects systematically along streams to collect data on environmental variables and prey species. Habitat selection by salamanders was examined at two spatial scales: home-range scale and stream-reach scale. At the home-range scale, water quality variables were not different between salamander locations and random locations, although salamanders were found in deeper water, used larger boulders, and were closer to boulders. Regression models confirmed that presence of salamanders was positively associated with boulder size, river depth, and canopy cover but negatively associated with distance to boulders. At the stream-reach level, only the average water velocity was lower within home ranges than out of home ranges; however, no difference was found between core home ranges and out of home ranges. These results showed that large boulders were the most important variable selected by salamanders. Plenty of large boulders in the streams, together with evidences of postrelease growth of salamanders, indicate the two streams likely are providing suitable habitat for salamanders.																	0022-1511	1937-2418				SEP	2017	51	3					417	424		10.1670/16-106								WOS:000407503000016

Modeling of Water Resources Allocation and Water Quality Management for Supporting Regional Sustainability under Uncertainty in an Arid Region	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												In this study, a scenario-based interval-stochastic fraticle optimization with Laplace criterion (SISFL) method is developed for sustainable water resources allocation and water quality management (WAQM) under multiple uncertainties. SISFL can tackle uncertainties presented as interval parameters and probability distributions; meanwhile, it can also quantify artificial fuzziness such as risk-averse attitude in a decision-making issue. Besides, it can reflect random scenario occurrence under the supposition of no data available. The developed method is applied to a real case of water resources allocation and water quality management in the Kaidu-kongque River Basin, where encounter serve water deficit and water quality degradation simultaneously in Northwest China. Results of water allocation pattern, pollution mitigation scheme, and system benefit under various scenarios are analyzed. The tradeoff between economic activity and water-environment protection with interval necessity levels and Laplace criterions can support policymakers generating an effective and robust manner associated with risk control for WAQM under multiple uncertainties. These discoveries avail local policymakers gain insight into the capacity planning of water-environment to satisfy the basin's integrity of socio-economic development and eco-environmental sustainability.

They are useful, but understanding on LID practices and broadening the LID applications among practitioners is another important task. The main purpose of this study is to understand local professionals' perceptions on different LID techniques and awareness on their benefits, while also gathering opinions on barriers and incentives. An online survey was delivered to 91 recipients, a diverse pool of stakeholders involved in the Energy Corridor District (ECD) area in Houston, Texas. The majority of the respondents answered that they were familiar with LID. The techniques that have been applied to a larger extent are Detention Ponds and Bioswales. When asked about applying techniques in the future, Retention Ponds, Rain Gardens, Bioswales, and Detention Ponds are highly probable items. Decision-makers identified the major barriers as being the lack of incentives for their application, lack of knowledge of the client, and lack of knowledge of the development team. Education programs would be the most successful incentive, followed by financial incentives and innovations in policy systems. Urban planners have the most expertise in LID practices, followed by architects/landscape architects, while developers were found not to be very familiar with the concepts. This study understands the current and practical opinions about LID from the decision-makers. Different groups understand the importance of education and identified a major barrier as the lack of policy instruments. Some innovation in regulations may elevate proper LID practices.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2017	31	12					3795	3808		10.1007/s11269-017-1707-5								WOS:000407831200007

In addition, the modified universal soil loss equation (MUSLE) uses a constant K-factor which cannot address seasonal variation in soil erodibility caused by freeze-thaw cycles in cold regions. The current study presents a simple method to incorporate detailed landuse and management inputs in SWAT. The method delineates HRUs based on field boundaries and associates each HRU with a particular field. As a result, long-term detailed records can be incorporated into the SWAT management files. In addition, the existing MUSLE in SWAT was modified by introducing a variable K-factor to address effects of freeze-thaw cycles on soil erosion for cold regions. This modified version of SWAT was calibrated and validated for an agricultural micro-watershed, i.e., Black Brook Watershed in New Brunswick, Canada. The results showed that, compared with the standard HRU-delineation method, field-based HRU-delineation method was able to improve landuse and management practice input accuracy for SWAT and save time and effort for long-term simulation, and provide high resolution outputs in the watershed. As a result, the field-based HRU-delineation method can facilitate decision making not only at the subbasin scale but also at the field scale. In addition, results showed that sediment loading simulation accuracy was improved with the modified-MUSLE compared with the original-MUSLE.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2017	31	12					3953	3974		10.1007/s11269-017-1718-2								WOS:000407831200016

Seasonal and animal farm size influences on in-stream phosphorus transport in an agricultural watershed	NUTRIENT CYCLING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS												Excess phosphorus (P) is generally responsible for the eutrophication of Midwestern surface waters and causes algal blooms, fish kills, and other detrimental ecological effects. In-stream transport of dissolved and particulate P (PP), under both stormflow and baseflow conditions, was studied in an agricultural Wisconsin watershed with diverse sizes of animal farm operations. Trends in P losses were compared both on an individual event and seasonal (spring, summer, fall) basis. In-stream P transport was characterized by high PP losses in the spring during periods of relatively little crop cover and high dissolved P losses in the fall, when surface coverage was still present. The majority of P (64-71%) was transported in the spring season during periods of high flow. Presence of high animal density at lower portions of the watershed resulted in increasing downstream P concentration and load (i.e., concentration dilution effects with increasing drainage area were absent).

Microbial communities are major components of riverine ecosystems and mediate the processes of nutrients and organic matter produced by treated and untreated WWTP effluent. To date, the impacts of WWTP effluent discharge on riverine microbial communities remain poorly understood. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and water quality analysis, we investigated the microbial community compositions and predicted functions in the effluents of five municipal WWTPs and their receiving rivers. The results showed that the microbial compositions in the five WWTP effluents with different treatment processes were similar. Significant differences in the microbial community were not noted between the effluent, upstream, and downstream sites for both sampling months. However, dissimilarity of microbial composition between two sampling periods was observed. The temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and ammonium were major environmental factors associated with microbial community changes. Functional annotations of microbial communities based on 16S amplicons identified xenobiotic degradation and metabolism functions in effluent and river samples. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed the dominance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) over ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in the WWTP effluents and rivers, and significant positive correlation between AOB abundance and nitrate concentration was observed. These findings will help increase our understanding of the impact of effluent discharge on urban river ecosystems.

Effect of inoculation of the cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp on tilapia biofloc culture	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												Cyanophytes are the most ancient photosynthetic organisms. During its evolution, they have developed various ecophysiological adaptation strategies to survive in extreme conditions. The environment prevailing under biofloc cultures provides various conditions appropriate for cyanobacterial proliferation. An outdoor experiment (7weeks) was performed with a simple random design consisting of four inoculation levels (by triplicate) of Oscillatoria sp. (0.0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1mgL(-1)) in saltwater biofloc. The objective was to evaluate the effect of the cyanobacteria inoculation on water quality and tilapia production parameters. The results indicated that the amount of Oscillatoria sp. inoculated significantly affected water quality (pH, chlorophyll a, TSS and NO3-N) and tilapia parameters (final weight, feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate and survival). No significant effects on dissolved oxygen, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) or NO2-N were observed. We recommend identifying the cyanobacteria species that are able to grow in a biofloc system and their possible adverse effects on the system.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				SEP	2017	48	9					4725	4734		10.1111/are.13294								WOS:000407278400012

Thirty postlarvae of freshwater prawn with an initial average weight of 0.13 +/- 0.05g were randomly stocked in six experimental units with 0.20m(2) and volume of 50L. The experiment lasted thirty days. Dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH were monitored daily; ammonia concentration was determined three times per week; nitrite concentration, alkalinity and hardness were measured weekly. For the formation of microbial floc, molasses was used to keep the ammonia concentrations within safe levels for prawn farming. The variables of water quality remained within the suitable range for the production of the species, except for ammonia concentrations at the F treatment, which exceeded the safe levels. At the end of the experiment, the following parameters were evaluated: survival, specific growth rate, weight gain and feed conversion rate. Differences were found only in feed conversion rate with better values on RAS treatment. The microorganisms present in the RAS and F treatment were also evaluated. The densities of rotifers, amoebas and total bacteria were higher at the F treatment although the same organisms were found at the RAS treatment. The results of this study showed the possibility of rearing M. rosenbergii in biofloc system technology.

Five treatments were tested. One treatment with non-supplementation of microbial products served as control (C). In the other four treatments, Novozymes Pond Protect (NO), Bio-Form BZT-Water Reform (WR), Bacillus natto (BN) and Effective Microbes (EM) were added at the intervals of two weeks, respectively. Mussel yield declined in the tanks with supplementation of the microbial products. No significant differences were found in fish yield and chemical water quality among the treatments except total nitrogen (TN) was higher in tanks EM than in tanks C. Biomass of phytoplankton and Cyanophyta was higher in tanks NO, WR, BN and EM than in tanks C. Supplementation of the microbial products resulted in change in bacterial community in which Actinobacteria, Chlorobi, Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria dominated. Bacterial community in the tanks was significantly affected by TN, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand and Cyanophyta biomass. This study reveals that the function of these microbial products as probiotics is limited in H. cumingii farming.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				SEP	2017	48	9					4897	4909		10.1111/are.13309								WOS:000407278400027

Our hypothesis was that the ecological attributes of the rotifer community were different when considering the influence of fish aquaculture activities. We identified 28 species, with 10 species from the Brachionidae family. The average density and diversity index of rotifers were higher in reservoir stations, with mean values in the ponds approximately 50% lower than those of the reservoir. The microphagous species dominated during all the time, while the raptorial species were accidental in all studied environments. The ponds were represented by four significant indicator species: Brachionus caudatus, B.leydigi, Dicranophoroides caudatus and Testudinella patina and the reservoir by three: B.falcatus, B.havanaensis and Conochilus dossuarius. In general, nine species were significantly associated with some categories of environmental conditions, such as high or low turbidity and low values of conductivity and TDS. Four of the five best bioindicator species belonged to the microphagous genus Brachionus. B.havanaensis indicated five environmental conditions (IndVal>93.1%), and it appeared to be a key species in this Neotropical semiarid reservoir influenced by aquaculture activities. The dominance of microphagous rotifers suggests a functional redundancy of species in the studied environments. We found that these systems and their management affected the planktonic rotifer community in this region of Brazil by increasing the species richness.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				SEP	2017	48	9					4910	4922		10.1111/are.13310								WOS:000407278400028

The recirculating treatment system consisted of a settling cell, a biofilter tank, a bivalve tank and gravel beds. The toxic pollutants, threatening the growth of bivalves, were reduced by the settling cell and the biofilter tank, so that the polyculture of shrimp and bivalves could be achieved. The living bivalve tank could function well as a remover of remaining small suspended solids (SS), and other pollutants. As the SS was reduced to a very low level by bivalve tank before the water flowing into the gravel beds, the risk of clogging was prevented. The studies suggested that the system maintained high removal efficiencies of SS, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and nitrite nitrogen (NO2--N) and could contribute to the increase in shrimp yield.

Study of phytohormone profile and oxidative metabolism as key process to identification of salinity response in tomato commercial genotypes	JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												Climatic change, intensive agriculture, and worsening water quality induce abiotic stress conditions for plants. Among these factors, salinity stress is a limit factor for plant growth. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the phytohormones role and oxidative metabolism in response to salt stress of two genotypes of tomato cv. Grand Brix and cv. Marmande RAF, the crops were carried out in a growth chamber. Salinity stress reduces biomass and relative growth rate (RGR) in both genotypes, this effect being greater in cv. Marmande RAF. These results, together with main stress indicator response, the O-2(-), indicate that cv. Marmande RAF is more sensitive to Saline stress. Grand Brix showed less oxidative stress, because it presented greater detoxification of the O-2(.-), due to SOD enzyme activity induction and greater antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, Grand Brix has a better hormonal profile adapted to salt stress resistance, the accumulation of IAA, GA4 and CKs and their beneficial role against oxidative stress could make the difference between resistance and sensitivity to salt stress. On the other hand, a lower ACC concentration, ethylene precursor, combined with a greater O-2(.-) detoxification in the cv. Grand Brix could play a fundamental role in tolerance to saline stress. Besides, an increase in ABA levels promotes better stomatal closure, better photosynthesis control and a lower rate of water loss. This data could be essential to select plants with greater resistance to saline stress.

This lake supplies approximately four million people with drinking water and has undergone strong re-oligotrophication over the past decades. We calculated depth-specific annual oxygen depletion rates (ODRs) during the period of stratification and found that 50% of the observed variability in ODR was already explained by a simple separation into a sediment- and volume-related oxygen consumption. Adding a linear factor for water depth further improved the model indicating that oxygen depletion increased substantially along the depth. Two other factors turned out to significantly influence ODR: total phosphorus as a proxy for the lake's trophic state and mean oxygen concentration in the respective depth layer. Our analysis points to the importance of nutrient reductions as effective management measures to improve and protect the oxygen status of such large and deep lakes.

This study analyzed the general hydrochemical characteristics of the lake water to determine the spatiotemporal variability of contaminants and to assess the potential health risk associated with the surface water. Lake water was monitored at three stations each month throughout 2013. Samples were analyzed for pH, total dissolved solids, temperature, EC, major ions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42-, Cl-, HCO3 (-), and CO3 (2-)), ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), fluoride (F-), phenol, and heavy metals (As, Hg, and Cr6+). The results suggest that Na+ is the dominant cation in the lake water, and Cl- and SO4 (2-) are the dominant anions, resulting in a primary water type of Cl center dot SO4-Na. Contaminant levels (NH4-N, F-, As, Hg, Cr6+, and phenol) vary through time and space (spatiotemporal variations). As and F- are high in the summer season; Cr6+ and Hg do not significantly change over the year; and the NH4-N and phenol concentrations also remain relatively stable. Concentrations of all these substances are within the acceptable limits for recreational water use (1.5, 1.5, 0.1, 0.001, 0.05, and 0.01 mg/L for NH4-N, F-, As, Hg, Cr6+, and phenol, respectively). An assessment model recommended by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the P.R. China was used in the study to conduct the health risk assessment. While workers do experience higher non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks than tourists, the risks are low and negligible. As and Cr6+ contribute the most to total carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks.

Effects of landuse intensification on stream basal resources and invertebrate communities	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Human population growth and development have degraded freshwater ecosystems through direct negative effects on basal resources and higher trophic levels. Knowledge of how basal resources are influenced by anthropogenic activities is needed to examine foodweb responses and to evaluate negative effects of human disturbance. We combined quantitative sampling of all putative resources and consumers and naturally occurring stable isotopes of resource C and N to investigate how land use influences characteristics of basal resources (leaf litter, fine particulate organic matter [FPOM] suspended in water, FPOM deposited in pools, and epilithon) and the invertebrate communities in 9 streams of British Columbia (Canada) on a seasonal basis. Study streams were grouped as forest, cropland, and urban, based on percentages of land use in their catchments. We tested for seasonal and spatial differences in biomass, isotopic variability, and overlap of different basal resources and their relationships with invertebrate communities. Our results show that landuse intensification promotes wholesale degradation, which includes deterioration of water quality, changes to the quantity and quality of basal resources, and shifts in community structure of benthic invertebrates. Stream basal resources showed large variations in isotopic signatures caused by landuse changes, with the largest isotopic variability observed in cropland streams and the smallest in urban streams. Invertebrate communities had fewer taxa and reduced functional diversity in impaired streams (i.e., cropland and urban) via simplification of feeding styles of consumers, probably because of bottom-up controls. Our study highlights the importance of quantifying the isotopic variability of basal resources to estimate effects on food webs over time and along landuse intensification gradients.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2017	36	3					609	625		10.1086/693457								WOS:000407373600013

Assessing the expansion of wadeable benthic macroinvertebrate collection methods in large semiwadeable rivers	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Benthic macroinvertebrates are used commonly as water-quality indicators in wadeable streams and rivers. However, increased depth and overall complexity of large rivers may cause inaccessibility or unacceptable index and metric variability when attempting a single wadeable method. Significant increases in sampling effort and time expenditure have been recommended to compensate for the increased variability when assessing large rivers. However, the transition between wadeable streams and nonwadeable rivers is not well defined, especially for free-flowing systems. We evaluated the utility of a modified wadeable-stream collection method for sampling large and complex semiwadeable rivers. Our results suggest that water-quality measurements across the width of a river can be used to identify influences of multiple water sources. This spatial information and a single-habitat (e.g., riffle-run) approach could be used with a modest increase in sampling effort to reduce metric variability and provide important source-tracking information. These supplementary data and a grasp of the complex ecological processes that exist in large rivers are essential for recognizing why biological communities differ among sites and for using macroinvertebrates to assess large river systems.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2017	36	3					683	691		10.1086/692942								WOS:000407373600018

However, a shift in land use from cotton to perennial grasses and a change in land management such as the harvesting of mesquite for biofuel production can significantly affect regional hydrology and water quality. In this study, APEX and SWAT models were integrated to assess the impacts of replacing cotton with Alamo switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) and Miscanthus x giganteus in the upstream subwatershed and harvesting mesquite in the downstream subwatershed on water and nitrogen balances in the Double Mountain Fork Brazos watershed in the SHP and TRP regions. Simulated average (1994-2009) annual surface runoff from the baseline cotton areas decreased significantly (P < 0.05) by 88%, and percolation increased by 28% under the perennial grasses scenario compared to the baseline cotton scenario. The soil water content enhanced significantly under the irrigated switchgrass scenario compared to the baseline irrigated cotton scenario from January to April and August to October. However, the soil water content was depleted significantly under the dryland Miscanthus scenario from April to July relative to the baseline dryland cotton scenario. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and organic-N loads in surface runoff and NO3-N leaching to groundwater reduced significantly by 86%, 98%, and 100%, respectively, under the perennial grasses scenario. Similarly, surface runoff, and NO3-N and organic-N loads through surface runoff reduced significantly by 98.9%, 99.9%, and 99.5%, respectively, under the post-mesquite-harvest scenario. Perennial grasses exhibited superior ethanol production potential compared to mesquite. However, mesquite is an appropriate supplementary bioenergy source in the TRP region because of its standing biomass and rapid regrowth characteristics.

This emphasis on participatory governance has produced significant attention to the importance of "environmental awareness" as a precondition of participation in environmental governance. This article analyzes the connected discourses surrounding environmental awareness and participation in Indian water-quality policy, focusing on North India's Ganges River. Drawing on evidence from policy documents and interviews with government officials and other key informants, it argues that the emphasis on environmental awareness as a precondition of participation has allowed the state to effectively forestall participation, to approach awareness raising as a consensus-building activity, and to effectively rollback the regulation of polluting industries. Moreover, conditional participation has increased opportunities for state agencies to control the conditions and terms of "awareness," contributing to the effacement of alternative environmental knowledges.																	1070-4965	1552-5465				SEP	2017	26	3					272	296		10.1177/1070496517697768								WOS:000407600800002

The developed paradigm was called the catastrophe theory-based DI (CDI) model. The proposed model was applied to assess groundwater vulnerability to pollution index (GVPI) in Perak Province, Malaysia. The area vulnerability index was modeled by considering the DRASTIC multiple vulnerability causative factors (VCFs) obtained from different data sources. The weights and ranking of the VCFs were computed by using the inner fuzzy membership mechanism of the CDI model. The estimated vulnerability index values of the CDI model were processed in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to produce a catastrophe theory-DRASTIC groundwater vulnerability to pollution index (CDGVPI) map, which demarcated the area into five vulnerability zones. The produced CDGVPI map was validated by applying the water quality status-vulnerability zone relationship (WVR) approach and the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve method. The performance of the developed CDI model was compared with that of the standard DI model. The validation results of the WVR approach exhibits 89.29% prediction accuracy for the CDI model compared with 75% for the DI model. Meanwhile, the ROC validation results for the CDI and DI models are 88.8% and 78%, respectively. The GIS-based CDI model demonstrated better performance than the DI model. The GVPI maps produced in this study can be used for precise decision making process in environmental planning and groundwater management.

The effect of water contamination and host-related factors on ectoparasite load in an insectivorous bat	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												We examined the effects of sex, age, and reproductive state of the insectivorous bat Pipistrellus kuhlii on the abundance and prevalence of arthropod ectoparasites (Macronyssidae and Cimicidae) in habitats with either sewage-polluted or natural bodies of water, in the Negev Desert, Israel. We chose water pollution as an environmental factor because of the importance of water availability in desert environments, particularly for P. kuhlii, which needs to drink on a daily basis. We predicted that parasite infestation rates would be affected by both environment and demographic cohort of the host. We found that female bats in the polluted site harbored significantly more mites than female bats in the natural site and that juveniles in the polluted site harbored significantly more cimicid individuals than juveniles in the natural site. We further found that age and sex (host-related factors) affected ectoparasite prevalence and intensity (i.e., the abundance of parasites) in the polluted site. Our results may suggest that the interaction between host-related and environment-related factors affected parasite infestations, with females and young bats being more susceptible to ectoparasites when foraging over polluted water. This effect may be particularly important for bats that must drink or forage above water for other wildlife that depend on drinking water for survival.

Palaeoecological records of coral community development on a turbid, nearshore reef complex: baselines for assessing ecological change	CORAL REEFS												Understanding past coral community development and reef growth is crucial for placing contemporary ecological and environmental change within appropriate reef-building timescales. On Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR), coral reefs situated within coastal inner-shelf zones are a particular priority. This is due to their close proximity to river point sources, and therefore susceptibility to reduced water quality discharged from coastal catchments, many of which have been modified following European settlement (ca. 1850 AD). However, the extent of water quality decline and its impacts on the GBR's inner-shelf reefs remain contentious. In this study, palaeoecological coral assemblage records were developed for five proximal coral reefs situated within a nearshore turbid-zone reef complex on the central GBR. A total of 29 genera of Scleractinia were identified from the palaeoecological inventory of the reef complex, with key contributions to reef-building made by Acropora, Montipora, and Turbinaria. Discrete intervals pre- and post-dating European settlement, but associated with equivalent water depths, were identified using Bayesian age depth modelling, enabling investigation of competing ideas of the main drivers of nearshore coral assemblage change. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that changes in the composition of nearshore coral assemblages are: (1) intrinsically driven and linked to vertical reef development towards sea level, and (2) the result of changes in water quality associated with coastal river catchment modification. Our records found no discernible evidence of change in the generic composition of coral assemblages relative to European settlement. Instead, two distinctive depth-stratified assemblages were identified. This study demonstrates the robust nature of nearshore coral communities under reported water-quality decline and provides a useful context for the monitoring and assessment of ecological change on reefs located within the most nearshore turbid zone environments of the central GBR.

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of land use and land cover and river discharge on water quality in the Migina catchment, southern Rwanda. Rainfall, discharge and water quality (total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, and temperature) were measured in different periods from May 2009 to June 2013. In 2011, measurements were done at the outlets of 3 sub-catchments (Munyazi, Mukura and Akagera). Between May 2012 and May 2013 the measurements were done in 16 reaches of Munyazi dominated by rice, vegetables, grass/forest or ponds/reservoirs. Water quality was also measured during two rainfall events. Results showed seasonal trends in water quality associated with high water flows and farming activities. Across all sites, the total suspended solids related positively to discharge, increasing 2-8 times during high flow periods. Conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH decreased with increasing discharge, while total nitrogen and total phosphorus did not show a clear pattern. The total suspended solids concentrations were consistently higher downstream of reaches dominated by rice and vegetable farming. For total nitrogen and total phosphorus results were mixed, but suggesting higher concentration of total nitrogen and total phosphorus during the dry and early rainy (and farming) season, and then wash out during the rainy season, with subsequent dilution at the end of the rains. Rice and vegetable farming generate the transport of sediment as opposed to ponds/reservoir and grass/forest.

During the summers of 2012-2014, we collected and analyzed surface-water samples for water-quality indicators, including fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli, nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon), suspended sediment concentration, pharmaceuticals, and hormones. Samples were collected upstream and downstream from different types of visitor use at weekly to biweekly intervals and during summer storms. We conducted a park-wide synoptic sampling campaign during summer 2014, and sampled upstream and downstream from meadows to evaluate the mitigating effect of meadows on water quality. At pack stock stream crossings, Escherichia coli concentrations were greater downstream from crossings than upstream (median downstream increase in Escherichia coli of three colony forming units 100 mL(-1)), with the greatest increases occurring during storms (median downstream increase in Escherichia coli of 32 CFU 100 mL(-1)). At backpacker use sites, hormones, and pharmaceuticals (e.g., insect repellent) were detected at downstream sites, and Escherichia coli concentrations were greater at downstream sites (median downstream increase in Escherichia coli of 1 CFU 100 mL(-1)). Differences in water quality downstream vs. upstream from meadows grazed by pack stock were not detectable for most water-quality indicators, however, Escherichia coli concentrations decreased downstream, suggesting entrapment and die-off of fecal indicator bacteria in meadows. Our results indicate that under current-use levels pack stock trail use and backpacker use are associated with detectable, but relatively minor, effects on water quality, which are most pronounced during storms.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				SEP	2017	60	3					526	543		10.1007/s00267-017-0899-z								WOS:000406954700013	28597051

This is one of the water quality problems associated with high nutrient loads, such as those found in the Kinokawa River, with drains the southwestern part of the Kii peninsula in Japan. Water quality monitoring data showed that 2-MIB tended to increase when total phosphorus (TP) concentration exceeded 0.02 mg/L. This study employed mass load and river water quality analyses coupled with water runoff analyses to examine ways of mitigating TP load in river water. In this study, it was revealed following things. (1) TP mass load could be reduced by approximately half if the industrial drainage volume standards defined in the Water Pollution Control Law were more stringent. (2) TP concentration could be decreased by 41% in response to TP mass load reduction and by 5% in response to an increase in river flow rate. (3) TP mass load reduction combined with an increase in river flow rate could reduce TP concentration to less than 0.015 mg/L and prevent increases in 2-MIB in tap water.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				SEP	2017	13	37					141	148		10.21660//2017.37.2735								WOS:000406909600023

JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS												When states incompletely monitor or enforce, environmental nonprofits step in. We estimate the impact of these groups on industrial compliance with the Clean Water Act, as well as their effect on government monitoring and enforcement. We geographically link annual panel data on facility inspection rates, pollution violations, and enforcement actions with information about nearby nonprofit watershed groups. In addition to two-stage least squares estimation for endogenous efforts of nonprofits, governments, and firms, we implement a recent advance in nonlinear methods with improved fit for our fractional dependent variables. As the number of nonprofit groups increase, government decreases inspections and firms have fewer severe effluent violations. The nonprofits' oversight substitutes for government efforts by interacting directly with facilities rather than putting pressure on regulatory mechanisms. The interventions by these environmeVntal groups encourage compliance and, based on theory, improve efficiency.																	2333-5955	2333-5963				SEP	2017	4		2	1			S261	S288		10.1086/692508								WOS:000407121400008

Shifting paradigms in restoration of the world's coral reefs	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Many ecosystems around the world are rapidly deteriorating due to both local and global pressures, and perhaps none so precipitously as coral reefs. Management of coral reefs through maintenance (e.g., marine-protected areas, catchment management to improve water quality), restoration, as well as global and national governmental agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., the 2015 Paris Agreement) is critical for the persistence of coral reefs. Despite these initiatives, the health and abundance of corals reefs are rapidly declining and other solutions will soon be required. We have recently discussed options for using assisted evolution (i.e., selective breeding, assisted gene flow, conditioning or epigenetic programming, and the manipulation of the coral microbiome) as a means to enhance environmental stress tolerance of corals and the success of coral reef restoration efforts. The 2014-2016 global coral bleaching event has sharpened the focus on such interventionist approaches. We highlight the necessity for consideration of alternative (e.g., hybrid) ecosystem states, discuss traits of resilient corals and coral reef ecosystems, and propose a decision tree for incorporating assisted evolution into restoration initiatives to enhance climate resilience of coral reefs.

Multiple stressors threaten the imperiled coastal foundation species eelgrass (Zostera marina) in Chesapeake Bay, USA	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Interactions among global change stressors and their effects at large scales are often proposed, but seldom evaluated. This situation is primarily due to lack of comprehensive, sufficiently long-term, and spatially extensive datasets. Seagrasses, which provide nursery habitat, improve water quality, and constitute a globally important carbon sink, are among the most vulnerable habitats on the planet. Here, we unite 31 years of high-resolution aerial monitoring and water quality data to elucidate the patterns and drivers of eelgrass (Zostera marina) abundance in Chesapeake Bay, USA, one of the largest and most valuable estuaries in the world, with an unparalleled history of regulatory efforts. We show that eelgrass area has declined 29% in total since 1991, with wide-ranging and severe ecological and economic consequences. We go on to identify an interaction between decreasing water clarity and warming temperatures as the primary drivers of this trend. Declining clarity has gradually reduced eelgrass cover the past two decades, primarily in deeper beds where light is already limiting. In shallow beds, however, reduced visibility exacerbates the physiological stress of acute warming, leading to recent instances of decline approaching 80%. While degraded water quality has long been known to influence underwater grasses worldwide, we demonstrate a clear and rapidly emerging interaction with climate change. We highlight the urgent need to integrate a broader perspective into local water quality management, in the Chesapeake Bay and in the many other coastal systems facing similar stressors.

Comparative column testing of three reactive mixtures for the bio-chemical treatment of iron-rich acid mine drainage	MINERALS ENGINEERING												Optimization of the hydraulic properties of reactive mixtures in passive systems can improve treatment efficiency of iron-rich acid mine drainage (Fe-rich AMD). The use of highly permeable and porous substrates could limit clogging and flow-related issues. The efficiency and evolution of hydraulic conductivity (kat) of three reactive mixtures - two types of dispersed alkaline substrate (DAS), composed of wood ash (50% v/v - WA50) or calcite (20% v/v - C20), and one mixture consisting mainly of organic matter (70% w/w), typically used in passive biochemical reactors (PBRs) - were tested in 1.5 L columns. The reactors were operated with hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 1 to 5 d over a period of 16-63 days. In the WA-DAS reactors, results showed that a minimum HRT of 2 d was required to remove 33-62% of Fe in AMD with 2500 mg/L Fe. The calcite-DAS showed limited Fe removal (< 10%) in AMD at > 1500 mg/L Fe, but was around 40% at < 1500 mg/L Fe, over a 7-day period, at 2 d of HRT. Slight increase of the PBRs efficiency was found (77% and 91%), at initial Fe concentration of 500 mg/L, when the HRT was doubled (from 2.5 d to 5 d). All reactors removed other metals (37-99.9% for Al, Zn, and Pb; 20-98% for Ni, except in C20) and SO42- (5-37%). Evolution of the hydraulic parameters of all reactors showed insignificant variation of the initial porosity of 0.68-0.74 and k(sat) around 10(-2) cm/s, indicating no evidence of clogging throughout the testing period, even at 5 d of HRT. Nonetheless, Fe removal was HRT-dependent. Therefore, water quality, especially Fe concentration, should be among the design criteria for a long-term satisfactory treatment of Fe-rich AMD.																	0892-6875					SEP	2017	111						79	89		10.1016/j.mineng.2017.06.002								WOS:000406729800008

Airborne measurements may fill the gap, yet they are often hindered by the high cost and difficulty in deployment. Here we demonstrate the capacity of a low-cost, low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in assessing an intense phytoplankton (Phaeocystis globosa) bloom (chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 73 to 45.6 mg/m(3)) in Weitou Bay in the western Taiwan Strait. The UAV was equipped with a hyperspectral sensor to measure the water color with a footprint of 5 mat every 30 m distance along the flight track. A novel approach was developed to obtain remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from the UAV at-sensor radiometric measurements. Compared with concurrent and co-located field measured R-rs (14 stations in total), the UAV-derived R-rs showed reasonable agreement with root mean square difference ranging 0.0028-0.0043 sr(-1) (relative difference similar to 20-32%) of such turbid waters for the six MODIS bands (412-667 nm). The magnitude of the bloom was further evaluated from the UAV-derived R-rs. For the bloom waters, the estimated surface chlorophyll a concentration (Chl) ranged 6-98 mg/m(3), which is 3-50 times of the Chl under normal conditions. This effort demonstrates for the first time a successful retrieval of both water color (i.e., R-rs) and Chl in a nearshore environment from UAV hyperspectral measurements, which advocates the use of UAVs for rapid assessment of water quality, especially for nearshore or difficult-to-reach waters, due to its flexibility, low cost, high spatial resolution, and sound accuracy.

J	Rodrigues, T; Alcantara, E; Watanabe, F; Imai, N				Rodrigues, Thanan; Alcantara, Enner; Watanabe, Fernanda; Imai, Nilton			Retrieval of Secchi disk depth from a reservoir using a semi-analytical scheme	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The mechanistic model reported in Lee et al. (2015) estimating the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) was applied to an oligo- to mesotrophic reservoir in Brazil. The model was originally validated with data covering lake, oceanic, and coastal waters; however, the model used the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) designed for optically deep waters as input and was applied to oceanic and coastal waters to derive absorption [a] and backscattering [b(b)] coefficients. The hypothesis is that the use of QAA(v5) (http://www.ioccg.org/groups/Software_OCA/QAA_v5.pdf) to estimate both a and b(b) (step M1) to retrieve K-d (step M2) and Z(SD) (step M3) will lead to errors caused by M1 preventing an accurate estimate in oligo- to mesotrophic water. To test this hypothesis, data collected in three field trips were used to apply the mechanistic model based on the spectral bands from OLI/Landsat-8, (often applied to oceanic and coastal waters), and multispectral instrument (MSI)/Sentinel-2 bands (applied to QAA designed for very turbid inland water). The impact of step M1 over steps M2 and M3 was analyzed by the error analysis. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for K-d using QAA(v5) ranged between 1035% and 19.76%, while the error using QAA(M14) varied between 12.68% and 28.29%. Regarding the errors of step M3 and applying QAA 5, the total root-mean-square difference (RMSD) varied from 055 to 1.18 m and MAPE ranged between 12.86% and 31.17%, while the RMSD ranged between 0.70 and 1.50 m and MAPE varied from 1433% to 39.13% when using QAA(M14). However, the result from QAA(v5) showed a better correlation with in situ data, although underestimating K-d and Z(SD). Therefore, a modified version of QAA(v5) (QAA(R17)) was evaluated. The results showed an improvement of K-d (MAPE ranging between 8.89% to 18.76%) and Z(SD) (RMSD ranging between 032 and 0.90 m and MAPE ranging between 8.65 and 19.75%), bringing the values close to the 1:1 line. The largest error was observed for the data of the second field trip, where the bio-optical properties showed a horizontal gradient along the reservoir. In addition, the magnitude of the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) also varied depending on the water quality. Thus, with respect to Z(SD) mapping, this research showed that environments with a high variability in R-rs can limit the accurate estimation of inherent optical properties (IOPs) based on QAA(v5). Therefore, the limiting step of the model was attributed to M1, which means that the mechanistic model from Lee et al. (2015) can be considered an universal approach if M1 is modified based on the type of water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Al-Khafaji, MS; Abdulraheem, ZA				Al-Khafaji, Mahmoud Saleh; Abdulraheem, Zahraa Abdulhussain			A Deterministic Algorithm for Determination of Optimal Water Quality Monitoring Stations	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Water quality monitoring networks are usually designed according to statistical approaches and general criteria without a consistent or logical deterministic design strategy. In this research, a deterministic approach for allocating the most sensitive water quality monitoring stations was proposed. This approach was applied on the western part of the Al-Hammar Marsh. Two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality simulation models were used to estimate the distribution of total dissolved solids (TDS) within the marsh for all of the expected conditions. Subsequently, the spatial distribution of the variance of TDS was computed based on the results of these models and performed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) database layer. The standard acceptable TDS variation limits of +/- 5%, land-use map, land-cover map and other main selection criteria of the monitoring stations were set as constraints via GIS database layers. These layers were integrally applied to the variance layer to obtain the locations of the most sensitive monitoring stations. It was concluded that, the most representative monitoring network consists of 46 stations. This number can be reduced to 37 and 29 stations by increasing the acceptable TDS variation limits to +/- 10% and 15%, respectively. The developed approach can be used with limited data. Moreover, it can be applied to rivers, lakes or wetlands, considering all of the related constraints. In addition, the GIS database can be easily updated and analysed. These features are not available in other methods such as the Sanders method, multiple criteria decision making and dynamic programming approach.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2017	31	11					3575	3592		10.1007/s11269-017-1686-6								WOS:000406652400019

Comparison of Computer Models for Estimating Hydrology and Water Quality in an Agricultural Watershed	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Various computer models, ranging from simple to complex, have been developed to simulate hydrology and water quality from field to watershed scales. However, many users are uncertain about which model to choose when estimating water quantity and quality conditions in a watershed. This study compared hydrologic/water quality models including Spreadsheet Tool for the Estimation of Pollutant Load (STEPL)-Purdue, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), High Impact Targeting (HIT), Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment (L-THIA), Pollutant Load (PLOAD), Spatially and Temporally Distributed Model for Phosphorus Management (STEM-P), Region 5, and ensemble modeling (using STEPL-Purdue, SWAT, L-THIA, PLOAD, and STEM-P). Model capabilities, inputs, and underlying methods to estimate streamflow, surface runoff, baseflow, nutrients, and sediment were examined. Uncalibrated, calibrated, and validated outputs of these models and uncalibrated ensemble modeling in estimating water quantity and quality for a 41.5 km(2) agricultural watershed in Northeastern Indiana were explored, and suggestions were provided on the selection and use of models. Models need to be selected carefully based on the simulation objectives, data availability, model characteristics, time constraints, and project budgets.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				SEP	2017	31	11					3641	3665		10.1007/s11269-017-1691-9								WOS:000406652400023

However, the nutrient and sediment reduction efficiencies of these novel designs are virtually unknown, and the possibility of increasing riverine flow in the Chesapeake Bay watershed associated with climate change this century necessitates an evaluation of their performance to develop and utilize those that optimize reductions in nutrient and sediment fluxes. We compare pre- and post-construction loads (total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS)) from RSCs (i.e., upland BMPs) and a SWC (i.e., stream restoration) constructed at the outflow of a highly developed watershed in the Coastal Plain physiographic province of Maryland. The largest of the two RSCs performed best in relation to expected nutrient and sediment reductions because of superior water retention capability. By the length of river reach restored, the SWC attained from 79 to 88% of its N reduction TMDL goal, but only 19 to 23 and 2.7 to 3.1% for TP and TSS, respectively; by watershed area, % attainments of TMDL goals were much lower. Results indicate that SWCs have the potential to curtail N loading from developed catchments, but additional water quality benefits may be limited. Climate change projections indicate that there will be an increased frequency of larger-volume storms that will result in an increase in stormflow runoff from urban areas, and increased pollutant loads will likely curtail potential gains made by efforts to achieve TMDL goals. Given the large-scale implementation of BMPs currently underway to accommodate the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, the restoration community needs to adopt a concerted strategy of building climate resilience into many types of urban BMPs to help attain and maintain loads at TMDL levels in anticipation of a progressively wetter climate throughout this century.																	1559-2723	1559-2731				SEP	2017	40	5					1227	1246		10.1007/s12237-017-0226-1								WOS:000406333700002

Developing a regional diatom index for assessment and monitoring of freshwater streams in sub-tropical Australia	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The use of borrowed indices to assess stream health has limitations and research suggests a need to develop more reliable regionally based indices that are sensitive to the relationship between taxa and environmental conditions. Implementing this is challenging in the Southern Hemisphere given the scarcity of diatom indices, specifically in sub-tropical areas. The purpose of this study was to develop a regionally based diatom index to assess freshwater lotic systems in sub-tropical eastern Australia and compare the results with borrowed indices to derive meaningful inferences on river health. A total of 119 epilithic diatom and water samples were collected during 2014-2015 from the Richmond River Catchment in Northern NSW Australia. Statistical analysis indicated that total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were strong variables influencing the data set and subsequently TP was chosen as a nutrient proxy for the index. Analysis of diatoms resulted in TP sensitivity values (1-5) being assigned to 105 species with relative abundance of > 1% in the data set. These species were used to calculate the Richmond River Diatom Index (RRDI) for 45 sites within the Catchment. The index effectively scored sites along the environmental gradient with sites in the upper catchment generally scoring lower (healthier) than the mid and lower catchment sites. The index compared positively with both the Diatom Species Index for Australian Rivers (DSIAR) (r = 0.76) and the Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) (r = 0.65). Further research is suggested to test the RRDI on independent sites in neighbouring catchments and develop class boundaries from the RRDI so that the index can be readily used by water managers to assess and monitor freshwater systems in sub-tropical Australia.

After water retention, the potential ecological risk of metal contamination in the riparian soils of the Miyun Reservoir (MYR) to water quality has raised public concern. The remobilization characteristics of cobalt (Co) in MYR riparian soils are still unknown. Riparian soil samples (considering five different land use types and three vertical elevations) were collected from the MYR prior to water impoundment. Total Co concentrations, soil properties, total Co in soil solution, Co chemical fractions and labile Co measured by diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) are applied to investigate the Co remobilization characteristics. The results showed that the total concentrations of Co (C-total-Co) were approximately equal to background values of Co in Beijing and China at most of the sites. The highest values of C-total-Co were observed at 140 m and 145 m in recreational land (S3), which may be influenced by the anthropogenic activities. No obvious differences in C-total-Co and DGT-labile Co (C-DGT-Co) were found with the variation of land use types and vertical elevations in the soils of the MYR. C-DGT-Co made up 9%-52% of the total dissolved Co, with an average value of 25%, indicating that Co in the soil solution was partially sustained by the solid phase. The highest C-DGT-Co were observed in grassland and mountain land, indicating that the previous intensive mining in the upstream areas of the MYR is responsible for the release of Co. The results of the sequential extraction showed that Co is mainly bound to the residual fraction. DGT-labile Co had no correlation with non-residual fractions measured by sequential extraction, but had a significantly positive relationship with C-DGT-Mn, indicating that Co trapped by DGT mainly came from the dissolution of MnOx. When the MYR riparian soils are submerged, a reducing environment will be formed. In this case, Co associated with MnOx may be also released into the water.

J	Windle, J; Rolfe, J; Pascoe, S				Windle, Jill; Rolfe, John; Pascoe, Sean			Assessing recreational benefits as an economic indicator for an industrial harbour report card	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Industrial harbours are a complex interface between environmental, economic and social systems. Trying to manage the social and economic needs of the community while maintaining the integrity of environmental ecosystems is complicated, as is the identification and evaluation of the various factors that underpin the drivers of economic, community and resource condition. An increasingly popular strategy to deal with the identification and evaluation challenges in complex human-environmental systems is to use a report card system which can be used as a summary assessment tool to monitor the health of aquatic ecosystems. To date though these have largely focused on environmental factors, and it is only very recently that attempts are being made to include social, cultural and economic indicators. There has been limited consensus in the selection of social and economic indicators applied in different aquatic report cards but as recreation is such an important activity, typically some measure of recreation benefit is included. However, there has been no commonality in the measures applied to assess its performance as an economic indicator. This paper is focused on the assessment of recreational benefits as an indicator of economic value in the report card for Gladstone Harbour in Queensland, Australia. It is the first aquatic health report card to include an assessment of the nonmarket value of recreation which makes it a more comprehensive indicator of economic value compared to other report cards based on measures of employment, participation or expenditure. There have now been three consecutive years of reporting (2014-2016) of the Gladstone Harbour report card, and the results indicate that the recreation index appears to be effective in monitoring changes over time.

Nutrient concentrations in tidal creeks as indicators of the water quality role of mangrove wetlands in Southwest Florida	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Coastal mangroves have the potential to improve the water quality of urban and rural runoff before it is discharged into adjacent coastal bays and oceans; but they also can be impaired by excessive pollutants from upstream. Nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen), salinity, and other water quality parameters were measured in five mangrove tidal creeks in different hydrogeomorphic and urbanization settings during high and low tides over a calendar year of wet (June and August 2015) and dry (February and April 2016) seasons in the Greater Naples Bay area in Southwest Florida, USA. Nutrient concentrations (ave. +/- error) in the tidal creeks were 0.055 +/- 0.008 mg-P/L for total phosphorus (TP) and 0.610 +/- 0.020 mg-N/L for total nitrogen (TN), with an average N:P ratio of 11.4:1. Average wet season TP (0.075 +/- 0.010 mg-P/L) was significantly higher than the dry season TP (0.033 +/- 0.003 mg-P/L; p < 0.01, f = 15.17, f(crit) = 3.89) and the average wet season TN (0.75 +/- 0.03 mg-N/L) was significantly higher than dry season TN (0.52 +/- 0.02 mg/L; p < 0.01, f = 64.14, f(crit) = 3.89), suggesting that urban stormwater runoff is directly or indirectly affecting the nutrient conditions in these mangroves. Significant differences in nutrient concentrations between low tide and high tide were not found for either TP (p = 0.43, f =.63, f(crit) = 3.88) or TN (p = 0.20, f = 1.66, f(crit) = 3.89). These differences were confirmed by a PCA and cluster analyses, which found differences to be seasonal. We could not conclude from these results whether these five mangrove wetlands were sources nor sinks of nutrients based simply on the measurement of nutrient concentrations. But we illustrated that nutrient concentrations were indicators of the mangroves' hydrogeomorphic settings, their tidal fluxes from Naples Bay, and the Bay's upstream watersheds, and less by direct urban runoff.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2017	80						316	326		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.05.043								WOS:000406436100033						
J	Bell, CD; Tague, CL; McMillan, SK				Bell, Colin D.; Tague, Christina L.; McMillan, Sara K.			A model of hydrology and water quality for stormwater control measures	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Stormwater control measures (SCMs) are a management strategy that can reduce runoff and nitrogen (N) export from urban watersheds by creating an ecosystem that stores water and promotes N retention and removal. This work develops and explores a computer model that simulates the dynamic hydrologic and water quality processes of SCMs. Data from an SCM in Charlotte, NC was used for model calibration and validation. The hydrologic routines successfully simulated distributions of observed storm event outflow volumes and duration without calibration. Through calibration, the model reproduced observed distributions of event mean concentrations of both nitrate and ammonium in SCM outflow. Model sensitivity to varied air temperature, inflow N concentrations, and inflow volumes was determined. Scenario testing showed that deeper SCMs have greater inorganic N removal efficiencies because they have more stored volume of relatively N-deplete water, and therefore have a greater capacity to dilute relatively N-rich inflow.

J	Kotalik, CJ; Clements, WH; Cadmus, P				Kotalik, Christopher J.; Clements, William H.; Cadmus, Pete			Effects of magnesium chloride road deicer on montane stream benthic communities	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Montane streams often intercept and run parallel to roads and highways where road deicer is seasonally applied for snow and ice removal. This research used stream mesocosms to evaluate the effects of MgCl2 road deicer to a Rocky Mountain stream benthic community in Colorado, USA. Measured responses included macroinvertebrate drift, community composition metrics, and macroinvertebrate biomass after a 10-day exposure. Natural benthic communities were exposed to concentrations of liquid MgCl2 road deicer that bracketed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) surface water chronic chloride 'aquatic life criteria' (230 mg Cl-/l). Results showed no effects on macroinvertebrate drift, but significant reductions in abundance, taxa richness, and community biomass. Specifically, stonefly (Plecoptera) and mayfly (Ephemeroptera) abundance decreased at Cl- concentrations below the U.S. EPA chronic chloride water quality standard, and at concentrations substantially lower than those generated from traditional laboratory toxicity tests. However, caddisflies (Trichoptera), midges (Chironomidae) and other dipterans were tolerant to all MgCl2 treatments. We conclude that MgCl2 road deicer has the potential to impair montane stream benthic communities at relatively low ionic concentrations, and regulatory agencies should manage for and establish regionally appropriate application rates for this stressor.

J	Tammelin, M; Kauppila, T; Viitasalo, M				Tammelin, Mira; Kauppila, Tommi; Viitasalo, Matias			Factors controlling recent diatom assemblages across a steep local nutrient gradient in central-eastern Finland	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Iisalmi Route, a chain of lakes in central-eastern Finland, is more eutrophic than its surroundings. We used multivariate analyses to study the influence of selected environmental factors (water quality, basin characteristics, and subcatchment surficial geology) on the recent diatom assemblages across this steep local nutrient gradient. In addition to the spatial analysis of surface sediment diatom assemblages from 51 sampling sites (48 lakes), temporal changes in the total phosphorus (TP) concentrations of one Iisalmi Route lake (Lake Kirmanjarvi) were analyzed using weighted averaging partial least squares regression and 27 fossil diatom samples. Both TP and electrical conductivity (EC) showed statistically significant independent signals in the modern diatom data. The TP gradient was related to till grain size variation suggesting that geological factors affect the spatial TP variation directly or indirectly through differences in land use. Based on the temporal study, the direct effect of geology is most likely behind the steep nutrient gradient in the area because Lake Kirmanjarvi was found to be naturally eutrophic. EC, on the other hand, seems related to anthropogenic disturbance. Our study highlights the importance of taking the local geology into account when assessing past or present water quality or planning for lake management.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2017	799	1					309	325		10.1007/s10750-017-3229-9								WOS:000405720000021						
J	Wohl, E				Wohl, Ellen			The significance of small streams	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE					Water and Environmental Sustainability Symposium	OCT 20, 2015	Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA		Tsinghua Univ			Headwaters, defined here as first- and second-order streams, make up 70%-80% of the total channel length of river networks. These small streams exert a critical influence on downstream portions of the river network by: retaining or transmitting sediment and nutrients; providing habitat and refuge for diverse aquatic and riparian organisms; creating migration corridors; and governing connectivity at the watershed-scale. The upstream-most extent of the channel network and the longitudinal continuity and lateral extent of headwaters can be difficult to delineate, however, and people are less likely to recognize the importance of headwaters relative to other portions of a river network. Consequently, headwaters commonly lack the legal protections accorded to other portions of a river network and are more likely to be significantly altered or completely obliterated by land use.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				SEP	2017	11	3			SI		447	456		10.1007/s11707-017-0647-y								WOS:000405707000002

According to German and European legislation, hygienic monitoring is not mandatory for such water bodies which are neither drinking water sources nor categorized as bathing waters. Consequently, relatively little is known about the occurrence of-potentially pathogenic-bacteria and viruses in Germany's streams and rivers. The Holtemme was selected for a case study because it is relatively well monitored for both chemical water quality and aquatic ecology, but not for hygiene. Originating in the mountains of Harz Nature Park, the 47 km long Holtemme is characterized by a strong longitudinal gradient in chemical water quality, which is related to different land uses and the influx of treated wastewater from two urban areas (Wernigerode and Halberstadt). Waste water loads received by the Holtemme are comparatively high when compared to similarly small streams. In 2015, total coliform concentrations between more than 200 and 77,010 bacteria per 100 mL, and fecal coliform concentrations between 5 and 24,060 bacteria per 100 mL were observed in the Holtemme's main channel. The highest concentrations were typically found below the outlets of the two wastewater treatment plants. The treated wastewater contained total and fecal coliform concentrations of up to 200,500 and 83,100 per 100 mL, respectively; however, there were significant temporal variations. While the observed concentrations are unproblematic from a legal perspective (because no maximum permissible limits are defined for streams in Germany), they would exceed the tolerable limits for bathing waters in the EU, indicating moderate to critical pollution limits.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				SEP	2017	11	3			SI		544	553		10.1007/s11707-017-0648-x								WOS:000405707000010						
J	Cousins, JJ				Cousins, Joshua J.			Structuring Hydrosocial Relations in Urban Water Governance	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS												This article concentrates on how hydro-social relations are differentially structured across technical experts engaged within diverse and multiple networks of institutional and bureaucratic practice and the implications this has for more inclusive forms of environmental governance and decision-making. I empirically focus on stormwater governance in Chicago and Los Angeles as a means to capture the range of geographical and institutional variations in environmental knowledge. Both cities face considerably different water resource challenges in the United States but are at the forefront of developing comprehensive and progressive urban water governance programs. In the article, I identify four visions of hydrosocial relations: hydro-reformist, hydro-managerial, hydro-rationalist, and hydro-pragmatist. Each of these represents a particular understanding of how hydrosocial relations should proceed. They all align around shared framings of integrated management and the utilization of the best available science and technology to drive decision-making. Consensus, however, masks fundamental differences among the varying groups of expertise. Differences center on the perceived effectiveness of different types of infrastructural interventions, of market and economic incentives, and the role of new institutions and rules to govern stormwater. I argue that each frame looks to structure hydrosocial relations to fit their own vision but consequently offer apolitical strategies that reduce water quality and quantity problems to their technical and hydrological components. ??????????, ???????????????????????????, ?????????, ??????????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????????????????????, ??????????????????????????????, ?????????????: ???????????????????????, ??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????, ????????????????, ?????????, ??????????????, ?????????????????????? La atencion se orienta en este articulo a establecer como se estructuran diferencialmente las relaciones hidro-sociales entre diferentes expertos tecnicos involucrados dentro de diversas y multiples redes de practica institucional y burocratica, y a ver las implicaciones que esto tiene para formas mas abiertas de gobernanza ambiental y toma de decisiones. Empiricamente, me enfoco en la gobernanza del agua lluvia en Chicago y Los angeles como medio de captar el ambito de variaciones geograficas e institucionales en el conocimiento ambiental. En lo que concierne a los recursos hidricos, las dos ciudades enfrentan en los Estados Unidos retos considerablemente diferentes, pero estan en la vanguardia del desarrollo de programas urbanos amplios y progresistas sobre gobernanza del agua. En el articulo, identifico cuatro visiones de relaciones hidro-sociales: hidro-reformistas, hidro-gerenciales, hidro-racionalistas e hidro-pragmaticas. Cada uno de estos tipos de visiones representa un entendimiento particular sobre como deben proceder las relaciones hidro-sociales. Todas ellas estan alineadas alrededor de marcos compartidos de manejo integrado y de la utilizacion de la mejor ciencia y tecnologia disponible que oriente la toma de decisiones. El consenso, sin embargo, esconde diferencias fundamentales entre los variados grupos de experticia. Las diferencias se centran en la efectividad percibida de los diferentes tipos de intervenciones infraestructurales, de los incentivos de mercado y economicos, y del papel que tienen las nuevas instituciones y reglas para gobernar el agua lluvia. Sostengo que cada marco busca estructurar las relaciones hidro-sociales de acuerdo con su propia vision, pero consecuentemente ofrece estrategias apoliticas que reducen los problemas de calidad y cantidad del agua a sus componentes tecnicos e hidrologicos.

Hydrogeochemical characteristics of a volcanic-sedimentary aquifer with special emphasis on Fe and Mn content: A case study in Mexico	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												Previous studies performed on the volcanic-sedimentary aquifer of the Tenancingo Valley (Mexico) reports high concentrations of Fe, Mn, and NO3-, and water from several wells receives purification treatments due to presence of Fe and Mn. These studies have not achieved conclusive results regarding the origin of Fe and Mn, nor have hydrogeochemical evaluations of the aquifer been performed. The present study aimed to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of the water and identify the geochemical processes that determine presence of Fe and Mn in groundwater. This characterization was based on physicochemical data from well and spring samples (16 samples) during dry and rainy seasons (June and November 2012, respectively). The EC, temperature and pH ranged from 125 to 793 mu S cm(-1), 14.5 to 24.9 degrees C and 6.5 to 8.5 pH units, respectively. The Eh values ranged from - 219 to 327 my, indicating the existence of both reducing and oxidizing zones. Presence of Fe and Mn was detected in both springs and wells; concentrations were higher in well, exceeding 4 mg Fe L-1 and 0.5 mg Mn L-1. Content of Si ranged from 12 to 47 mg L-1. A model of the hydrogeochemical behavior of the aquifer was created to highlight the following: i) processes involved in water-rock interactions, including fluctuations in silicate levels that determine anionic and cationic content of water, and ii) redox reactions as the major control processes of Fe and Mn. Water quality for human use is restricted by Fe and Mn content and pH. For irrigation use, significant limitations were not presented.

Chronic toxicity of five metals to the polar marine microalga Cryothecomonas armigera - Application of a new bioassay	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												The paucity of ecotoxicological data for Antarctic organisms is impeding the development of region specific water quality guidelines. To address this limitation, toxicity testing protocols need to be developed to account for the unique physiology of polar organisms, in particular their slow growth rates. In this study, a toxicity test protocol was developed to investigate the toxicities of five metals to the polar marine microalga Cryothecomonas armigera. The concentrations which reduced population growth rate by 10% (EC10) after 24-d for Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and Ni were 21.6, 152, 366, 454, and 1220 mu g.L-1, respectively. At the concentrations used in tests, only Cu and Ni were sufficiently toxic to enable the derivation of EC50 values of 63.1 and 1570 mu g.L-1 respectively. All metals affected C armigera's cellular physiology including cellular chlorophyll a fluorescence, cell complexity and size, and lipid concentrations. However, no changes to cellular membrane permeability were observed. The reduction in cellular lipid concentrations was a more sensitive indicator of toxicity for Cd, Ni, and Pb than growth rate inhibition, with EC10 values of 89, 894, and 11 mu g.L-1, respectively, highlighting its potential as a sensitive measure of metal toxicity.

A.; Paterson, Eric; McRoberts, Colin W.; Stutter, Marc			Potential tracers for tracking septic tank effluent discharges in watercourses	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Septic tank effluent (STE) contributes to catchment nutrient and pollutant loads. To assess the role of STE discharges in impairment of surface water, it is essential to identify the sources of pollution by tracing contaminants in watercourses. We examined tracers that were present in STE to establish their potential for identifying STE contamination in two stream systems (low and high dilution levels) against the background of upstream sources. The studied tracers were microbial, organic matter fluorescence, caffeine, artificial sweeteners and effluent chemical concentrations. The results revealed that tracer concentration ratios Cl/EC, Cl/NH4-N, Cl/TN, Cl/TSS, Cl/turbidity, Cl/total coliforms, Cl/sucralose, Cl/saccharin and Cl/Zn had potential as tracers in the stream with low dilution level (P < 0.05). Fluorescence spectroscopy could detect STE inputs through the presence of the tryptophan-like peak, but was limited to water courses with low level of dilution and was positively correlated with stream Escherichia coil (E. coil) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). The results also suggested that caffeine and artificial sweeteners can be suitable tracers for effluent discharge in streams with low and high level of dilution. Caffeine and saccharin were positively correlated with faecal coliforms, E. coil, total P and SRP, indicating their potential to trace discharge of a faecal origin and to be a marker for effluent P. Caffeine and SRP had similar attenuation behaviour in the receiving stream waters suggesting caffeine's potential role as a surrogate indicator for the behaviour of P downstream of effluent inputs. Taken together, results suggest that a single tracer alone was not sufficient to evaluate STE contamination of watercourses, but rather a combination of multiple chemical and physical tracing approaches should be employed. A multiple tracing approach would help to identify individual and cumulative STE inputs that pose risks to stream waters in order to prioritise and target effective mitigation measures.

HYDROBIOLOGIA					10th International Symposium on Cladocera	SEP 28-OCT 03, 2014	Lednice, CZECH REPUBLIC	Charles Univ, Dept Ecol				We investigated the relative importance of flood defenses and other environmental variables for the cladoceran and copepod communities in floodplain water bodies in Southeastern Norway. The water bodies covered gradients of size, distance to the river and water chemistry, and half of them were located behind flood defenses. The effects of environmental variables on the communities were analyzed using redundancy analysis. The set of environmental variables accounted for more of the explained variation in the cladoceran community than in the copepod community. Water quality was much more important than flooding-related variables for both communities. Although cladoceran species richness was slightly higher in water bodies outside flood defenses, total nitrogen, total organic carbon (TOC), and water body area were the most important factors for the cladocerans. Macrophyte coverage was the most important variable for both species richness and community structure of copepods. Although our results show that water quality and spatial/structural variables are more important than flood defenses in structuring the communities, the effect of TOC on the cladoceran community could likely be mediated through effects of flood defense on TOC. Prospects for a continued anthropogenic pressure on river floodplains raise concern for the future of these unique ecosystems.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2017	798	1					45	60		10.1007/s10750-015-2350-x								WOS:000404686800006

Hence it is important to develop an eco-friendly and cost effective technology to treat the dyes contaminated wastewater. In this research, an integrated approach of electrochemical oxidation (EO) and biodegradation process (BP) was studied of methyl red (MR) dye. In EO, RuO2-IrO2-TiO2 is used as anode and titanium mesh electrode as cathode. This was followed by BP of the treated EO effluent. Various parameters viz., pH (5-10), sodium chloride con centrations (NaCI) (1-5 g L-1) and current density (10-30 mA cm(2)) were optimized. The results of the EO showed 99.96% of MR decolorization within 10 min at pH of 5, NaCI of 2 g L-1 and current density of 30 mA cm2. The EO treated MR was further treated by BP Pseudomonas stutzeri MN1, Acinetobacter baumannii MN3 and mixed consortia of MN1 and MN3. The out of three treatments, the results of mixed consortium BP showed 90% removal of COD at the end of 24 h. The phytotoxic evaluation using Vigna radiate seeds confirmed the toxicity of untreated MR solution, whereas, 100% germination was observed in treated (biodegraded) MR solution. Overall these results evidenced that MR dye was completely decolorized and mineralized by EO and BP within 10 min and 24 h respectively. Hence, this integrated approach can be used as an effective degradation method to treat dyes in the textile industry. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Heritier, L; Meistertzheim, AL; Verneau, O				Heritier, Laurent; Meistertzheim, Anne-Leila; Verneau, Olivier			Oxidative stress biomarkers in the Mediterranean pond turtle (Mauremys leprosa) reveal contrasted aquatic environments in Southern France	CHEMOSPHERE												Increasing anthropogenic activities, like agricultural practices, constitute the main causes of the loss of water quality and disruption of freshwater ecosystems. High concentrations of pesticides, as shown under experimental conditions, can indeed impact freshwater animals. In Southern France, especially in the Pyrenees-Orientales department, because agricultural activities are mainly based on fruit crops and vineyards, glyphosate and AMPA were detected in some watercourses. Thereby we investigated the effects of degraded waters on the physiology of the endemic endangered freshwater species, namely the Mediterranean pond turtle Mauremys leprosa, in contrasted environments along the same rivers on the one hand and between different rivers on the other. We measured the activity and gene expression of two enzymes involved in the oxidative detoxification processes, namely the Catalase and the Superoxide dismutase. We showed significant variations in the Catalase gene expression and activity within turtles of the Fosseille River depending of their location, i.e. upstream or downstream of the wastewater treatment plants (WTP). Because agricultural environments are similar all along this river, they can no be longer considered as the unique source of turtle stress. The processed waters discharged by the WTP,which contribute to watercourses degradation, could therefore considerably impact the biodiversity of the freshwater environments.

Influence of cover crops on arthropods, free-living nematodes, and yield in a succeeding no-till soybean crop	APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY												Production practices that incorporate fall-planted cover crops into no-till agronomic crop rotations have become increasingly popular across the Northeastern United States for weed suppression and enhancing environmental stewardship. Field experiments were conducted in 2011 and 2012 to investigate effects of rotating cereal (barley, Hordeum vulgare), legume (Austrian winter pea, Pisum sativum subsp. arvense), cereal/legume cover crop mixture, and a fallow (bare-ground) control on above- and belowground fauna in a succeeding soybean crop. Free-living nematodes and soybean foliar arthropods were sampled through time to determine effects of cover crops on soil food web structure and complexity and herbivorous and beneficial arthropods, respectively. Our hypotheses were that organic matter from cover crop biomass would provide energy and nutrients to the soil food web and that increased habitat complexity from cover crop residue would provide habitat for more predatory arthropods aboveground. In general, cover crops in this no-till system had a stronger influence on the below- than aboveground fauna. There was no consistent, positive effect of cover crops on beneficial foliar arthropods or on soybean yield. Cover crops increased the soil food web structure and complexity as determined by nematode community indices. Specific effects of different cover crop types on the free-living nematode community varied within the growing season and between study years. Probable causes for differences encountered among cover crop treatments and years are discussed.																	0929-1393	1873-0272				SEP	2017	117						21	31		10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.04.003								WOS:000404321300004						
J	Refaey, MM; Tian, X; Tang, R; Li, DP				Refaey, Mohamed M.; Tian, Xing; Tang, Rong; Li, Dapeng			Changes in physiological responses, muscular composition and flesh quality of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus suffering from transport stress	AQUACULTURE												Transport of living fish is an important operation in fish farms. This study investigated the effect of transport stress on the muscular chemical composition and flesh quality of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus fingerlings. Fish were divided into two groups, the control group and the treatment group. The fish in the treatment group were exposed to the transportation process (3.5 h), while the control fish were kept under the normal aquaculture conditions (not-transport). Samples of muscle were collected for assay at several time intervals: before the experiment (basal level), and at 0, 24, 72 and 168 h after transportation process. The obtained results indicated serum cortisol and glucose levels significantly increased in the transported fish compared to non-transported fish directly after transport Transportation caused significant decrease in water, fat and energy contents of muscle after 24 h compared to other time intervals and non-transported fish. Muscle pH and shearing force significantly decreased at time 0 h, and then augmented after 24 h thereafter reduced again after 72 h and again improved at 168 h after transportation. Compared to the control group, transported fish exhibited the highest values in drip loss, stored loss, and frozen leakage rate. It is concluded that the transportation process results in marked changes in muscular chemical composition and reduces the flesh quality of I. punctatus fingerlings. A recovery period of 168 his recommended to reduce the consequences of the transportation stress. Statement of relevance: This work would tell us the effect of transport on muscular biochemical profiles and flesh quality of catfish, and help us to determine the duration that the fish needs to recover from the transportation stress.

Tolerable erosion concept is a tool for awareness and assessment of soil erosion status and its economic, social, and environmental hazards. This study was conducted to design a framework for evaluating and identifying spatial patterns of erosion hazard in Haji-Ghushan watershed, based on tolerable erosion concept, by using the SWAT model. The framework was consisted of two parts: the erosion tolerance index (ETI), and the sediment-phosphorous index (SPI) for evaluating onsite and offsite effects of soil erosion, respectively. Four hazard levels were defined for each index. The results of sediment simulation indicated that the maximum rate of erosion belonged to agricultural lands located on steep slopes in the central part of the watershed, and the minimum rate was from forest lands, despite their steep slopes. The map of spatial,distribution of erosion hazard showed that, in terms of both onsite and offsite effects, a major part of the watershed (around 65%) had experienced an erosion rate lower than the erosion tolerance threshold; hence, these areas were not faced with erosion hazard. The spatial distribution of the areas exposed to the onsite erosion hazard, however, was differed from those confronted by the offsite erosion hazard. Identified high hazard areas based on the erosion offsite impacts were mainly located in sub-basins close to the watershed outlet where the sediment and phosphorous yield was high due to the high sediment-phosphorous delivery ratio. High hazard areas with high risk of soil degradation and productivity reduction are distributed throughout the watershed, depending on the magnitude of the erosion rate. These findings revealed that, in addition to erosion rate, sediment delivery ratio is also an important parameter in evaluating soil erosion hazard. For achieving the sustainable agro-environment, it is necessary to consider both the onsite and offsite effects of soil erosion to identify the high hazard areas. Also the results showed that the designed framework was capable of identifying the high hazard and hot spot areas well. The findings of this study are useful for officials and policy makers of soil conservation and environmental protection agencies in the region.

J	Kim, YJ; Choo, BK; Cho, JY				Kim, Young-Joo; Choo, Byung-Kil; Cho, Jae-Young			Effect of gypsum and rice straw compost application on improvements of soil quality during desalination of reclaimed coastal tideland soils: Ten years of long-term experiments	CATENA												The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of applying gypsum and rice straw compost on improvements in soil quality during the desalination of previously reclaimed coastal tideland soils. The four treatments were control (without amendment), gypsum, rice straw compost, and gypsum + rice straw compost. The experiments were carried out in a completely randomized design with three replicates. Saturated electrical conductivity (ECe) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) values of soils treated with gypsum, or gypsum + rice straw compost, reached the salinity and sodicity classification limits of 4 dS m(-1) and 15% (US Salinity Laboratory Staff, 1954), respectively, after eight years of leaching experiments. However, despite 10 years of leaching experiments, neither the control nor the rice straw compost alone treatment reached the salinity and sodicity classification limits. The addition of gypsum and rice straw compost resulted in a reduction in soil bulk density and a corresponding increase in soil porosity in highly saline-sodic soils (p <= 0.05). The results of mean weight diameter (MWD) showed that the application of soil amendments increased MWD significantly (p <= 0.05); the highest MWD was observed for the gypsum + rice straw compost treatment and was twice the magnitude of the control.																	0341-8162	1872-6887				SEP	2017	156						131	138		10.1016/j.catena.2017.04.008								WOS:000404305700014

In this study, potentiometric sensors using either Pt, Al or stainless steel working electrodes were fabricated. Both Pt and stainless steel electrodes exhibited high performance. As an example, a 200 mV response was obtained from SUS304 stainless steel electrode exposed to 1 mg/L residual chlorine concentration within about 4 min. The effects of pH and dissolved oxygen concentration as environmental factors were evaluated, and Pt and SUS316 electrodes showed the same variation with changes in these parameters. The data suggest that the appropriate pairing of electrode materials could allow the fabrication of all-solid-state sensor devices with the advantages of compactness, low power consumption, low cost and robustness.

Altered development, oxidative stress and DNA damage in Leptodactylus chaquensis (Anura: Leptodactylidae) larvae exposed to poultry litter	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Poultry litter (PL), which is usually used as organic fertilizer, is a source of nutrients, metals, veterinary pharmaceuticals and bacterial pathogens, which, through runoff, may end up in the nearest aquatic ecosystems. In this study, Leptodactylus chaquensis at different development stages (eggs, larval stages 28 and 31 here referred to as stages I, II and III respectively) were exposed to PL test sediments as follows: 6.25% (T1), 12.5% (T2); 25% (T3); 50% (T4); 75% (T5); 100% PL (T6) and to dechlorinated water as control. Larval survival, development endpoints (growth rate -GR-, development rate -DR-, abnormalities), antioxidant enzyme activities (Catalase -CAT- and Glutathione-S-Transferase -GST-), and genotoxic effect (DNA damage index by the Comet assay) were analyzed at different times. In stage I, no egg eclosion was observed in treatments T3-T6, and 50% of embryo mortality was recorded after 24 h of exposure to T2. In stages II and III, mortality in treatments T3-T6 reached 100% between 24 and 48 h. In the three development stages evaluated, the DR and GR were higher in controls than in PL treatments (T1, T2), except for those Tl-treated larvae of stage II. Larvae of stage I showed five types of morphological abnormalities, being diamond body shape and lateral displacement of the intestine the most prevalent in T1, whereas larvae of stages II and III presented lower prevalence of abnormalities. In stage I, CAT activity was similar to that of control (p > 0.05), whereas it was higher in T1- and T2-treated larvae of stages II and III than controls (p < 0.05). In stages I and III, GST activity was similar to that of controls (p > 0.05), whereas it was inhibited in Tl-treated larvae of stage II (p < 0.05). T1- and T2-treated larvae of stages II and III caused higher DNA damage respect to controls (p < 0.05), varying from medium to severe damage (comet types II, III and IV). These results showed that PL treatments altered development and growth and induced oxidative stress and DNA damage, resulting ecotoxic for L. chaquensis larvae.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				SEP	2017	143						62	71		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.05.007								WOS:000404095100009	28505481

Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and wastewater ponds, Part I: Mallard ducks overwintering at a northern wastewater treatment pond	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												In northern urban areas, wastewater treatment ponds (WWTPs) may provide a thermal refuge during winter (-10 degrees C) that is used by normally migratory mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). On the ponds, mallards may experience stress due to crowding, or through the ingestion of WWTP water, be exposed to a diverse array of synthetic chemicals, which may have adverse health effects. Photographic sampling was used to assess mallard sex ratios and behavioural patterns throughout the late winter on wastewater ponds in Edmonton, Canada. The WWTP mallard population was large ( > 1000 birds), but temporally variable and consistently male-dominated. Locomotion and dabbling were the primary behaviors observed; aggression was rarely observed, which suggests crowding stress was low or absent. Mallard abundance tended to be higher at lower air temperatures, suggesting that WWTP ponds acted as a thermal refuge. Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen from duck feces and potential food sources indicated that mallards were not feeding at the site, or on invertebrates or select waste grain from offsite. Rather, ducks either consumed an undetermined food source or were feeding very little. Taken together, the data suggest that winter use of northern WWTP ponds may serve as an alternative to migration, whether this strategy benefits or harms mallards likely depends on winter severity, and not on WWTP pond characteristics or water quality.

Fingerlings of rohu were cultured in indoor biofloc tanks in light-limited condition for 16 weeks with daily addition of molasses as carbon source to maintain the C/N ratio at 15. Different water quality parameters were measured at weekly interval. Growth, survival and welfare indices including stress and immunological status were measured after the end of the experimental period. Factor analysis using water quality variables indicated ammonia immobilization by heterotrophic bacteria, rather than nitrification, as the dominant mechanism influencing ammonia removal in the biofloc system. Ammonia immobilization was concomitant with microbial biomass production, as also revealed through factor analysis. The biofloc culture system enhanced the growth of rohu significantly than the control fish. As a measure of stress, the serum glucose content did not differ significantly between the fish cultured in biofloc and control system. Among the immunological parameters, respiratory burst and alkaline phosphatase activity showed significant enhancement in fish grown in biofloc system than the control. However, myeloperoxidase activity and total serum protein content did not show any statistically significant difference between biofloc and control system. The enhanced growth and welfare of the cultured fish may be attributed to in situ maintenance of water quality within the biofloc system and presence of microbial floc. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ding, WJ; Cheng, SA; Yu, LL; Huang, HB				Ding, Weijun; Cheng, Shaoan; Yu, Liliang; Huang, Haobin			Effective swine wastewater treatment by combining microbial fuel cells with flocculation	CHEMOSPHERE												Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) provide a cost-effective method for treating swine wastewater treatment and simultaneously producing electricity, yet they need to be combined with other wastewater treatment processes to improve the effluent water quality. In this paper, we constructed single-chamber air-cathode MFCs with a compact configuration for nitrogen and COD removal and high electricity production and combined them with a low-cost flocculation process to discharge higher quality wastewater. We show that MFCs could remove ammonia at a rate of 269.2 +/- 0.5 g m(-3) d(-1) (99.1 +/- 0.1% ammonia removal efficiency) with a maximum power density of 37.5 W m(-3) and 21.6% of coulombic efficiency at a 40:60 ratio of raw swine wastewater to denitrification effluent of swine wastewater. Up to 82.5 +/- 0.5% COD could be removed with MFCs, from 2735 +/- 15 mg L-1 to 480 +/- 15 mg L-1, and flocculation further reduced levels to 90 1 mg L-1 for a 96.6 +/- 0.2% overall COD removal efficiency of the combination technology. Cost analysis of the combined MFC and flocculation process showed a net economic benefit of $ 0.026 m(-3). In summary, this novel combination wastewater treatment method provides an effective way to treat swine wastewater to low pollutant levels in the effluent at low cost (a net gain).

CHEMOSPHERE												The possible environmental impact of the recent increase in use of a group of technology-critical elements (Nb, Ta, Ga, In, Ge and Te) is analysed by reviewing published concentration profiles in environmental archives (ice cores, ombrotrophic peat bogs, freshwater sediments and moss surveys) and evaluating temporal trends in surface waters. No increase has so far been recorded. The low potential direct emissions of these elements, resulting from their absolute low production levels, make it unlikely that the increasing use of these elements in modern technology has any noticeable effect on their environmental concentrations on a global scale. This holds particularly true for those of these elements that are probably emitted in relatively high amounts from other human activities (i.e., coal combustion and non-ferrous smelting), such as In, the most studied element of the group.

This study describes a fast and efficient chemical hazard screening strategy for characterising trace levels of polar organic contaminants in water matrices, based on liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry with post-acquisition 'case-control' data processing. This method allowed for a rapid response time of less than 24 h for the screening of target, suspect and non-target unknown chemicals via direct injection analysis, and a second, more sensitive analysis option requiring sample pre-concentration. The method was validated by fortifying samples with a range of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (n = 46); with >90% of target compounds positively screened in samples at 1 ng mL(-1), and 46% at 0.1 ng mL(-1) when analysed via direct injection. To simulate a contamination event samples were fortified with compounds not present in the commercial library (designated 'non-target compounds'; fipronil and fenitrothion), tentatively identified at 0.2 and 1 ng mL(-1), respectively; and a compound not included in any known commercial library or public database (designated 'unknown' compounds; 8C1(-) perfluorooctanesulfonic acid), at 0.8 ng mL(-1). The method was applied to two 'real-case' scenarios: (1) the assessment of drinking water safety during a high-profile event in Brisbane, Australia; and (2) to screen treated, re-circulated drinking water and pre-treated (raw) water. The validated workflow was effective for rapid prioritisation and screening of suspect and non-target potential hazards at trace levels, and could be applied to a wide range of matrices and investigations where comparison of organic contaminants between an affected and control site and or timeframe is warranted.

Measurement differences between turbidity instruments, and their implications for suspended sediment concentration and load calculations: A sensor inter-comparison study	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The use of turbidity for indicating environmentally detrimental levels of suspended and colloidal matter in freshwater systems, and for defining acceptable water quality standards in national and European drinking water regulations, is well established. Turbidity is therefore frequently adopted as a surrogate for suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), or as a relative and objective measure of water clarity in monitoring programmes. Through systematic, controlled experimentation, we tested the response of 12 commercially available turbidity sensors, of various designs, to gauge their measurement consistency when benchmarked against pre-prepared sediment suspensions of known SSC. Results showed that despite calibration to a Formazin standard, sensor responses to identical SSC solutions (in the range of 20 -1000 mg L-1) varied considerably. For a given SSC, up to five-fold differences in recorded turbidity were recorded across the tested instruments. Furthermore, inconsistent measurements were identified across instruments, regardless of whether they operated using backscatter or side-scatter optical principles. While the findings may have implications for compliance with turbidity-based water quality standards, they are less likely to be an issue when turbidity is being used as a surrogate for SSC, provided that instrument use remains constant and that instrument drift is not an issue. In this study, a field comparison of a subset of four study sensors showed that despite very different absolute turbidity readings for a given SSC, well correlated and reliable turbidity - SSC ratings were established (as evidenced by r(2) coefficients from 0.92 to 0.98). This led to reasonably consistent suspended sediment load estimates of between 64.7 and 70.8 tonnes for a rainfall event analysed. This study highlights the potential for issues to arise when interpreting water turbidity datasets that are often assumed to be comparable, in that measurement inconsistency of the type reported here may remain unknown to water resource decision makers and practitioners.

Allen			Reeling in the damages: Harmful algal blooms' impact on Lake Erie's recreational fishing industry	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Lake Erie is one of the most valuable natural resources in the United States, providing billions of dollars in benefits each year to recreationalists, homeowners and local governments. The ecosystem services provided by Lake Erie, however, are under threat due to harmful algal blooms. This paper provides recreational damage estimates using spatially and temporally varying algae measures and monthly fishing permit sales collected between 2011 and 2014. Results indicate that fishing license sales drop between 10% and 13% when algal conditions surpass the World Health's Organization's moderate health risk advisory threshold of 20,000 cyanobacteria cells/mL. For Lake Erie adjacent counties experiencing a large, summer-long algal bloom, this would result in approximately 3600 fewer fishing licenses issued and approximately $2.25 million to $5.58 million in lost fishing expenditures. Our results show a discrete jump in reduced angling activity upon crossing this threshold, with limited additional impacts associated with more severe algal blooms. This suggests that policies aimed at eliminating, rather than mitigating, algal levels are most beneficial to the Ohio angling industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A macrophyte bioassessment approach linking taxon-specific tolerance and abundance in north temperate lakes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Bioassessment methods are critically needed to evaluate and monitor lake ecological condition. Aquatic macrophytes are good candidate indicators, but few lake bioassessment methods developed in North America use them. The few macrophyte bioassessment methods that do exist suffer from problems related to subjectivity and discernibility along disturbance gradients. We developed and tested a bioassessment approach for 462 north temperate lakes. The approach links macrophyte abundance to lake ecological condition via estimates of taxon-specific abundance-weighted tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance. Using variables related to eutrophication, urban development and agriculture, we calculated abundance-weighted tolerance ranges for 59 macrophyte taxa and clustered them according to their tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance. We also created a composite index of anthropogenic disturbance using 20 variables related to population density, land cover and water chemistry. We used a statistical approach to set ecological condition thresholds based on the observed abundance of sensitive, moderately tolerant and tolerant taxa in each lake.

Understanding the relationships between water quality, recreational fishing practices, and human health in Phoenix, Arizona	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Across the United States, recreational freshwater fisheries are not only an important leisure activity, but can also provide a relatively inexpensive source of protein in local diets. However, recreational freshwater fisheries are generally not well-monitored in terms of fish consumption vs. catch and release, nor are all recreational surface waters regularly monitored for the presence of potentially harmful contaminants in water or fishes. In six urban lakes that support recreational fisheries in Phoenix, Arizona, a majority of surveyed anglers reported eating recreationally caught fishes, even though they thought the water might be polluted. Surface water samples collected from the six urban recreational fishery lakes showed varying levels of organic contaminants, including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and phthalates. As many Phoenix urban recreational fisheries lakes and ponds are located in low income and high minority neighborhoods, the results of this pilot study could be used to inform urban fisheries management and other agencies of the potential need for fish consumption advisories, inform actions to improve water quality in urban lakes and ponds that support urban fisheries, and support further research and monitoring, in order to reduce potential risks to public health.

Viral disinfection of organic fresh produce comparing Polyphenon 60 from green tea with chlorine	FOOD CONTROL												Contamination of fresh produce with enteric viruses is a matter of concern because viruses may persist in food surfaces under normal storage conditions for long periods. Chlorinated compounds are the most common substances used to disinfect fresh produce but they present some disadvantages such as the formation of by-products. In this study, green tea extract (GTE), a natural compound from Camellia sinensis, was tested to disinfect fresh produce contaminated with 8 log(10) of human adenoviruses (HAdV) and 6 log(10) of infectious murine noroviruses (MNV), a surrogate of human norovirus. Chorine was also employed to compare the action of GTE with a common disinfectant. Results demonstrated that, although GTE was not as efficient as chlorine, it demonstrated good effectiveness to decrease the amount HAdV in fresh produce. Both disinfectants were more effective than just using water to reduce the load of infectious HAdV. It was also observed that both chlorine and GTE were more effective to remove HAdV than MNV, probably due to different interactions of the viruses with the plant tissues. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A major challenge is overcoming the associated costs to agricultural producers. We integrate spatially-explicit models of ecosystem processes with agricultural commodity production models to analyze the biophysical and economic consequences of alternative land use and land management patterns to achieve Total Maximum Daily Loads targets in a proto-typical agricultural watershed. We apply these models to find patterns that maximize water quality objectives for given levels of foregone agricultural profit. We find it is possible to reduce baseline watershed phosphorus loads by similar to 20% and sediment loads by similar to 18% without any reduction in agricultural profits. Our results indicate that meeting more stringent targets will result in substantial economic loss. However, when we add the social benefits from water quality improvement and carbon sequestration to private agricultural net returns we find that water quality improvements up to 50% can be obtained at no loss to societal returns. The cost of meeting water quality targets will vary over time as commodity and ecosystem service, prices fluctuate. If crop prices drop or the value of ecosystem services increase, then achieving higher water quality goals will be less costly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cogan, NG; Chellam, S				Cogan, N. G.; Chellam, Shankararaman			Global parametric sensitivity analysis of a model for dead-end microfiltration of bacterial suspensions	JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE												One of the central problems in membrane implementation is that foulants deposit on surfaces of microfilters employed for water and wastewater treatment and reuse, reducing their productivity. In an effort to remove as much of the deposited materials as possible and maintain the flux, the direction of flow across these membranes is regularly and frequently reversed. However, backwashing only removes the loosely or reversibly bound materials necessitating the entire system to be taken off-line for chemical cleaning when fouling increases beyond a threshold value. We recently presented a mathematically rigorous methodology to determine timing and duration of backwashes so as to delay membrane chemical cleaning and reduce associated operational complexity and costs. By considering an optimal control formulation, using the flow direction as the control variable, the optimal timing and maximum volume of water that can be microfiltered in a given time period were predicted during dead-end filtration of bacterial suspensions. The value of these predictions depend on our ability to accurately and precisely estimate input parameters such as the clean membrane resistance, influent water quality estimates, and biofilm and exo-polymeric substance formation rates and effects. These estimates are inherently uncertain leading to uncertainty in the predictions, which can be rigorously quantified using Sobol indices. These provide a global method for assessing the sensitivity of model predictions (e.g. optimal timing and volume filtered) with respect to variations in the inputs.																	0376-7388	1873-3123				SEP 1	2017	537						119	127		10.1016/j.memsci.2017.05.042								WOS:000402508600012

Modelling of Escherichia coli concentrations in bathing water at microtidal coasts	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Monitoring of the quality of bathing water in line with the European Commission bathing water directive (Directive 2006/7/EC) is a significant economic expense for those countries with great lengths of coastline. In this study a numerical model based on finite elements is generated whose objective is partially substituting the microbiological analysis of the quality of coastal bathing waters. According to a study of the concentration of Escherichia coli in 299 Spanish Mediterranean beaches, it was established that the most important variables that influence the concentration are: monthly sunshine hours, mean monthly precipitation, number of goat cattle heads, population density, presence of Posidonia oceanica, UV, urbanization level, type of sediment, wastewater treatment ratio, salinity, distance to the nearest discharge, and wave height perpendicular to the coast. Using these variables, a model with an absolute error of 10.6 +/- 1.5 CFU/100 ml is achieved. With this model, if there are no significant changes in the beach environment and the variables remain more or less stable, the concentration of E. coli in bathing water can be determined, performing only specific microbiological analyses to verify the water quality.

Biofilm structures (EPS and bacterial communities) in drinking water distribution systems are conditioned by hydraulics and influence discolouration	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												High-quality drinking water from treatment works is degraded during transport to customer taps through the Drinking Water Distribution System (DWDS). Interactions occurring at the pipe wall-water interface are central to this degradation and are often dominated by complex microbial biofilms that are not well understood. This study uses novel application of confocal microscopy techniques to quantify the composition of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and cells of DWDS biofilms together with concurrent evaluation of the bacterial community. An internationally unique, full-scale, experimental DWDS facility was used to investigate the impact of three different hydraulic patterns upon biofilms and subsequently assess their response to increases in shear stress, linking biofilms to water quality impacts such as discolouration. Greater flow variation during growth was associated with increased cell quantity but was inversely related to EPS-to-cell volume ratios and bacterial diversity. Discolouration was caused and EPS was mobilised during flushing of all conditions. Ultimately, biofilms developed under low-varied flow conditions had lowest amounts of biomass, the greatest EPS volumes per cell and the lowest discolouration response. This research shows that the interactions between hydraulics and biofilm physical and community structures are complex but critical to managing biofilms within ageing DWDS infrastructure to limit water quality degradation and protect public health.

Such fluctuation is believed associated with the state shifts of bacterial community within. To date, seasonality effects on bacterioplankton community patterns in large rivers serving as drinking water sources however, are still poorly understood. Here we investigated the intra-annual bacterial community structure in the Dongjiang River, a drinking water source of Hong Kong, using high-throughput pyrosequencing in concert with geochemical property measurements during dry, and wet seasons. Our results showed that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla of bacterioplankton communities, which varied in composition, and distribution from dry to wet seasons, and exhibited profound seasonal changes. Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Cyanobacteria seemed to be more associated with seasonality that the relative abundances of Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were significantly higher in the dry season than those in the wet season (p < 0.01), while the relative abundance of Cyanobacteria was about 10-fold higher in the wet season than in the dry season. Temperature and NO3--N concentration represented key contributing factors to the observed seasonal variations. These findings help understand the roles of various bacterioplankton and their interactions with the biogeochemical processes in the river ecosystem.																	1664-302X					AUG 31	2017	8									10.3389/fmicb.2017.01644								WOS:000408797000001	28912759

Here, we used a grapefruit agroecosystem model to evaluate the responses of the active soil microbial community-as a microbial subset directly involved in soil functionality-undergoing strategies to cope with the low water availability in south-east Spain. For this purpose, we tested the impacts of: (i) water quality: transfer-water from a river (TW) or reclaimed-water from a wastewater-treatment plant (RW); and (ii) water quantity: continuous optimal amount of water or reduced irrigation (RDI) in the temporal frame when the crop is less sensitive; and their interactions. Metaproteomics revealed that the phylogenetic diversity of the active community and its functional diversity were lowered in soils with RW. RDI lowered soil respiration and functional diversity while the phylogenetic diversity remained constant. The reestablishment of full irrigation after RDI led to a recovery of soil respiration that was accompanied by an enhanced abundance of resilient bacterial populations. Bacterial populations displayed molecular mechanisms against water stress that have been conserved evolutionarily in plants. Protein- based studies shed light on ecological and functional mechanisms that govern the adaptive responses of soil microbial communities to climate-change friendly water management.

Surprisingly Modest Water Quality Impacts From Expansion and Intensification of Large-Sscale Commercial Agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon-Cerrado Region	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Large-scale commercial cropping of soybeans expanded in the tropical Amazon and Cerrado biomes of Brazil after 1990. More recently, cropping intensified from single-cropping of soybeans to double-cropping of soybeans with corn or cotton. Cropland expansion and intensification, and the accompanying use of mineral fertilizers, raise concerns about whether nutrient runoff and impacts to surface waters will be similar to those experienced in commercial cropland regions at temperate latitudes. We quantified water infiltration through soils, water yield, and streamwater chemistry in watersheds draining native tropical forest and single-and double-cropped areas on the level, deep, highly weathered soils where cropland expansion and intensification typically occurs. Although water yield increased four-fold from croplands, streamwater chemistry remained largely unchanged. Soil characteristics exerted important control over the movement of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) into streams. High soil infiltration rates prevented surface erosion and movement of particulate P, while P fixation in surface soils restricted P movement to deeper soil layers. Nitrogen retention in deep soils, likely by anion exchange, also appeared to limit N leaching and export in streamwater from both single-and double-cropped watersheds that received nitrogen fertilizer. These mechanisms led to lower streamwater P and N concentrations and lower watershed N and P export than would be expected, based on studies from temperate croplands with similar cropping and fertilizer application practices.

However, the interpretation of c-Q data can be difficult unless these data are fitted using statistical models. Such models are frequently applied for geogenic solutes, but it is unclear to what extent they might aid in the investigation of nutrient export patterns, particularly for total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) which is a critical driver of downstream eutrophication problems. The goal of the present study was therefore to statistically model c-Q relations (where c is TDP concentrations) in a set of contrasting watersheds in the Northern Great Plains-ranging in size from 0.2 to 1000+km(2)-to assess the controls of landscape properties on TDP transport dynamics. Six statistical models were fitted to c-Q data, notably (a) one linear model, (b) one model assuming that c-Q relations are driven by the mixing of end-member waters from different landscape locations (i.e., hydrograph separation), (c) one model relying on a biogeochemical stationarity hypothesis (i.e., power law), (d) one model hypothesizing that c-Q relations change as a function of the solute subsurface contact time (i.e., hyperbolic model), and (e) two models assuming that solute fluxes are mostly dependent on reaction rates (i.e., chemical models). Model performance ranged from mediocre (R-2 < 0.2) to very good (R-2 > 0.9), but the hydrograph separation model seemed most universal. No watershed was found to exhibit chemostatic behaviour, but many showed signs of dilution or enrichment behaviour. A tendency toward a multi-model fit and better model performance was observed for watersheds with moderate slope and higher effective drainage area. The relatively poor model performance obtained outside these conditions illustrates the likely importance of controls on TDP concentrations in the region that are independent of flow dynamics.

J	Lu, YG; Aitken, RJ; Lin, MJ				Lu, Yonggang; Aitken, Robert John; Lin, Minjie			Ultrastructural investigation and in vitro recapitulation of spermatid differentiation in a potential bio-indicator species - The marine invertebrate Galeolaria gemineoa (Polychaeta: Serpulidae)	PLOS ONE												Galeolaria gemineoa is a sessile broadcast-spawning marine invertebrate, whose spermatozoa have been regarded as a sensitive indicator for water quality monitoring. In this study, 10 steps of spermiogenesis have been identified at the ultrastructural level and this differentiation process has been recapitulated in vitro up to the point of spermiogenesis (step 7-9 spermatids). On completion of the second meiosis, newly formed spermatids were detached from the seminiferous epithelium and released to the lumen of each germinal chamber. These spermatids were present in pairs and interconnected by a cytoplasmic bridge throughout the entire spermiogenic process. On the basis of morphological events such as formation of the acrosome, elongation of the flagellum, and condensation of the nucleus, spermiogenesis has been temporally divided into Golgi phase, acrosomal phase and maturation phase. During the Golgi phase, proacrosomal vesicles appeared at the posterior pole of the spermatids and gradually fused into a proacrosomal vacuole. Simultaneously, the distal centriole docked onto the plasma membrane and gave rise to a formative flagellum. The acrosomal phase was characterised by differentiation of the acrosome, condensation of the chromatin and formation of a mitochondrial sheath surrounding the initial portion of the flagellum. During the maturation phase, the fully differentiated acrosome migrated to the anterior pole and excess cytoplasm was extruded from the spermatids in the form of residual bodies. In addition, we successfully induced step 1-3 spermatids to differentiate into the step 7-9 spermatids in both male germinal fluid and 10% foetal bovine serum in RPMI 1640 medium, but failed to replicate this process in female or boiled male germinal fluids. This finding supports our concept that spermatid differentiation in this species is dependent on intrinsic developmental programming and does not require input from accompanying nurse cells.

In this paper, the macroinvertebrate communities from the main tributaries in the Three Gorges Reservoir Catchment (TGRC) were investigated as a function of the four seasons to explore the temporal variations in macroinvertebrate communities and further tests the temporal stability of certain metrics that are based on macroinvertebrates under a routine bioassessment framework. Results: The taxa richness reached the highest point in spring, followed by winter, autumn and summer. The taxa Chironomidae, Heptageniidae, Corbiculidae and Baetidae dominated the communities across seasons. The temporal variations in communities were mainly reflected in the changes in taxa proportions between seasons. The percentages of the taxa Heptageniidae and Baetidae were the highest in autumn (normal discharge period) and lowest in summer (high discharge period). The abundance of macroinvertebrates was the lowest in summer, increased in autumn and winter, and then decreased in spring. Natural fluctuations of aquatic ecosystems (temporal effects) resulted in variations that were apparent in macroinvertebrate-based metrics, such as EPT%, Baetidae%, Caenidae%, Ephemerellidae% and Hydropsychidae%. Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrated that the macroinvertebrate communities in the main tributaries of the TGRC varied as a function of seasons. This variation was fundamentally similar to the seasonal patterns in subarctic and temperate streams. Different hydro-morphological characteristics and water quality during the high discharge period (summer), low discharge period (winter) and normal discharge period (spring and autumn) strongly affected the distribution patterns of macroinvertebrate communities. Discharge variation among seasons resulted in seasonal fluctuations in the density of macroinvertebrates. In the TGRC, autumn was the important hatching period for mayflies (Ephemeroptera). The variations in metrics related to macroinvertebrates indicated that temporal effects should not be neglected under a biomonitoring framework in future studies.																	0716-078X	0717-6317				AUG 29	2017	90								6	10.1186/s40693-017-0069-y								WOS:000408693700001

J	Vu, T; Deksissa, T; Xu, JJ				Trinh Vu; Deksissa, Tolessa; Xu, Jiajun			Development and characterization of a hybrid mesoporous material infused with metallic oxide nanoparticles for water treatment	NANOMATERIALS AND NANOTECHNOLOGY												In the current study, a hybrid mesoporous material infused with metallic oxide nanoparticles, MCM-48 with TiO2 nanoparticles, has been developed for potential application in water treatment. MCM-48 belongs to a family of mesoporous siliceous materialsM41S, in which MCM-48 has a unique three-dimensional cubic symmetry structure. Using this hybrid approach, it will allow the polluted water to pass through the strong yet high permeable structure of mesoporous material and to allow enough time for the pollutants to react with the metallic oxide nanoparticles infused on the porous structure so that the polluted water can be treated without introducing secondary pollutants. A modified hydrothermal method has been developed to synthesize three samples of this hybrid material with TiO2 nanoparticles of 15, 50, and 300 nm in diameter, respectively. The microstructures before and after the infusion of nanoparticles are characterized using scanning electron microscope and X-ray powder diffraction. Under the current study, the synthesized samples are tested for their capability of removing organic dye and trace metals. The results have shown that while all three hybrid materials have shown over 80% adsorption rate for organic dye, the sample synthesized using 300 nm TiO2 nanoparticle has shown the highest adsorption rate. Similarly, the highest adsorption rate for most trace metals tested here also occurs in the sample made with 300 nm TiO2 nanoparticle. Coincidently, the sample prepared with 300 nm TiO2 nanoparticle has a much larger internal surface area and smaller average pore size compared to the two other samples, which may lead to the higher adsorption rate of trace metals and organic dye tested here. This study has presented a hybrid mesoporous material that can be potentially used for pollutants removal in water treatment. Future study is needed to investigate how to reuse this hybrid mesoporous material and to obtain a further understanding of the mechanism affecting the micro structures of the hybrid material.																	1847-9804					AUG 24	2017	7								1847980417727428	10.1177/1847980417727428								WOS:000408426500001

Nitrogenous concentrations and dual isotopes of nitrate were measured to ascertain the spatial and temporal distributions of nitrate transformation in the Yellow River, the second-longest river in China. Assessment of the long-term record indicates that [ NO3 (-)- N] has increased by two-fold over the past three decades. Weekly observation of ammonium over a twelve- year period revealed high concentrations and suggests impairment of water quality, particularly since 2011. The estimated total dissolved nitrogen flux was 7.2 times higher in middle reaches than that at head waters. Anthropogenic nitrogen sources become more important in lower section of the upper reaches and middle reaches because of intensive agricultural activities and urban input. Nitrate in the lower reaches was mainly derived from transportation of upstream nitrate and point sources from cities. The spatial variation of ammonium and nitrate isotopes show that nitrification is a key process governing nitrogen transformation. Riverine biological processes could potentially be responsible for the shift of nitrate isotope signature. The first step to reducing nitrogen load and improving water quality will be containment and careful management of sources from urban input, sewage waste and irrigation runoff.

Remote sensing of CDOM and Chla concentrations for inland lakes is often limited by low spatial resolution. The newly launched Sentinel-2 satellite is equipped with high spatial resolution (10, 20, and 60 m). Empirical band ratio models were developed to derive CDOM and Chla concentrations in Lake Huron. The leave-one-out cross-validation method was used for model calibration and validation. The best CDOM retrieval algorithm is a B3/B5 model with accuracy coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.884, root-mean-squared error (RMSE) = 0.731 m(-1), relative root-meansquared error (RRMSE) = 28.02%, and bias = -0.1 m(-1). The best Chla retrieval algorithm is a B5/B4 model with accuracy R-2 = 0.49, RMSE = 9.972 mg/m(3), RRMSE = 48.47%, and bias = -0.116 mg/m(3). Neural network models were further implemented to improve inversion accuracy. The applications of the two best band ratio models to Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m x 10 m pixel size presented the high potential of the sensor for monitoring water quality of inland lakes.

This paper explored the use of spatial regression to evaluate the impacts of watershed characteristics on ambient total nitrogen (TN) concentration in a heavily polluted watershed and make predictions across the region. Regression results have confirmed the substantial impact on TN concentration by a variety of point and non-point pollution sources. In addition, spatial regression has yielded better performance than ordinary regression in predicting TN concentrations. Due to its best performance in cross-validation, the river distance based spatial regression model was used to predict TN concentrations across the watershed. The prediction results have revealed a distinct pattern in the spatial distribution of TN concentrations and identified three critical sub-regions in priority for reducing TN loads. Our study results have indicated that spatial regression could potentially serve as an effective tool to facilitate water pollution control in watersheds under diverse physical and socio-economical conditions.																	2045-2322					AUG 16	2017	7								8318	10.1038/s41598-017-08254-w								WOS:000407675800008	28814731					
J	Zabbey, N; Olsson, G				Zabbey, Nenibarini; Olsson, Gustaf			Conflicts - Oil Exploration and Water	GLOBAL CHALLENGES												Water resources and water quality are closely related to oil exploration, refining and distribution. Since oil products provide over 90% of transport energy in almost all countries it is apparent that any oil operation is an inherent risk for water resources. Since water supplies will be increasingly stressed as a consequence of climate change and population increase the environmental risks associated with oil exploration may intensify. Thus, there are more reasons than CO2 emissions and climate change to cut down on oil production and consumption. In this paper water related risks are discussed from two aspects: (1) water use and water pollution as a result of normal exploration, refining and distribution, (2) water and marine life contamination caused by accidents. It will be exemplified by some major oil accidents, too often caused by human errors or negligence. Ecological effects of oil contamination for seawaters and freshwaters are discussed. Some aspects of social and economic consequences are examined. Some possibilities for mitigating oil leakage risks are highlighted.																	2056-6646					AUG 15	2017	1	5			SI				1600015	10.1002/gch2.201600015								WOS:000419792400001

Climate Change Impacts on Harmful Algal Blooms in US Freshwaters: A Screening-Level Assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) have serious adverse effects on human and environmental health. Herein, we developed a modeling framework that predicts the effect of climate change on cyanobacteria concentrations in large reservoirs in the contiguous U.S. The framework, which uses climate change projections from five global circulation models, two greenhouse gas emission scenarios, and two cyanobacterial growth scenarios, is unique in coupling climate projections with a hydrologic/water quality network model of the contiguous United States. Thus, it generates both regional and nationwide projections useful as a screening-level assessment of climate impacts on CyanoHAB prevalence as well as potential lost recreation days and associated economic value. Our projections indicate that CyanoHAB concentrations are likely to increase primarily due to water temperature increases tempered by increased nutrient levels resulting from changing demographics and climatic impacts on hydrology that drive nutrient transport. The combination of these factors results in the mean number of days of CyanoHAB occurrence ranging from about 7 days per year per waterbody under current conditions, to 16-23 days in 2050 and 18-39 days in 2090. From a regional perspective, we find the largest increases in CyanoHAB occurrence in the Northeast U.S., while the greatest impacts to recreation, in terms of costs, are in the Southeast.

Quantitative CrAssphage PCR Assays for Human Fecal Pollution Measurement	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Environmental waters are monitored for fecal pollution to protect public health and water resources. Traditionally, general fecal-indicator bacteria are used; however, they cannot distinguish human fecal waste from other animal pollution sources. Recently, a novel bacteriophage, crAssphage, was discovered by metagenomic data mining and reported to be abundant in and closely associated with human fecal waste. To confirm bioinformatic predictions, 384 primer sets were designed along the length of the crAssphage genome. Based on initial screening, two novel crAssphage qPCR assays (CPQ_056 and CPQ_064) were designed and evaluated in reference fecal samples and water matrices. The assays exhibited high specificities (98.6%) when tested against an animal fecal reference library, and crAssphage genetic markers were highly abundant in raw sewage and sewage impacted water samples. In addition, CPQ_056 and CPQ_064 performance was compared to HF183/BacR287 and HumM2 assays in paired experiments. Findings confirm that viral crAssphage qPCR assays perform at a similar level to well-established bacterial human-associated fecal-source-identification approaches. These new viral-based assays could become important water quality management and research tools.

Organic Carbon Amendments for Enhanced Biological Attenuation of Trace Organic Contaminants in Biochar-Amended Stormwater Biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												This study sought to evaluate how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) affects attenuation of trace organic contaminants (TOrCs) in biochar-amended stormwater biofilters. It was hypothesized that (1) DOC-augmented runoff would demonstrate enhanced TOrC biodegradation and (2) biochar-amended sand bearing DOC-cultivated biofilms would achieve enhanced TOrC attenuation due to sorptive retention and biodegradation. Microcosm and column experiments were conducted utilizing actual runoff, DOC from straw and compost, and a suite of TOrCs. Biodegradation of TOrCs in runoff was more enhanced by compost DOC than straw DOC (particularly for atrazine, prometon, benzotriazole, and fipronil). 16S rRNA gene quantification and sequencing revealed that growth-induced microbial community changes were, among replicates, most consistent for compost-augmented microcosms and least consistent for raw runoff microcosms. Compost DOC most robustly enhanced utilization of TOrCs as carbon substrates, possibly due to higher residual nutrient levels upon TOrC exposure. Sand columns containing just 0.5 wt % biochar maintained sorptive TOrC retention in the presence of compost-DOC-cultivated biofilms, and TOrC removal was further enhanced by biological activity. Overall, these results suggest that coamendment with biochar and compost may robustly enhance TOrC attenuation in stormwater biofilters, a finding of significance for efforts to mitigate the impacts of runoff on water quality.

In vitro bioassays with limited key toxicological end points have been shown to be suitable to evaluate mixtures of organic pollutants in wastewater and recycled water. Omics approaches such as transcriptomics can monitor biological effects at the genome scale. However, few studies have applied omics approach in the assessment of mixtures of organic micropollutants. Here, an omics approach was developed for profiling bioactivity of 10 water samples ranging from wastewater to drinking water in human cells by a reduced human transcriptome (RHT) approach and dose-response modeling. Transcriptional expression of 1200 selected genes were measured by an Ampliseq technology in two cell lines, HepG2 and MCF7, that were exposed to eight serial dilutions of each sample. Concentration-effect models were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and to calculate effect concentrations (ECs) of DEGs, which could be ranked to investigate low dose response. Furthermore, molecular pathways disrupted by different samples were evaluated by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. The ability of RHT for representing bioactivity utilizing both HepG2 and MCF7 was shown to be comparable to the results of previous in vitro bioassays. Finally, the relative potencies of the mixtures indicated by RHT analysis were consistent with the chemical profiles of the samples. RHT analysis with human cells provides an efficient and cost-effective approach to benchmarking mixture of micropollutants and may offer novel insight into the assessment of mixture toxicity in water.

J	Packett, R				Packett, Robert			Rainfall contributes similar to 30% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen exported from a southern Great Barrier Reef river basin	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A study was conducted to estimate how much of the annual load of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from Great Barrier Reef (GBR) river basins could come from rainfall. Results suggest rainfall contributed similar to 37% of the average annual DIN load from the Fitzroy Basin over three wet seasons. Rainfall DIN contribution at plot to sub-catchment scale ranged from 5 to > 100% for study sites in the Fitzroy and Pioneer Basins. An estimate using measured and modelled data indicates similar to 28% of the longer-term average annual DIN load from the entire GBR catchment may originate from rainfall. These estimates may affect current GBR management and water quality targets. Numerous studies predict increases in atmospheric nitrogen pollution from Asia via fossil fuel combustion and more frequent severe La Nina events via global warming. Future GBR rainfall chemistry data may be required for assessing catchment management outcomes and regional trends in atmospheric DIN deposition.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					16	31		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.05.008								WOS:000407529200014	28521935

This is the fifth time that this study has been conducted as an initiative of the European Sea Ports Organisation (ESPO). The data and results are derived from the Self-Diagnosis Method (SDM), a concise checklist against which port managers can self-assess the environmental management of their port in relation to the performance of the EcoPorts membership. The SDM tool was developed in the framework of the ECOPORTS project (2002-2005) and it is managed by ESPO. A total number of 91 ports from 20 different European Maritime States contributed to this evaluation. The main results are that air quality remains as the top environmental priority of the respondent ports, followed by energy consumption and noise. In terms of environmental management, the study confirms that key components are commonly implemented in the majority of European ports. 94% of contributing ports have a designated environmental manager, 92% own an environmental policy and 82% implement an environmental monitoring program. Waste is identified as the most monitored issue in ports (80%), followed by energy consumption (73%) and water quality (70%).

Significance of beach geomorphology on fecal indicator bacteria levels	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Large databases of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) measurements are available for coastal waters. With the assistance of satellite imagery, we illustrated the power of assessing data for many sites by evaluating beach features such as geomorphology, distance from rivers and canals, presence of piers and causeways, and degree of urbanization coupled with the enterococci FIB database for the state of Florida. We found that beach geomorphology was the primary characteristic associated with enterococci levels that exceeded regulatory guidelines. Beaches in close proximity to marshes or within bays had higher enterococci exceedances in comparison to open coast beaches. For open coast beaches, greater enterococci exceedances were associated with nearby rivers and higher levels of urbanization. Piers and causeways had a minimal contribution, as their effect was often overwhelmed by beach geomorphology. Results can be used to understand the potential causes of elevated enterococci levels and to promote public health.

J	Karbassi, AR; Marefat, A				Karbassi, Abdolreza R.; Marefat, Ali			The impact of increased oxygen conditions on heavy metal flocculation in the Sefidrud estuary	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Similar to natural filters, estuaries are capable of removing considerable amounts of heavy metal from rivers that flow into saline water environments by turning the metal into flocs. The research objective was to investigate the self-purification potential of estuaries in removal of metal by flocculation processes. Hence, flocculation of metal was Studied experimentally in 5 aquaria with varying salinity levels. Subsequently, experiment was repeated while dissolved oxygen increased. Results indicated that at higher dissolved oxygen, the flocculation rates of Mn, Ni, and Pb increased by 9%, 20%, and 26%, respectively. However, Zn and Cu showed 23% and 26% of decrease in flocculation rate, respectively. In the analysis of the relationship between oxidation reduction potential and estuarine water quality it was found that ORP escalated with an increase in the dissolved oxygen. This finding suggests that ORP can be used to govern the potential of flocculation processes at estuarine zone.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					168	175		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.011								WOS:000407529200030	28601438

Effect of nutrient pollution on dinoflagellate cyst assemblages across estuaries of the NW Atlantic	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We analyzed surface sediments from 23 northeast USA estuaries, from Maine to Delaware, and nine estuaries from Prince Edward Island (PEI, Canada), to determine how dinoflagellate cyst assemblages varied with nutrient loading. Overall the abundance of cysts of heterotrophic dinoflagellates correlates with modeled nitrogen loading, but there were also regional signals. On PEI cysts of Gymnodiniwn microreticulatum characterized estuaries with high nitrogen loading while the sediments of eutrophic Boston Harbor were characterized by high abundances of Spinifentes spp. In Delaware Bay and the Delaware Inland Bays Polysphaeridiwn zohatyi correlated with higher temperatures and nutrient loading. This is the first study to document the dinoflagellate cyst eutrophication signal at such a large geographic scale in estuaries, thus confirming their value as indicators of water quality change and anthropogenic impact.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					339	351		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.024								WOS:000407529200049	28633948

The heterogeneity of the tropic-functional pattern of protozoan communities and its environmental drivers were studied in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea during a 1-year cycle. Samples were collected using the glass slide method at four stations within a water pollution gradient. A second-stage matrix-based analysis was used to summarize spatial variation in the annual pattern of the functional structure. A clustering analysis revealed significant variability in the trophic-functional pattern among the four stations during the 1-year cycle. The heterogeneity in the trophic-functional pattern of the communities was significantly related to changes in environmental variables, particularly ammonium-nitrogen and nitrates, alone or in combination with dissolved oxygen. These results suggest that the heterogeneity in annual patterns of protozoan trophic-functional structure may reflect water quality status in coastal ecosystems.																	0025-326X	1879-3363				AUG 15	2017	121	1-2					400	403		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.012								WOS:000407529200056	28624358

In this study, ten areas located along the western coast of the Korean Peninsula are investigated with respect to remotely sensed water quality indicators derived from NASA MODIS aboard of the satellite Aqua. We found that there was a strong seasonal trend with spatial heterogeneity. In specific, a strong six-month phase-lag was found between chlorophyll-a and total suspended solid owing to their inversed seasonality, which could be explained by different dynamics and environmental settings. Chlorophyll-a concentration seemed to be dominantly influenced by temperature, while total suspended solid was largely governed by local tidal forcing and bottom topography. This study demonstrated the potential and applicability of satellite products in coastal management, and highlighted find that remote-sensing would be a promising tool in resolving orthogonality of large spatio-temporal scale variabilities when combining with proper time series analyses.

Policymakers developed goals to reduce the area of hypoxic extent because of its ecological, economic, and commercial fisheries impacts. However, the goals remain elusive after 30 y of research and monitoring and 15 y of goal-setting and assessment because there has been little change in river nitrogen concentrations. An intergovernmental Task Force recently extended to 2035 the deadline for achieving the goal of a 5,000-km(2) 5-y average hypoxic zone and set an interim load target of a 20% reduction of the spring nitrogen loading from the Mississippi River by 2025 as part of their adaptive management process. The Task Force has asked modelers to reassess the loading reduction required to achieve the 2035 goal and to determine the effect of the 20% interim load reduction. Here, we address both questions using a probabilistic ensemble of four substantially different hypoxia models. Our results indicate that, under typical weather conditions, a 59% reduction in Mississippi River nitrogen load is required to reduce hypoxic area to 5,000 km(2). The interim goal of a 20% load reduction is expected to produce an 18% reduction in hypoxic area over the long term. However, due to substantial interannual variability, a 25% load reduction is required before there is 95% certainty of observing any hypoxic area reduction between consecutive 5-y assessment periods.

J	Chen, X; McGowan, S; Zeng, LH; Xu, L; Yang, XD				Chen, Xu; McGowan, Suzanne; Zeng, Linghan; Xu, Lei; Yang, Xiangdong			Changes in carbon and nitrogen cycling in a floodplain lake over recent decades linked to littoral expansion, declining riverine influx, and eutrophication	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study aimed to understand changes in the biogeochemical processing of organic matter (OM) in response to multiple stressors (e.g., littoral area expansion, wastewater input, and hydrological regulation) in East Dongting Lake (Central China) over the past 60 years, using analyses of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratios, delta C-13, delta N-15, and diatoms from 2 sediment cores collected from the littoral and central parts of the lake. OM mainly originated from phyto-plankton and C-3 plant-derived soil OM based on the ranges of C/N ratios (from 7 to 11) and delta C-13 (between - 27% and -23%). Littoral area expansion due to siltation caused an increasing influx of terrestrial soil OM in the 1980s and the 1990s, subsequently lowering delta C-13 values and rising C/N ratios in both sediment cores. Meanwhile, higher delta N-15 was linked to a high influx of isotopically heavy nitrate from urban and agricultural wastewaters. After 2000, slight decreases in TOC and TN in the littoral area were attributable to reducing inputs of external OM, likely linked to declining sediment influx from the upper reaches resulting from the Three Gorges Dam impoundment. Contrasting increases in TOC, TN, and C/N ratios in the central part indicated a high influx of terrestrial soil OM due to the declining distance from the shoreline with littoral area expansion. Declining delta N-15 values after 2000 indicated an increase in N-2-fixing cyanobacteria with eutrophication. Changes in diatom assemblages in both the littoral and central zones reflected nutrient enrichment and hydrological alterations. These results indicate that littoral expansion, declining riverine influx, and anthropogenic nutrient inputs are potential driving forces for the biogeochemical processing of OM in floodplain lakes. This study provides sedimentary biogeochemical clues for tracking past limnological conditions of floodplain lakes that are subjected to increasing disturbances from hydrological regulation and eutrophication.

In this work, a simple and novel DNAzyme-based SERS quadratic amplification method is developed for the detection of Pb2+. This strategy possesses some remarkable features compared to the conventional DNAzyme-based SERS methods, which are as follows: (i) Coupled DNAzyme-activated hybridization chain reaction (HCR) with bio barcodes; a quadratic amplification method is designed using the unique catalytic selectivity of DNAzyme. The SERS signal is significantly amplified. This method is rapid with a detection time of 2 h. (ii) The problem of high background induced by excess bio barcodes is circumvented by using magnetic beads (MBs) as the carrier of signal-output products, and this sensing system is simple in design and can easily be carried out by simple mixing and incubation. Given the unique and attractive characteristics, a simple and universal strategy is designed to accomplish sensitive detection of Pb2+. The detection limit of Pb2+ via SERS detection is 70 fM, with the linear range from 1.0x10(-13) M to 1.0x10(-7) M. The method can be further extended to the quantitative detection of a variety of targets by replacing the lead-responsive DNAzyme with other functional DNA.																	0039-9140	1873-3573				AUG 15	2017	171						185	189		10.1016/j.talanta.2017.04.049								WOS:000403511500025	28551127					
J	Sosa-Perez, G; MacDonald, LH				Sosa-Perez, Gabriel; MacDonald, Lee H.			Reductions in road sediment production and road-stream connectivity from two decommissioning treatments	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Unpaved forest roads can be an important source of sediment to streams. Road decommissioning is an increasingly common technique to eliminate these impacts, but few pre- and post-treatment studies have rigorously assessed its effectiveness. The objectives of this study in the northern Colorado Front Range were to: (1) quantify the effects of key variables on road sediment production before decommissioning; (2) quantify the changes over time in segment-scale sediment production from two decommissioning treatments (ripping only, and ripping plus mulching) versus untreated controls; and (3) quantify the factors affecting road-stream connectivity and the changes in connectivity due to decommissioning 12.3 km of roads. Median sediment production rate in the first year prior to decommissioning was 0.3 kg m(-2), but values varied from 0.0 kg m(-2) to 3.0 kg m(-2). Traffic, precipitation intensity, and road segment area had the greatest effects on road sediment production. In the first two years after decommissioning the median road sediment production was zero kg m(-2), as the furrows created by ripping trapped nearly all of the eroded sediment. Decommissioning also reduced road-stream connectivity from 12% of the total length to only 2%, with most of the connected segments being immediately adjacent to a stream. While both decommissioning treatments were effective, the ripping plus mulching treatment had visibly less surface erosion and no segment generated any measurable sediment. These results can help guide the design and quantify the benefits of future road decommissioning projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Presently, reverse osmosis (RO) processes are leading in global desalination with 53% share followed by thermally driven technologies 33%, but in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries their shares are 42% and 56% respectively due to severe feed water quality. In RO processes, intake, pretreatment and brine disposal cost 25% of total desalination cost at 30-35% recovery. We proposed a tri-hybrid system to enhance overall recovery up to 81%. The conditioned brine leaving from RO processes supplied to proposed multi evaporator adsorption cycle driven by low temperature industrial waste heat sources or solar energy. RO membrane simulation has been performed using WinFlow and IMSDesign commercial softwares developed by GE and Nitto. Detailed mathematical model of overall system is developed and simulation has been conducted in FORTRAN. The final brine reject concentration from tri-hybrid cycle can vary from 166,000 ppm to 222,000 ppm if RO retentate concentration varies from 45,000 ppm to 60,000 ppm. We also conducted economic analysis and showed that the proposed tri-hybrid cycle can achieve highest recovery, 81%, and lowest energy consumption, 1.76 kWh(elec)/m(3), for desalination reported in the literature up till now.

UV light and UV/H2O2 have been applied as pretreatment to control the fouling in ultrafiltration membranes. The results show that both pretreatments decreased 30-44% the transmembrane pressure (TMP), and consequently the membrane fouling. The removal of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by the membrane was improved by 31% in the case of UV/H2O2 pretreatment. The turbidity removal was improved more than 30% when both UV-based pretreatments were used. The removal of SUVA, which it is a measurement of the aromaticity of the EfOM, correlated well with the maximum TMP reached so, the reduction of SUVA can be an indicator of the membrane fouling reduction in order to assess other pretreatments. The application of these pretreatments can represents important savings in the operational costs related with the membrane cleaning procedures and maintenance. So, the application of UV-based pretreatments seems to be a promising technique to reduce the membrane fouling and to increase the water quality for water reuse applications.																	0376-7388	1873-3123				AUG 15	2017	536						141	147		10.1016/j.memsci.2017.04.070								WOS:000402008200016

In that context, a key difference between urban and natural areas lies in recharge evaluation. A large number of studies have been published since the 1990s that evaluate recharge in urban areas, with no specific methodology. Most of these methods show that there are generally higher rates of recharge in urban settings than in natural settings. Methods such as mixing ratios or ground water modeling can be used to better estimate the relative importance of different sources of recharge and may prove to be a good tool for total recharge evaluation. However, accurate evaluation of this input is difficult. The objective is to present a methodology to help overcome those difficulties, and which will allow us to quantify the variability in space and time of the recharge into aquifers in urban areas. Recharge calculations have been initially performed by defining and applying some analytical equations, and validation has been assessed based on groundwater flow and solute transport modeling. This methodology is applicable to complex systems by considering temporal variability of allwater sources. This allows managers of urban groundwater to evaluate the relative contribution of different recharge sources at a city scale by considering quantity and quality factors. The methodology is applied to the assessment of recharge sources in the Barcelona city aquifers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, XO; Tian, YM; Zhao, XH				Wang, Xiaoou; Tian, Yimei; Zhao, Xinhua			The influence of dual-substrate-layer extensive green roofs on rainwater runoff quantity and quality	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study investigates the ability of dual-substrate-layer extensive green roofs to retain rainwater and reduce pollutant leaching. The substrates in dual-substrate-layer green roofs consist of an upper organic nutrition layer for plant growth and a lower inorganic adsorption layer for water retention and pollutant reduction. One traditional single-substrate-layer extensive green roof was built for comparison with dual-substrate-layer green roofs. During the experimental period, dual-substrate-layer green roofs supported better natural vegetation growth, with coverage exceeding 90%, while the coverage in single-substrate-layer green roof was over 80%. Based on the average retention value of the total rainfall for four types of simulated rains (the total rainfall depth (mm) was 43.2, 54.6, 76.2 and 86.4, respectively), the dual-substrate-layer green roofs, which used the mixture of activated charcoal with perlite and vermiculite as the adsorption substrate, possessed better rainfall retention performance (65.9% and 55.4%) than the single-substrate-layer green roof (52.5%). All of the dual-substrate-layer green roofs appeared to be sinks for organics, heavy metals and all forms of nitrogen in all cases, while acted as sources of phosphorus contaminants in the case of heavy rains. In consideration of the factors of water retention, pollution reduction and service life of the green roof, a mixture of activated charcoal and/or pumice with perlite and vermiculite is recommended as the adsorption substrate. The green roofs were able to mitigate mild acid rain, raising the pH from approximately 5.6 in rainfall to 6.5-7.6 in green roof runoff. No signs of a first flush effect for phosphate, total phosphorus, ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, organics, zinc, lead, chromium, manganese, copper, pH or turbidity were found in the green roof runoff. Cost analysis further proved the practicability of dual-substrate-layer green roofs in retaining rainwater, and their long-term rainwater runoff quantity and quality performance in urban environments merit further investigation.

Alterations in stream morphology and hydrology, added to the effects of global climate change, are responsible for this phenomenon, that is particularly pernicious in mountainous lotic systems naturally characterized by coarse substrates. Among the studies investigating this issue some were descriptive, while others used artificial substrates to compare ongoing fine sediment accumulation and macro invertebrate assemblage recruitment. Other studies used from the outset artificial substrates arranged with different levels of clogging. Our study fits into this line, but adding an innovative element simulating different availability of coarse particulate organic matter, i.e. the main trophic input in low-order, mountainous stream. To investigate how clogging and CPOM can influence macroinvertebrate communities, we placed 135 artificial substrates in the upper Po river ( NW Italy). We set up a three way factorial design with three different levels of sedimentation and terrestrial leaf material. Artificial substrates were removed on three different dates. Benthic invertebrates were identified and classified according to their bio-ecological traits. We also measured macroinvertebrate dry mass and CPOM degradation in the different trap types. Our findings show that clogging acts as a selective filter influencing taxa richness, density, functional composition and biomass of benthic assemblage. Moreover, fine sediments affect the energetic dynamics in the river ecosystem, decreasing the mass loss rate of terrestrial leaves. Interestingly, our results clearly demonstrate that high availability of CPOM can buffer the negative effect of clogging, suggesting that an adequate input of allochthonous organic matter may lessen the impact of fine sediment deposition. Because land use transformation and removal of wooded riparian areas increase clogging and simultaneously reduces the input of CPOM, our findings stress the importance to include the management of river basins in the conservation strategies of mountainous streams.

J	Xiao, LW; Zhu, B; Kumwimba, MN; Jiang, SW				Xiao, Liwei; Zhu, Bo; Kumwimba, Mathieu Nsenga; Jiang, Shiwei			Plant soaking decomposition as well as nitrogen and phosphorous release in the water-level fluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The operating scheme of the Three Gorges Reservoir results in a summer drought in the water-level fluctuation zone during which plants grow vigorously. In the winter inundation season, soaking plants may decompose and release nutrients resulting in water quality deterioration. This study quantifies the contributions of the underwater decomposition of nine dominant plant species in the water-level fluctuation zone to nutrient release. The insitu litterbag technique was used to study for soaking decomposition over 200 days. All soaking plant species decomposed rapidly at an average rate of 1.99 +/- 0.33% d(-1) in the early stage of soaking (0 to 30 days) and at an average rate of only 0.07 +/- 0.04% d-1 in the later stage (30 to 200 days). After 200 days of soaking, the nine plant species released an average of 312.40 (+/-) 39.97 g kg(-1) organic carbon, 6.71 +/- 4.29 g kg(-1) of nitrogen and 2.25 +/- 1.25 g kg(-1) of phosphorus. A positive relationship was found between soaking plant decomposition rates and initial C/N ratios of 25 to 50, and a negative relationship where the C/N ratios were between 50 and 100. The amounts of total nitrogen or total phosphorus released were significantly negatively correlated with the initial C/N or C/P ratios of the plants. Among the studied plant species, Xanthium sibiricum Patr ex Widder showed high level of nutrient release via soaking decomposition. In contrast, Cynodon dactylon (Linn.) Pers. and Polygonum hydropiper exhibited low levels of nutrient release and are recommended as suitable species for the ecological restoration of the water-level fluctuation zone. Our results demonstrate that after 200 days of soaking plant decomposition, the loadings of total organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in thewater-level fluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir were 2942.1, 81.1, and 24.7 kg ha(-1), respectively and therefore could potentially damage the aquatic environment of the reservoir.

Benthic invertebrates, such as the crustacean Gammarus fossarum, are key in the functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and are frequently used as sentinel species of water quality status. The aim of this work was to study the effects of amixture of themost frequently detected surfactants in the bioconcentration kinetics of two pharmaceuticals in G. fossarum, evaluating their potential enhancing or suppressing effects. Laboratory exposure experiments for both pharmaceuticals and surfactants (concentration ratio 1: 25) were set up for two individual compounds, the anxiolytic oxazepam and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole. Gammarid samples were processed using microQuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) extraction. Pharmaceuticals concentration in the organisms was followed-up by means of nanoliquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). Results indicated a similar mode of action of the surfactants in the bioconcentration kinetics of both drugs, decreasing the accumulation rate in the organism. Oxazepam showed a higher accumulation potential than sulfamethoxazole in all cases. Depuration experiments for oxazepam also demonstrated the high depurative capacity of gammarids, eliminating N50% of the concentration of oxazepam in <6 h. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the spatio-temporal variabilities of inorganic N concentration (i. e., NO3-, NH4+) and total dissolved N (TDN) and identified their sources in waters and suspended matters using an isotopical approach in the Jinshui River, a river with a length of 87 km in the monsoon-climate region of China. The spatio-temporal inorganic N concentrations differed significantly along the longitudinal gradient in the river network. The NO3-, NH4+ and TDN concentrations ranged from 0.02 to 1.12 mg l(- 1), 0.03 to 4.28mg l(- 1), and 0.33 to 2.78 mg l(- 1), respectively. The N-15 tracing studies demonstrated that N in suspended organic matter was in the form of suspended particulate nitrogen (SPN) and was primarily from atmospheric deposition and agricultural fertilizer. In contrast, N in stream waters was mainly in the form of nitrate and was from atmospheric deposition, fertilizers, soil, and sewage. Meanwhile, both delta N-15- SPN and delta N-15-NO3- peaked in the rainy season (i. e., July) because of higher terrigenous sources via rain runoff, demonstrating the dominant diffusive N sources in the catchment. Thus, our results could provide critical information on N pollution control and sustainable watershed management of the riverine ecosystem in monsoon- climate region. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Monitoring water quality in Toronto's urban stormwater ponds: Assessing participation rates and data quality of water sampling by citizen scientists in the FreshWater Watch	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												From 2013 to 2015, citizen scientist volunteers in Toronto, Canada were trained to collect and analyze water quality in urban stormwater ponds. This volunteer sampling was part of the research program, FreshWater Watch (FWW), which aimed to standardize urban water sampling efforts from around the globe. We held training sessions for new volunteers twice yearly and trained a total of 111 volunteers. Over the course of project, similar to 30% of volunteers participated by collecting water quality data after the training session with 124 individual sampling events at 29 unique locations in Toronto, Canada. A few highly engaged volunteers were most active, with 50% of the samples collected by 5% of trainees. Stormwater ponds generally have poor water quality demonstrated by elevated phosphate concentrations (similar to 30 mu g/ L), nitrate (similar to 427 mu g/ L), and turbidity relative to Canadian water quality standards. Compared to other urban waterbodies in the global program, nutrient concentrations in Toronto's urban stormwater ponds were lower, while turbidity was not markedly different. Toronto FWW (FWW-TO) data was comparable to that measured by standard lab analyses and matched results from previous studies of stormwater ponds in Toronto. Combining observational and chemical data acquired by citizen scientists, macrophyte dominated ponds had lower phosphate concentrations while phytoplankton dominated ponds had lower nitrate concentrations, which indicates a potentially important and unstudied role of internal biogeochemical processes on pond nutrient dynamics. This experience in the FWW demonstrates the capabilities and constraints of citizen science when applied to water quality sampling. While analytical limits on in-field analyses produce higher uncertainty in water quality measurements of individual sites, rapid data collection is possible but depends on the motivation and engagement of the group of volunteers. Ongoing efforts in citizen sciencwill thus need to address sampling effort and analytical limits to fully realize the potential value of engaging citizen scientists in water quality sampling.

To investigate the ecological roles of periphyton and their symbiotic bacterial assemblages related to the control of cyanobacterial blooms, mesocosm experiments were performed in a eutrophic lake that is usually infested with harmful cyanobacterial blooms. Our results showed that periphyton, together with their symbionts, reduced Chl-alpha concentrations (up to 94%), improved water clarity and effectively controlled cyanobacterial blooms in the treatment mesocosm. Planktonic bacterial compositions varied greatly in the pre-bloom/bloom/post-bloom periods in both mesocosms and were mainly influenced by total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations. The phylum Cyanobacteria was the major component in the water samples until bloom peak, but it was replaced by Actinobacteria in the post-bloom period. However, periphyton niches were dominated by Alphaproteobacteria throughout the experiments, Cyanobacteria proportion being lower. Overall, the results indicated that periphyton and their unique bacterial partners could effectively compete with cyanobacteria and improve water quality. Their underlying interaction mechanism was also suggested to explain how periphyton and their symbionts can reduce cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic water.

The process-representation of the algal community model PRO-TECH was tested within the extended Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation framework which includes pre-defined Limits of Acceptability for simulations. Testing was a precursor to modification of the model for real-time forecasting of algal communities that will place different demands on the model in terms of a) the simulation accuracy required, b) the computational burden associated with the inclusion of forecast uncertainties and c) data assimilation. We found that the systematic differences between the model's representation of underwater light compared to the real lake systems studied and the uncertainties associated with nutrient fluxes will be the greatest challenges when forecasting algal blooms.

Chad			Evaluation of Bladed Skid Trail Closure Methods in the Ridge and Valley Region	FOREST SCIENCE												Forest roads and skid trails with inadequate best management practices (BMPs) often contribute the majority of erosion produced from forest harvesting operations. We evaluated soil erosion rates from bladed skid trails in the mountains of Virginia after a timber harvest. The randomized complete block design included six blocks, each containing four skid trail closure BMP treatments (waterbar only [Control], slash-covered [Slash], seeded [Seed], and seeded with fertilizer and mulch [Mulch]). Control treatments resulted in an average erosion rate of 6.8 tons ac(-1) yr(-1) (15.1 tonnes ha(-1) yr(-1)) following installation. Seed treatments resulted in an average erosion rate of 2.6 tons ac(-1) yr(-1) (5.9 tonnes ha(-1) yr(-1)). Mulch treatments averaged 0.5 ton ac(-1) yr(-1) (1.1 tonnes ha(-1) yr(-1)), and Slash treatments averaged 0.4 ton ac(-1) yr(-1) (0.8 tonnes ha(-1) yr(-1)). Seed, Mulch, and Slash treatments significantly reduced soil erosion rates in comparison to Control treatments (P = 0.0315), with Mulch and Slash treatments being most effective (P < 0.0001). Results indicate that ground cover treatments are beneficial in addition to waterbars for effective erosion control. A cost analysis indicates that Seed treatments are the most cost-effective ($ 2771.89/mi); however, on a basis of erosion prevented, Slash treatments were the most cost-effective ($ 73.65/ton).																	0015-749X	1938-3738				AUG 9	2017	63	4					432	440		10.5849/FS.2016-030R1								WOS:000416748600009

Data Descriptor: Long-term chloride concentrations in North American and European freshwater lakes	SCIENTIFIC DATA												Anthropogenic sources of chloride in a lake catchment, including road salt, fertilizer, and wastewater, can elevate the chloride concentration in freshwater lakes above background levels. Rising chloride concentrations can impact lake ecology and ecosystem services such as fisheries and the use of lakes as drinking water sources. To analyze the spatial extent and magnitude of increasing chloride concentrations in freshwater lakes, we amassed a database of 529 lakes in Europe and North America that had greater than or equal to ten years of chloride data. For each lake, we calculated climate statistics of mean annual total precipitation and mean monthly air temperatures from gridded global datasets. We also quantified land cover metrics, including road density and impervious surface, in buffer zones of 100 to 1,500m surrounding the perimeter of each lake. This database represents the largest global collection of lake chloride data. We hope that long-term water quality measurements in areas outside Europe and North America can be added to the database as they become available in the future.

Data Descriptor: Water quality measurements in San Francisco Bay by the US Geological Survey, 1969-2015	SCIENTIFIC DATA												The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) maintains a place-based research program in San Francisco Bay (USA) that began in 1969 and continues, providing one of the longest records of water-quality measurements in a North American estuary. Constituents include salinity, temperature, light extinction coefficient, and concentrations of chlorophyll-alpha, dissolved oxygen, suspended particulate matter, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, silicate, and phosphate. We describe the sampling program, analytical methods, structure of the data record, and how to access all measurements made from 1969 through 2015. We provide a summary of how these data have been used by USGS and other researchers to deepen understanding of how estuaries are structured and function differently from the river and ocean ecosystems they bridge.																	2052-4463					AUG 8	2017	4								170098	10.1038/sdata.2017.98								WOS:000407145400001	28786972

Results revealed that compared to photolysis, the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of the four sulfonamides were significantly enhanced with the addition of g-C3N4, and more than 90% of photodegradation removal was obtained. The effects of typical water quality parameters, including solution pH, bicarbonate ion and humic acid, on the photodegradation process were discussed. It was found that although the photodegradation of the four sulfonamides exhibited different trends under the variation of the water quality parameters, an excellent photocatalytic removal could always be achieved, illustrating the robustness and effectiveness of the g-C3N4 photodegradation process. The ESR measurements showed that both OH center dot and center dot O-2(-) were produced in the photocatalytic process of g-C3N4 under visible light irradiation. And trapping experiments confirmed that center dot O-2(-) and holes played a significant role in the photodegradation of SMX, SDZ and SMZ; but holes and OH center dot were the main oxidative species for SSX degradation. Finally, according to the oxidation products detected by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC/MS/MS), the degradation pathways of the four sulfonamides were proposed and compared. It was found that there were some common pathways shared by the different sulfonamides, such as cleavage of S-N bond and hydroxylation of the benzene ring (the main degradation pathways for SSX). More importantly, some specific photodegradation pathways were also identified: (1) the nitration of amino group on the benzene ring occurred for SMX, SDZ and SMZ (the main degradation pathway for SMX, SDZ and SMZ), but not for SSX; (2) the bond cleavage between benzene ring and S occurred only in degradation of SSX; and (3) the carboxylation of the methyl group occurred only in degradation of SMZ.

Habitat change mediates the response of coral reef fish populations to terrestrial run-off	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Coastal fish populations are typically threatened by multiple human activities, including fishing pressure and run-off of terrestrial pollution. Linking multiple threats to their impacts on fish populations is challenging because the threats may influence a species directly, or indirectly, via its habitats and its interactions with other species. Here we examine spatial variation in abundance of coral reef fish across gradients of fishing pressure and turbidity in Fiji. We explicitly account for multiple pathways of influence to test the alternative hypotheses that (1) habitat moderates predation by providing shelter, so habitat loss only affects prey fish populations if there are abundant predators, (2) habitat change co-drives biomass of both prey and predator functional groups. We examined responses of 7 fish functional groups and found that habitat change co-drives both predator and prey responses to turbidity. Abundances of all functional groups were associated with changes in habitat cover; however, the responses of their habitats to turbidity were mixed. Planktivore and piscivore abundance were lower in areas of high turbidity, because cover of their preferred habitats was lower. Invertivore, browser and grazer abundance did not change strongly over the turbidity gradient, because different components of their habitats exhibited both increases and decreases with turbidity. The effects of turbidity on fish populations were minor in areas where fish populations were already depleted by fishing. These findings suggest that terrestrial run-off modifies the composition of reef fish communities indirectly by affecting the benthic habitats that reef fish use.

The WASH targets and indicators for HCFs include: an improved water source on the premises accessible to all users, basic sanitation facilities, a hand washing facility with soap and water at all sanitation facilities and patient care areas. To establish viable targets for WASH in HCFs, investigation beyond 'access' is needed to address the state of WASH infrastructure and service provision. Patient and caregiver use of WASH services is largely unaddressed in previous studies despite being critical for infection control. Methods: The state of WASH services used by staff, patients and caregivers was assessed in 17 rural HCFs in Rwanda. Site selection was non-random and predicated upon piped water and power supply. Direct observation and semi-structured interviews assessed drinking water treatment, presence and condition of sanitation facilities, provision of soap and water, and WASH-related maintenance and record keeping. Samples were collected from water sources and treated drinking water containers and analyzed for total coliforms, E. coli, and chlorine residual. Results: Drinking water treatment was reported at 15 of 17 sites. Three of 18 drinking water samples collected met the WHO guideline for free chlorine residual of >0.2 mg/l, 6 of 16 drinking water samples analyzed for total coliforms met the WHO guideline of <1 coliform/100 mL and 15 of 16 drinking water samples analyzed for E. coli met the WHO guideline of <1 E. coli/100 mL. HCF staff reported treating up to 20 L of drinking water per day. At all sites, 60% of water access points (160 of 267) were observed to be functional, 32% of hand washing locations (46 of 142) had water and soap and 44% of sanitary facilities (48 of 109) were in hygienic condition and accessible to patients. Regular maintenance of WASH infrastructure consisted of cleaning; no HCF had on-site capacity for performing repairs. Quarterly evaluations of HCFs for Rwanda's Performance Based Financing system included WASH indicators. Conclusions: All HCFs met national policies for water access, but WHO guidelines for environmental standards including water quality were not fully satisfied. Access to WASH services at the HCFs differed between staff and patients and caregivers.

NuBBE(DB): an updated database to uncover chemical and biological information from Brazilian biodiversity	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The intrinsic value of biodiversity extends beyond species diversity, genetic heritage, ecosystem variability and ecological services, such as climate regulation, water quality, nutrient cycling and the provision of reproductive habitats it is also an inexhaustible source of molecules and products beneficial to human well-being. To uncover the chemistry of Brazilian natural products, the Nuclei of Bioassays, Ecophysiology and Biosynthesis of Natural Products Database (NuBBE(DB)) was created as the first natural product library from Brazilian biodiversity. Since its launch in 2013, the NuBBE(DB) has proven to be an important resource for new drug design and dereplication studies. Consequently, continuous efforts have been made to expand its contents and include a greater diversity of natural sources to establish it as a comprehensive compendium of available biogeochemical information about Brazilian biodiversity. The content in the NuBBE(DB) is freely accessible online (https://nubbe.iq.unesp.br/portal/nubbedb.html) and provides validated multidisciplinary information, chemical descriptors, species sources, geographic locations, spectroscopic data (NMR) and pharmacological properties. Herein, we report the latest advancements concerning the interface, content and functionality of the NuBBE(DB).

BUILDING QUALITY INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES FOR WATER AND SANITATION PROVIDERS IN LATIN AMERICA - EXAMPLES FROM GERMAN DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION	PERIODICO TCHE QUIMICA												The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) implements development cooperation projects in the area of quality infrastructure on behalf of the German government. In Latin America, it is currently cooperating with institutions in three countries Peru, Bolivia and Nicaragua in the field of water and sanitation. These three countries still face important challenges in water and sanitation provision in terms of service coverage, institutional development and enforcement of sector regulations. Furthermore, most service providers are not able to ensure the accuracy of quantity measurements or the reliability of water quality analysis. PTBs experience has proven that before project intervention water and sanitation is usually not in the focus of QI bodies. Even though some services or standards exist, they generally lack of direct interaction with the sector. Nonetheless, an example of project work in Bolivia shows that it is possible to bring the sector and QI bodies closer, through the development of specific services. Proof of success is the continuity of water utilities participating in annual proficiency tests and also the number of laboratories of water utilities being part of a sector accreditation program. The example from Peru, on the other hand, shows how the introduction of a new regulation for the control of the quality of industrial and commercial waste water released into the sewage system can be a driving force to bring QI bodies and the regulating institutions to work together.																	1806-0374	2179-0302				AUG	2017	14	28					18	22										WOS:000429409100002

The WQI is an important indicator of the relationship between use and land cover and water quality in a watershed. The purpose of this paper is to present a study of water quality of rivers Paraguagu, Joanes, Jacuipe, Ipitanga, which are responsible for the water supply for the population of metropolitan region of Salvador with more than three million inhabitants and highest population density Northeast North. Through this study we can conclude that there is a decrease in water quality in nearby points of urbanized areas due to lack of sanitation, as well as in areas where there is impairment of riparian vegetation cover.																	1806-0374	2179-0302				AUG	2017	14	28					23	29										WOS:000429409100003

Design: The Speak to Your Health Community Survey is a community-based participatory component of the health surveillance system in Genesee County, Michigan. This cross-sectional survey recruits participants from every residential Census Tract of the county and strives for demographic representativeness. Results: Respondents (n = 834) rated their tap water quality (taste, smell, appearance) as poor (36%), fair (18%), good (20%), very good (17%), and excellent (10%). They rated their sleep quality as poor (12%), fair (28%), good (39%), very good (18%), and excellent (4%), and had an average (SD) sleep length of 408 (90) minutes. Controlling for age, sex, years of education, and whether respondents were African American and Hispanic/Latino/a, lower perceived tap water quality was associated with lower sleep quality and shorter sleep length. Conclusion: Results indicate that adverse health conditions related to the water crisis extend beyond lead poisoning in children and include deterioration of sleep conditions among adult residents.

It is necessary to continuously monitor the progress of land cover/use recovery after disaster in order to sustain vegetation around estuarine and coastal areas. The purpose of this study was to assess the recovery progress of vegetation around estuarine and coastal areas after the Indian Ocean tsunami using a simplified method which consisting Google Earth and visual photo interpretation. Vegetation areas were able to be detected with high accuracy (80%-100%) using simplified method which consisting Google Earth and visual photo interpretation. We were able to show that all most of area including mangrove forests recovered relatively smoothly. However, the area which has a large vegetation areas have not enough recovered, which reached to half or less than half compare with before tsunami. This may be significant in affecting the role of the coastal ecosystem and bioshield. A large number of small mangrove patches (less than 0.1 ha) were able to found around ponds, a number that rapidly increased after the tsunami. Some site in 2013 was double that in 2004. Fish farmers might have planted them for supplying nutrients to ponds and maintain the water quality. Dozen years have passed since the 2004 tsunami, and it might be time to more focus on the recovery of large vegetation area.																	2087-0469	2089-2063				AUG	2017	23	2					81	89		10.7226/jtfm.23.2.81								WOS:000424506100004

Environmental assessment of two small scale wastewater treatment systems: SBR vs CAS	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												European Water Directive 91/271/EEC introduced a series of measures aimed at protecting sensitive areas against the emission of nutrients originating from waste water treatment plants. There are, however, environmental costs associated with achieving the required level of water quality, such as greenhouse gas emissions resulting from energy consumption. The goal of this study is to assess these environmental costs in an enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR)-sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system for a population equivalent (p.e.) of 45 people and compare it to a conventional activated sludge (CAS) system. For that purpose, three major environmental indicators have been estimated: the global warming potential (GWP); eutrophication potential (EP) and power consumption (PC). Moreover, two different functional units, one based on volume (m(3)) and the other on eutrophication reduction (kg PO4removed3-), were used to further determine sustainability. In this case study, the 45 p. e. EBPR-SBR showed a GWP of 150 kg CO2/kg PO4removed3-, an EP of 13.6 equivalent g PO43-/m(3) and a PC of 175 kWh/kg PO4removed3-. These values are below those obtained for a CAS system.																	1751-231X					AUG	2017	12	3					549	556		10.2166/wpt.2017.066								WOS:000424140400006

The SWMM hydrological model was calibrated and then used to predict the hydrograph and concentration graphs of surface runoff from a storm events based on weather forecasts. These results are used to decide how to operate the first flush treatment unit in the field by comparing water quality in the unit with that in runoff. This water quality monitoring system will also be used to reflect real-time field conditions, which will be used to improve the efficiency of the treatment system. The first flush treatment unit can be installed underground to use for storage of storm water. The system was tested against field data collected in a sub-basin of the Gwanpyung-cheon stream in Daejeon, Republic of Korea. Continuous monitoring results indicated that the first 4 hours of surface runoff exhibit higher concentrations than normal levels in the study site, and these levels can be used to determine the necessary volume for efficient treatment. When settling in the treatment system over 24 hours, the average removal efficiencies for TSS, TP and TN were 87.4%, 57.3%, and 43.6%, respectively.																	1751-231X					AUG	2017	12	3					557	563		10.2166/wpt.2017.065								WOS:000424140400007						
J	Masindi, V				Masindi, Vhahangwele			Integrated treatment of acid mine drainage using cryptocrystalline magnesite and barium chloride	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												This study endeavours to report the efficiency of a hybrid approach in the treatment of acid mine drainage. Cryptocrystalline magnesite was used to pre-treat acid mine drainage and barium chloride was used to remove the residual sulphate through the formation of barium sulphate. Batch experimental approach was adopted and the documented optimum conditions for both cryptocrystalline magnesite and barium salts were used. This was 60 mins for pre-treatment and 60 mins for polishing the residual sulphate. Water quality was assessed using ICP-MS and IC. Mineralogical composition was done using XRD, elemental composition with XRF, morphology with SEM and transmission electron microscope. Magnesite removed >99% of heavy metal species and 40% sulphate except for base cations. Barium managed to remove 99% of residual sulphate from an aqueous system. This indicate that the water meet the industrial, discharge and irrigation standards as stipulated by the water quality guidelines. As such, it can be concluded that this integrated approach can be used to treat acid mine drainage to useable standards as defined in the water quality guidelines. This will be a pragmatic approach for mining houses to curtail the impact of acid mine drainage by using natural and locally available materials such as cryptocrystalline magnesite and polish the water with barium salts.																	1751-231X					AUG	2017	12	3					727	736		10.2166/wpt.2017.074								WOS:000424140400023

Handling processes and transportation causes high stress in Nile tilapia. This study explores anesthetic effect and stress reduction of Alpinia galanga oil (AGO) on Nile tilapia. The anesthetic activity was evaluated by the time for fish induction to anesthesia and full recovery. It was found that the suitable dose of AGO that caused desirable anesthesia of Nile tilapia was 700 mg/L. This dose gave induction and recovery times of approximately 257 and 438 sec, respectively. Blood glucose and plasma cortisol of the fish anesthetized with AGO showed nearly normal levels indicating that the fish stress during handling was not increased. Study on loading densities of fish mimicked general fish transportation and showed that loading density of fish was a crucial factor on fish stress. The highest water quality was found in the lowest loading density of fish. Water containing AGO at a concentration of 150 mg/L showed significantly higher potential for reducing fish activity and water improvement than without AGO. Therefore, AGO is a promising natural edible plant oil for anesthesia in Nile tilapia.																	1881-7831	1881-784X				AUG	2017	11	4					186	192		10.5582/ddt.2017.01035								WOS:000416992600003	28867750

More particles accumulate as the intensity of recirculation increases thus potentially increasing the bacterial carrying capacity of the systems. Applying a recent, rapid, culture-independent fluorometric detection method (Bactiquant (R)) for measuring bacterial activity, the current study explored the relationship between total particle surface area (TSA, derived from the size distribution of particles > 5 mu m) and bacterial activity in freshwater RAS operated at increasing intensity of recirculation (feed loading from 0.043 to 3.13 kg feed m(-3) make-up water). Four independent sets of water samples from different systems were analyzed and compared including samples from: (i) two individual constructed wetlands treating the effluent system water from two commercial, freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) farms of different recirculation intensity; (ii) an 8.5 m(3) pilot scale RAS; and (iii) twelve identical, 1.7 m(3) pilot scale RAS assigned one of four micro-screen treatments (no micro-screen, 100, 60, or 20 mu m mesh size micro-screens) in triplicate. There was a strong, positive, linear correlation (p < 0.05) between TSA and bacterial activity in all systems with low to moderate recirculation intensity (i.e. feed loading <= 1 kg feed m(-3) make-up water). However, the relationship apparently ceased to exist in the systems with highest recirculation intensity (feed loading 3.13 kg feed m(-3) make-up water; corresponding to 0.32 m(3) make-up water kg(-1) feed). This was likely due to the accumulation of dissolved nutrients sustaining free-living bacterial populations, and/or accumulation of suspended colloids and fine particles less than 5 mu m in diameter, which were not characterized in the study but may provide significant surface area. Hence, the study substantiates that particles in RAS provide surface area supporting bacterial activity, and that particles play a key role in controlling the bacterial carrying capacity at least in less intensive RAS. Applying fast, culture-independent techniques for determining bacterial activity might provide a means for future monitoring and assessment of microbial water quality in aquaculture farming systems.

J	Montenegro, LA; Sharma, SK; Kennedy, MD				Montenegro, Luis Angel; Sharma, Saroj Kumar; Kennedy, Maria Dolores			Assessment of urban water supply in Managua, Nicaragua	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												This paper describes Managua's water supply system. It outlines key issues such as: the configuration of the system, number of household connections, water production and consumption, Non-revenue Water (NRW), service level, water tariff structure and the financial situation of the state-owned water utility (ENACAL). The analysis of the data collected shows that Nicaragua has reached 99% coverage of safe drinking water in urban areas and has met Target 7.C of the MDGs. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to provide a better level of service in terms of both water quality and continuity of supply. Managua city has a continuous water supply of between 3 and 24 h per day and some areas have long-term water shortages. The study also showed that ENACAL and its main water system (Managua) has a NRW above 50% and a non-cost recovery water tariff. This has created an unsustainable financial situation in the national water utility, which is reflected in the lack of maintenance and lack of replacement of old infrastructure, leading to a "vicious circle" of ineffective service and non-willingness to pay for water supply services. Without UWDM plans, measures or strategies in Managua, there is a low probability that ENACAL's financial situation will improve, making it unlikely that the current water service level will improve in Managua city.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				AUG	2017	87						120	130		10.5004/dwt.2017.21338								WOS:000415820700010						
J	Ekmekyapar, F; Cebi, UK				Ekmekyapar, Fsun; Cebi, Ulviye Kanburoglu			An investigation of inorganic chemicals and heavy metals in Kirklareli Dam water, Thrace region	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												This study provides a baseline for the assessment of the inorganic pollution, especially metal contamination, in the waters of the Kirklareli dam on the Ergene River basin. A survey of inorganic chemicals was performed in water samples collected from the Kirklareli dam reservoirs in 2014-2015. Water samples from five sampling sites were collected and analyzed for 12 different water quality parameters. Using these data, regional irrigation water quality was assessed via a method prescribed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Results from the application of this method indicated that the salinity of the dam water, as represented by electrical conductivity (ECw), was at a medium level (C2: 250-750 micromhos cm(-1)), and that the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) ranged from medium (S2: 10-18) to high (S3: 18-26) sodicity. Therefore, the dam water from the sampling sites of 1, 3, 4, and 5 was predominantly of the C2-S2 class. Cation concentrations were found to be higher in January than in the other months. In examining the water quality classes in terms of measured physico-chemical parameters, the dam water was determined to be class I for pH, EC, TSS and cations. Furthermore, the results showed that the Pb concentrations in the Kirklareli dam water (10-200 mu g L-1) were of the class IV quality, which is the maximum limit of the Turkish Water Pollution Control Regulations. The Fe and Mn concentrations in the dam water were class II.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				AUG	2017	87						306	313		10.5004/dwt.2017.21316								WOS:000415820700028

This study describes a methodology to obtain the best performance for multiple LID units under varying by time-to-peak of storm with the same intensity and duration using storm water management model (SWMM), a popular model for rainfall-runoff and water quality simulation. The hypothetical temporal distributions were designated by Huff curves, which provided characterizing storm mass curves, along with the relationship of intensity-duration-frequency to determine storm intensity for 1-h in 2-year return period. Three types of LID units (rain barrel, infiltration trench, and vegetative swale) were selected to develop aggregate LID scenarios using the SWMM. The results indicated that, when compared with other field experiments, the SWMM successfully estimated change in flow discharge and suspended solid (SS) loss reflecting different storm patterns at the final outlet of and urbanized sub-catchment as well as the effects of LID practices. The performances of aggregate LID scenarios including lag time of peak runoff, peak runoff reduction, volume reduction, and SS loss reduction were sensitive to arrangement order and time-of-storm peak-to-storm duration. Scenario 5, which had the order of vegetative swale, rain barrel, and infiltration trench, showed the most effective serial arrangement, as it exhibited the more consistent results across the storm patters. This study thus provides insights into the effective design of aggregate LID scenarios considering different storm characteristics.

J	Gibellini, S; Sorlini, S; Gomez, AP				Gibellini, Silvia; Sorlini, Sabrina; Gomez, Andrea Pollmann			CRITICAL ISSUES CONCERNING DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION MANAGEMENT IN VILANCULOS (MOZAMBIQUE)	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL												The research work aimed at analysing the drinking water quality in Vilanculos (Mozambique) and at investigating the influence of poor sanitation management on drinking water quality. The purpose was to understand the reasons of water source contamination and re-contamination in the water supply chain, in order to define strategies to control source contamination and to suggest practical ways for reducing the risk of recontamination. A first phase of microbiological drinking water quality monitoring allowed identifying the most critical areas to be valued in a next sanitation assessment activity, carried out by means of interviews to stakeholders and by direct observation. The microbiological analysis carried out at the source showed that only in few cases there is compliance of water samples with the standard limit for all microbiological parameters. It was also found that the cases of compliance with the regulatory limit decrease moving from the source to the consumer, meaning improper hygiene habits in the supply chain. Microbiological contamination shows a potential danger for the health of consumers. As regards excreta and wastewater management, a prevalence of unimproved sanitation facilities with direct infiltration into the ground and a bad management of septic tanks were identified. In order to improve population's health conditions, a preventive approach should be implemented, including both the improvement of the structural characteristics of latrines and their management and the improvement of water supply infrastructures. Moreover, good practices at the household level resulted to be an important strategy to preserve water microbiological quality.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				AUG	2017	16	8					1701	1708										WOS:000415723000007

Groundwater salinization in Graciosa and Pico islands (Azores archipelago, Portugal): processes and impacts	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Graciosa and Pico islands, Azores, Portugal Study focus: Seawater intrusion is a main driver of groundwater salinization in the Azores archipelago. In order to characterize the associated geochemical processes through major-ion and determination of stable (delta O-18; delta H-2; delta B-11) and radiogenic isotopic ratios (delta(87) Sr) a total of 46 wells were sampled in Graciosa and Pico, as well as 51 wells from other islands. New hydrological insights for the region: The overall groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by Cl and Na, which account respectively for 10.4%-46.9% and 16%-39.7% of the relative major-ion content. Mean electrical conductivity (EC) in Graciosa is in the range 308 - 3462 mu S/cm, while hand-dug wells in Pico are highly mineralized (1758-9732 mu S/cm). Drilled wells in Pico are in the range of 186 mu S/cm to 5625 mu S/cm. Besides mixture with seawater, groundwater chemistry is also influenced by dissolution of silicate minerals which also contributes to water composition. Moreover, O-18 and H-2 stable isotope data show that a few samples depict an evaporative effect, resulting in heavier isotopic compositions besides mixing with a marine source. About 70% of the wells in Graciosa and Pico exceed the 200 mg Cl/L and the EC Portuguese reference values, severely constraining water supply. The impact on water quality is also shown by exceedances of the groundwater threshold values derived for the Azores River Basin District (89%).

Use of water quality surrogates to estimate total phosphorus concentrations in Iowa rivers	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The study was focused on total phosphorus (TP) concentrations measured in rivers in Iowa, a Midwestern state located in the central United States. Study focus: Accurate measurement of TP concentrations in rivers is needed to quantify loads and evaluate the progress of nutrient reduction strategies. We evaluated the relation of water quality surrogates, turbidity, orthophosphorus (OP), chlorophyll a, chloride and discharge to TP concentrations at 43 different river monitoring sites over a 15-year period. New hydrological insights for the region: TP concentrations were highly correlated to turbidity (0.78 +/- 0.20) and OP (0.69 +/- 0.13) across all sites and less correlated to chlorophyll a (0.07 +/- 0.15), chloride (-0.10 +/- 0.24) and discharge (0.41 +/- 0.23). When the regression models included OP as a variable, the mean r(2) for all 43 sites was 0.90 +/- 0.08 and ten of the 43 sites had r2 values greater than 0.95. When OP was excluded in the regression model, the overall mean r2 values decreased to 0.72 +/- 0.14 and for six of the river sites, the r2 value decreased by 50%. Other variables (discharge, chlorophyll a, chloride) were included in the regression equations on a case-by-case basis. Including OP in the regression models was critically important for rivers draining the tile-drained Des Moines Lobe region.																	2214-5818					AUG	2017	12						111	121		10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.04.006								WOS:000415815000007

Study focus: Cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the western United States generally pose challenges to water quality, often through mobilization of salts and trace metals by irrigation. However, in the Arkansas River Basin of Colorado, patchy exposure of multiple Cretaceous formations has made it difficult to identify which formations are most problematic. This paper examines water quality in surface-water inflows along a 26-km reach of the Arkansas River relative to the presence or absence of the Cretaceous Niobrara Formation within the watershed. New hydrological insights for the region: Principal component analysis (PCA) shows Niobrarainfluenced inflows have distinctive geochemistry, particularly with respect to Na, Mg, SO42-, and Se. Uranium concentrations are also greater in Niobrara-influenced inflows. During the irrigation season, median dissolved solids, Se, and U concentrations in Niobrara-influenced inflows were 83%, 646%, and 55%, respectively, greater than medians where Niobrara Formation surface exposures were absent. During the non-irrigation season, which better reflects geologic influence, the differences were more striking. Median dissolved solids, Se, and U concentrations in Niobrara-influenced inflows were 288%, 863%, and 155%, respectively, greater than median concentrations where the Niobrara Formation was absent. Identification of the Niobrara Formation as a disproportionate source for dissolved solids, Se, and U will allow for more targeted studies and management, particularly where exposures underlie irrigated agriculture.

J	Yehia, M; Baghdady, A; Howari, FM; Awad, S; Gad, A				Yehia, Mohamed; Baghdady, Ashraf; Howari, Fares M.; Awad, Samir; Gad, Ahmed			Natural radioactivity and groundwater quality assessment in the northern area of the Western Desert of Egypt	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												The chemical composition and natural radioactivity of the northern area of the western desert groundwater were determined to evaluate hydrogeochemical facies and assess groundwater quality for different uses. Many the groundwater samples belong to the Na+ - Cl-, Na2SO4- type, followed by Ca2+ - Mg2+ - Cl- type. Only a few samples are of the Na+ - HCO3- type. The spatial distributions of the major ions describe similar anomalies, with the highest concentrations found at the extreme northeastern margin of the oasis, as well as in its northern and northwestern parts. Fe is the most abundant toxic metal, followed by Cu and Mn. Anomalies of Cr, Ni and Zn are also detected. Rock/water interactions strongly affect the chemical composition of the groundwater. Dissolution and cation exchange are the main processes controlling the hydrogeochemistry. Most of the irrigation groundwater problems in the study area may be resolved using an effective drainage system. The estimated total annual dose due to ingestion of U-238, Th-232 and K-40 in groundwater samples reveals that the groundwater is safe for human consumption. However, the toxic metal content of the Bahariya groundwater exceeds the permissible levels for both irrigation and consumption, and the water must be filtered through suitable membranes to exclude these toxic metals. Regular monitoring of the quality of this water for drinking is strictly required.

J	Miller, JD; Hutchins, M				Miller, James D.; Hutchins, Michael			The impacts of urbanisation and climate change on urban flooding and urban water quality: A review of the evidence concerning the United Kingdom	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: United Kingdom (UK). Study focus: Climate change and urbanization pose significant threats for flooding and water quality in urban areas. This paper reviews the evidence concerning the combined impacts of urbanisation and climate on the urban water environment of inland catchments of the United Kingdom and assesses the degree of confidence in reported directions of change and response. It also assesses the utility of the evidence for setting environmental legislation and managing the urban water environment in the future and identifies knowledge gaps that limit effective and management interventions. New hydrological insights: There is a lack of nationally research focused on the dual impacts of climate change and urbanisation on flooding and water quality in UK urban areas. This is despite there being a clear acceptance that flood risk is increasing, water quality is generally not meeting desirable levels, and that combined population and climate change projections pose a pressing challenge. The available evidence has been found to be of medium-high confidence that both pressures will result in (i) an increase in pluvial and fluvial flood risk, and (ii) further reduction in water quality caused by point source pollution and altered flow regimes. Evidence concerning urban groundwater flooding, diffuse pollution and water temperature was found to be more sparse and was ascribed a low-medium confidence that both pressures will further exacerbate existing issues. The confidence ascribed to evidence was also found to reflect the utility of current science for setting policy and urban planning. Recurring factors that limit the utility of evidence for managing the urban environment includes: (i) climate change projection uncertainty and suitability, (ii) lack of sub-daily projections for storm rainfall, (iii) the complexity of managing and modelling the urban environment, and (iv) lack of probable national-scale future urban land use projections. Suitable climate products are increasingly being developed and their application in applied urban research is critical in the wake of a series of extreme flooding events across the UK and timely for providing state-of-the-art evidence on which to base possible future water quality legislation in a post Brexit-WFD era.

J	Baumber, A				Baumber, Alex			Enhancing ecosystem services through targeted bioenergy support policies	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												While policy-makers in the bioenergy sector have paid considerable attention over the past decade to the risks that energy cropping can pose to forests, soils and food security, there has been less focus on how bioenergy policies can be designed to enhance ecosystem services. Some perennial energy crops have demonstrated the potential to provide habitat for biodiversity, improve soil health, enhance water quality, mitigate dryland salinity and sequester carbon. While much uncertainty exists around which forms of energy cropping might deliver these benefits, opportunities exist to preferentially support beneficial energy crops through the adaptation of existing bioenergy policies. This article provides a global review of bioenergy policy instruments that identifies existing and potential mechanisms for promoting the enhancement of ecosystem services. While many existing bioenergy support policies promote fuel supply (a provisioning service) and climate change mitigation (a regulating service), it is less common for bioenergy policies to actively enhance ecosystem services such as habitat provision, soil improvement and water regulation. Further opportunities to promote these ecosystem services exist through structured tax concessions, sub-mandates, banding and renewable energy auctions, but careful consideration needs to be given to trade-offs between services, risks of disservices and the need for complementary nonenergy policies.

Building the bridge between ecosystem services research and practice	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												There is growing demand for information regarding the impacts of decisions on ecosystem services and human benefits. Despite the large and growing quantity of published ecosystem services research, there remains a substantial gap between this research and the information required to support decisions. Research often provides models and tools that do not fully link social and ecological systems; are too complex, specialized, and costly to use; and are targeted to outcomes that differ from those needed by decision makers. Decision makers require cost-effective, straightforward, transferable, scalable, meaningful, and defensible methods that can be readily understood. We provide illustrative examples of these gaps between research and practice and describe how researchers can make their work relevant to decision makers by using Benefit Relevant Indicators ( BRIs) and choosing models appropriate for particular decision contexts. We use examples primarily from the United States, including cases that illustrate varying degrees of success in closing these gaps. We include a discussion of the challenges and opportunities researchers face in adapting their work to meet the needs of practitioners. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Review of Epidemiological Studies of Drinking-Water Turbidity in Relation to Acute Gastrointestinal Illness	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												BACKGROUND: Turbidity has been used as an indicator of microbiological contamination of drinking water in time-series studies attempting to discern the presence of waterborne gastrointestinal illness; however, the utility of turbidity as a proxy exposure measure has been questioned. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a review of epidemiological studies of the association between turbidity of chinking-water supplies and incidence of acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI), including a synthesis of the overall weight of evidence. Our goal was to evaluate the potential for causal inference from the studies. METHODS: We identified 14 studies on the topic (distinct by region, time period and/or population). We evaluated each study with regard to modeling approaches, potential biases, and the strength of evidence. We also considered consistencies and differences in the collective results. DISCUSSION: Positive associations between drinking-water turbidity and AGI incidence were found in different cities and time periods, and with both unfiltered and filtered supplies. There was some evidence for a stronger association at higher turbidity levels. The studies appeared to adequately adjust for confounding. There was fair consistency in the notable lags between turbidity measurement and AGI identification, which fell between 6 and 10 d in many studies. CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations suggest a detectable incidence of waterborne AGI from drinking water in the systems and time periods studied. However, some discrepant results indicate that the association may be context specific. Combining turbidity with seasonal and climatic factors, additional water quality measures, and treatment data may enhance predictive modeling in future studies.																	0091-6765	1552-9924				AUG	2017	125	8							UNSP 086003	10.1289/EHP1090								WOS:000413790600009	28886603

The Case for Universal Screening of Private Well Water Quality in the US and Testing Requirements to Achieve It: Evidence from Arsenic	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES												BACKGROUND: The 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) regulates >170,000 public water systems to protect health, but not >13 million private wells. State and local government requirements for private well water testing are rare and inconsistent; the responsibility to ensure water safety remains with individual households. Over the last two decades, geogenic arsenic has emerged as a significant public health concern clue to high prevalence in many rural American communities. OBJECTIVES: We build the case for universal screening of private well water quality around arsenic, the most toxic and widespread of common private water contaminants. We argue that achieving universal screening will require policy intervention, and that testing should be made easy, accessible, and in many cases free to all private well households in the United States, considering the invisible, tasteless, odorless, and thus silent nature of arsenic. DISCUSSION: Our research has identified behavioral, situational and financial barriers to households managing their own well water safety, resulting in far from universal screening despite traditional public health outreach efforts. We observe significant socioeconomic disparities in arsenic testing and treatment when private water is unregulated. Testing requirements can he a partial answer to these challenges. CONCLUSIONS: Universal screening, achieved through local testing requirements complemented by greater community engagement targeting biologically and socioeconomically vulnerable groups, would reduce population arsenic exposure greater than any promotional efforts to date. Universal screening of private well water will identify the dangers hidden in America's drinking water supply and redirect attention to ensure safe water among affected households.																	0091-6765	1552-9924				AUG	2017	125	8							UNSP 085002	10.1289/EHP629								WOS:000413790600002	28893720

The parameters analysed were compared with the National Water Quality Standards Malaysia (NWQS) and Drinking Water Quality Standards. The parameters that were tested in the analysis of rainwater were temperature, pH, turbidity, total suspended solid (TSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oygen demand (COD), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), Total Coliforms and Escherichia coli. The study showed that all parameters conform to the standard set by National Water Quality Standards Malaysia (NWQS) and Drinking Water Quality Standards. The results showed that temperature, pH, turbidity, TSS, DO, BOD, COD and NH3-N mean values are 26.2 degrees C-28.6 degrees C, 6.18-6.36, 0.93-3.06 ntu, 1.0-4.6 mg/L, 6.21-8.29 mg/L, 0.21-0.43 mg/L, 3-7 mg/L and 0.01-0.47mg/L, respectively. Meanwhile the Total Coliform and Escherichia coli are below the maximum limit set by the Drinking Water Quality Standards. According to the Water Quality Index (IKA), the quality of rainwater in the study area is in class IIA for sampling point T1 and T2 and turned into class I after undergoing filtration treatment at sampling point T3. The result showed that the rainwater is safe to be used for their daily activities.																	0126-6039					AUG	2017	46	8					1211	1219		10.17576/jsm-2017-4608-06								WOS:000415048400006

This study focuses on the water quality of a lake based on rehabilitation work completed in 2014. This lake suffers from eutrophication and water quality degradation due to the increase in pollution rates and water source scarcity. Nine points were selected to represent the water quality status for the study area. Two river tributaries that pass through the University Malaya (UM) campus have been considered due of its potential as a water source for the lake. Field and laboratory analysis were conducted to understand the transport of water quality parameters. The data variations were analyzed using a multivariate statistical method to determine the significant differences between the lake and river. Based on the Malaysian Water Quality Index (WQI) and cluster analysis, the results indicated that the lake and river have different physico-chemical characteristics and the lake water has a better quality than the river. Comparison of the concentration for BOD, TSS, PO43- and NO3- between year 2009 and current study proved that the water quality has improved by 99.8% proving that the lake remediation is effective.																	0126-6039					AUG	2017	46	8					1221	1229		10.17576/jsm-2017-4608-07								WOS:000415048400007

Canonical correlation analysis to predict relative prosperity was performed for selected 110 nations with the focus on Romania and Slovenia. The study results for Romania for 2011 indicate low approval of the government, low confidence in the judicial system as well as in financial institutions, in addition to concerns about health prospects and lack of confidence in the transparency of elections for the loving construct. In addition, the being construct is also negative in Romania suggesting overall dissatisfaction with the economic status and development, indicating strong dissatisfaction with governmental efforts to address poverty and efforts regarding sanitation, concerns about environment, existing standard of living and life expectancy, suggesting a weak health system. The study further suggests for Slovenia for 2011 negative expectations for the loving construct and below average expectations for the being construct. The approval of the government and confidence in the judicial system and financial institutions in Slovenia is also low, the only positive expectation is the confidence in electoral system, but Slovenians are also worried about their health prospects. In addition, the being construct for Slovenia is also slightly below average, indicating dissatisfaction with economic development and below average satisfaction with water quality and environment, and life expectancy suggesting health system inefficiency. The longitudinal study for the time period from 2011 till 2016 suggests moderate improvements for Romania in eight areas of relative prosperity, especially for the natural environment, governance and education, and for Slovenia practically unchanged situation. The study further suggests that both nations still face numerous challenges but due to implementation of certain structural reforms till 2016, albeit limited, some additional improvements regarding the economic prosperity of their citizens could be expected in the near future.																	1582-9146	2247-9104				AUG	2017	19	46					822	835										WOS:000413856000015

Deep-sea environments are more vulnerable to decreasing pH since sediments in deep oceans below the carbonate compensation depth (CCD) are often completely devoid of carbonate particles. In order to assess the potential risk of heavy metal release from deep-sea deposits, the mobility of elements from ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) nodules and pelagic clays was examined by means of leaching experiments using phosphate buffer solutions ranging in pH from 7.1 to 8.6 (NBS scale). With decreasing pH, the results showed an enhanced leaching of elements such as Li, B, Mg, Si, Sc, Sr, Ba, Tl, and U, but a reduced leaching of V, Cu, Mo, Cd, and W. Elements in leachates originate mainly from exchangeable fractions, and tend to be affected by sorption-desorption processes. Concentrations of most elements did not exceed widely used international water quality criteria, indicating that changes in pH caused by future ocean acidification may not increase the risk of heavy metal release during deep-sea nodule mining operations.

Pilot-scale drinking water treatment plant: effects of disinfection alternatives and filtration systems	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												A pilot-scale drinking water treatment plant was designed and manufactured to control disinfection by-product (DBP) levels through better removal of natural organic matter (NOM) and the application of disinfectant alternatives that produce lower DBPs levels. The designed pilot plant consists of several stages including disinfection (by chlorine, chlorine dioxide, or ozone), coagulation-flocculation (using alum or alum + cationic polymer), and a sedimentation and gravity filtration system, such as sand or granular activated carbon (GAC). The efficiency of the designed plant was evaluated according to the water quality produced in terms of turbidity, pH, alkalinity, total organic carbon, and ultraviolet absorption at 254 nm (UV254), phytoplankton, and DBP levels. Improved reductions of turbidity, algae, and NOM, and consequently lower DBP levels, could be obtained. The lowest DBPs levels were obtained through the treatment sequence: ClO2/modified coagulation/GAC, due to the combination of the high oxidation powers of ClO2 with the high adsorption capacity of GAC.

The influences of ions (Mg2+, SO42-, PO43-, SiO32-, Cl- and H+) on the performance of HPMA against CaCO3 scale are investigated by conducting static test. The effect of the mass ratio (beta = [HPMA]/[CaCO3]) on the performance of HPMA against CaCO3 scale is also studied. The effect of HPMA on the crystals of CaCO3 is examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results can be summarized as follows: the effect of beta on the performance of HPMA against CaCO3 scale mainly depends on CaCO3 concentration; the presence of Mg2+, SO42-, PO43- and SiO32- can change adsorption equilibrium of carboxyl ion of HPMA onto the CaCO3 crystal growth sites; both SO42- and SiO32- can enhance the performance of HPMA, but SiO32- causes performance declining in the presence of PO43- ; the presence of PO43- and Mg2+ may weaken the performance; Cl-can improve the performance and this effect increases with increasing Cl-concentration; pH value has a remarkable influence on the performance; SEM morphologies of CaCO3 scale are distorted with dosage of HPMA; Ca-HPMA formation is confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectra.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				AUG	2017	85						36	45		10.5004/dwt.2017.21280								WOS:000412882200005

Membrane distillation techniques provide high quality permeate from this insanitary source. However, grey water contains surfactants present in the form of linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) that reduces the contact angle between the feed solution and the membrane surface leads to the wetting phenomenon. Electro-coagulation (EC) with aluminium electrodes has been demonstrated as an effective technology that removes LAS significantly. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of the current density and circulation rate of EC unit on the permeate water quality. For this purpose, synthetic grey water was treated at different operating conditions. It has been shown that, only after 12 min of EC, the turbidity, total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, electrical conductivity and faecal coliforms were reduced by an average 94.4%, 89.9%, 83.8%, 71.0%, 73.1%, 96.1%, 30.2% and 1.32log, respectively. The EC permeate was sent to the solar powered vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) to produce pure water. Photovoltaic panels and a thermal collector supplied electricity and heat, respectively, for the combination of EC and VMD in order to use renewable energy.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				AUG	2017	85						46	54		10.5004/dwt.2017.21024								WOS:000412882200006

Pollution parameters were analyzed including pH, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solids, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates and fecal coliform. All parameters of drains exceeded the permissible level of wastewater standards. Hudiara drain showed the highest pollution load in terms of COD: 429.86 t/d while in Babu Sabu drain, highest pollution load was calculated in terms of BOD: 162.82 t/d. Lab-scale treatment (oxidation ponds) was designed to treat the wastewater of the Babu Sabu drain, through combination of different algae species, namely Chaetomorpha sutoria, Sirogonium sticticum and Zygnema sp. Two different size ponds (horizontal and vertical), and three different concentration of algal samples (25, 50 and 75 g/3 L) were selected for 6 d retention time. Percentage removal efficiencies of parameters in vertical and horizontal ponds, that is, turbidity: 62.12%, 69.79%; EC: 79.3%, 83%; BOD: 86.6%, 88.5%; COD: 79.72%, 83.01%; FC: 100%, 100%; nitrates: 89.6%, 89.8%; sulfates: 96.9%, 97%; phosphates: 85.3%, 86.3% and TOC: 75.6%, 79% were observed, respectively. Maximum reduction was observed after day 6 in the 50 g/3 L algae setup in horizontal pond due to large surface area. Results concluded that algae-based treatment is the most energy efficient and cost-effective in improving water quality in drains.

A case study was performed to understand the influence of land use on the quality of surface water. Water quality indices of surface water from different locations within study area were compared with the land use pattern of that location. Multi-criteria decision-making methods, like weighted sum method, weighted product method and grey relational analysis, were used to determine the priority values (PV) of the different water quality parameters on the basis of important criteria like hazard potential, cost of mitigation, utilization potential and popularity among the researchers. Water quality indices of the samples were calculated from those PV by weighted average method. The indices were then compared with respective land use pattern to assess the relation between land use pattern and water quality. The results suggest that dense settlement, moderate to low vegetation and dense cultivation is good for surface water, whereas low settlement, dense vegetation and moderate cultivation is bad for surface water. These findings may be useful for managers and policy makers to manage land use for maintaining the optimum quality of surface water.

Investigating trade-offs between water quality and agricultural productivity using the Land Utilisation and Capability Indicator (LUCI)-A New Zealand application	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												Concern for the impacts of rural land-use intensification on ecosystem services is growing world-wide, especially with regard to water quality management. The Land Utilisation & Capability Indicator (LUCI) is a GIS framework that considers impacts of land use on multiple ecosystem services in a holistic and spatially explicit manner. Due to its fine spatial scale and focus on the rural environment, LUCI is well-placed to help both farm and catchment managers to explore and quantify spatially explicit solutions to improve water quality while also maintaining or enhancing other ecosystem service outcomes. LUCI water quality and agricultural productivity models were applied to a catchment in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources, sinks and pathways in the landscape were identified and trade-offs and synergies between water quality and agricultural productivity were investigated. Results indicate that interventions to improve water quality are likely to come at the expense of agriculturally productive land. Nonetheless, loss of agriculturally productive land can be minimised by using LUCI to identify, at a fine spatial scale, the most appropriate locations for nutrient intervention. Spatially targeted and strategic nutrient source management and pathway interception can improve water quality, while minimising negative financial impacts on farms. Our results provide spatially explicit solutions to optimize agricultural productivity and water quality, which will inform better farm, land and catchment management as well as national and international policy.

The pollution tolerance index (PTI) and saprobic index (SI) use diatoms to assess the health of aquatic ecosystems. We collected epilithic diatoms from the Pazarsuyu Stream located in the Turkish province of Giresun between June 2014 and May 2015 to assess the water quality using the four types of diatom indices which consist of BDI, TDI, PTI, SI. A total of 49 taxa were identified as belonging to the class of Bacillariophyceae. The reference site affected by domestic waste contained Ulnaria ulna (Nitzsch) Compere, Navicula radiosa Kutzing and Encyonerna niinuturn (Hilse) D.G.Mann. The water quality of the site had average BDI values ranging between 14.2 and 14.5 and average TDI values between 50 and 54.7, both of which indicate the existence of a mesotrophic environment. However, according to the value of the SI, the studied site was moderately polluted (beta-mesosaprobity), whereas PTI values showed that the site was heavily polluted (alpha-mesosaprobic).																	1863-9135					AUG	2017	190	3					189	197		10.1127/fal/2017/0991								WOS:000412040000003

The foreign workers also got into the farming business in the Kingdom. Water is an important input to practice agriculture. However, no comparative information is available regarding the attitude of Saudis and non-Saudis towards water. Keeping in view the importance of water, present study was conducted in the 13 administrative regions of the country. Using the Random Number Generator, some 230 respondents were selected randomly from each region with the total sample size was of 3000. Some 1800 respondents completely filled the study questionnaire. The study was aimed to examine and provide information regarding comparative perceptions of Saudis and Non-Saudis regarding some issues related to irrigation water; a topic that has not been studied so far. According to study findings, the Non-Saudis farmers have higher awareness about water uses and modern irrigation systems. Significant differences regarding their knowledge on the importance of irrigation water resources, the potential benefits of modern irrigation methods and awareness on the problems faced by farmers regarding water quality in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were noticed. The study suggests the launching of extension education programs for both the Saudis and Non-Saudis farmers to keep them informed with the latest farming technologies and elevate their technical knowledge.																	2320-8694					AUG	2017	5				1		S86	S90		10.18006/2017.5(Spl-1-SAFSAW).S86.S90								WOS:000413094900010

Facies variations in response to Holocene sea-level and climate change on Bora Bora, French Polynesia: Unravelling the role of synsedimentary siderite in a tropical marine, mixed carbonate-siliciclastic lagoon	MARINE GEOLOGY												Five mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedimentary facies were identified in the barrier-reef lagoon of Bora Bora using microfacies and statistical analyses of 70 sediment samples taken at high resolution from two vibrocores. Fades and fades successions were interpreted with respect to Holocene sea-level and climate changes. The windward lagoon core is characterized by sideritic marly wackestones and foraminifera-sideritic wackestones, deposited around 7700 years BP (years before present) during the early-mid Holocene transgression. At that time, extensive weathering and erosion of iron-bearing minerals from the volcanic island, due to a wetter climate, were expressed in the formation of synsedimentary siderite in lagoonal sediments. The enrichment in delta O-18 (+ 032 to + 0.54 parts per thousand) in the siderite grains indicates marine to mixed marine-meteoric conditions during precipitation. Siderite formation resulted from microbial degradation of organic material, indicated by depleted delta C-13 values (- 13.61 to - 14.48160) that led to reducing conditions in lagoonal sediments, and resulted in iron reduction in the presence of dissolved bicarbonate. The chemical compositions of the siderites changes upcore, from relatively high Fe (91-95 mol%) and low Mn (5-6 mol%) at the core base to relatively low Fe (83-88 mol%) and high Mn (11-16 mol%) at the core top. The substitutions of Fe by Mn, Ca and Mg at grain margins illustrate changes in pore-water chemistry towards more oxygenated conditions and reflect sea-level rise and elevated rainfall during the early-mid Holocene. A drier climate during the mid-late Holocene was accompanied by reduced iron input and the proportion of siderite decreased, approaching zero in the upper section of the core. In the leeward lagoon core, siderite is again common in the lower section, and decreases in abundance upcore. Mollusc-foraminifera many packstones and mollusc wackestones accumulated similar to 5400-3500 years BP during the mid-Holocene in the windward core. Early in this period rotalid and miliolid foraminifera dominated. These are tolerant of environmental stress such as changes in water quality, nutrients or salinity. From the mid-Holocene to the present, textularid foraminifera are common in both cores, and indicate normal marine lagoonal conditions. Since the mid-late Holocene sea-level highstand and fall to modern level, mudstones have dominated in both cores. During the last 1000 years coral fragments have increased in abundance in the windward lagoon, presumably as a result of lagoonward progradation of fringing reefs in the mid-late Holocene. Since the late Holocene, motus on the windward side of Bora Bora have hampered sediment transport and lagoonward pro gradation of sand aprons. Increasing numbers of peloids, largely hardened faecal pellets, in the windward core in the last 1000 years may reflect early submarine lithification within the lagoon. Our study shows that during the Holocene, sea-level and climate change have influenced sediment import, composition and distribution in the Bora Bora lagoon. The sensitive response of the environment to external changes demonstrates the potential of tropical reef lagoons as archives of climate and sea-level changes.																	0025-3227	1872-6151				AUG 1	2017	390						1	22		10.1016/j.margeo.2017.05.002								WOS:000413381800001

D.; Hirji, Rafik; Dube, Timothy			Remote sensing of surface water quality in relation to catchment condition in Zimbabwe	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												The degradation of river catchments is one of the most important contemporary environmental problems affecting water quality in tropical countries. In this study, we used remotely sensed Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess how catchment condition varies within and across river catchments in Zimbabwe. We then used non-linear regression to test whether catchment condition assessed using the NDVI is significantly (alpha = 0.05) related with levels of Total Suspended Solids (TSS) measured at different sampling points in thirty-two sub-catchments in Zimbabwe. The results showed a consistent negative curvilinear relationship between Landsat 8 derived NDVI and TSS measured across the catchments under study. In the drier catchments of the country, 98% of the variation in TSS is explained by NDVI, while in wetter catchments, 64% of the variation in TSS is explained by NDVI. Our results suggest that NDVI derived from free and readily available multispectral Landsat series data (Landsat 8) is a potential valuable tool for the rapid assessment of physical water quality in data poor catchments. Overall, the finding of this study underscores the usefulness of readily available satellite data for near-real time monitoring of the physical water quality at river catchment scale, especially in resource-constrained areas, such as the sub-Saharan Africa.

Sensitivity of the mayfly Adenophlebia auriculata (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) to MgSO4 and Na2SO4	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Acid mine drainage (AMD) continues to deteriorate water quality in freshwater ecosystems. Sulphates, a major salt component in AMD, can exacerbate AMD effects in freshwater because salts are toxic to aquatic life in high concentrations. Sulphates are predominant in South African AMD impacted freshwater ecosystems. In this study, the sensitivity of nymphs of the mayfly Adenophlebia auriculata (Ephemeroptera: Leptophlebiidae) was investigated by exposing the organisms to magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) and sodium sulphate (Na2SO4) as models of mining salinisation in short-term (96 h) and long-term (240 h) in static system tests. Short-term and long-term lethal concentrations of each salt were estimated using regression analyses. The results indicated that A. auriculata was more sensitive to MgSO4 (LC50 = 3.81 g/L) than Na2SO4 (LC50 = 8.78 g/L) after short-term exposures. However, this species became sensitive to Na2SO4 (LC10 = 0.19 g/L) but tolerant to MgSO4 (LC10 = 0.35 g/L) after long-term exposures. These results suggest that the 0.25 g/L sulphate compliance limit for South Africa is inadequate to protect A. auriculata from Na2SO4 toxicity in the long-term, yet it overprotects this species from MgSO4 exposures in the short-term. The findings of this study are an important major step in understanding the ecological effects of AMD to aquatic life. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hydrochemical modelling of water quality in terms of emerging micropollutants in Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West Provinces	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Emerging micropollutants (EMPs) are ubiquitous in aquatic systems and are associated with a wide range of eco-toxicological effects worldwide. There remains a lack of scientific understanding of the major underlying hydrochemical factors behind variations in concentration heterogeneities of EMPs in time and space. This study was therefore conducted to determine major hydrochemical processes controlling water quality and the occurrence of EMPs mainly, carbamazepine (CBZ), tonalide (AHTN), galaxolide (HHCB), caffeine (CAF), technical 4-nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA) in water from Mpumalanga, Gauteng and North West Provinces in South Africa. Grab water samples were collected bi-monthly between June 2014 and April 2016 from 44 water sources using standard sampling procedures. BPA, NP, CAF, HHCB, AHTN, CBZ were extracted, cleaned and enriched using autotrace-SPE at neutral pH and analyzed using GC x GC-TOFMS. Kruskal Wallis-test was used to test for temporal variations in occurrence of the analytes. The Geochemist's Workbench (R) Release 11 software, Surfer Golden Graphics for surface mapping, PHREEQC software and bivariate ion plots were used determine the major hydro-geochemical processes. The mean concentrations of EMPs varied from 3.48 mu g/L for CAF to 421.53 mu g/L for HHCB. Although the Kruskal Wallis test revealed no any statistically significant temporal variations in concentrations of the analytes in water samples at 95% confidence level, their occurrence and distribution vary spatially with BPA being the most widely distributed EMP and was present in 62% of the sampled sites. Municipal waste water inputs, agricultural pollution, ion-exchange reactions, carbonate and silicate weathering were the major processes controlling water quality in the study area. This study may assist water resource managers to ably address and manage water pollution resulting from a number of natural and anthropogenic hydrochemical processes in the study area.

Modeling phytoremediation of nitrogen-polluted water using water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) has a great potential for purification of wastewater through physical, chemical and biological mechanisms. In an attempt to improve the quality of effluents discharged from waste stabilization ponds at the University of Dar es Salaam, a pilot plant was constructed to experiment the effectiveness of this plants for transformation and removal of nitrogen. Samples of wastewater were collected and examined for water quality parameters, including pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and various forms of nitrogen, which were used as input parameters in a kinetic mathematical model. A conceptual model was then developed to model various processes in the system using STELLA 6.0.1 software. The results show that total nitrogen was removed by 63.9%. Denitrification contributed 73.8% of the removed nitrogen. Other dominant nitrogen removal mechanisms are net sedimentation and uptake by water hyacinth, which contributed 16.7% and 9.5% of the removed nitrogen, respectively. The model indicated that in presence of water hyacinth biofllm about 1.26 g Nm(-2)day(-1) of nitrogen was removed. However, in the absence of biofilm in water hyacinth pond, the permanent nitrogen removal was only 0.89 g Nm(-2)day(-1). This suggests that in absence of water hyacinth, the efficiency of nitrogen removal would decrease by 29.4%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment of drinking water quality and rural household water treatment in Balaka District, Malawi	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Access to drinking water from unsafe sources is widespread amongst communities in rural areas such as Balaka District in Malawi. This situation puts many individuals and communities at risk of waterborne diseases despite some households adopting household water treatment to improve the quality of the water. However, there still remains data gaps regarding the quality of drinking water from such sources and the household water treatment methods used to improve public health. This study was, therefore, conducted to help bridge the knowledge gap by evaluating drinking water quality and adoption rate of household water treatment and storage (HWTS) practices in Nkaya, Balaka District. Water samples were collected from eleven systematically selected sites and analyzed for physico-chemical and microbiological parameters: pH, TDS, electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, F-, Cl-, NO3-, Na, K, Fe, Faecal Coliform (FC) and Faecal Streptococcus (FS) bacteria using standard methods. The mean results were compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) and Malawi Bureau of Standards (MBS) (MS 733:2005) to ascertain the water quality for drinking purposes. A total of 204 randomly selected households were interviewed to determine their access to drinking water, water quality perception and HWTS among others. The majority of households (72%, n = 83) in Njerenje accessed water from shallow wells and rivers whilst in Phimbi boreholes were commonly used. Several households (>95%, n = 204) were observed to be practicing HWST techniques by boiling or chlorination and water storage in closed containers. The levels of pH (7.10-7.64), F- (0.89-1.46 mg/L), Cl- (5.45-89.84 mg/L), NO3- (0-0.16 mg/L), Na (20-490 mg/L), K (2.40-14 mg/L) and Fe (0.10-0.40 mg/L) for most sites were within the standard limits. The EC (358-2220 mu S/cm), turbidity (0.54-14.60 NTU), FC (0-56 cfu/100 mL) and FS (0-120 cfu/100 mL) - mainly in shallow wells, were found to be above the WHO and MBS water quality specifications. The majority of the water samples (73%, n = 11) were classified as of "Intermediate risk" (FC 11 -100 cfu/100 mL), hence not suitable for human consumption without prior treatment. This calls for large scale adoption of HWTS and continued monitoring of the water sources used in the study areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Remote sensing and Geographic Information System techniques were used to determine the geometric and hydrologic parameters required for estimating model parameters. The Snyder Unit Hydrograph method was used for ungauged subcatchment simulations based on parameter transfer from gauged subcatchments. The Marimba and Mukuvisi subcatchments were considered as the gauged subcatchments based on data completeness for the simulation period (2004-2010). Before extrapolating the calibrated model setup to eight ungauged subcatchments, the feasibility of model parameter transferability was tested, using the proxy - catchment approach and evaluated using the Nash Sutcliffe (NSE) and Relative Volume Error (RVE) criterion. Results showed that the model successfully predicted gauged catchment runoff and peakflows for the calibration (Marimba NSE = 68%, RVE = 5.8%; Mukuvisi NSE = 64%, RVE = -8.9%) and validation (Marimba NSE = 61%, RVE = 8.1%; Mukuvisi NSE = 57%, RVE = 9.9%) periods. The study demonstrates the suitability of HEC-HMS for continuous runoff simulation in a complex watershed with numerous subcatchments and channel reaches. The ungauged subcatchments contribute to 51% of Upper Manyame Catchment's runoff. Ruwa and Lake Chivero sub catchments had the highest ungauged subcatchment contribution to Upper Manyame Catchment runoff (19% and 15% respectively). This work will have a significant contribution for the future development of water resources programs in Upper Manyame Catchment in particular and in other data-scarce catchments.

Along with other water quality parameters, elevated nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) has been shown to influence the reproductive development and endogenous sex steroid production in a number of aquatic animal species, including Atlantic salmon. We sought to determine whether elevated NO3-N in RAS can influence early maturation in post-smolt Atlantic salmon in an 8-month trial in replicated freshwater RAS. Post-smolt Atlantic salmon (102 +/- g) were stocked into six RAS, with three RAS randomly selected for dosing with high NO3-N (99 +/- mg/L) and three RAS set for low NO3-N (10 +/- 0 mg/L). At 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-months post-stocking, 5 fish were randomly sampled from each RAS, gonadosomatic index (GSI) data were collected, and plasma was sampled for 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) quantification. At 4- and 8-months post-stocking,.samples of culture tank and spring water (used as "makeup" or replacement water) were collected and tested for a suite of 42 hormonally active compounds using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, as well as for estrogenicity using the bioluminescent yeast estrogen screen (BLYES) reporter system. Finally, at 8-months post-stocking 8-9 salmon were sampled from each RAS for blood gas and chemistry analyses, and multiple organ tissues were sampled for histopathology evaluation. Overall, sexually mature males were highly prevalent in both NO3-N treatment groups by study's end, and there did not appear to be an effect of NO3-N on male maturation prevalence based on grilse identification, GSI, and 11-MT results, indicating that other culture parameters likely instigated early maturation. No important differences were noted between treatment groups for whole blood gas and chemistry parameters, and no significant tissue changes were noted on histopathology. No hormones, hormone conjugates, or mycotoxins were detected in any water samples; phytoestrogens were generally detected at low levels but were unrelated to NO3-N treatment. Finally, low-level estrogenicity was detected in RAS water, but a NO3-N treatment effect could not be determined. The major findings of this study are i) the NO3-N treatments did not appear to be related to the observed male maturation, and ii) the majority of hormonally active compounds were not detectable in RAS water.

J	Kamstra, A; Blom, E; Terjesen, BF				Kamstra, Andries; Blom, Ewout; Terjesen, Bendik Fyhn			Mixing and scale affect moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) performance	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors (MBBR) are used increasingly in closed systems for farming of fish. Scaling, i.e. design of units of increasing size, is an important issue in general bio-reactor design since mixing behaviour will differ between small and large scale: Research is mostly performed on small-scale biofilters and the question is to what extent this can be upscaled to a commercial level. Therefore, the objective of this research was to establish the effect of mixing and scale on MBBR performance. The research was done in two major parts; firstly effects of scale-sensitive factors were studied in small reactors. Secondly, performance of these small reactors was then compared to increasingly large reactor sizes, using the same inlet water quality and biofilm. Firstly, a 200 L MBBR (medium scale) was operated continuously using a synthetic feed solution. Biofilm carriers from this reactor was used for short-term experiments in 0.8 L reactors (small scale) and compared with the performance of the 200 L medium scale reactor. Reactor geometry and superficial air velocity (m h(-1)) were identical in these experiments. Subsequently, the small reactors were incubated with biofilm carriers from three commercial farms and performance compared with these large scale reactors. In a number of additional experiments the effect of mixing and Total Ammonia Nitrogen (TAN) was tested at small and medium scale. The results showed that MBBR scale has a significant effect on TAN removal rate. In general, the larger the scale the better the performance. TAN removal (rTAN) at small scale (0.8 L) is about 80% compared to that at medium scale (200 L). The difference between small scale and large scale ( > 20 m(3)) is even higher. These findings warrant further studies on whether a plateau is reached in rTAN at a certain scale; a study which will have considerable importance for optimal design and dimensioning of commercial scale RAS. It was further found that superficial air velocity is not a good scaling factor for MBBRs. Upscaling while maintaining geometry implies increasing air injection depth and therefore increased energy input will be required at a comparable superficial air velocity, which is not incorporated in the superficial air velocity term (m h(-1)). Superficial air velocity and media filling% were found to have a strong effect on mixing time at small scale. An air velocity below a threshold of 5 m h(-1) decreased TAN removal at both small and medium scale. Intense mixing at small scale increased TAN removal at low TAN concentration. However, at a high TAN concentration, the small scale MBBR always performed at not more than 80% of the capacity of the medium scale system, irrespective of the mixing conditions. Hence, the capacity of full scale systems will be under -estimated when based solely on small scale experiments.																	0144-8609	1873-5614				AUG	2017	78		A		SI		9	17		10.1016/j.aquaeng.2017.04.004								WOS:000411542900003						
J	Rojas-Tirado, P; Pedersen, PB; Pedersen, LF				Rojas-Tirado, Paula; Pedersen, Per Bovbjerg; Pedersen, Lars-Flemming			Bacterial activity dynamics in the water phase during start-up of recirculating aquaculture systems	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												Microbial water quality in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) is important for successful RAS operation but difficult to assess and control. There is a need to identify factors affecting changes in the bacterial dynamics - in terms of abundance and activity - to get the information needed to manage microbial stability in RAS. This study aimed to quantify bacterial activity in the water phase in six identical, pilot scale freshwater RAS stocked with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during a three months period frgm start-up. Bacterial activity and dynamics were investigated by the use of a patented method, BactiQuant (R). The method relies on the hydrolysis of a fluorescent enzyme-substrate and is a rapid technique for quantifying bacterial enzyme activity in a water sample. The results showed a forty-fold increase in bacterial activity within the first 24 days from start-up. Average BactiQuant (R) values (BQV) were below 1000 at Day 0 and stabilized around 40,000 BQV after four weeks from start. The study revealed considerable variation in initial BQV levels between identically operated and designed RAS; over time these differences diminished. Total ammonia nitrogen, nitrite and nitrate levels were very similar in all six RAS and were neither related to nor affected by BQV. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD5) were highly reproducible parameters between RAS with a stable equilibrium dynamic over time. This study showed that bacterial activity was not a straightforward predictable parameter in the water phase as e.g. nitrate-N would be in identical RAS, and showed unexpected sudden changes/fluctuations within specific RAS. However, a bacterial activity stabilization phase was observed as systems matured and reached equilibrium, suggesting a successive transition from fragile to robust microbial community compositions.

For cultivated marine fish larvae, stable microbial environments, characterized by slow-growing, K-selected bacteria, have been found to improve growth and survival. Compared to flow-through systems, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) offer a better possibility for obtaining microbial stability in the rearing water. However, the microbial ecology in RAS is complex and little studied, and to optimize the microbial water quality more knowledge is needed on microbial community dynamics and interactions between microbes and fish. In the present study we investigated microbial community dynamics in three large-scale RAS, operated with different salinities (12, 22 and 32 ppt), for production of Atlantic salmon post-smolts. We focused on the stability of microbial communities over time in the bioreactors and the fish tanks, and compared the microbial communities within and between the three RAS. The study showed that: 1) The microbial community of the water was similar between the compartments of each RAS at the same time point, 2) The microbial communities of the water (and to a lesser extent the biofilm) within each system underwent large changes over time, 3) The microbiota of biofilm and water differed significantly within each system, 4) Biofilm community profiles were more similar between RAS than the water community profiles, and 5) Salinity structured the microbial community composition. The present study provides new knowledge on how the microbiota in RAS varies with time and how it is influenced by environmental factors.

J	Becke, C; Steinhagen, D; Schumann, M; Brinker, A				Becke, Cornelius; Steinhagen, Dieter; Schumann, Mark; Brinker, Alexander			Physiological consequences for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) of short-term exposure to increased suspended solid load	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												Suspended solids are an unavoidable component of fish farming, and especially so in recirculating aqua culture systems (RAS) where fine particles accumulate over time. High levels of fine particles are widely regarded as harmful to fish health and welfare. However, little is known about the direct impact of these accumulating particles on stress, performance, health or other welfare parameters of fish. In this study, the effects of solids on rainbow trout were investigated specifically, uncoupled from other potentially confounding water parameters. To this end, the suspended solid load in a replicate RAS was artificially increased by a factor of 7 to over 30 mg total suspended solids (TSS)/L, alongside a sister system operating normally, with a maximum suspended solid concentration of 5 mg/L. At these levels, the concentrations of particles smaller than 32 pm amounted to 0.3 +/- 0.3 mg/L in the control system and to 8.0 +/- 2.7 mg/L in the treatment system. With the exception of turbidity, all further water parameters generally considered important to salmonid welfare were kept comparable and well below harmful levels. In consequence, fish performed well in both RAS, indicating good husbandry conditions. Feeding behavior was observed to differ slightly between control and treatment RAS, but without any apparent effect on performance. The impact of the accumulating particles on fish was examined using a wide range of physiological assays. No significant differences in stress markers (heat shock protein 70, plasma cortisol) were detected between fish in the control and treatment RAS. The same was found for hematological assays (differential leukocyte count, hematocrit, RBC indices, etc.). Fin condition was also unaffected by increased suspended solid load and most surprisingly, histological examination not only revealed no detrimental effects of particle accumulation, but showed the gill status of fish in the solid treatment to be better than that of control fish. Overall, this study shows that by itself, short-term exposure to suspended solids at concentrations of 30 mg/L has no detrimental effect on rainbow trout. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Diem, TNT; Konnerup, D; Brix, H				Trang Ngo Thuy Diem; Konnerup, Dennis; Brix, Hans			Effects of recirculation rates on water quality and Oreochromis niloticus growth in aquaponic systems	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												The present study examined the effects of three recirculation rates (50%, 200% and 400%) on water quality and biomass growth at low and high fish stocking densities (122 and 220 fish/m(3)) in aquaponic systems. The system consisted of a Tilapia tank connected to a gravel filter and three hydroponic trenches in series with Ipomoed aquatica, Lactuca sativa and Canna glauca. The RRs influenced most water quality parameters with best water quality at the high R.R. At the low RR of 50% mass mortality of fish occurred due to lack of oxygen. The fish growth and survival was excellent in the high RR of 400% at the low fish density of 122 fish/m3. The plant trenches were found to be effective in removing potential harmful concentrations of NH4-N and NO2-N from the recirculating water. For each kg of fish produced in this system approximately 1.0 m(3) water was needed. During a 25-day period about 1 kg of marketable fresh biomass of L aquatica and 270 g dry weight aboveground biomass of C glauca was produced. It is concluded that high recirculation rate of the water of 200-400% per day is needed to secure a good growth and a low FCR of Tilapia in aquaponic systems. High recirculation rates also secure a good water quality. The aquaponic system has a very low effluent discharge compared to traditional aquaculture techniques, and it recycles nutrients for plant growth. Hence, aquaponic system is a promising sustainable solution that can be applied on commercial fish pond scale.

The effects of different concentrations of total suspended solids (TSS) on PL performance were also evaluated. One experimental group was reared in a conventional microalgae-based system with daily water exchange and daily addition of microalgae (herein called microalgae treatment). The other two experimental groups were reared using biofloc technology (BFT) with daily dextrose addition and no water exchange, but in the "Biofloc-500" treatment, TSS were maintained at around 500 mg L-1, while in the "Biofloc-700" treatment, TSS were maintained at around 700 mg L-1. Water quality variables remained within the appropriate range for larval culture. In microalgae treatment, ammonia control was likely associated with its assimilation into microalgae biomass and daily water exchange. In biofloc tanks, however, the addition of dextrose stimulated the production of bacterial biomass from ammonia. This system required only 12.9% of the water used by the microalgae treatment since water was not exchanged during the culture. The nursery of young PLs resulted in similar (P > 0.05) performance in all treatments: survival > 94%, PL length -11.5 mm, and PL dry weight -1.2 mg. In addition, the salinity stress test (> 90.0%) was not significantly different among treatments. Our results indicate that BFT can be as effective as the microalgae-based system for the nursery of young L. vannamei post -larvae. We also found that post -larvae performance was similar (P > 0.05) between biofloc treatments, indicating that organisms can tolerate environments with large quantities of solids.

The reported production parameters (range) in the two S-CCS were specific water consumption (q): 0.04-0.47 L/kg/min and feed load per water flow: 9.0-64 g/m(3). The study period was split in two sub-periods; January-May (4.4-7.5 degrees C), and June-September (7.5-13.2 degrees C) before a regression model was used to determine the relationship between production intensity (q, feed load) and water quality (pH, CO2). With the acceptable level of CO2 defined as <= 10 mg/L, the model predicted a minimum specific water consumption (L/kg/min) between 0.07 (winter) and 0.2 (summer). The predicted maximum feed load per water flow (g/m(3)) was between 35 (summer) and 45 g/m(3) (winter). These calculated limits for production intensity were close to the values earlier reported for smolt or post-smolt production in large, onshore tanks.																	0144-8609	1873-5614				AUG	2017	78		B				221	227		10.1016/j.aquaeng.2017.06.001								WOS:000411543000016

J	Masindi, V				Masindi, Vhahangwele			Recovery of drinking water and valuable minerals from acid mine drainage using an integration of magnesite, lime, soda ash, CO2 and reverse osmosis treatment processes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												In this study, the possibility of recovering valuable minerals and drinking water from acid mine drainage was explored. Neutralisation of Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) and recovery of metals were done at 60 mins of equilibration. DOW water & Process solutions, Reverse Osmosis System Analysis (ROSA), version 9.1 was used to further purify the resultant water to meet the drinking quality standards as required by the South African National Standard (SANS) report (SANS 241). The obtained results revealed that drinking water, metals, gypsum, hydrated lime/limestone were recovered from the treatment process as valuable resources. This was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF). Morphological properties of initial and recovered minerals were examined using High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy (HR-SEM). Carbon Dioxide (CO2) was bubbled through soda treated water to recover limestone and to stabilise the pH of the product water (pH approximate to 7.5). Post treatment, the resultant water was further purified by simulated Reverse Osmosis (RO) system to produce water that meet the drinking water quality as stipulated by SANS 241 standards. The pH of recovered drinking water was approximate to 6.5. The metals removal efficiency of the RO system was approximate to 100%. In general, this study demonstrated that the integration of magnesite, lime, soda ash, CO2 and reverse osmosis treatment processes can convert environmental pollutants and waste resources into commercially valuable products that have industrial applications.																	2213-3437					AUG	2017	5	4					3136	3142		10.1016/j.jece.2017.06.025								WOS:000411143200010

Though soil is treated by electrokinetic (EK) to remove contaminants, this technology cannot take the lead without treatment of groundwater. In the present study, the groundwater sample was collected from Kathanganni Village, Tirupur(Textile Valley) and treated with a chemical process for removal of hardness and followed by the electrodialysis process. Two different current densities viz., 10 mA/cm(2)(system I) and 20 mA/cm(2)(system II) were used. Mixed metal oxide (IrO2-RuO2-TiO2/Ti) was used as anode and Titanium used as cathode. The anionic exchange (AMI - 7001) and cationic exchange (CMI -7000) membranes were placed between anodic and cathodic compartments respectively. The anolyte and catholyte reservoirs were filled with distilled water and the middle compartment filled with chemically treated contaminated water. The optimization of alkali and soda ash for efficient removal of hardness in the groundwater was examined. The efficient removal of salinity such as chloride (90%), sulfate (98%), and TDS (96%) were achieved within 12 h of electrodialysis process. This treated water quality was compared with standard irrigation water quality parameters.

Organic chloramines in chlorine-based disinfected water systems: A critical review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												This paper is a critical review of current knowledge of organic chloramines in water systems, including their formation, stability, toxicity, analytical methods for detection, and their impact on drinking water treatment and quality. The term organic chloramines may refer to any halogenated organic compounds measured as part of combined chlorine (the difference between the measured free and total chlorine concentrations), and may include N-chloramines, N-chloramino acids, N-chloraldimines and N-chloramides. Organic chloramines can form when dissolved organic nitrogen or dissolved organic carbon react with either free chlorine or inorganic chloramines. They are potentially harmful to humans and may exist as an intermediate for other disinfection by-products. However, little information is available on the formation or occurrence of organic chloramines in water due to a number of challenges. One of the biggest challenges for the identification and quantification of organic chloramines in water systems is the lack of appropriate analytical methods. In addition, many of the organic chloramines that form during disinfection are unstable, which results in difficulties in sampling and detection. To date research has focussed on the study of organic monochloramines. However, given that breakpoint chlorination is commonly undertaken in water treatment systems, the formation of organic dichloramines should also be considered. Organic chloramines can be formed from many different precursors and pathways. Therefore, studying the occurrence of their precursors in water systems would enable better prediction and management of their formation.

Occurrence and formation of disinfection by-products in the swimming pool environment: A critical review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Disinfection of water for human use is essential to protect against microbial disease; however, disinfection also leads to formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), some of which are of health concern. From a chemical perspective, swimming pools are a complex matrix, with continual addition of a wide range of natural and anthropogenic chemicals via filling waters, disinfectant addition, pharmaceuticals and personal care products and human body excretions. Natural organic matter, trace amounts of DBPs and chlorine or chloramines may be introduced by the filling water, which is commonly disinfected distributed drinking water. Chlorine and/or bromine is continually introduced via the addition of chemical disinfectants to the pool. Human body excretions (sweat, urine and saliva) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (sunscreens, cosmetics, hair products and lotions) are introduced by swimmers. High addition of disinfectant leads to a high formation of DBPs from reaction of some of the chemicals with the disinfectant. Swimming pool air is also of concern as volatile DBPs partition into the air above the pool. The presence of bromine leads to the formation of a wide range of bromo- and bromo/chloro-DBPs, and Br-DBPs are more toxic than their chlorinated analogues. This is particularly important for seawater-filled pools or pools using a bromine-based disinfectant. This review summarises chemical contaminants and DBPs in swimming pool waters, as well as in the air above pools. Factors that have been found to affect DBP formation in pools are discussed. The impact of the swimming pool environment on human health is reviewed. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

This study reviewed the formation and control strategies for DBPs and toxicity in reclaimed water during chlorination. Both regulated and emerging DBPs have been frequently detected in reclaimed water during chlorination at a higher level than those in drinking water, indicating they pose a greater risk to humans. Luminescent bacteria and Daphnia magna acute toxicity, anti-estrogenic activity and cytotoxicity generally increased after chlorination because of the formation of DBPs. Genotoxicity by umu-test and estrogenic activity were decreased after chlorination because of destruction of toxic chemicals. During chlorination, water quality significantly impacted changes in toxicity. Ammonium tended to attenuate toxicity changes by reacting with chlorine to form chloramine, while bromide tended to aggravate toxicity changes by forming hypobromous acid. During pretreatment by ozonation and coagulation, disinfection byproduct formation potential (DBPFP) and toxicity formation potential (TFP) occasionally increase, which is accompanied by DOC removal; thus, the decrease of DOC was limited to indicate the decrease of DBPFP and TFP. It is more important to eliminate the key fraction of precursors such as hydrophobic acid and hydrophilic neutrals. During chlorination, toxicities can increase with the increasing chlorine dose and contact time. To control the excessive toxicity formation, a relatively low chlorine dose and short contact time were required. Quenching chlorine residual with reductive reagents also effectively abated the formation of toxic compounds. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Trihalomethane concentrations in tap water as determinant of bottled water use in the city of Barcelona	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												Bottled water consumption is increasing worldwide, despite its huge economic and environmental cost. We aim to describe personal and tap water quality determinants of bottled water use in the city of Barcelona. This cross-sectional study used data from the Health Survey of Barcelona in 2006 (N = 5417 adults). The use of bottled water to drink and to cook was evaluated in relation to age, gender, educational level, district and levels of trihalomethanes (THMs), free chlorine, conductivity, chloride, sodium, pH, nitrate and aluminium in municipal tap water using Robust Poisson Regression. The prevalence of bottled water use to drink and cook was 53.9% and 6.7%, respectively. Chemical parameters in water had a large variability (interquartile range of THMs concentrations: 83.2-200.8 ag/L) and were correlated between them, except aluminium. Drinking bottled water increased with educational level, while cooking with bottled water was higher among men than among women and decreased with age. After adjusting by these personal determinants, a dose-response relationship was found between concentrations of all chemicals except aluminium in tap water and bottled water use. The highest association was found for THMs, with a Prevalence Ratio of 2.00 (95%CI = 1.86, 2.15) for drinking bottled water and 2.80 (95%CI = 1.72, 4.58) for cooking with bottled water, among those with >150 mu g/L vs. <100 mu g/L THMs in tap water. Conclusion: More than half of Barcelona residents regularly drank bottled water, and the main determinant was the chemical composition of tap water, particularly THM level.

Trihalomethanes (THMs), the most commonly measured and dominant class of DBPs in drinking water, served as a primary metric and surrogate for the full DBP mixture. Average THM exposure was calculated, based on rough estimates of past levels in Iowa. To reduce misclassification, a follow-up study was undertaken to improve estimates of past THM levels and to re-evaluate their association with cancer risk. In addition, the risk associated with haloacetic acids, another class of DBPs, was examined. In the original analysis, surface water treatment plants were assigned one of two possible THM levels depending on the point of chlorination. The re-assessment considered each utility treating surface or groundwater on a case-by-case basis. Multiple treatment/disinfection scenarios and water quality parameters were considered with actual DBP measurements to develop estimates of past levels. The highest annual average THM level in the re-analysis was 156 mu g/L compared to 74 mu g/L for the original analysis. This allowed the analysis of subjects exposed at higher levels (>96 mu g/L). The re-analysis established a new approach, based on case studies and an understanding of the water quality and operational parameters that impact DBP formation, for determining historical exposure.

J	Rolfe, J; Harvey, S				Rolfe, John; Harvey, Sally			Heterogeneity in practice adoption to reduce water quality impacts from sugarcane production in Queensland	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES												A key strategy in reducing water quality impacts into the Great Barrier Reef is to change farm management practices to limit the creation of pollutants or their transmission off farm. However, designing programs to improve adoption in agriculture of Better Management Practices (BMPs) can be challenging because of heterogeneity among landholders and between farms and farming systems. This is relevant to broader issues in the adoption literature where a focus on identifying factors influencing and heterogeneity in adoption have rarely transferred through to analysis and prediction models suitable for policy purposes. In this case study these issues have been tested with sugarcane farmers in Queensland, where the current policy settings are targeting increases in adoption of better management practices from 34% in 2011 to 90% by 2018. The main goals of the study were to identify how rates of adoption for different practices might be explained by (a) the motivations of farmers (b) potential barriers to adoption (c) farm characteristics and (d) financial drivers. The results confirm that measures to improve BMP adoption are complicated by heterogeneity in adoption drivers between practices and across groups of landholders, creating challenges to find effective strategies to encourage adoption.

Ecosystem services from turfgrass landscapes	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING					5th European-Turfgrass-Society (ETS) Conference	JUN 05-08, 2016	Salgados, PORTUGAL	European Turfgrass Soc				Turf is an important component of the urban and rural landscape. The natural plant formations/biomes that it mimics are the tropical savanna, the temperate grasslands (steppe and the prairies) and the tundra. Turf in a higher or lower degree provides all the ecosystem services of the other types of vegetation. Vegetation ecosystem services that have been previously emphasized include functional, aesthetical, recreational, social, and economic services as well as services related to people psychological or physical health. The purpose of this review is to gather updated information on turf ecosystem services, mainly on how they compare to other types of vegetation, or substitutes, and to suggest some future trends/areas of research. Turf has a unique role in aesthetics and, definitely, provides an irreplaceable surface for recreational sports/activities. From the available information, turf seems to have a higher potential than other types of vegetation for reducing runoff, increasing infiltration, purifying water from sediments and pollutants, controlling erosion, improving soil quality and reducing fire hazards. For the lawn owners the main turf benefits are: first the enhanced property aesthetics, second the increment in property value and third the provision of a recreation area. Turf, as all vegetation, uses water. Without the water its benefits may be reduced or annihilated. Mimicking nature may offer some solutions for saving water: summer brown lawns that green up in the fall, although losing some of the turf benefits, may be an appropriate choice where irrigation is not feasible and are worth some research. Research, should also be done on lawns using a mix of grasses and legumes: the presence of legumes may avoid N fertilization and, possibly allows for clippings removal and usage as biofuel, while keeping the soil accumulation of carbon, preventing N leaching and turning turf's carbon footprint even more positive.

Varying evapotranspiration and salinity level of irrigation waterinfluence soil quality and performance of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING					5th European-Turfgrass-Society (ETS) Conference	JUN 05-08, 2016	Salgados, PORTUGAL	European Turfgrass Soc				Increasing use of recycled water that is often high in salinity warrants further examination of irrigation practices for turfgrass health and salinity management. A study was conducted during 2011-2012 in Riverside, CA to evaluate the response of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) 'SR 4550' turf to varying quality and quantity of irrigation water. A modified line-source sprinkler irrigation system provided a salinity gradient (ECw similar to 0.6-4.2 dS m(-1)) in between lines. Irrigation was scheduled in four separate irrigation zones perpendicular to the irrigation lines according to 80, 100, 120, and 140% ETo. Changes in turf quality (R-2 = 0.30***), were primarily driven by the number of days that the area had been irrigated with saline water. When data were separated by irrigation amount, both time and water quality accounted for 54% and 46% of the variability (p < 0.001) in quality and cover, respectively at 80% ETo. A model was created to quantify decline in turf quality in relationship to %ET0 replacement and salinity accumulation in the rootzone (R-2 = 0.57). Our results suggest that perennial ryegrass requires irrigation scheduling at 140% ET0, irrigation water quality below ECw similar to 1.7 dS m(-1), and ECe below 3.8 dS m(-1) to maintain acceptable quality for 442 d in Riverside, CA.

Understanding and Managing the Effects of Climate Change on Ecosystem Services in the Rocky Mountains	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												Public lands in the US Rocky Mountains provide critical ecosystem services, especially to rural communities that rely on these lands for fuel, food, water, and recreation. Climate change will likely affect the ability of these lands to provide ecosystem services. We describe 2 efforts to assess climate change vulnerabilities and develop adaptation options on federal lands in the Rocky Mountains. We specifically focus on aspects that affect community economic security and livelihood security, including water quality and quantity, timber, livestock grazing, and recreation. Headwaters of the Rocky Mountains serve as the primary source of water for large populations, and these headwaters are located primarily on public land. Thus, federal agencies will play a key role in helping to protect water quantity and quality by promoting watershed function and water conservation. Although increased temperatures and atmospheric concentration of CO2 have the potential to increase timber and forage production in the Rocky Mountains, those gains may be offset by wildfires, droughts, insect outbreaks, non-native species, and altered species composition. Our assessment identified ways in which federal land managers can help sustain forest and range productivity, primarily by increasing ecosystem resilience and minimizing current stressors, such as invasive species. Climate change will likely increase recreation participation. However, recreation managers will need more flexibility to adjust practices, provide recreation opportunities, and sustain economic benefits to communities. Federal agencies are now transitioning from the planning phase of climate change adaptation to implementation to ensure that ecosystem services will continue to be provided from federal lands in a changing climate.																	0276-4741	1994-7151				AUG	2017	37	3					340	352		10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-16-00087.1								WOS:000411812900010						
J	Chang, CL; Li, MY				Chang, Chia-Ling; Li, Meng-Yuan			Predictions of Diffuse Pollution by the HSPF Model and the Back-Propagation Neural Network Model	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Watershed models are important tools for predicting the possible change of watershed responses. Environmental models comprise the deterministic model and the probabilistic model. This study discusses the Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF) and the Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN); these two models represent the deterministic model and the probabilistic model, respectively. As the properties of the two models are distinct, they have differing abilities to predict surface-runoff pollution. For the two models, the runoff simulation results are satisfactory. However, due to the limitation of the water quality monitoring records, pollution simulation is more difficult than runoff simulation. The results indicate that the prediction accuracy in the pollution simulation can be improved by adjusting the BPNN neurons. On the contrary, improving the prediction accuracy is limited by HSPF. Although the flexibility of BPNN is higher than HSPF, sufficient historical monitoring records are important for both of these models.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				AUG 1	2017	89	8					732	738		10.2175/106143017X14902968254665								WOS:000411925800007	28743327

It covers a region that is highly diverse, ranging from almost virgin mountain zones to densely urbanized areas and mining zones. These contrasts have a strong impact on rivers and their ecosystems. Based on two sampling campaigns (summer 2014, spring 2015), we investigated the longitudinal water quality pattern along the Selenga and its tributaries in Mongolia. While headwater regions typically had a very good water quality status, wastewater from urban areas and impacts from mining were found to be main pollution sources in the tributaries. The highest nutrient concentrations in the catchment were found in Tuul River, and severely elevated concentrations of trace elements (As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn), nutrients (NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, PO43-), and selected major ions (SO42-) were found in main tributaries of Selenga River. Moreover, trace element concentrations during spring 2015 (a time when many mines had not yet started operation) were markedly lower than in summer 2014, indicating that the additional metal loads measured in summer 2014 were related to mining activities. Nevertheless, all taken water samples in 2014 and 2015 from the main channel of the Mongolian Selenga River complied with the Mongolian standard (MNS 1998) for the investigated parameters.

Vulnerabilities of poverty, isolation, and rough geographical terrain complicate life for Appalachians who need access to adequate water supply and septic systems. In 2013, an inter-professional team of nursing, architecture, engineering, and law enforcement faculty and students developed a water-focused collaboration with community members in southeastern Kentucky. Greater accessibility to clean drinking water is a critical need in the area. Collaborative community engagement yielded effective and sustainable interventions. Inter-professional teams completed N=30 comprehensive home assessments examining factors such as water source utilization, septic system management, health status, and disaster preparedness. While the majority of homes evaluated had functional water supply and septic systems, the team observed straight piping as a means of waste disposal for several homes. Homeowners who did not have a residential water supply identified common gathering places where they typically obtain drinking water. To expand environmental assessment, the team collected water samples at 16 different sites where residents obtain drinking water or use it for recreational purposes. Testing of collected samples revealed 15 of 16 sites contained fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, or both. Because of the findings, the team and community key informants collaboratively developed interventions, such as relaying findings to community leaders, developing a WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene)-related education program, and improving access to clean, safe water through the design and construction of a water kiosk. Outcome of interventions included greater awareness and knowledge of WASH related topics, improved access to clean water sources, and sustainable solutions to enhance overall quality of life, health and well-being.																	1936-7031	1936-704X				AUG	2017	161	1					1	18		10.1111/j.1936-704X.2017.3248.x								WOS:000411056200001						
J	Hibbs, BJ; Lee, M; Ridgway, R				Hibbs, Barry J.; Lee, Monica; Ridgway, Rachel			Land Use Modification and Changing Redox Conditions Releases Selenium and Sulfur from Historic Marsh Sediments	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION												San Diego Creek Watershed forms the southern end of the Coastal Plain that covers much of Los Angeles County and Orange County, California. Prior to 1900, the central part of the watershed was marshland, and the edges of the watershed were used for grazing sheep and cattle. After 1900, cattle and sheep grazing were displaced by irrigated agriculture. Drainage ditches and channels were constructed to drain the marshes to "reclaim" the land for agriculture. Today, the drainage ditches and channels still exist in the watershed, which has undergone massive urban growth. Shallow groundwater discharges into these channels and ditches, which then flows as surface water, into Upper Newport Bay a thriving ecological habitat. Surface flows in these channels usually exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) aquatic water quality criterion for selenium (Se) of 3.1 mu g/L (lotic) for protection of aquatic life. Selenium in surface flows is caused by groundwater inflows. The highest concentrations of Se in shallow groundwater in the watershed coincide with the marshland area that was displaced by agriculture. Concentrations of Se in shallow groundwater beneath the former marsh area often exceed 25 mu g/L and are as high as 478 mu g/L. In areas where marshes were absent, concentrations of Se in groundwater are usually less than 25 mu g/L. In the marsh, Se accumulated due to chemically reducing conditions in the organic-rich marshland soils that caused it to precipitate as elemental Se(0) and metal selenides, Se(-II). We hypothesize that the elevated concentrations of Se in groundwater where the marshes once existed are a direct result of the destruction of the marsh. Today, oxidizing groundwater flows through the soils where the marshes once existed, remobilizing Se as selenate, a water soluble and oxidized form of Se(+VI) that is highly mobile in aquifer systems.																	1936-704X					AUG	2017	161	1					48	65		10.1111/j.1936-704X.2017.3251.x								WOS:000411056200004

The study was a descriptive-analytical one and lasted for 9 month. Samples were taken monthly between March 2016 and November 2016. Six sampling sites were selected to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes of water quality along the river. The samples were analyzed based on the standard methods for the following parameters: pH, conductivity (EC), NH4+, NO3-, CI-, suspended solids, PO43-, SO42-, metals (Fe, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni, Hg, As, Zn, Cu, Mn). The obtained values were compared with those imposed by the Romanian environmental legislation. An efficient and simplified method to express the quality of water used for consumption is provided by the Water Quality Index (WQI). WQI reflects the quality of water in a single value by comparing data obtained from the investigation of a number of physico-chemical parameters to the existing limits. The evaluation of water quality was performed using the Water Quality Index of the Canadian Council of Ministries of the Environment (CCME WQI). Water quality indices were classified as: excellent, good, medium, bad and very bad. The results indicated the water quality classification as "good" in all six sampling selected sites.																	0034-7752					AUG	2017	68	8					1732	1739										WOS:000410388000012

The water quality was evaluated by comparison with the limit values of the drinking water quality legislation (Law no.458/2002) and the Order 621/2014 (applicable to all groundwater bodies of Romania). The results showed that phenols and metals (iron and manganese) exceeded the threshold values in all sampling sites. Moreover, the anthropogenic factors including agriculture, use of fertilizers, manures, animal husbandry led to an increase of the bacterial load, particularly at wells sites.

Interdisciplinary research over the last two decades has indicated that ecohydrological interfaces are often hot spots of ecological, biogeochemical, and hydrological processes and may provide refuge for biota during extreme events. Ecohydrological interfaces can have significant impact on global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, biodiversity, pollutant removal, and ecosystem resilience to disturbance. The organizational principles (i.e., the drivers and controls) of spatially and temporally variable processes at ecohydrological interfaces are poorly understood and require the integrated analysis of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes. Our rudimentary understanding of the interactions between different drivers and controls critically limits our ability to predict complex system responses to change. In this paper, we explore similarities and contrasts in the functioning of diverse freshwater ecohydrological interfaces across spatial and temporal scales. We use this comparison to develop an integrated, interdisciplinary framework, including a roadmap for analyzing ecohydrological processes and their interactions in ecosystems. We argue that, in order to fully account for their nonlinear process dynamics, ecohydrological interfaces need to be conceptualized as unique, spatially and temporally dynamic entities, which represents a step change from their current representation as boundary conditions at investigated ecosystems. Plain Language Summary The movement of water, matter, organisms, and energy can be altered substantially at ecohydrological interfaces that we introduce here as a new concept to support the quantitative analysis of nonlinear system behavior stimulated by the complex and multifacetted interactions of hydrological, biogeochemical, and ecological processes across system boundaries. Ecohydrological interfaces are defined here as the dynamic transition zones that may develop at ecosystem (or subsystem) boundaries and control the movement and transformation of organisms, water, matter, and energy between adjacent systems. In this paper, we explore similarities and contrasts in the functioning of diverse freshwater ecohydrological interfaces across spatial and temporal scales. We use this comparison to develop an integrated, interdisciplinary framework, including a roadmap for analyzing ecohydrological processes and their interactions in ecosystems. We argue that, in order to fully account for their nonlinear process dynamics, ecohydrological interfaces need to be conceptualized as unique, spatially and temporally dynamic entities, which represents a step change from their current representation as boundary conditions at investigated ecosystems.

With mitigation of nutrients in inland waters and their discharges to the Baltic Sea being a common WFD and BSAP target, we use Sweden as a case study of observable effects, by compiling and analyzing all openly available water and nutrient monitoring data across Sweden since 2003. The data compilation reveals that nutrient monitoring covers only around 1% (down to 0.2% for nutrient loads) of the total number of WFD-classified stream and lake water bodies in Sweden. The data analysis further shows that the hydro-climatically driven water discharge dominates the determination of waterborne loads of both total phosphorus and total nitrogen across Sweden. Both water discharge and the related nutrient loads are in turn well correlated with the ecosystem status classification of Swedish water bodies. Nutrient concentrations do not exhibit such correlation and their changes over the study period are on average small, but concentration increases are found for moderate-to-bad status waters, for which both the WFD and the BSAP have instead targeted concentration decreases. In general, these results indicate insufficient distinction and mitigation of human-driven nutrient components in inland waters and their discharges to the sea by the internationally harmonized applications of the WFD and the BSAP. The results call for further comparative investigations of observable large-scale effects of such regulatory/management frameworks in different parts of the world.

Unlike other hedonic studies of water quality, we test whether housing market responds to average water quality or more to extreme events. We also test the spatial and temporal extent of effects of water quality on housing prices. We find that poor coastal water quality, measured in terms of the concentration of chlorophyll, has a negative impact on housing prices that diminishes with distance from the shoreline. Furthermore, our finding suggests that housing prices are most influenced by the extreme environmental conditions, which may be accompanied by unpleasant odors, discoloration, and even fish kills. We further predict potential increases in home values associated under water quality improvement scenarios and find an increase in the values of homes in coastal communities along Narragansett Bay of about $18 million up to $136 million.

Managed aquifer recharge through off-season irrigation in agricultural regions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Options for increasing reservoir storage in developed regions are limited and prohibitively expensive. Projected increases in demand call for new long-term water storage to help sustain agriculture, municipalities, industry, and ecological services. Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is becoming an integral component of water resources around the world. However, MAR faces challenges, including infrastructure costs, difficulty in enhancing recharge, water quality issues, and lack of available water supplies. Here we examine, through simulation modeling of a hypothetical agricultural subbasin in the western U.S., the potential of agricultural managed aquifer recharge (Ag-MAR) via canal seepage and off-season field irrigation. Weather phenomenon in many regions around the world exhibit decadal and other multiyear cycles of extreme precipitation. An ongoing challenge is to develop approaches to store greater amounts of water during these events. Simulations presented herein incorporate Ag-MAR programs and demonstrate that there is potential to enhance regional recharge by 7-13%, increase crop consumptive use by 9-12%, and increase natural vegetation consumption by 20-30%, where larger relative increases occur for lower aquifer hydraulic conductivity and higher specific yield values. Annual increases in groundwater levels were 7 m, and sustained levels following several years of drought were greater than 2 m. Results demonstrate that Ag-MAR has great potential to enhance long-term sustainability of water resources in agricultural basins.

Patrick			Temporal variability in the importance of hydrologic, biotic, and climatic descriptors of dissolved oxygen dynamics in a shallow tidal-marsh creek	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Due to strong abiotic forcing, dissolved oxygen (DO) in shallow tidal creeks often disobeys the conventional explanation of general aquatic DO cycling as biologically regulated. In the present work, we seek to quantify the relative importance of abiotic (hydrologic and climatic), and biotic (primary productivity as represented by chlorophyll-a) descriptors of tidal creek DO. By fitting multiple linear regression models of DO to hourly chlorophyll-a, water quality, hydrology, and weather data collected in a tidal creek of a Chesapeake Bay marsh (Maryland, USA), temporal shifts (summer-early winter) in the relative importance of tidal creek DO descriptors were uncovered. Moreover, this analysis identified an alternative approach to evaluating tidal stage as a driver of DO by dividing stage into two DO-relevant variables: stage above and below bankfull depth. Within the hydrologic variable class, stage below bankfull depth dominated as an important descriptor, thus highlighting the role of pore water drainage and mixing as influential processes forcing tidal creek DO. Study findings suggest that tidal creek DO dynamics are explained by a balance of hydrologic, climatic, and biotic descriptors during warmer seasons due to many of these variables (i.e., chlorophyll-a, water temperature) acting as tracers of estuarine-marsh water mixing; conversely, in early winter months when estuarine and marsh waters differ less distinctly, hydrologic variables increase in relative importance as descriptors of tidal creek DO. These findings underline important distinctions in the underlying mechanisms dictating DO variability in shallow tidal marsh-creek environments relative to open water estuarine systems.

Predicting redox-sensitive contaminant concentrations in groundwater using random forest classification	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Machine learning techniques were applied to a large (n>10,000) compliance monitoring database to predict the occurrence of several redox-active constituents in groundwater across a large watershed. Specifically, random forest classification was used to determine the probabilities of detecting elevated concentrations of nitrate, iron, and arsenic in the Fox, Wolf, Peshtigo, and surrounding watersheds in northeastern Wisconsin. Random forest classification is well suited to describe the nonlinear relationships observed among several explanatory variables and the predicted probabilities of elevated concentrations of nitrate, iron, and arsenic. Maps of the probability of elevated nitrate, iron, and arsenic can be used to assess groundwater vulnerability and the vulnerability of streams to contaminants derived from groundwater. Processes responsible for elevated concentrations are elucidated using partial dependence plots. For example, an increase in the probability of elevated iron and arsenic occurred when well depths coincided with the glacial/bedrock interface, suggesting a bedrock source for these constituents. Furthermore, groundwater in contact with Ordovician bedrock has a higher likelihood of elevated iron concentrations, which supports the hypothesis that groundwater liberates iron from a sulfide-bearing secondary cement horizon of Ordovician age. Application of machine learning techniques to existing compliance monitoring data offers an opportunity to broadly assess aquifer and stream vulnerability at regional and national scales and to better understand geochemical processes responsible for observed conditions.

J	Woo, CH				Woo, Chang Hwa			Research Trend of Membrane for Water Treatment by Analysis of Patent and Papers Publication	APPLIED CHEMISTRY FOR ENGINEERING												Since the beginning of the water shortage by disasters such as global warming, environmental pollution, and drought, development of original technology and studies have been undergone to increase availability of water resources. Among them the water treatment separation membrane technology is an environmentally friendly process that does not use chemicals and shows better water quality improvement effect than conventional physicochemical and biological processes. The water treatment membrane can be applied to various fields such as waste water treatment, water purification treatment, seawater desalination, ion exchange process, ultrapure water production, organic solvent separation and water treatment technology, and it tends to expand the range of application. In the core technology of water treatment membrane, researches are being actively carried out to develop a separation membrane of better performance by controlling the pore size to adjust the separation performance. In this review, we summarized the frequency of announcement by country and organization through the technological competitiveness evaluation of patents and papers of the water separation membrane. Also, we evaluated the results from membrane research for waste water treatment, water purification treatment, seawater desalination, ion exchange process and present the future direction of research.																	1225-0112	1228-4505				AUG	2017	28	4					410	419		10.14478/ace.2017.1059								WOS:000411024000005

Combined effects of nutrient enrichment and inorganic sedimentation on benthic biota in an experimental stream system	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												Sedimentation and nutrient loading are among the most prevalent threats to fluvial ecosystem integrity. This study employed artificial streams (mesocosms) to simulate individual and combined impacts of nutrient enrichment and deposited fine sediment on benthic biota. Ninety-six circular mesocosms were used in a 21-day crossed experiment that measured the impact of three substrate compositions (0, 25, and 50% fines < 2 mm) and four nitrogen concentrations (17, 22, 43, and 94 mu g L-1 (soluble inorganic nitrogen)) on periphyton and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) of macroinvertebrate assemblages indicated substantial shifts in structural composition, while univariate models for Lepidostomatidae and total Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera revealed that nutrient and sediment subsidies related to single factors were suppressed by an additional stressor. Stressor mechanism overlap was evident at higher treatment levels, as moderate nutrient enrichment increased nutritional resources but high nitrogen concentrations lead to substrate smothering by periphyton, contributing to habitat degradation originating from inorganic sedimentation. Our study is consistent with research showing that nutrient loading and sedimentation interact to deteriorate lotic systems beyond levels attributable to either individual stressor. Management practices and pollution standards need to incorporate relationships between stressors tightly co-vary in natural settings.																	1201-3080					AUG	2017	52	3					151	165		10.2166/wqrj.2017.038								WOS:000411094100001

These results can assist decision makers in thinking about language used to communicate coastal water quality issues, particularly budget referenda.																	1068-2805	2372-2614				AUG	2017	46	2					268	295		10.1017/age.2017.9								WOS:000410911800006

A pilot project was conducted to evaluate the impact of rain gardens on the water quality and volume reduction of storm runoff from urban streets in a combined sewer area. The study took place in a six-block area on South Grand Boulevard in St. Louis, Missouri. The impact was assessed through a comparison between the pre-construction (2011/ 2012) and the post-construction (2014) phases. Shortly after the rain gardens were installed, the levels of total suspended solids, chloride, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, zinc, and copper increased. The level of mercury was lower than the detection level in both phases. E. coli was the only parameter that showed statistically significant decrease following the installation of rain gardens. The likely reason for initial increase in monitored water quality parameters is that the post-construction sampling began after the rain gardens were constructed but before planting, resulted from soil erosion and wash-out from the mulch. However, the levels of most of water quality parameters decreased in the following time period during the post-construction phase. The study found 76% volume reduction of stormwater runoff following the installation of rain gardens at one of studied sites. Statistical analysis is essential on collected data because of the encountered high variability of measured flows resulted from low flow conditions in studied sewers.

China's Sponge City construction: A discussion on technical approaches	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING					International Low Impact Development Conference	2016	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	Chinese Soc Civil Engineers, Water Ind Soc, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Water Environm Res Inst, Chinese Acad Engn, Tsinghua Univ, Peking Univ, Beijing Univ Civil Engn & Architecture				Since 2014, China has been implementing the Sponge City Construction initiative, which represents an enormous and unprecedented effort by any government in the world for achieving urban sustainability. According to preliminary estimates, the total investment on the Sponge City Plan is roughly 100 to 150 million Yuan (RMB) ($15 to $22.5 million) average per square kilometer or 10 Trillion Yuan (RMB) ($1.5 Trillion) for the 657 cities nationwide. The Sponge City Plan (SCP) calls for the use of natural processes such as soil and vegetation as part of the urban runoff control strategy, which is similar to that of low impact development (LID) and green infrastructure (GI) practices being promoted in many parts of the world. The SCP includes as its goals not only effective urban flood control, but also rainwater harvest, water quality improvement and ecological restoration. So far, the SCP implementation has encountered some barriers and challenges due to many factors. The present paper presents a review of those barriers and challenges, offers discussions and recommendations on several technical aspects such as control goals and objectives; planning/design and construction of LID/GI practices; performance evaluation. Several key recommendations are proposed on Sponge City implementation strategy, Site-specific regulatory framework and technical guidance, Product innovation and certification, LID/GI Project financing, LID/GI professional training and certification, public outreach and education. It is expected that the successful implementation of the SCP not only will bring about a sustainable, eco-friendly urbanization process in China, but also contribute enormously to the LID/GI research and development with the vast amount of relevant data and experiences generated from the Sponge City construction projects.

This is achieved by utilizing an engineered system containing a surface layer of mulch, a thick soil media often amended with a variety of materials to improve water quality, a variety of vegetation, and underdrains, depending on the surrounding soil characteristics. Bioretention systems have been studied quite extensively for warm climate applications, but data strongly supporting their long-term efficacy and application in cold climates is sparse. Although it is apparent that bioretention is an effective stormwater management system, its design in cold climate needs further research. Existing cold climate research has shown that coarser media is required to prevent concrete frost from forming. For spring, summer and fall seasons, if sufficient permeability exists to drain the system prior to freezing, peak flow and volume reduction can be maintained. Additionally, contaminants that are removed via filtration are also not impacted by cold climates. In contrary, dissolved contaminants, nutrients, and organics are significantly more variable in their ability to be removed or degraded via bioretention in colder temperatures. Winter road maintenance salts have been shown to negatively impact the removal of some contaminants and positively impact others, while their effects on properly selected vegetation or bacteria health are also not well understood. Research in these water quality aspects has been inconsistent and therefore requires further study.

The "sponge city" concept emphasizes that the runoff can permeate the soil or be stored temporarily, and rainwater could be used again when it is needed. Beijing is one of the earliest cities to study rainwater harvesting and LID techniques in China. Through long-term monitoring of rainfall, runoff flow, and water quality of a campus demonstration project in Beijing, the runoff quantity and pollutant concentration variations have been analyzed. Furthermore, the runoff reduction effects of single LID measure, such as green roof, filtration chamber, and permeable pavement, have been investigated. Additionally, the overall reduction effectiveness of the LID system on the average annual rainfall runoff and pollution load has been discussed. Preliminary studies suggest that runoff pollutant concentration is positively correlated with the rainfall interval time, and the longer rainfall interval time leads to higher runoff pollutant concentrations. The very good outflow quality of the rainwater harvesting system could satisfy the reclaimed water quality standard for scenic entertainment use. The non-point-source pollution reduction effects of the LID system are obvious because the pollutants could be removed by filtration on the one hand and the pollution load could be reduced because of the significantly reduced outflow on the other hand.

After administration, they end up in municipal wastewater streams. However, conventional wastewater treatment plants are incapable of removing them effectively resulting in their detection in the discharged effluents and consequently in the environment. Presence of antibiotics in the environmental waters has negative effect on water quality and also contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, advanced treatment methods become an inevitable approach. This mini review provides a brief summary on the occurrence of macrolide antibiotics in the aquatic environment and overview of the recent developments in photocatalytic degradation using TiO2 for their efficient removal.

High-resolution images of phytoplankton cells can now be acquired by digital microscopes, which facilitate automating the analysis and identification process of specimens. Therefore, new systems of image analysis are potentially advantageous compared to manual methods of counting for solution identification. Segmentation is an important step in the analysis of phytoplankton images. Many standard techniques like thresholding and edge detection are employed in the segmentation of diatoms and other phytoplankton, which are crucial organisms in microscopy images. However, in general, they require several parameters to be fixed beforehand by the user in order to get the best results. This process is usually done by comparing results and looking for the best parameters. To automatize this process, we propose an automatic tuning method to find the optimal parameters in an iterative procedure, called Parametric Segmentation Tuning (PST). This technique compares successive segmentation results, choosing the ones that gets the maximal similarity. In this paper, tuning is formulated as an optimization problem using a similarity function within the solution space. This space consists of the set of binary images that are generated by the segmentation technique to be tuned, where these binary images are seen as a function of the original images and the segmentation parameters. The PST technique was tested with two of the most popular techniques employed to segment phytoplankton images: the Canny edge detection and a binarisation method. The results of the thresholding technique were validated by comparing them to those of the Otsu method and the Canny method with a ground truth. They show that PST is effective to find the best parameters.																	2076-3417					AUG	2017	7	8							762	10.3390/app7080762								WOS:000408905900012						
J	Amicarelli, A; Leuzzi, G; Monti, P; Alessandrini, S; Ferrero, E				Amicarelli, Andrea; Leuzzi, Giovanni; Monti, Paolo; Alessandrini, Stefano; Ferrero, Enrico			A stochastic Lagrangian micromixing model for the dispersion of reactive scalars in turbulent flows: role of concentration fluctuations and improvements to the conserved scalar theory under non-homogeneous conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												Several reaction schemes, based on the conserved scalar theory, are implemented within a stochastic Lagrangian micromixing model to simulate the dispersion of reactive scalars in turbulent flows. In particular, the formulation of the reaction-dominated limit (RDL) reaction scheme is here extended to improve the model performance under non-homogeneous conditions (NHRDL scheme). The validation of the stochastic model is obtained by comparison with the available measurements of reactive pollutant concentrations in a grid-generated turbulent flow. This test case describes the dispersion of two atmospheric reactant species (NO and O-3) and their reaction product (NO2) in an unbounded turbulent flow. Model inter-comparisons are also assessed, by considering the results of state-of-the-art models for pollutant dispersion. The present validation shows that RDL reaction scheme provides a systematic overestimation (relative error of ca. 85% around the centreline) in computing the local reactant consumption/production rate, whereas the NHRDL scheme drastically reduces this gap (relative error lower than 5% around the centreline). In terms of NO2 production (or reactant consumption), neglecting concentration fluctuations determines overestimations of the product mean of around 100% and a NO2 local production of one order of magnitude higher than the reference simulation. In terms of standard deviations, the concentration fluctuations of both the passive and reactive scalars are generally of the same order of magnitude or up to 1 or 2 orders of magnitudes higher than the corresponding ensemble mean values, except for the background reactant close to the plume edges. The study highlights the importance of modelling pollutant reactions depending on the instantaneous instead of the mean concentrations of the reactants, thus quantifying the role of the turbulent fluctuations of concentration, in terms of scalar statistics (mean, standard deviation, intensity of fluctuations, skewness and kurtosis of concentration, segregation coefficient, simulated reaction rate). This stochastic particle method represents an efficient numerical technique to solve the convection-diffusion equation for reactive scalars and involves several application fields: micro-scale air quality (urban and street-canyon scales), accidental releases, impact of odours, water quality and fluid flow industrial processes (e.g. combustion).

Environmental impact of coal mining and coal seam gas production on surface water quality in the Sydney basin, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The extraction of coal and coal seamgas (CSG) will generate produced water that, if not adequately treated, will pollute surface and groundwater systems. InAustralia, the discharge of produced water from coal mining and related activities is regulated by the state environment agency through a pollution licence. This licence sets the discharge limits for a range of analytes to protect the environment into which the producedwater is discharged. This study reports on the impact of produced water from coal mine activities located within or discharging into high conservation environments, such as National Parks, in the outer region of Sydney, Australia. The water samples upstream and downstream from the discharge points from six mines were taken, and 110 parameters were tested. The results were assessed against a water quality index (WQI) which accounts for pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, total phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen and E. coli. The water quality assessment based on the trace metal contents against various national maximum admissible concentration (MAC) and their corresponding environmental impacts was also included in the study which also established a base value of water quality for further study. The study revealed that impacted water downstream of the mine discharge points contained higher metal content than the upstream reference locations. In many cases, the downstream water was above the Australia and New Zealand Environment Conservation Council and international water quality guidelines for freshwater stream. The major outliers to the guidelines were aluminium (Al), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). The WQI of surface water at and downstream of the discharge point was lower when compared to upstream or reference conditions in the majority of cases. Toxicology indices of metals present in industrial discharges were used as an additional tool to assess water quality, and the newly proposed environmental water quality index (EWQI) lead to better trend in the impact of coal and coal seam gas mining activities on surface water quality when compared to the upstream reference water samples. Metal content limits were based on the impact points assigned by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, USA. For environmental and health impact assessment, the approach used in this study can be applied as a model to provide a basis to assess the anthropogenic contribution from the industrial and mining activities on the environment.

A case study characterizing animal fecal sources in surface water using a mitochondrial DNA marker	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water quality impairment by fecal waste in coastal watersheds is a public health issue. The present study provided evidence for the use of a mitochondrial (mtDNA) marker to detect animal fecal sources in surface water. The accurate identification of fecal pollution is based on the notion that fecal microorganisms preferentially inhabit a host animal's gut environment. In contrast, mtDNA host-specific markers are inherent to eukaryotic host cells, which offers the advantage by detecting DNA from the host rather than its fecal bacteria. The present study focused on sampling water presumably from non-point sources (NPS), which can increase bacterial and nitrogen concentrations to receiving water bodies. Stream sampling sites located within the Piscataqua River Watershed (PRW), New Hampshire, USA, were sampled from a range of sites that experienced nitrogen inputs such as sewer and septic systems and suburban runoff. Three mitochondrial (mtDNA) gene marker assays (human, bovine, and canine) were tested from surface water. Nineteen sites were sampled during an 18-month period. Analyses of the combined single andmultiplex assay results showed that the proportion of occurrence was highest for bovine (15.6%; n = 77) compared to canine (5.6%; n = 70) and human (5.7%; n = 107) mtDNA gene markers. For the human mtDNA marker, there was a statistically significant relationship between presence vs. absence and land use (Fisher's test p = 0.0031). This result was evident particularly for rural suburban septic, which showed the highest proportion of presence (19.2%) compared to the urban sewered (3.3%), suburban sewered (0%), and agricultural (0%) as well as forested septic (0%) sites. Although further testing across varied land use is needed, our study provides evidence for using the mtDNA marker in large watersheds.

J	Fraser, G; Rohde, K; Silburn, M				Fraser, Grant; Rohde, Ken; Silburn, Mark			Fertiliser management effects on dissolved inorganic nitrogen in runoff from Australian sugarcane farms	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) movement from Australian sugarcane farms is believed to be a major cause of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks which have reduced the Great Barrier Reef coral cover by similar to 21% (1985-2012). We develop a daily model of DIN concentration in runoff based on >200 field monitored runoff events. Runoff DIN concentrations were related to nitrogen fertiliser application rates and decreased after application with time and cumulative rainfall. Runoff after liquid fertiliser applications had higher initial DIN concentrations, though these concentrations diminished more rapidly in comparison to granular fertiliser applications. The model was validated using an independent field dataset and provided reasonable estimates of runoff DIN concentrations based on a number of modelling efficiency score results. The runoff DIN concentration model was combined with a water balance cropping model to investigate temporal aspects of sugarcane fertiliser management. Nitrogen fertiliser application in December (start of wet season) had the highest risk of DIN movement, and this was further exacerbated in years with a climate forecast for 'wet' seasonal conditions. The potential utility of a climate forecasting system to predict forthcoming wet months and hence DIN loss risk is demonstrated. Earlier fertiliser application or reducing fertiliser application rates in seasons with a wet climate forecast may markedly reduce runoff DIN loads; however, it is recommended that these findings be tested at a broader scale.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							409	10.1007/s10661-017-6115-z								WOS:000410241300013	28733785

Quality assessment and public health status of harvested rainwater in a peri-urban community in Edo State of Nigeria	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The harvested rainwater is an alternative water source in communities where there is limited or scarcity of water distribution system. However, contamination of roof-harvested rainwater is of immense concern to the general public health. Therefore, this study was initiated to assess the levels of physicochemical quality and heavy metal concentrations in the harvested rainwater from Oluku communities in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. The roof-harvested rainwater samples were collected from 20 independent different residential households in Oluku communities, between April 2015 and September 2015. Physicochemical analyses were carried out using standard analytical methods, and heavy metal concentrations were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The evaluation of the rainwater harvesting shows that 60% (12/20) of the roofs were made of corrugated iron sheets; aluminum sheets, 20%(4/20); asbestos, 10%(2/20); and open space was 10% (2/20). Also, the storage systems used for the storage of harvested rainwater were as follows: PVC tanks, 20% (4/20); drums, 30% (6/20); buckets, 25% (5/20); and wells, 25% (5/20). The physicochemical indicators investigated (temperature, nitrate, chlorine content, electrical conductivity, phosphate, total dissolved solids, and sulfate) were within World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. However, some pH levels of the roof-harvested rainwater were acidic and below the WHO standard. Furthermore, a high value of turbidity was observed in some locations and exceeded the WHO guidelines. Though some heavy metal indicators (Zn, Na, K, and Ca) in this study were within the WHO guidelines, some locations revealed heavy metal (Cu, Fe, and Cd) concentrations slightly above the WHO guidelines. There is need for proper rainwater harvesting system and continuous monitoring of harvested rainwater for potable uses.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							405	10.1007/s10661-017-6122-0								WOS:000410241300009	28726176

Changes in sub-soil river water quality upon its open storage-a case study	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												A study was carried out to investigate the changes in the physicochemical and biological properties of sub-soil river water upon its storage in a man-made reservoir. Palar sub-soil and reservoir water samples were collated fortnightly for a period of 5 years (2010-2014). The open reservoir is used as a reliable raw water source for condenser cooling systems and for the demineralizing (DM) plant input of Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR), Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS), and other laboratories at Kalpakkam, southeast coast of India. Relatively high nutrient concentration was observed in the Palar sub-soil water, and a significant reduction in average concentration (mu mol l(-1)) of phosphate (Palar 1.92; open reservoir 1.54) and nitrate (Palar 9.78; open reservoir 5.67) was observed from Palar to open reservoir. Substantial increase in pH (Palar 8.05; open reservoir 8.45), dissolved oxygen (mg l(-1)) (Palar 6.07; open reservoir 8.47), and chlorophyll-a (mg m(-3)) (Palar 1.66; open reservoir 8.43) values were noticed from the Palar sub-soil water to open reservoir water. It is concluded that sub-soil water with higher nutrient concentrations when stored openly, exposing to the sun, resulted in growth of plants, planktonic, and macrophytes, which led to substantial deterioration in water quality from its utility point of view as a condenser cooling medium and raw water input for DM plant.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							399	10.1007/s10661-017-6095-z								WOS:000410241300003	28718095

More than four million people living in this megacity use groundwater for drinking, industrial and household purposes. Thus, major ion and trace element content were assessed in order to investigate the main hydrochemical properties of groundwater and determine if groundwater of the area poses a threat to the MMA population. Hierarchical cluster analysis using all the groundwater chemical data showed five groups of water. The first two groups were classified as recharge waters (Ca-HCO3) coming from the foothills of mountain belts. The third group was also of Ca-HCO3 water type flowing through lutites and limestones. Transition zone waters of group four (Ca-HCO3-SO4) flow through the valley of Monterrey, whereas discharge waters of group 5 (Ca-SO4) were found toward the north and northeast of the MMA. Principal component analysis performed in groundwater data indicates four principal components (PCs). PC1 included major ions Si, Co, Se, and Zn, suggesting that these are derived by rock weathering. Other trace elements such as As, Mo, Mn, and U are coupled in PC2 because they show redox sensitive properties. PC3 indicates that Pb and Cu could be the less mobile elements in groundwater. Although groundwater supplied to MMA showed a high-quality, high mineralized waters of group 5 have NO3- concentrations higher than the maximum value proposed by international guidelines and SO42-, NO3-, and total dissolved solid concentrations higher than the maximum levels allowed by the Mexican normative.

Comparative study of the effects of a small-scale trout farm on the macrozoobenthos, potamoplankton, and epilithic diatom communities	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Trout farms are one of the major sources of pollution of highland streams and rivers, which are very sensitive ecosystems otherwise scarcely influenced by human activities. A trout farm with low annual production was chosen for comparative monitoring of its effects on the macrozoobenthos, epilithic diatom, and potamoplankton communities in the receiving stream. Research was conducted every 2 months during a period of 1 year (one control point and three localities downstream from the farm). The fish farm discharge induced moderate alteration of environmental factors in the receiving watercourse, viz., significant increase of the ionized and un-ionized ammonia fraction, dissolved oxygen concentration, and biological oxygen demand. Species richness and Simpson's diversity index did not change in any of the communities. Correspondent analysis of potamoplankton community composition clearly showed trout farm effects, thereby indicating the need for reevaluation of saprobic valence values for potamoplankton species. The complete lack of influence of the trout farm discharge on the epilithic diatom community is probably due to absence of significant changes of phosphorus concentration in the receiving stream. Effects of the trout farm on the macrozoobenthos community were further characterized by 14 additional indices. The percentages of Chironomidae larvae, shredders, and total collectors; ratio of shredders to collectors; and the family biotic index are suggested as candidates for future multimetric index for measuring of trout farm influence.

Developing an environmental water quality monitoring program for Haraz River in Northern Iran	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water quality management plans are an indispensable strategy for conservation and utilization of water resources in a sustainable manner. One common industrial use of water is aquaculture. The present study is an attempt to use statistical analyses in order to prepare an environmental water quality monitoring program for Haraz River, in Northern Iran. For this purpose, the analysis of a total number of 18 physicochemical parameters was performed at 15 stations during a 1-year sampling period. According to the results of the multivariate statistical methods, the optimal monitoring would be possible by only 3 stations and 12 parameters, including NH3, EC, BOD, TSS, DO, PO4, NO3, TDS, temperature, turbidity, coliform, and discharge. In other words, newly designed network, with a total number of 36 measurements (3 stations x 12 parameters = 36 parameters), could achieve exactly the same performance as the former network, designed based on 234 measurements (13 stations x 18 parameters = 234 parameters). Based on the results of cluster, principal component, and factor analyses, the stations were divided into three groups of high pollution (HP), medium pollution (MP), and low pollution (LP). By clustering the stations, it would be possible to track the water quality of Haraz River, only by one station at each cluster, which facilitates rapid assessment of the water quality in the river basin. Emphasizing on three main axes of monitoring program, including measurement parameters, sampling frequency, and spatial pattern of sampling points, the water quality monitoring program was optimized for the river basin based on natural conditions of the study area, monitoring objectives, and required financial resources (a total annual cost of about US $2625, excluding the overhead costs).																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							410	10.1007/s10661-017-6125-x								WOS:000410241300014	28733786

Quality assessment of groundwater from the south-eastern Arabian Peninsula	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Assessment of groundwater quality plays a significant role in the utilization of the scarce water resources globally and especially in arid regions. The increasing abstraction together with man-made contamination and seawater intrusion have strongly affected groundwater quality in the Arabia Peninsula, exemplified by the investigation given here from the United Arab Emirates, where the groundwater is seldom reviewed and assessed. In the aim of assessing current groundwater quality, we here present a comparison of chemical data linked to aquifers types. The results reveal that most of the investigated groundwater is not suitable for drinking, household, and agricultural purposes following the WHO permissible limits. Aquifer composition and climate have vital control on the water quality, with the carbonate aquifers contain the least potable water compared to the ophiolites and Quaternary clastics. Seawater intrusion along coastal regions has deteriorated the water quality and the phenomenon may become more intensive with future warming climate and rising sea level.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							411	10.1007/s10661-017-6092-2								WOS:000410241300015	28735434

Spatial patterns of DOC concentration and DOM optical properties in a Brazilian tropical river-wetland system	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The Cerrado (savanna) and Pantanal (wetland) biomes of Central Western Brazil have experienced significant development activity in recent decades, including extensive land cover conversion from natural ecosystems to agriculture and urban expansion. The Cuiaba River transects the Cerrado biome prior to inundating large areas of the Pantanal, creating one of the largest biodiversity hot spots in the world. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the optical absorbance and fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from 40 sampling locations spanning Cerrado and Pantanal biomes during wet and dry seasons. In the upper, more agricultural region of the basin, DOC concentrations were highest in the rainy season with more aromatic and humified DOM. In contrast, DOC concentrations and DOM optical properties were more uniform for the more urbanized middle region of the basin between wet and dry seasons, as well as across sample locations. In the lower region of the basin, wet season connectivity between the river and the Pantanal floodplain led to high DOC concentrations, a fourfold increase in humification index (HIX) (an indicator of DOM humification), and a 50% reduction in the spectral slope (S-R). Basin-wide, wet season values for S-R, HIX, and FI (fluorescence index) indicated an increasing representation of terrestrially derived DOM that was more humified. Parallel factor analysis identified two terrestrially derived components (C1 and C2) representing 77% of total fluorescing DOM (fDOM). A third, protein-like fDOM component increased markedly during the wet season within the more urban-impacted region.

A Greener UV and Peroxide-Based Chemical Oxygen Demand Test	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Water quality assessment typically includes the determination of chemical oxygen demand (COD) by oxidation of organic matter with Cr(VI) in an acidic medium followed by digestion. Unfortunately, the required reagents are harmful and the reaction times are rather long. We investigated earlier the use of H2O2 as a more environmentally friendly oxidizing agent to replace the hazardous chromates. In the present study, we have furthered this possibility by incorporating the use of H2O2 in the presence of UV light. A protocol has been devised and tested with standards and real samples that replaces toxic Cr(VI), halves the amount of silver sulfate required, and greatly reduces the necessary reaction time, thus yielding a faster and more environmentally sound method.

INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Physico-chemical parameters and bacterial abundance of Visakhapknam coastal water were analysed for the period July 2011 to July 2013 in four selected stations. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) in four stations ranged between 4.9-9.8 mg/l with mean DO maximum in station Y (8.33 +/- 0.674 mg/l) and minimum at station F (6.27 +/- 0.425 mg/l). pH values ranged between 6.9 and 9.8. pH was maximum at station Y (8.068 +/- 0.451) and minimum at station B (7.95 +/- 0.439). Salinity was recorded between 2139 ppt in four stations with highest mean at station Y (32.9 +/- 2.7) and lowest at station F (31.2 +/- 3.3). Temperature in four stations ranged between 25 to 33 degrees C, with a mean higher temperature at station F (30.52 +/- 1.25 degrees C) and lower at Y (28.28 +/- 1.25 degrees C).

J	Chen, RS; Tsai, CM				Chen, Rong-Song; Tsai, Chan-Ming			Development of an Evaluation System for Sustaining Reservoir Functions-A Case Study of Shiwen Reservoir in Taiwan	SUSTAINABILITY												Reservoirs serve as important facilities, providing a stable source of public water in Taiwan. As construction of new reservoirs becomes more difficult, it is essential to ensure sustainable functionality of reservoirs in the future. To this end, this study proposes a system for reservoir sustainability evaluation. The evaluation system consists of social justice, environmental protection, and economic development containing 12 indicators which are grouped into six categories: flood control, sediment management, water resources allocation, river ecology, water quality, and benefit and fairness. Moreover, evaluation system operational procedures to supplement planning and decision-making processes are proposed, and applied in a case study of the Shiwen reservoir planning in Taiwan. The planned reservoir in this case study is rated as "Good", nearly "Excellent", in sustainability as evaluated with the Sustainability Confidence Index (SCI). Additionally, Analytic Network Process (ANP) results indicate that the flood control capacity and sediment management are the first and second most important indicators for the reservoir. If desilting operations had been conducted, the SCI values would have increased from 3.3 to 3.7, warranting an "Excellent" rating for the reservoir. The case study demonstrates that decision-makers can apply the proposed system when managing reservoir evaluations.																	2071-1050					AUG	2017	9	8							1387	10.3390/su9081387								WOS:000408861800102

The method can effectively connect the natural characteristics of watershed water sources, three-level zoning of water resources, and comprehensively consider the pollution distribution, socio-economics and many other factors. The zoning process includes four steps: (1) Generate the multi-level hydrological unit; (2) Identify the multi-element water catchment units; (3) Obtain the control unit with the administrative boundary as the boundary; (4) Check and adjust the results to meet the actual needs. Based on this method, the Yangtze River Basin was divided into 568 control units with a total area of 1.91 million km(2). These control units were used as the basic unit to analyze the water quality status and the results show that the upper reaches have good water quality, while the lower reaches have poor water quality and more serious water pollution. Our study helps the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China develop the list of control units that are needed to improve water quality during the 13th Five-Year Plan, with a goal to provide technical support for control-unit-based water pollution prevention and control in the future.

These systems are found to retain brackish characteristics until total desalination is achieved. To evaluate the effects of salinity on the organic substances released from the sediment, a laboratory water-sediment column experiment was conducted to assess associated changes in water quality variables such as the sediment oxygen demand (SOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), and concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Under high salinity conditions, the release of N from the sediment was promoted with the enhancement of SOD and COD. This trend was accounted for by the response of the microorganisms (cell breakdown of algae and suppression of metabolic activity). Our results suggest that chemicals (N, P, and COD) released from sediment and its overall impact on the water quality of a brackish lake should vary depending on the temporal and spatial dynamics of the salinity.

J	Liyanage, CP; Yamada, K				Liyanage, Chamara P.; Yamada, Koichi			Impact of Population Growth on the Water Quality of Natural Water Bodies	SUSTAINABILITY												Human activities pose a significant threat to the water quality of rivers when pollution exceeds the threshold limit. Urban activities in particular are highlighted as one of the major causes of contamination in surface water bodies in Asian countries. Evaluation of sustainable human population capacities in river watersheds is necessary to maintain better freshwater ecosystems in a country while achieving its development goals as a nation. We evaluated the correlation between the growth rate of the population in a watershed area and water quality parameters of a river ecosystem. The Kelani River in Sri Lanka was selected for the study. The highest correlation coefficients of 0.7, 0.69, 0.69 (p < 0.01) corresponding to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO) and total coliform (TC) were obtained with the population in watersheds of the Kelani river in Sri Lanka. Thus, we propose a quantitative approach to estimating the population capacity of watersheds based on water quality classification standards (WQCS), employing the Bayesian network (BN) classification model. The optimum population ranges were obtained from the probability distribution table of the population node in the BN. The results showed that the population density should be approximately less than 2375 to keep the water quality in the watershed for bathing and drinking purposes and approximately less than 2672 for fish and other aquatic organisms. This research will offer a means that can used to understand the impact of population on water quality in river basins and confer direct influence on natural water bodies.																	2071-1050					AUG	2017	9	8							1405	10.3390/su9081405								WOS:000408861800120

Some of these initiatives were direct responses to the evolving challenges in the water sector, and put forest hydrological services into perspective. To a certain extent, water was managed within a wider environmental context through the combination of forest and water management. However, the efforts to enhance forest hydrological services did not correspond to the immense potential of forests for the achievement of sustainable water management. We present a comprehensive and current view of the major challenges and opportunities related to forest hydrological services in South Korea. We identify key forest hydrological services in view of the major biophysical, environmental, and economic challenges in the water sector. We propose guidelines for the enhancement of forest hydrological services and for a better inclusion of these services in South Korea's sustainable development strategy. An increased contribution of forests to the provision of high-quality water in sufficient, regulated amounts, and to the preservation of a safe environment in regards to natural hazards is imperative for the long-term development of South Korea.

J	Shen, MH; Yang, YL				Shen, Manhong; Yang, Yongliang			The Water Pollution Policy Regime Shift and Boundary Pollution: Evidence from the Change of Water Pollution Levels in China	SUSTAINABILITY												Boundary environmental pollution and pollution spillovers are important issues for improving the water quality of trans-boundary rivers. This paper explores the empirical effects of the evolution of the pollution reduction mandates on boundary pollution by studying the change of water pollution levels (as proxied by pH, BOD, COD and NH3-N) of key state monitoring stations from 2004 to 2014. The empirical findings support the existence of boundary pollution and indicate the association between environmental policy and boundary pollution levels using propensity score matching, although the relation is conditional on which water pollution measure is considered. The pollution levels of monitoring stations on provincial borders are significantly higher than those of interior monitoring stations. The pollution of tributaries is more serious than that of the main stream, which was quickly reversed after the pollution reduction mandates changed. The improvement of the water environment showed great differences with the change of policy when we compare the water quality of monitoring stations in the upper reaches of provincial borders with the water quality downstream of provincial borders. Our empirical analysis finds strong evidence of strategic polluting across provincial borders. Local officials may manipulate pollution within their jurisdictions, and the overall pollution reduction target will exacerbate border pollution, whereas water quality inspection can reduce marginal pollution. Finally, we further validate the net impact of the policies on boundary pollution using a difference in difference (DID) approach.

This paper tracks the change trajectories of rural household livelihoods and regional ecological footprints in four water source areas of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project where various ecological and environmental protection projects and measures are being proposed to protect water quality. As a result, some concerns regarding rural livelihood have arisen. The sustainable livelihood approach developed by DFID (Department for International Development in UK) was used to measure the natural, physical, financial, human, and social capitals of rural livelihoods, while the ecological footprint accounting approach was used to calculate the amount of bio-productive spaces that produce the yearly resource flows for human consumption. The study period is 2000-2014 and data was obtained from the Statistical Yearbooks. The results show that the change trend of natural capitals of rural households, which have increased by 72.5% (SY), 98.8% (NY), 69.3% (TA), and 120.3% (JN) within 15 years, determine the overall change track of rural livelihoods and that rural household livelihood grows with the expansion of regional ecological footprints. Sensitivity of regional eco-footprints to rural livelihood varies from 5.8 to 0.5 in case areas. It is recommended that in the "post South-to-North Water Diversion era", four policy instruments-population transfer and relocation, industrial restructuring and updating, rural infrastructure and community reconstruction, and cross-ecological compensation-should be adopted to improve sustainable livelihoods in these four water source areas.

Application to Fuente de Piedra Ramsar, Mediterranean Salt Lake (South of Spain)	WATER												This work concerns the case study of a Mediterranean Ramsar salt lake (Fuente de Piedra, southern Spain) that receives the treated wastewater of the local village treatment plant. The wastewater goes through a system of canals, water dams, and three semi-natural ponds that were built in 2005. This work aims to investigate the capacity of the system to assimilate the impact of wastewater effluents on Lake Fuente de Piedra. For this, four points were sampled on 27-29 April 2016, at the inlet and the outlet points of the first and the third semi-natural ponds, with three replicates each. Temperature, pH, and conductivity at the inlet were 19.62 degrees C, 7.99, and 3262.67 mu S/cm, respectively, and increased through the pond system by 7.59%, 8.04%, and 37.34%, respectively. Phytoplankton concentration indicators decreased from the inlet point to the outlet point (chlorophyll a from > 500 to < 20mg/L), as did the biovolume (from > 5 x 10(10) to 4.3 x 10(9) mu m(3)/mL). Zooplankton biovolume, in contrast, increased three orders of magnitude from the inlet (3.5 x 10(7) mu m(3)/mL) to the outlet point (1.6 x 10(9) mu m(3)/mL). Heterotrophic bacteria (1.29 x 10(5) cfu/mL) and faecal enterococci (1033 +/- 351 cfu/100 mL) were high at the inlet point, but decreased at the outlet point by almost three orders of magnitude. Total phosphorous and total nitrogen decreased 40.3% and 23.1% through the pond system. The results showed an improvement in water quality in its passage through the built system. Additionally, as permanent wetlands with acceptable water quality, the water system attracts wild fauna during the dry summer, leading to the conclusion that these semi-natural or artificial wetlands should be extrapolated to other aquatic ecosystems (Mediterranean wetlands) that receive contributions of residual waters. Better functioning of the treatment plant is desirable to improve the conservation of the Ramsar and adjacent wetlands systems.

Christian			Diel and Seasonal Patterns in Continuously Monitored Water Quality at Fixed Sites in Two Adjacent Embayments of the Tidal Freshwater Potomac River	WATER												Water quality patterns in two adjacent embayments of the tidal freshwater Potomac River were compared using continuously monitored data. The two embayments, the tidal Occoquan and Gunston Cove, are shallow embayments fed by tributaries which vary in their watershed attributes. The tidal Occoquan has a larger watershed and a dam just upstream from the head of tide whereas Gunston Cove has a large wastewater treatment plant just upstream of the embayment. Water temperature, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH were collected at 15 min intervals at representative locations in the two embayments from April through November of 2012. Mean daily values of water quality variables exhibited similar seasonal patterns at both sites which were related to seasonal patterns of forcing functions such as temperature, light and freshwater inflows. Three two-week intervals were examined in great detail. During a mid-summer period of stable conditions and low flow, both embayments exhibited strong and consistent diel (light cycle-based) periodicity in temperature, DO, and pH. Specific conductance exhibited semi-diel (tidal cycle-based) periodicity. The two other two-week intervals were punctuated by substantial flow events which resulted in major changes in daily mean values and disruptions to the typical diel or semi-diel cycles. The large rainfall event related to Hurricane Sandy caused a major disruption in diel and semi-diel cycles. Some cycles were quickly re-established and others took a week or more. The two embayments exhibited similar behavior in most aspects. Site-specific factors such as differences in the frequency and magnitude of tributary flow pulses and the presence of treated sewage discharge at Gunston Cove helped explain some of the differences observed between the two embayments.

WATER												An important motivation for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive is the creation of non-market environmental benefits, such as improved ecological quality, or greater opportunities for open-access river recreation via microbial pollution remediation. Pollution sources impacting on ecological or recreational water quality may be uncorrelated, but non-market benefits arising from riverine improvements are typically conflated within benefit valuation studies. Using stated preference choice experiments embedded within a survey that also collected respondents' socio-economic characteristics, we aimed to disaggregate these sources of value for different river users, thereby allowing decision makers to understand the consequences of adopting alternative investment strategies. Our results suggested that anglers derived greater value from improvements to the ecological quality of river water, in contrast to swimmers and rowers, for whom greater value is gained from improvements to recreational quality. More generally, we found three distinct groups of respondents: a majority preferring ecological over recreational improvements, a substantial minority holding opposing preference orderings, and a yet smaller proportion expressing relatively low values for either form of river quality enhancement. As such, this research demonstrates that the non-market benefits that may accrue from different types of water quality improvements are nuanced in terms of their potential beneficiaries and, by inference, their overall value and policy implications.

Spatial and Seasonal Surface Water Quality Assessment in a Tropical Urban Catchment: Burio River, Costa Rica	WATER												Water quality assessments are essential for providing information regarding integrated water resource management processes. This study presents the results of a spatial and seasonal surface water quality assessment of the Burio river sub-catchment in Costa Rica. Fourteen sample campaigns were conducted at eight sample sites between 2005 and 2010. Seasonal variations were evaluated using linear mixed-effects models where dissolved oxygen, total solids, and nitrate showed significant differences between dry and wet seasons (p < 0.05). Cluster analysis identified three clusters at the top, middle, and bottom of the catchment that were consistent with land use patterns, and principal component analysis identified the main parameters that were affecting 84% of the total variance in water quality (biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, total phosphate, and nitrate). The National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI) results indicated the majority of the river consisted of mainly "medium" water quality, although "bad" and "good" water quality results were identified depending on sample site and season. This methodological approach provides a useful monitoring technique for local governments that can be used for further remediation strategies.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							558	10.3390/w9080558								WOS:000408729200005						
J	Meng, C; Wang, XL; Li, Y				Meng, Chong; Wang, Xiaolei; Li, Yu			An Optimization Model for Waste Load Allocation under Water Carrying Capacity Improvement Management, A Case Study of the Yitong River, Northeast China	WATER												In this study, a two-stage stochastic programming (TSP) model was developed for supporting regional waste load(chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH3-N) allocation in four main pollution departments (industry, municipal, livestock breeding, and agriculture), constrained by the water carrying capacity, which can be improved by ecological restoration engineering, in the nine function zones of the Yitong River. A number of scenarios corresponding to different stream flow levels were examined. The results revealed that the carrying capacity of COD and NH3-N has a similar tendency with a positive correlation to stream flow levels. The allocation amount of each pollutant for the four departments was obtained differently in each zone, and ecological restoration engineering solutions were obtained for different zones to improve the carrying capacity of the pollutants in order to meet the permitted emission allocation and water qualities. The results are helpful in establishing a rational discharge permit system of each pollution unit under water quality targets, and provide a basis for production plans of these pollution units.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							573	10.3390/w9080573								WOS:000408729200020

This phenomenon is due to the effect of the degradation of water environment. Turbidity is one of the most important water quality parameters directly related to underwater light penetration which affects the primary productivity. This study aims to investigate spatiotemporal variation of turbidity in the waters with major factors affecting its patterns using remote sensing data. An algorithm for turbidity retrieval was developed based on the correlation between in situ measurements and a red band of Landsat 8 OLI with R-2 = 0.84 (p < 0.05). Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) model was used to compute bed shear stress, a major factor affecting turbidity in shallow waters. In addition, the relationships between turbidity and rainfall, and bed shear stress induced by wind were analyzed. It was found that: (1) In the dry season, turbidity was low at the middle of the bay while it was high in shallow waters nearby coastlines. Resuspension of bed sediment was a major factor controlling turbidity during time with no rainfall. (2) In the rainy season or for a short time after rainfall in the dry season, turbidity was high due to a large amount of runoff entering into the study area.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							570	10.3390/w9080570								WOS:000408729200017						
J	Novo, P				Novo, Paula			Accounting for the Assimilative Capacity of Water Systems in Scotland	WATER												A key methodological challenge in understanding the relationship between the economy and the underlying ecosystem base resides in how to account for the ecosystem's degradation and the decline of associated ecosystem services. In this study, we use information on nutrients and metals concentrations from the Environmental Change Network (ECN) database and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for the period 2000-2010 in order to assess the assimilation capacity of water systems. The research covers five upstream sites and 17 downstream sites in northeast Scotland. Our results highlight the relevance of considering a number of pollutants, and suggest that elements such as arsenic, lead and mercury can pose a threat to ecosystems' sustainability and health. However, little research has been done in terms of their assimilation capacity and their impact on grey water footprint assessments. In addition, the results indicate that background conditions might be relevant when performing sustainability analysis at different spatial scales. The study also poses relevant questions in relation to land management approaches versus traditional 'end-of-pipe' water treatment approaches, and the definition of maximum and background concentrations. In this regard, further studies will be required to understand the trade-offs between different ecosystem services depending on how these concentrations are defined.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							559	10.3390/w9080559								WOS:000408729200006

As a result, P removal structures were developed to filter dissolved P from drainage water before reaching a water body. While many P removal structures with different P sorption materials (PSMs) have been constructed over the past two decades, there remains a need to evaluate their performances and compare on a normalized basis. The purpose of this review was to compile performance data of pilot and field-scale P removal structures and present techniques for normalization and comparison. Over 40 studies were normalized by expressing cumulative P removal as a function of cumulative P loading to the contained PSM. Results were further analyzed as a function of retention time (RT), inflow P concentration, and type of PSM. Structures treating wastewater were generally more efficient than non-point drainage water due to higher RT and inflow P concentrations. For Ca-rich PSMs, including slag, increased RT allowed for greater P removal. Among structures with low RT and inflow P concentrations common to non-point drainage, Fe-based materials had an overall higher cumulative removal efficiency compared to non-slag and slag materials.

Design, Construction, and Application of an Inexpensive, High-Resolution Water Sampler	WATER												The cost of high-resolution water sampling devices for ecological studies and water quality analyses can be prohibitive. Moreover, the potential for operator error in the use of complicated sampling equipment can lead to inaccuracies. Here we describe the construction and operation of an inexpensive and easy-to-use water sampler that achieves a water column sampling resolution of approximately 1 cm. The device is driven by a peristaltic pump and is constructed entirely of non-corrosive and non-reactive materials. The sampler has no moving parts and was completely reliable in fieldwork on temperate and Antarctic lakes. The device is especially suited for the collection of water samples from calm or stagnant surface waters, such as lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and deep swamps or other wetlands. In addition, because its components are unaffected by corrosive salts and sulfides, the device is suitable for sampling calm inlet waters, including shallow bays and estuaries. Because of its low cost, simple construction, compact design, and precision performance, this water sampler is an excellent option for studying and monitoring shallow to moderately deep (<50 m) natural waters.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							578	10.3390/w9080578								WOS:000408729200025						
J	Sommerlot, AR; Easton, ZM				Sommerlot, Andrew R.; Easton, Zachary M.			A Web Based Interface for Distributed Short-Term Soil Moisture Forecasts	WATER												Agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution is a source of water quality impairment, and demonstrates widely varying spatial and temporal pollution potential. Many efforts to protect water quality are based on seasonal and annual estimates of pollutant loss potential (NRCS 590 nutrient management standard, P-Index) that inadequately address the hydrologic processes driving NPS pollution. One barrier to adopting practices that address NPS pollution is a lack of tools capable of transferring information at sufficient spatial and temporal resolution so that end-users can make informed decisions. We introduce a web-based system displaying distributed hydrologic forecasts using free and open source software. The system consists of three primary components: (1) a hydrology model that provides short-term distributed forecasts; (2) a data structure capable of re-structuring large, high resolution rasters; (3) an interface employing adaptive map-viewing technology that allows end-users to interact with the data to avoid high-risk areas when planning agricultural practices.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							604	10.3390/w9080604								WOS:000408729200050

Many lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLYB) have followed this pattern. For effective lake management, it is essential to understand the pattern and drivers of SRs in these lakes. Fourteen typical lakes in the MLYB were chosen to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of SRs and identify the drivers over different time periods. Since 1900, SRs increased from <0.2 to 0.3-0.6 g.cm(-2).year(-1), particularly notable during 1930-1990. Combined with climatic factors, SR correlated negatively with lake (catchment) size and abundance of aquatic vegetation, whereas other lake features including nutrient status did not contribute significantly to the variation in SRs, due to the fast decomposition processes of organic matter in shallow lakes. Detrimental land use practices especially reclamation for croplands and rapid urbanization was revealed to elevate SRs pronouncedly. We propose various management strategies aiming to maintain SR reference condition at -0.16 +/- 0.08 g.cm(-2).year(-1), which is analogous to the SR value between 1850 and 1900.

J	Yang, YH; Liu, Y; Cao, SL; Cheng, YF				Yang, Yuheng; Liu, Yang; Cao, Shengle; Cheng, Yufei			A Method of Evaluating Water Resource Assets and Liabilities: A Case Study of Jinan City, Shandong Province	WATER												The traditional concepts of water resource development and utilization have caused serious hydrological and environmental issues in some regions. In addition, policy issues in China have led to a severe water crisis. The quantitative accounting of water resources is a theoretical approach to solving these problems. In this paper, 13 indicators were selected from four classes, including resources, the environment, society, and efficiency, and a case study of Jinan, Shandong Province, was performed using a set pair analysis model to calculate the water resource assets from 2011-2015. In previous methods of water resource accounting, the water quality was not considered; therefore, the loss coefficient of water resource assets was proposed to improve the reliability of accounting. According to the relationships among the unit price of water, water quantity, and water quality, physical and quantitative accounting methods were used to create water balance sheets from 2011-2015. The calculation results showed that the physical change in water resource assets in Jinan City was 30 million m(3), and water resource assets initially increased and then decreased. In 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, water resource assets totalled 36.5 million USD, 45.9 million USD, 66.7 million USD, 35.5 million USD, and 37.5 million USD, respectively (at 6.4588, 6.3125, 6.1932, 6.2166, 6.2284 USRMB, respectively). This initial accounting provides quantitative and physical support for the improved management of water resources.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							575	10.3390/w9080575								WOS:000408729200022

The groundwater samples in this study area were dominated of HCO3-Ca, HCO3-Ca-Mg, and HCO3-SO4-Ca types. The PCA suggested that four principal components could explain 88.85% of the total variance of 10 parameters, indicating that the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater was mainly controlled by the dissolution/precipitation of carbonates, gypsum, and halite minerals, cation exchange, and anthropogenic activities. To be specific, the enrichment of Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3- and SO42- in groundwater were primarily affected by the dissolution of dolomite and gypsum minerals, and the role of calcite dissolution was relatively weaker because most groundwater samples were saturated with respect to calcite. Besides, cation exchange was another factor that may affect the concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in groundwater, and the concentration of SO42- can also be influenced by coal mining activity. In addition, the concentrations of Na+ and Cl- in groundwater were likely influenced by the dissolution of halite, cation exchange, and human activities.																	2073-4441					AUG	2017	9	8							625	10.3390/w9080625								WOS:000408729200069						
J	Prevoteau, A; Rabaey, K				Prevoteau, Antonin; Rabaey, Korneel			Electroactive Biofilms for Sensing: Reflections and Perspectives	ACS SENSORS												Microbial electrochemistry has from the onset been recognized for its sensing potential due to the microbial ability to enhance signals through metabolic cascades, its relative selectivity toward substrates, and the higher stability conferred by the microbial ability to self-replicate. The greatest challenge has been to achieve stable and efficient transduction between a microorganism and an electrode surface; Over the past decades, a new kind of microbial architecture has been observed to spontaneously develop on polarized electrodes: the electroactive biofilm (EAB). The EAB conducts electrons over long distances and performs quasi-reversible electron transfer on conventional electrode surfaces. It also possesses self-regenerative properties. In only a few years, EABs have inspired considerable research interest for use as biosensors for environmental or bioprocess monitoring. Multiple challenges still need to be overcome before implementation at larger scale of this new kind of biosensors can be realized. This perspective first introduces the specific characteristics of the EAB with respect to other electrochemical biosensors. It summarizes the sensing applications currently proposed for EABs, stresses their limitations, and suggests strategies toward potential solutions. Conceptual prospects to engineer EABs for sensing purposes are also discussed.																	2379-3694					AUG	2017	2	8					1072	1085		10.1021/acssensors.7b00418								WOS:000408702500002	28745865

The photocatalytic membrane combines photocatalysis and membrane filtration in a single step. The impact of each individual constituent such as acidity, alkalinity, dissolved organic matter (DOM), divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+), and Cl- on the degradation of CBZ was examined. CBZ in water was efficiently degraded by an N-doped TiO2-coated Al2O3 membrane. However, elements added to the water, which simulate the constituents of natural water, had an impact on the CBZ degradation. Water alkalinity inhibited CBZ degradation mostly due to increase in pH while radical scavenging by carbonate was more dominant at higher values (>200 mg/L as CaCO3). A negative effect of Ca2+ addition on photocatalytic degradation was found only in combination with phosphate buffer, probably caused by deposition of CaHPO4 or CaHPO4 center dot 2H(2)O on the catalyst surface. The presence of Cl- and Mg2+ ions had no effect on CBZ degradation. DOM significantly inhibited CBZ degradation for all tested background organic compounds. The photocatalytic activity of N-doped TiO2-coated Al2O3 membranes gradually decreased after continuous use; however, it was successfully regenerated by 0.1% HCl chemical cleaning. Nevertheless, dissolution of metals like Al and Ti should be monitored following acid cleaning.

J	Tsuji, Y; Montani, S				Tsuji, Yasuyo; Montani, Shigeru			Spatial variability in an estuarine phytoplankton and suspended microphytobenthos community	PLANKTON & BENTHOS RESEARCH												Estuarine material circulation depends on the presence of both phytoplankton and suspended microphytobenthos in the water column. However, the spatial distribution of suspended microphytobenthos and phytoplankton in estuaries is poorly understood. In this study, the abundance of suspended microphytobenthos and phytoplankton in the water column was determined along the salinity gradient in Lake Furen, Japan, from April to October 2015. Throughout the study period, surface and bottom salinity changed horizontally from <10 to >30. Phytoplankton was the main contributor to spatial increases in total cell abundance in mesohaline water as a result of the lake's hydro graphic characteristics and water quality. The suspended microphytobenthos cell abundance in the surface and bottom water decreased with increasing salinity and was affected by the depth gradient. Suspended microphytobenthos cell abundances increased with depth (similar to 10 and 20% of total cell abundance in the surface and bottom water, respectively), which indicated that they were derived from microphytobenthos on the seafloor. The dominant suspended microphytobenthos taxa (Cocconeis spp. and Melosira varians) were mainly distributed in oligo-and mesohaline water, with peaks in mesohaline bottom water. In contrast, the dominant phytoplankton taxa (Skeletonema spp., Heterocapsa triquetra, and Prorocentrum spp.) were abundant at different salinity levels. The spatial distribution of dominant benthic and planktonic species in the water column was influenced by their tolerance to salinity. Our results suggest that suspended microphytobenthos contribute to microalgal communities in estuaries, especially those in bottom waters. Quantification of phytoplankton and suspended microphytobenthos will allow a better understanding of the effects of their spatial distribution on estuarine material circulation.																	1880-8247					AUG	2017	12	3					190	200		10.3800/pbr.12.190								WOS:000409395600006

This prototype is based on only four metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors suitable for IoT technology. The system architecture consists of four stages: data acquisition, data storage, data processing, and user interfacing. The designed eNose was tested with experiment for detection of volatile components in water pollution, as a dimethyl disulphide or dimethyl diselenide or sulphur.

In this paper, the design and development of an IoT platform with multiple Mobile Sensor Nodes (MSN) for the spatiotemporal quality evaluation of surface water is presented. A survey planner is proposed to distribute the Sampling Locations of Interest (SLoIs) over the study area and generate paths for MSNs to visit the SLoIs, given the limited energy and time budgets. The SLoIs are chosen based on a cellular decomposition that is composed of uniform hexagonal cells. They are visited by the MSNs along a path ring generated by a planning approach that uses a spanning tree. For quality evaluation, an Online Water Quality Index (OLWQI) is developed to interpret the large quantities of online measurements. The index formulations are modified by a state-of-the-art index, the CCME WQI, which has been developed by the Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment (CCME) for off-line indexing. The proposed index has demonstrated effective and reliable performance in online indexing a large volume of measurements of water quality parameters. The IoT platform is deployed in the field, and its performance is demonstrated and discussed in this paper.																	1424-8220					AUG	2017	17	8							1735	10.3390/s17081735								WOS:000408576900038

In this research, seven algorithms are assessed with different band combinations of multispectral and hyperspectral bands using linear (LN), quadratic polynomial (QP) and power (PW) regression approaches, resulting in altogether 43 algorithmic combinations. These algorithms are evaluated by using simulated and measured datasets to understand the strengths and limitations of these algorithms. Two simulated datasets comprising 500,000 reflectance spectra each, both based on wide ranges of inherent optical properties (IOPs), are generated for the calibration and validation stages. Results reveal that the regression approach (i.e., LN, QP, and PW) has more influence on the simulated dataset than on the measured one. The algorithms that incorporated linear regression provide the highest retrieval accuracy for the simulated dataset. Results from simulated datasets reveal that the 3-band (3b) algorithm that incorporate 665-nm and 680-nm bands and band tuning selection approach outperformed other algorithms with root mean square error (RMSE) of 15.87 mg.m(-3), 16.25 mg.m(-3), and 19.05 mg.m(-3), respectively. The spatial distribution of the best performing algorithms, for various combinations of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and non-algal particles (NAP) concentrations, show that the 3b_tuning_QP and 3b_680_QP outperform other algorithms in terms of minimum RMSE frequency of 33.19% and 60.52%, respectively. However, the two algorithms failed to accurately retrieve Chla for many combinations of Chla and NAP, particularly for low Chla and NAP concentrations. In addition, the spatial distribution emphasizes that no single algorithm can provide outstanding accuracy for Chla retrieval and that multi-algorithms should be included to reduce the error. Comparing the results of the measured and simulated datasets reveal that the algorithms that incorporate the 665-nm band outperform other algorithms for measured dataset (RMSE = 36.84 mg.m(-3)), while algorithms that incorporate the band tuning approach provide the highest retrieval accuracy for the simulated dataset (RMSE = 25.05 mg.m(-3)).

The detailed hydrogeochemical study indicates that mine discharges are mostly highly acidic (pH 3.4-6.1) with very high concentration of Cu (9.2-60.8 mg/L). Water releases from the tailing pond is also acidic in nature (pH 2.39-2.48) and contains high concentration of Cu (15.6-65.2 mg/L). The water quality of the mine discharges and tailing is mainly affected by the oxidation of chalcopyrite, which presents abundantly in the host rock along with minor amount of pyrite. The blue coloured secondary mineral that precipitates along the course of the mine effluents is dominated by amorphous copper hydroxysulfate. Alpersite, gypsum, epsomite and hexahydrite occur as efflorescent salts during the summer time, and store very high concentration of metals. Alpersite contains Zn (285-391 mg/kg), Ni (62-78 mg/kg) and Cu (7.8-10.9%) whereas epsomite contains Zn (132-160 mg/kg), Ni (35-43 mg/kg) and Cu (3465-4184 mg/kg). Among the trace elements in tailing, Cu has the highest concentration ranges (98.2-4492 mg/kg) followed by Mn (131.4-760 mg/kg), Zn (54.3-241 mg/kg), Ni (25.7-170.3 mg/kg), Pb (12.5-46.4 mg/kg) and Cd (0.72-1.48 mg/kg). Tailing rich with efflorescent salt has maximum concentration of metals as well as maximum potential for releasing metals into the aqueous system.				Sahoo, Prafulla/N-5100-2018; Equeenuddin, Sk.

A major component in 13 spring water samples was analyzed using various techniques. The waters of the thermal springs at Guelma basin vary in temperature between 20 and 94 degrees C. Q-mode hierarchical cluster analysis suggests three groups. The water springs were classified as low, moderate and high salinity. Mineral saturation indices (SI) calculated from major ions indicate the spring waters are supersaturated with the most of the carbonate minerals, and all of the spring water samples are under-saturated with evaporite minerals. The thermal spring waters have a meteoric origin, and all samples are immature with strong mixing between warm and shallow waters, where the temperatures of reservoirs to which the thermal waters are related ranged between 64 degrees and 124 degrees C. The deep circulation of meteoric waters in the study area is supplied by the high geothermal gradient around 4.5 degrees C per 100 m and reaches a high temperature before rising to the surface. The estimated circulation depths ranged from 1425 and 3542 m.

The agricultural activity supports the social and economic pressure. Considering prolonged drought conditions and surface water insufficiency, increasing supplies rely on deep aquifers in spite of the critical status of the water quality used. Intense agriculture development has placed oases durability and crop quality to high risks of soil fertility loss, land degradation, and water availability issues, due to severe climate conditions, overexploitation of groundwater resources, intense desertification, overuse of soil, and poor land management. The recent contamination of the largest aquifer in southern Tunisia (Continental Intercalaire) by petroleum flows adds another dimension to the problem of water crisis and soil salinization in the region of interest. In this study, 41 water samples from CI wells were correspondingly collected for hydrochemical analyses. Major and minor element concentrations were evaluated by different standard methods. The obtained dataset indicates that the western side possesses low salinity hazard, whereas Nefzaoua and El Fedjej areas reveal highly mineralized water unsuitable for irrigation purposes. A number of assessment ratios (KR, TH, SAR, ESP, PS, etc.) and graphical methods (Riverside and Wilcox) confirm this classification. The combination of geochemical indicators with geographic information system permits the assessment of water quality on the basis of two different indexes. The resulted maps show, in turn, scattered classification between the western field with acceptable water quality and El Fedjej-Nefzaoua areas where the CI water is unsuitable for agricultural activities. Besides water chemistry evaluation, the assessment of soil composition, particularly toxic element concentrations, constitutes reliable criteria for monitoring the effectiveness of agricultural practices and the suitability of irrigation water. Hence, the concentrations of four heavy metals have been monitored along three soil profiles ranging from the surface to 80 cm of depth. The results are within permissible limits. The vertical distribution of Ni, Pb, Cu, and Zn is related mainly to physiochemical soil parameters, difference in moisture, and fine fraction distribution.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	16							350	10.1007/s12517-017-3148-0								WOS:000408570300002

The Quaternary aquifer represents the main groundwater source in the study area. It exists under unconfined to semiconfined conditions at depths varying between 4 m due North and 80 m in the South. The chemical analyses of the groundwater samples indicate that 77% of the total samples are fresh and 20% are brackish, while only 3% are saline. In addition, the iso-salinity contour map indicates that the salinity increases towards the central and northern parts of the study area. The total and permanent hardness increase as water salinity increases and vice versa in case of temporary hardness in the groundwater samples. The chemical water types and the ion ratios indicate meteoric origin of groundwater as well as the dissolution of terrestrial and marine salts. The contribution of recent recharge from the River Nile to a few groundwater wells in the study area varies from low to high. In addition, the most recharge sources are from the precipitation. Nitrate concentrations in groundwater increase towards the central and Northern areas significantly elevated in response to increasing anthropogenic land uses. Much of the solutes and physicochemical parameters in these waters are under the undesirable limits of World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking purpose, and a plot of sodium adsorption ratio versus EC shows that about 23% of the groundwater samples are good water quality, about 45% of groundwater samples are moderate quality, and 23% of the groundwater samples are intermediate water class, while the rest of samples (9%) are out of the range.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	16							372	10.1007/s12517-017-3151-5								WOS:000408570300024						
J	Magnusson, RS				Magnusson, Roger S.			Framework legislation for non-communicable diseases: and for the Sustainable Development Goals?	BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH												'Framework legislation' refers to legislation that sets out structures for governance and accountability or other processes for guiding the decisions and actions taken by government or the executive. Framework legislation for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) provides the opportunity for countries to focus their political commitment, to set national targets, and a time-frame for achieving them, and to create cross-sectoral governance structures for the development and implementation of innovative policies. Although they extend well beyond NCDs, the health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) create similar demands for effective national governance. A similar case might, therefore, be made for framework legislation for the health-related SDGs or for legislation to govern particular aspects, such as managing commercial relationships with the private sector or managing conflicts of interest. This article considers the possible benefits of framework legislation, including what issues might be appropriate for inclusion in a framework law. The absence of framework legislation should neither be seen as an excuse for inaction, nor is framework legislation a substitute for detailed regulation of areas such as sanitation and water quality, tobacco and alcohol control, food safety, essential medicines or poisons. The ultimate test for framework legislation will be its capacity to provide a catalyst for action and to accelerate progress towards national and global health goals.																	2059-7908					AUG	2017	2	3							UNSP e000385	10.1136/bmjgh-2017-000385								WOS:000408749700003	29082017

Srinivasa			Correlation between corrosion indices and corrosiveness of groundwater: a study with reference to selected areas of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The aim of the present study was to determine the aggressiveness of groundwater samples towards corrosion of various commercially important metals and to study the correlation between theoretical and experimental values of corrosiveness. For this purpose, 20 groundwater samples were collected in different mandals of Krishna District, Andhra Pradesh, India, and the metals selected were carbon steel, aluminium, copper and cupronickel alloy. The corrosiveness was determined by using gravimetric measurements. Further, corrosion and scaling indices, namely Langelier index (LI), aggressive index (AI), Ryznar index (RI), Puckorius index (PI) and Larson-Skold index (LS), were calculated with the help of various water quality parameters of all the samples to estimate their corrosivity. The experimental values of corrosion rates were attempted to correlate with various indices calculated and quality parameters determined in case of all the samples. It is observed that there is a significant lack of correlation between the indices and corrosion rates. Among the five indices taken into account, LI, AI and RI indicate scaling tendency of water samples, as inferred by their mean values, 0.657, 12.576 and 6.612, respectively, while the other two indices, PI and LS with the mean values of 8.141 and 1.188, respectively, suggest the corrosive behaviour. Further, the mean values of correlation coefficients, 0.18 and 0.27 for PI and LS, respectively, are higher compared with those for LI, AI and RI. The mean values of correlation coefficients of dissolved oxygen, chlorides and electrolytic conductivity are 0.33, 0.25 and 0.25, respectively, which are relatively higher compared with those of other quality parameters. The probable reasons for low correlation coefficients are explored based on the statistical data. Also, it was concluded that one of the significant factors, namely dissolved oxygen which has strong influence on corrosion of metals, was considered in none of the indices, leading to very low correlation between the theoretical and experimental values of corrosiveness.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	16							568	10.1007/s12665-017-6908-y								WOS:000408499100022

Paired-sample t tests reveal that the PTE concentrations of the pre-monsoon samples are higher than those of the post-monsoon samples. At a few locations, the concentration of Fe (56%), As (56%), Al (26%), Mn (19%) in pre-monsoon and Mn (46%), Ni (15%), Ba (15%), Pb (8%) in post-monsoon seasons exceeds the acceptable limit of Indian drinking standards. However, HPI values are below the critical pollution index value of 100 in both seasons in spite of an excess of these elements. The pollution indices evaluated by the multiple of the mean values approach reveal that 100, 94, 87% of the pre-monsoon and 92, 92, 85% of the post-monsoon samples belong to the "low-to-medium'' category with respect to the HPI, HEI and Cd indices. The thematic map depicting the spatial distribution of the contamination index (Cd) testifies the role of a `` dilution effect'' that results in lower pollution loads in the post-monsoon samples than the pre-monsoon ones. The results of cluster analysis confirm that the quality of the water is mainly controlled by geogenic processes and anthropogenic inputs, besides dilution effects.

Major ions and water isotopes were measured. Results show that hydrological processes and hydrogeochemical evolution of shallow groundwater were greatly disturbed by human activities. Excessive pumping resulted in significant declines of groundwater levels over the study area. This also induced infiltration of surface water into groundwater. A groundwater depression cone was the conflux center of groundwater surrounded by recharge zones including alluvial fans and surface water in alluvial plain. Pumping almost was the only way to discharge groundwater. Emission of SOx and NOx contributed at least 11% of rock weathering by dissolving into infiltrating precipitation. Surface waters containing sewage replenished ambient groundwater with an average mixing ratio of 74 +/- 17% due to groundwater level drawdown. As a result, groundwater had elevated concentrations of Na+ and SO42- with Na+ exchanged into aquifer sediments. About 29 +/- 16% of Na+ was exchanged from groundwater into soil matrix. Agriculture nitrate was high only in the recharge zones. The most important result is that the transformation of the study area from a place rich in water resource into an area lack of water just took several decades with the joint action of the heavily human activities. Our study also indicates that shallow groundwater could sensitively respond to and record environmental changes.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	16							571	10.1007/s12665-017-6918-9								WOS:000408499100025

Exploring socio-ecological inequalities in Lilongwe's water supply network	GEOFORUM												Urban political ecology attempts to unravel and politicize the socio-ecological processes that produce uneven waterscapes. At the core of this analysis are the choreographies of power that influence how much water flows through urban infrastructure as well as where it flows, thereby shaping conditions and quality of access in cities. If these analyses have been prolific in demonstrating uneven distribution of infrastructures and water quantity, the political ecology of water quality remains largely overlooked. In this paper, we argue that there is a clear theoretical and practical need to address questions of quality in relation to water access in the South. We show that conceptual resources for considering differentiated drinking water quality are already present within urban political ecology. We then contend that an interdisciplinary approach, 'highlighting the interdependencies between politics, power, and physiochemical and microbiological contamination of drinking water, can further our understandings of both uneven distribution of water contamination and the conceptualisation of inequalities in the urban waterscape. We illustrate our argument through the case of water supply in Lilongwe, Malawi. Our political ecology analysis starts from an examination of the physicochemical and microbiological quality of water supplied by the formal water utility across urban spaces in Lilongwe. We then, present the topography of water (quality) inequalities in Lilongwe and identify the political processes underlying the production of differentiated water quality within the centralised network. This paper thereby serves as a deepening of urban political ecology as well as a demonstration of how this approach might be taken forward in the analysis of urbanism and water supplies.				van der Zaag, Pieter/B-8247-2008	van der Zaag, Pieter/0000-0002-1215-2656; Rusca, Maria/0000-0003-4513-3213; Ferrero, Giuliana/0000-0002-2375-0395; Loftus, Alex/0000-0002-8136-1224												0016-7185	1872-9398				AUG	2017	84						138	146		10.1016/j.geoforum.2017.06.013								WOS:000408287000015

First report on the successful hybridization of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) and Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822)	ZYGOTE												Breeding and larval performance of novel hybrids from reciprocal crosses of Asian catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) and African catfish Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) were investigated in this study. Spawning was by hormonal injection of brood fish, artificial fertilization, and incubation in triplicate aquarium tanks (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 m(3)) with continuous aeration. Reciprocal crosses (female C. gariepinus x male P. hypophthalmus and male P. hypophthalmus x male C. gariepinus) had lower hatchability (<= 50%) than their pure siblings (>= 75%). Fish from all crosses survived until the juvenile stage but survival at 35 days post hatching (dph) was higher for pure C. gariepinus sib. female C. gariepinus x male P. hypophthalmus was observed to be less resistant to degradation of water quality than the other crosses, however it had higher body weight compared with the other crosses that showed similar performance. Morphological comparison of surviving juvenile at 35 dph, showed that all female P. hypophthalmus x male C. gariepinus and 13% of the female C. gariepinus x male P. hypophthalmus exhibited the very same morphology as that of their maternal parent species, while the other portion of the female C. gariepinus x male P. hypophthalmus cross exhibited morphological traits that were intermediate between those of both parent species. This study been the first successful attempt to hybridize both species and therefore, laid the groundwork for further studies on the aquaculture potentials of the novel hybrids.

Groundwater appraisal of Dhekiajuli, Assam, India: an insight of agricultural suitability and arsenic enrichment	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present work is an effort to develop an appraisal of the hydrogeochemical regime for the aquifers of Dhekiajuli, Sonitpur district, Assam, which is imperative considering: (i) excessive use of groundwater for irrigation; (ii) reported high arsenic (As) contamination; (iii) application of fertilizer is an inevitable process undergoing in this region to achieve higher yield owing to deteriorating water quality; and (iv) study area being the location of many tea estates of Assam, that export tea in many foreign countries. The highest As concentration of 44.39 mu g/L was detected in this study (Bachasimalu and Sitalmari region), implying high As-contaminated aquifers being used for drinking and irrigation purposes in the area. The relative abundance pattern of major cations and anions was in the order of Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ > K+ and HCO3- > Cl- > SO42-, respectively. Majority of the samples belong to Na+-K+-Cl--HCO3- and mixed water type. Closer inspection of Piper plot reveals that a higher As value ( > 40 mu g/L) was prevalent in HCO3- water type. Results of hydrogeochemical plots suggest silicate and carbonate weathering, ion exchange and anthropogenic activities to be the dominant processes governing groundwater contamination, including As which is further supported from PCA loadings. The Singri area to the east of the affected areas and adjacent to the Brahmaputra River has oxic aquifers owing to the absence of mass deposition of younger sediments, while reducing conditions prevails in the Bachasimalu and Sitalmari region. High positive correlation between As and Fe (r = 0.83**) and a negative correlation between ORP and Fe (r = -0.68**) further add that Fe (hydr)oxides are the direct source of As release in the affected region, the mechanism being reductive hydrolysis of such (hydr) oxides. The study implies that although groundwater is suitable for irrigation use, there is a high probability of As getting into the food chain through tea and other edible plants irrigated with As-contaminated water; thus, the area has a maximum probability of facing health hazards caused by As-contaminated groundwater.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							530	10.1007/s12665-017-6841-0								WOS:000407545200023

The model was calibrated and validated for hydrology, sediment and water quality for the period 2003-2012. The model was run under two climate changes, two land use changes and four combined change scenarios for near-future period (2020-2049). The results revealed that projected climate change impacts include an increase in streamflow (maximum increases of 52% under RCP 2.6 in December and 170% under RCP 8.5). Projected sediment concentrations under climate change scenarios showed a monthly average decrease of 10%. For land use change scenarios, agricultural development scenario indicated an opposite direction of changes in orthophosphate (increases in all months with an average increase of 6% under agricultural development scenario), leading to the conclusion that land use change is the dominant factor in nutrient concentration changes. Combined impacts results indicated that streamflows in late fall and winter months increased while in summer and early fall decreased. Suspended sediment and orthophosphate concentrations were decreased in all months except for increases in suspended sediment concentrations in September and October and orthophosphate concentrations in late winter and early spring due to the impact of land use change scenarios.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							543	10.1007/s12665-017-6880-6								WOS:000407545200036

As part of the waterway for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project of China, the water quality and trophic status of Lake Dongping are crucial for the successful operation of this project. In order to better understand the controlling factors of water quality and trophic status of Lake Dongping and to provide data for studying ecological baseline of lake restoration, the distribution and the controlling factors of subfossil chironomids were studied here. Our results show that a total of 41 taxa of subfossil chironomids are present in Lake Dongping. The dominant taxa consist of Stempellinella-Zavrelia (30.88%), Propsilocerus akamusi-type (26.79%), Paratanytarsus (13.15%), Cricotopus sylvestris-type (9.12%), and Hydrobaenus conformis-type (6.67%). Among them, the nutrient-tolerant taxa of Stempellinella-Zavrelia and eutrophic taxa of Propsilocerus akamusi-type are widely present in the lake, indicating that Lake Dongping is in a transition from mesotrophication to eutrophication. Redundancy analysis reveals that total phosphorus, water depth, and sulfate (SO42-) concentrations are dominant factors controlling the spatial distribution of subfossil chironomids, which explain 12, 9, and 8.5% of the variance, respectively. Therefore, in order to secure the water quality for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, it is crucial to regulate the input of nutrient and sulfate to Lake Dongping.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				AUG	2017	76	15							524	10.1007/s12665-017-6858-4								WOS:000407545200017

Here, we present a regional assessment of human marker prevalence among drainages that discharge to the U.S. southern California coast. Approximately 50 samples were analyzed for the HF183 human marker from each of 22 southern California coastal drainages under summer dry weather conditions, and another 50 samples were targeted from each of 23 drainages during wet weather. The HF183 marker was ubiquitous, detected in all but two sites in dry weather and at all sites during wet weather. However, there was considerable difference in the extent of human fecal contamination among sites. Similar site ranking was produced regardless of whether the assessment was based on frequency of HF183 detection or site average HF183 concentration. However, site ranking differed greatly between dry and wet weather. Site ranking also differed greatly when based on enterococci, which do not distinguish between pollution sources, vs. HF183, which distinguishes higher risk human fecal sources from other sources, indicating the additional value of the human-associated marker as a routine monitoring tool.																	1660-4601					AUG	2017	14	8							874	10.3390/ijerph14080874								WOS:000408684300044

The total PAH concentrations were 554.3 to 723.2 ng/L in the influent and 189.6 to 262.7 ng/L in the effluent. The removal efficiencies of Sigma PAHs in the dissolved phase ranged from 63 to 69%, with the highest observed in naphthalene (80% removal). Concentration and distribution of PAHs revealed that the higher molecular weight PAHs became more concentrated with treatment in both the dissolved phase and the dewatered sludge. The sharpest reduction was observed during the pretreatment and the biological phase. Noncarcinogenic risk, carcinogenic risk, and total health risk of PAHs found in the effluent and sewage sludge were also assessed. The effluent BaP toxic equivalent quantities (TEQ(BaP)) were above, or far above, standards in countries. The potential toxicities of PAHs in sewage effluent were approximately 10 to 15 times higher than the acceptable risk level in China. The health risk associated with the sewage sludge also exceeded international recommended levels and was mainly contributed from seven carcinogenic PAHs. Given that WWTP effluent is a major PAH contributor to surface water bodies in China and better reduction efficiencies are achievable, the present study highlights the possibility of utilizing WWTPs for restoring water quality in riverine and coastal regions heavily impacted by PAHs contamination.

Within the protected area of the red line area, the Qilihai wetland is an important ecotope with complex ecological functions, although the ecosystem is seriously disturbed due to anthropogenic activities in the surrounding areas. This study assesses the water quality status of the Qilihai wetlands to identify the pollution sources and potential improvements based on the ecological red line policy, to improve and protect the waters of the Qilihai wetlands. An indicator system was established to assess water quality status using single factor evaluation and a comprehensive evaluation method, supported by data from 2010 to 2013. Assessment results show that not all indicators met the requirement of the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002) and that overall, waters in the Qilihai wetland were seriously polluted.

Multicriteria Analysis to Select an Optimal Operating Option for a Water Grid	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Water supply systems are diversifying and expanding in response to climate pressures and population growth. However, these water grids present challenges for the water supply manager in identifying optimal operating options for the short term. This study demonstrates the final step in a framework to address these challenges, multicriteria analysis, using a case study based on the South East Queensland water grid. A shortlist of nine water grid operating options have been identified, which are optimal in terms of minimizing total operational cost, maximizing water security, and minimizing spills from reservoirs, over a 5-year period. This study assesses the performance of each of these nine operating options against a wider set of 18 criteria reflecting cost, supply reliability, environmental flow, water quality, reservoir spill, and water security concerns. The weighted summation multicriteria analysis technique is used to combine and rank performance of the nine operating options against the 18 criteria. An operating option is selected that performs best on average across the 18 criteria and four scenarios of preference weights. This operating option comprises a set of operating rules that can form the basis of a short-term optimal annual operating plan.

Water-economy models (WEMs), which integrate the complex interrelationships between hydrologic and economic systems, are effective tools for analyzing these issues and for providing appropriate solutions across varied spatial and temporal scales. These models can be powerful tools for examining potential future changes in water resources systems, including the effects of climate change, socioeconomic changes, and infrastructural and policy responses to water resource management challenges. In this paper, the WEM models used to answer water economy questions are classified into two general categories on the basis of their structure: network-based (simulation or optimization) hydroeconomic models, and economywide (input-output or computable general equilibrium) models. This paper highlights the primary differences in the applications and interpretations obtained using these approaches, analyzes the distribution of questions that different WEMs have been used to answer, and discusses previous work and efforts to integrate across model types. Findings suggest that additional efforts are needed to more realistically account for the range and complexity of linking water systems and society, particularly regarding ecology and water quality, and the food and energy sectors. Additionally, the broader economic impacts of water-related processes, for example those related to interregional trade dynamics, the distribution of income, and migration, should be investigated further. In effect, because of the inherent complexity in the economic dynamics underlying many water systems, such tools can challenge intuition and provide critical insights that are relevant to more effective management of transboundary water resources and related sectors.

J	Housh, M; Ohar, Z				Housh, Mashor; Ohar, Ziv			Multiobjective Calibration of Event-Detection Systems	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												CANARY, developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), is a freeware designed for contamination events detection in water distribution systems. CANARY has several imbedded statistical methods for analyzing water quality data to detect contamination events. The imbedded methods require calibration of their parameters to achieve good performance. However, the multiobjective nature of the problem creates a conflict between high sensitivity which results in good detection but with many false alerts, and low sensitivity which results in a small number of false alarms but with poor detection. In this work, a MOGA-CANARY add-in for CANARY autocalibration is introduced. This tool could be used by CANARY users to find the optimal parameter configuration that fits their system. MOGA-CANARY gives the users the whole set of Pareto optimal system configurations based on their defined objectives. The results of MOGA-CANARY are compared with existing manual calibration methods proposed in CANARY documentation.

Grouping Water-Demand Nodes by Similarity among Flow Paths in Water-Distribution Systems	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												The identification of monitoring or sensor locations, or demand estimation, within drinking water distribution systems can be challenging given the size of realistic network models. Approaches such as skeletonization or aggregation can effectively reduce a network model and are generally appropriate for satisfying hydraulic objectives. However, a reduced hydraulic network model might not be appropriate for water quality objectives because of altered transport characteristics. This study proposes a clustering approach that groups nodes with similar water quality characteristics within the context of maintaining the original network structure. The proposed approach uses an input-output relationship to assess the hydraulic path between any two nodes. Using the hydraulic path information, a k-means clustering algorithm identified nodes with similar hydraulic paths. For two different case studies, as the number of clusters increased, the nodes within each cluster were shown to become more similar. The differences in water quality characteristics between the individual clusters also increased, demonstrating the ability to generate more distinct clusters of nodes. By identifying nodes with similar water quality characteristics, the resulting clusters can provide future opportunities, for example, to reduce the problem size for monitoring or sensor selection by assuming the nodes within a given cluster behave similarly.

This paper describes the effects of water siltation on the underwater light environment of rivers under different levels of gold mining activities in the Tapajos River Basin. Furthermore, it investigates possible impacts on the phytoplankton community. Two field campaigns were conducted in the Tapajos River Basin, during high water level and during low water level seasons, to measure Inherent and Apparent Optical Properties (IOPs, AOPs), including scattering (b) and absorption (a) coefficients and biogeochemical data (sediment content, pigments, and phytoplankton quantification). The biogeochemical data was separated into five classes according to the concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) ranging from 1.8 mg.L-1 to 113.6 mg.L-1. The in-water light environment varied among those classes due to a wide range of concentrations of inorganic TSS originated from different levels of mining activities. For tributaries with low or no influence of mining tailings (TSS up to 6.8 mg.L-1), waters are relatively more absorbent with b: a ratio of 0.8 at 440 nm and b660 magnitude of 2.1 m(-1). With increased TSS loadings from mining operations (TSS over 100 mg.L-1), the scattering process prevails over absorption (b: a ratio of 10.0 at 440 nm), and b(660) increases to 20.8 m(-1). Non-impacted tributaries presented a critical depth for phytoplankton productivity of up to 6.0 m with available light evenly distributed throughout the spectra. Whereas for greatly impacted waters, attenuation of light was faster, reducing the critical depth to about 1.7 m, with most of the available light comprising of red wavelengths. Overall, a dominance of diatoms was observed for the upstream rivers, whereas cyanobacteria prevailed in the low section of the Tapajos River. The results suggest that the spatial and temporal distribution of phytoplankton in the Tapajos River Basin is not only a function of light availability, but rather depends on the interplay of factors, including flood pulse, water velocity, nutrient availability, and seasonal variation of incoming irradiance. Ongoing research indicates that the effects of mining tailings on the aquatic environment, described here, are occurring in several rivers within the Amazon River Basin.

Overall, the SI presents a variety of applications at the global scale (with case studies in Europe, Asia, South and North America, and the Antarctic), achieved with different remote sensing instruments, such as hyperspectral field and airborne sensors, ocean colour radiometry, geostationary platforms, and the multispectral Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites. The bibliometric analysis, carried out to include research articles published from 1900 to 2016, indicates that "chlorophyll-a", "ocean colour", "phytoplankton", "SeaWiFS" (Sea-Viewing-Wide Field-of-View Sensor), and "chromophoric dissolved organic matter" were the five most frequently used keywords in the field. The SI contents, along with the bibliometric analysis, clearly suggest that remote sensing of Chl-a is one of the topmost investigated subjects in the field.

J	Somorowska, U; Laszewski, M				Somorowska, Urszula; Laszewski, Maksym			Human-influenced streamflow during extreme drought: identifying driving forces, modifiers, and impacts in an urbanized catchment in central Poland	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												This study investigates the response of the streamflow to an extremely hot and dry summer 2015 in the urbanized catchment of the Utrata River in central Poland. The objectives were to: reveal changes in the flow regime, assess anomalies in summer river flows, estimate the natural and wastewater effluent contribution and provide an ecological context for the in-stream conditions. The mean annual flow rate in the period 1996-2015 increased by 0.61 m(3)/s as compared to 1951-1970. The mean annual wastewater inflow rate to the river in 2015 was approximately 0.770 m(3)/s, constituting 39% of the observed flow. Almost the entire period of August this contribution approached 100%. The optimum river water temperature threshold for warm-water fish species was exceeded. Streamflow modifications are attributed to an increase of wastewater discharge, urban impact through an increase in imperviousness, and the variability of climatic driving forces.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				AUG	2017	31	3					345	352		10.1111/wej.12249								WOS:000408947500006

Timing of organic carbon release from mountain pine beetle impacted ponderosa pine forests in South Dakota	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												The decay of mountain pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae) affected ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests has increased organic carbon (OC) loading within the Rapid Creek watershed in the Black Hills of South Dakota, with total OC (TOC) concentrations up to 6.2 mgL(-1) observed in 2015. The impacts of large-scale tree mortality on water quality were delayed. OC concentrations in the watershed correlated with recent MPB impact stage progression. Regional ponderosa pine forests that were 3 and 6 years after MPB infection (grey and snagfall phases) exhibited increased OC loading within the Rapid Creek watershed. A better understanding of regional watershed response patterns for MPB tree mortality may assist with mitigating ancillary water quality impacts.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				AUG	2017	31	3					375	379		10.1111/wej.12253								WOS:000408947500010

This study investigated the responses of streamflow and NPS pollutant loads to climate change in the 3S River Basin, a trans-boundary basin of the Mekong River, using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Firstly, the SWAT model in simulations of streamflow and NPS pollutant loads was calibrated and validated against observed data to prove the reliability of the simulation results. Then, the calibrated SWAT model was used to simulate changes in streamflow and NPS pollutants under the impact of climate change. The simulation results indicated that the streamflow and NPS pollutant loads are predicted to increase in the future. Moreover, water shortage in the dry season and soil degradation in the wet season are emphasized to occur in the future.

J	Shoemaker, C; Kroger, R				Shoemaker, Cory; Kroger, Robert			Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches to Understanding Changes in Redox Potential Due to Hydrology and Vegetation in Agricultural Drainage Ditches	WETLANDS												Excess nutrient loading from agricultural landscapes contributes to downstream water quality degradation. To mitigate these issues, agricultural drainage ditches have recently gained attention as potential sites for nutrient reduction. We examined the effects of vegetation and hydrology on oxidation-reduction (redox) potential. Testing occurred in an agricultural drainage ditch fitted with weirs in the summer of 2012. Redox potential was recorded using continuous automated data loggers and analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian methods. Significant difference was found when analyzing redox potential response to vegetation (t = -1.75, P = 0.08, df = 9754) and hydrology treatments (t = 7.51, P < 0.001, df = 9754) in a frequentist manner. Vegetation and hydrologic treatments were significant when analyzed using Bayesian methods; however, the interactions of the two terms had the greatest posterior weights. This study suggests that the innovative use of vegetation and controlled drainage can affect Eh, in particular Eh heterogeneity within ditch systems. Results obtained by analyzing these data in both a frequentist and Bayesian methods were similar in terms significance and magnitude. However, Bayesian methods, and their ability to incorporate prior information into a management framework, may be better suited for systems where previous information can be incorporated into analyses.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2017	37	4					705	714		10.1007/s13157-017-0901-9								WOS:000408670000009

Mine drainage is a significant problem for riverine ecosystems, it is commonly acidic (AMD), but neutral mine drainage (NMD) can also occur. A representative environment for studying metal pollution from NMD is provided by carboniferous catchments characterised by a circumneutral pH and high concentrations of carbonates, supporting the formation of secondary metal-minerals as potential sinks of metals. The present study focuses on understanding the mobility of metal pollution associated with historical mining in a carboniferous upland catchment. In the uplands of the UK, river water, sediments and spoil wastes were collected over a period of fourteen months, samples were chemically analysed to identify the main metal sources and their relationships with geological and hydrological factors. Correlation tests and principal component analysis suggest that the underlying limestone bedrock controls pH and weathering reactions. Significant metal concentrations from mining activities were measured for zinc (4.3 mg l(-1)), and lead (0.3 mg l(-1)), attributed to processes such as oxidation of mined ores (e.g. sphalerite, galena) or dissolution of precipitated secondary metal-minerals (e.g. cerussite, smithsonite). Zinc and lead mobility indicated strong dependence on biogeochemistry and hydrological conditions (e.g. pH and flow) at specific locations in the catchment. Annual loads of zinc and lead (2.9 and 0.2 tonnes per year) demonstrate a significant source of both metals to downstream river reaches. Metal pollution results in a large area of catchment having a depleted chemical status with likely effects on the aquatic ecology. This study provides an improved understanding of geological and hydrological processes controlling water chemistry, which is critical to assessing metal sources and mobilization, especially in neutral mine drainage areas.

Twenty-four extensive green roofs representing all combinations of the following four design factors were used: native meadow species versus Sedum; mineral-based versus biologically derived planting medium; 10-cm versus 15-cm depth; and irrigation provided daily, sensor controlled, or not at all. From events covering the period May-October in 2013 and 2014, mean values were determined for the seasonal volumetric runoff coefficient (C-vol = 0.4), peak runoff coefficient (C-peak = 0.12), and U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) curve number (CN = 94). Irrigation had the largest overall impact: daily irrigation increased C-vol to 0.5 compared to 0.3 for systems with sensor-controlled or no irrigation. The biologically derived planting medium, composed of a high proportion of aged wood compost, made a significant improvement, maintaining C-vol of 0.3 compared to 0.4 for the mineral-based product in the modules without irrigation. A similar pattern was found in the NRCS curve numbers. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Mantel, SK; Rivers-Moore, N; Ramulifho, P				Mantel, Sukhmani Kaur; Rivers-Moore, Nick; Ramulifho, Pfananani			Small dams need consideration in riverscape conservation assessments	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Small, off-channel dams are generally ignored in impact assessments owing to limited information and spatial resolution issues. Previous research on South African rivers showed correlative links between high density of small dams and associated reductions in low flows, poorer water quality, and impoverished aquatic macroinvertebrate communities that were dominated by opportunistic taxa instead of specialist groups. 2 .Since small dams are usually associated with catchment transformation (for example, vineyards, stock farming and exotic timber plantations), they are convenient surrogates of the impacts of catchment transformation on river functionality. Here, an index of cumulative small dams for South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland is presented and evaluated. 3.Fifty-two per cent of the water management catchments in the study region exceeded the threshold for the cumulative small dams density (SDD) index above which river functionality is compromised. This estimate of potentially affected catchments is considered to be conservative for reasons discussed. 4.The index results are compared with a recent systematic biodiversity planning exercise for setting biodiversity targets for freshwater areas of South Africa. Although the systematic planning included in-stream small dams within 50m of a river, analysis showed that 36% of all quaternaries that have high SDD score overlap with river reaches classified as natural' or largely natural'. 5.Disregarding dams outside the 50m buffer area equates to ignoring the majority of small dams (94%) in South Africa, and it is recommended that aquatic conservation assessments include the SDD index as a cost layer for prioritizing rivers for rehabilitation and conservation.

The results show that 69.2 +/- 28.6% of ammonium and 23.1 +/- 11.6% of the dissolved organic carbon were removed by the biologically enhanced activated carbon (BEAC) reactor. It is shown that higher biodegradable dissolved organic carbon enhances ammonium removal, even at low temperatures. The C/N ratio consumed by the BEAC reactor reached a steady value (i.e., 3.3) after 2 months of operation. Despite seasonal fluctuations and competition of the indigenous community, the heterotrophic nitrifying bacteria (Acinetobacter sp. HRBLi 16 and Acinetobacter harbinensis strain HITLi 7) remained relatively stable. The amount of carbon source was the most significant environmental parameter and dramatically affected the microbial community compositions in the BEAC reactor. The present study provides new insights into the application of a BEAC reactor for ammonium removal from drinking water, resisting strong seasonal changes.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	24					19569	19582		10.1007/s11356-017-9522-3								WOS:000408363200010	28681296

It was calibrated by using measured turbidity data from stations along the reservoir and satellite images based on a flood event in 2013. In June 2013, there was heavy rainfall for two consecutive days on the frozen and snow-covered ground in the higher elevations of western Alberta, Canada. The runoff from the rainfall and the melted snow caused one of the largest recorded inflows to the headwaters of the South Saskatchewan River and Lake Diefenbaker downstream. An estimated discharge peak of over 5200 m(3)/s arrived at the reservoir inlet with a thick sediment front within a few days. The sediment plume moved quickly through the entire reservoir and remained visible from satellite images for over 2 weeks along most of the reservoir, leading to concerns regarding water quality. The aims of this study are to compare, quantitatively and qualitatively, the efficacy of using turbidity data and satellite images for sediment transport model calibration and to determine how accurately a sediment transport model can simulate sediment transport based on each of them. Both turbidity data and satellite images were very useful for calibrating the sediment transport model quantitatively and qualitatively. Model predictions and turbidity measurements show that the flood water and suspended sediments entered upstream fairly well mixed and moved downstream as overflow with a sharp gradient at the plume front. The model results suggest that the settling and resuspension rates of sediment are directly proportional to flow characteristics and that the use of constant coefficients leads to model underestimation or overestimation unless more data on sediment formation become available. Hence, this study reiterates the significance of the availability of data on sediment distribution and characteristics for building a robust and reliable sediment transport model.

Aquatic ecotoxicity of ashes from Brazilian savanna wildfires	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In a global scenario of climate change, several studies have predicted an increase in fires in different parts of the world. With the occurrence of rains following the fires in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado biome), the compounds present in ashes may enter aquatic environments and cause adverse effects to these ecosystems. In this context, this study evaluated the potential toxicity of ashes from two areas of Cerrado and an area of pasture, through ecotoxicological bioassays and using three aquatic species from distinct trophic levels, which were exposed to different dilutions of ashes: the microcrustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia, the fish Danio rerio and the mollusc Biomphalaria glabrata. The ashes from the three sampled areas showed higher concentrations of some elements in relation to the soil samples (B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, S, Si, Sr, Zn), but only a small quantity of these compounds was solubilised. Our data showed that all ash samples caused acute toxicity to C. dubia (48hs-LC50 = 13.4 g L-1; 48hs-LC50 = 6.33 g L-1; 48hs-LC50 = 9.73 g L-1 respectively for transition area, pasture, typical cerrado areas), while in relation to D. rerio and B. glabrata, no acute toxicity was observed when they were exposed to ashes from native Cerrado vegetation and pasture areas. Ashes from a transition area showed toxicity for D. rerio (48hs-LC50 = 25.0 g L-1); possibly, this was due to the combination of multiple preponderant inorganic elements of ashes with other organic compounds not analysed, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In summary, these results suggest that wildfires may pose risks to zooplankton communities and emphasize the need for more studies to better understand the complexity of the ecological effects of fire on aquatic ecosystems.

As it is biocompatible, widely available, and economically feasible, chitosan mushroom has high potential to be a suitable replacement for alum. Also, it can be a promising alternative to chitosan obtained traditionally from Crustaceans due to its higher zeta potential and homogeneity based on the raw material required for its production. A wide range of coagulant dose (5-60 mg l(-1)) and wastewater pH (2-12) were taken into account to find the optimal conditions of coagulation. The optimal doses are 10 and 20 mg l(-1) at best pH (11 and 3) when treated with kaolin and palm oil mill effluent, respectively, while 1200 mg l(-1) of alum was not enough to reach the efficiency of chitosan mushroom. On the other hand, the optimum dose of chitosan mushroom (20 mg l(-1)) at pH 3 of pome produced (75, 73, and 98%) removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solids (TSS), respectively. The significant potential of chitosan mushroom was proved by zeta potential measurement. Indeed, it possesses the highest zeta potential (+70 mV) as compared to the traditional chitosan produced from crustaceans. In short, chitosan mushroom as a biocoagulant is eco-friendly and it enhances water quality that meets the requirements of environmental conservatives.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	24					20104	20112		10.1007/s11356-017-9560-x								WOS:000408363200059	28702910

Water Quality Impacts of Green Roofs Compared with Other Vegetated Sites	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT												Green roofs are a convenient stormwater management strategy in highly developed, urbanized areas. Research has demonstrated that green roofs are effective at mitigating stormwater runoff volume, in addition to providing a range of other environmental benefits. Previous studies on the overflow from extensive green roofs have indicated that the overflow from these roofs, particularly those maintained with fertilizer, may contribute nutrients to nearby streams, storm sewers, and adjacent waterways. Whereas many studies have compared green roof nutrient concentrations with that of conventional roofs and urban streams, few studies have compared green roof effluent with other vegetated systems' effluent. In this study, located in Villanova, Pennsylvania, green roof effluent was evaluated and compared with vegetated land uses (e.g., woods and grass) and other stormwater control measures (e.g., bioinfiltration rain garden and constructed stormwater wetland) typically found in urban watersheds. Effluent samples from all sites were tested and analyzed for concentration and mass loading of nitrogen (nitrate, nitrite, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total nitrogen) and phosphorus (orthophosphate and phosphorus). Overall, the green roof effluent concentrations for nitrogen and phosphorus species were statistically different than the other land uses, and often with higher concentrations. The green roof effluent was most statistically similar to the wooded land use. From a mass loading perspective, in terms of unit area of the contributing watershed, the green roof had a higher loading than the other land uses. However, the fertilized green roof exported less than 15 percent of the total input mass of nitrogen and phosphorus, demonstrating that volume reduction aids in managing the effluent.

This study evaluates the hydrologic and water quality performance of a three year old, zero exfiltration pervious concrete parking lot in an urban area of St. Catharines, Ontario. Pervious concrete pavement exhibited a more naturalized hydrologic response compared with conventional asphalt, with volume reductions, and lag times to peak for every event observed, despite the zero exfiltration design preventing any infiltration into native soils. Residual concentrations in the pervious concrete effluent were below Provincial Water Quality Objectives and Canadian Water Quality Objectives for the majority of pollutants; however, high pH and elevated levels of aluminum and chromium were detected in the discharge. The site is well suited for further research, and long-term monitoring would help to evaluate the effectiveness of zero exfiltration systems in cold climates.

Isolation of pathogenic fungi from the major cultivated coldwater fish species and their environment in the kumaon region of Uttrakhand	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL RESEARCH												An attempt as been made to isolate the pathogenic fungus from water, body tissue of cold water fish. The hemp seed culture was applied to obtain the fungal colonies and bacteria free pure isolate was obtained by repeated subcultures, using SDA (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar) under aseptic condition and allowed to incubate at 18-20 degrees C for 48 hours. Fungal infection was more prominent in the ponds of stagnant water than the running water raceways. The inferior water quality of the stagnant fish ponds supports the virulence of the fungus spores. The muscles of the rainbow trout, fins and gills of the carp were susceptible for the infection. Intensity of the infection in cold water fish species increases with the downfall of the water temperature. The pathogenic fungi in the present study was identified as Saprolegnia parasitica, Saprolegnia diclina and S. ferax with cotton like appearance, elongated zoosporangia and pear shaped primary sporangium.																	0367-6722					AUG	2017	51	4					756	758		10.18805/ijar.10982								WOS:000408286200027

Two experimental watersheds including control (W-I) and treatment (W-IV) watersheds were used in the study. The experimental watersheds were monitored about 6 years from 2006 to 2011 for the calibration period and 4 years from 2012 to 2015 for the treatment period. The forest in the treatment watershed was thinned between October and December in 2011, and the forest in the control watershed was left untreated. Water grab samples were collected from the streams in the watersheds on weekly basis during both the calibration and treatment periods and analyzed for calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), Kjeldahl nitrogen (KN), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), iron (Fe3+), aluminum (Al3+), ammonium nitrogen (NH4 (+)-N), and sulfate (SO4 (2-)). The simple linear regression equations were developed between mean monthly nutrient fluxes of two watersheds in the calibration period with significantly high correlation coefficients, and they were used to estimate nutrient fluxes from the treatment watershed during the treatment period as if thinning had not been applied. The changes in the monthly nutrient fluxes were estimated as the differences between measured and values calculated with the linear regression equations. Results showed that removal of 18% standing timber volume did not significantly change nutrient exports except for KN and Na+ from the treatment watershed.				yurtseven, ibrahim/N-4842-2017	yurtseven, ibrahim/0000-0002-0204-0829; Gokbulak, Ferhat/0000-0003-4778-9953												1612-4669	1612-4677				AUG	2017	136	4					653	664		10.1007/s10342-017-1062-3								WOS:000407928000007

Understanding how to maintain a healthy state of the water cycle has become an important proposition for sustainable development of human society. In this paper, natural-social attributes of the water cycle are synthesized and 19 evaluation indices are selected from four dimensions, i.e., water-based ecosystem integrity, water quality, water resource abundance and water resource use. A hierarchical water-cycle health evaluation system is established. An analytic hierarchy process is used to set the weight of the criteria layer and index layer, and the health threshold for each index is defined. Finally, a water-cycle health composite-index assessment model and fuzzy recognition model are constructed based on the comprehensive index method and fuzzy mathematics theory. The model is used to evaluate the state of health of the water cycle in Beijing during 2010-2014 and in the planning year (late 2014), considering the transfer of 1 billion m(3) of water by the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP). The results show health scores for Beijing of 2.87, 3.10, 3.38, 3.11 and 3.02 during 2010-2014. The results of fuzzy recognition show that the sub healthy grade accounted for 54%, 49%, 61% and 49% of the total score, and all years had a sub -healthy state. Results of the criteria layer analysis show that water ecosystem function, water quality and water use were all at the sub -healthy level and that water abundance was at the lowest, or sick, level. With the water transfer from the SNWDP, the health score of the water cycle in Beijing reached 4.04. The healthy grade accounted for 60% of the total score, and the water cycle system was generally in a healthy state. Beijing's water cycle health level is expected to further improve with increasing water diversion from the SNWDP and industrial restructuring. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Coupling habitat suitability and ecosystem health with AEHRA to estimate E-flows under intensive human activities	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Sustaining adequate environmental flows (e-flows) is a key principle for maintaining river biodiversity and ecosystem health, and for supporting sustainable water resource management in basins under intensive human activities. But few methods could correctly relate river health to e-flows assessment at the catchment scale when they are applied to rivers highly impacted by human activities. An effective method is presented in this study to closely link river health to e-flows assessment for rivers at the catchment scale. Key fish species, as indicators of ecosystem health, were selected by using the foodweb model. A multi-species-based habitat suitability model (MHSI) was improved, and coupled with dominance of the key fish species as well as the Index of Biological Integrity (IBI) to enhance its accuracy in determining the fish-preferred key hydrologic habitat variables related to ecosystem health. Taking 5964 fish samples and concurrent hydrological habitat variables as the basis, the combination of key variables of flow-velocity and water-depth were determined and used to drive the Adapted Ecological Hydraulic Radius Approach (AEHRA) to study e-flows in a Chinese urban river impacted by intensive human activities. Results showed that upstream urbanization resulted in abnormal river-course geomorphology and consequently abnormal e-flows under intensive human activities. Selection of key species based on the foodweb and trophic levels of aquatic ecosystems can reflect a comprehensive requirement on e-flows of the whole aquatic ecosystem, which greatly increases its potential to be used as a guidance tool for rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems at large spatial scales. These findings have significant ramifications for catchment e-flows assessment under intensive human activities and for river ecohealth restoration in such rivers globally. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, its natural water chemistry (major elements) received little attention though it is crucial for water quality and aquatic ecology. Major ions during 2004-2014 were determined using stoichiometry to explore their shifts and the driving factors in the Danjiangkou Reservoir. Results show significant differences in monthly, spatial and annual concentrations of major ions. Waters are controlled by carbonate weathering with the dominant ions of Ca2+ and HCO3- total contributing 74% to the solutes, which are consistent with regional geography. Carbonate dissolution was produced by sulfuric acid and carbonic acid in particular. The relative abundance of Ca2+ gradually decreases, Na+ + K+ abundance, however, has doubled in the recent 11 years. Population and human activities were the major drivers for several major ions, i.e., and Na+ concentrations were explained by population and GDP, and SO42- by GDP, industrial sewage and energy consumption. Estimation indicated that domestic salts and atmospheric deposition contributed 56% and 22% to Cl-, respectively. We conclude waters in the Reservoir are naturally controlled by rock weathering whilst some key elements largely contributed by anthropogenic activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents a new fuzzy-based multi-objective compromise methodology to determine the socio-optimal and sustainable policies for hydro-environmental management of groundwater resources, which simultaneously considers the conflicts and negotiation of involved stakeholders, uncertainties in decision makers' preferences, existing uncertainties in the groundwater parameters and groundwater quality and quantity issues. The fuzzy multi-objective simulation-optimization model is developed based on qualitative and quantitative groundwater simulation model (MODFLOW and MT3D), multi-objective optimization model (NSGA-II), Monte Carlo analysis and Fuzzy Transformation Method (FTM). Best compromise solutions (best management policies) on trade-off curves are determined using four different Fuzzy Social Choice (FSC) methods. Finally, a unanimity fallback bargaining method is utilized to suggest the most preferred FSC method. Kavar-Maharloo aquifer system in Fars, Iran, as a typical multi-stakeholder multi-objective real-world problem is considered to verify the proposed methodology. Results showed an effective performance of the framework for determining the most sustainable allocation policy in groundwater resource management. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Overexploitation of groundwater in this plain has led to water level decline and caused serious problems such as land subsidence, aquifer destruction and water quality degradation. The increasing population and agricultural development along with drought and climate change, have further increased the pressure on water resources in this region over the last years. In order to overcome such crisis, introduction of surface water into an aquifer at particular locations can be a suitable solution. A wide variety of methods have been developed to recharge groundwater, one of which is aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). One of the fundamental principles of making such systems is delineation of suitable areas based on scientific and natural facts in order to achieve relevant objectives. To that end, the Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) in conjunction with the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was applied in this study. More specifically, nine main parameters including depth of runoff as the considered source of water, morphology of the earth surface features such as geology, geomorphology, land use and land cover, drainage and aquifer characteristics along with quality of water in the aquifer were considered as the main layers in GIS. The runoff water available for artificial recharge in the basin was estimated through Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number method. The weighted curve number for each watershed was derived through spatial intersection of land use and hydrological soil group layers. Other thematic layers were extracted from satellite images, topographical map, and other collateral data sources, then weighed according to their influence in locating process. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was then used to calculate weights of individual parameters. The normalized weighted layers were then overlaid to build up the recharge potential map. The results revealed that 34% of the total area is suitable and very suitable for groundwater recharge. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Seawater-flooding events and impact on freshwater lenses of low-lying islands: Controlling factors, basic management and mitigation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												An unprecedented set of hydrologic observations was collected after the Dec 2008 seawater-flooding event on Roi-Namur, Kwajalein Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands. By two days after the seawater flooding that occurred at the beginning of dry season, the observed salinity of water withdrawn by the island's main skimming well increased to 100% seawater concentration, but by ten days later already decreased to only 10-20% of seawater fraction. However, the damaging impact on the potability of the groundwater supply (when pumped water had concentrations above 1% seawater fraction) lasted 22 months longer. The data collected make possible analyses of the hydrologic factors that control recovery and management of the groundwater-supply quality on Roi-Namur and on similar low-lying islands. With the observed data as a guide, three-dimensional numerical-model simulation analyses reveal how recovery is controlled by the island's hydrology. These also allow evaluation of the efficacy of basic water quality management/mitigation alternatives and elucidate how groundwater withdrawal and timing of the seawater-flooding event affect the length of recovery. Simulations show that, as might be expected, by adding surplus captured rainwater as artificial recharge, the freshwater-lens recovery period (after which potable groundwater may again be produced) can be shortened, with groundwater salinity remaining lower even during the dry season, a period during which no artificial recharge is applied. Simulations also show that the recovery period is not lengthened appreciably by groundwater withdrawals during recovery. Simulations further show that had the flooding event occurred at the start of the wet season, the recovery period would have been about 25% (5.5 months) shorter than actually occurred during the monitored flood that occurred at the dry-season start. Finally, analyses show that artificial recharge improves freshwater-lens water quality, making possible longer use of groundwater as a water supply throughout each year, even when no seawater flooding has occurred.

These data resulted in electrical resistivity images to depths of approximately 280 m.b.s.l., which were used to understand the distribution of freshwater and saltwater in the subsurface, and factors controlling this distribution. The resulting resistivity sections were interpreted in conjunction with existing data sets, including well logs, seismic reflection data, geologic reports, hydrologic reports, and land use maps from the region. Interpretation of these data shows a complex pattern of saltwater intrusion resulting from geology, pumping, and recharge. The resistivity profiles were used to identify geological flow conduits and barriers such as palaeo-channels and faults, localized saltwater intrusion from individual pumping wells, infiltration zones of surface fresh and brackish water, and regions showing improvements in water quality due to management actions. The use of ERT data for characterizing the subsurface in this region has led to an understanding of the spatial distribution of freshwater and saltwater at a level of detail unattainable with the previously deployed traditional well based salinity mapping and monitoring techniques alone. Significant spatial variability in the extent and geometry of intrusion observed in the acquired data highlights the importance of adopting continuous subsurface characterization methods such as this one.

Improvements in Standardized Testing for Evaluating Sediment Barrier Performance: Design of a Full-Scale Testing Apparatus	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												Perimeter controls [i.e., sediment barriers (SBs) or sediment retention devices] are typically used on construction sites to retain sediment and prevent polluted stormwater runoff from adversely affecting aquatic habitats and clogging storm sewers. Often, parameters based on rule-of-thumb are applied to the design of SBs without knowing their expected performance capabilities. This issue is further complicated by the difficulty in devising a scientifically sound, repeatable testing methodology, replicating field conditions to assess performance. To resolve this issue, a test apparatus was designed and constructed at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Test Facility to replicate in-field rainfall runoff rates for purposes of conducting full-scale experiments on various SBs. This apparatus allows for performance testing and direct comparisons between various SB products, practices, and installations. The overall intent of conducting full-scale testing is to improve design criteria and enhance the in-field performance of SB practices. Initial test results for a woven polypropylene silt fence reinforced with a polypropylene grid and supported by wooden posts performed well structurally with an average sediment retention rate of 90.5% by volume.

Long-Term Simulations of the Hydrology for Sugarcane Fields in the Humid Tropics: Case Study on Guyana's Coastland	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												A 4.2-ha sugarcane field in Guyana was instrumented to measure hydrometeorological variables and water table depths in order to calibrate DRAINMOD. The model performs favorably, with a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) of 0.72, index of agreement (IoA) of 0.92, mean absolute error (MAE) of 16.5 cm and percentage bias (PBIAS) of 1.0%. DRAINMOD is then used for long-term simulations of the field hydrology using historical climate data. The simulated field discharges are used to compute average drainage rates (DR) for five durations (1-day; 2-day, ..., 5-day). The annual maximum drainage rates for each of the five durations are then fitted to the Gumbel distribution (EV1) for frequency analysis. The return period for an average 3-day (DR3) duration drainage event is estimated, and it is shown that the historical design drainage coefficients (35-50 mm day(-1)) used for surface drainage systems in sugarcane fields along Guyana's coastland have return periods ranging from 1 in 2 years to 1 in 5 years. These return periods are within recommended values commonly used for agricultural drainage systems.

Hepatic transcriptomic profiles from barramundi, Lates calcarifer, as a means of assessing organism health and identifying stressors in rivers in northern Queensland	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Resource managers need to differentiate between sites with and without contaminants and those where contaminants cause impacts. Potentially, transcriptomes could be used to evaluate sites where contaminant-induced effects may occur, to identify causative stressors of effects and potential adverse outcomes. To test this hypothesis, the hepatic transcriptomes in Barramundi, a perciforme teleost fish, (Lates calcarifer) from two reference sites, two agriculturally impacted sites sampled during the dry season, and an impacted site sampled during the wet season were compared. The hepatic transcriptome was profiled using RNA-Seq. Multivariate analysis showed that transcriptomes were clustered based on site and by inference water quality, but not sampling time. The largest differences in transcriptomic profile were between reference sites and a site sampled during high run-off, showing that impacted sites can be identified via RNA-Seq. Transcripts with altered abundance were linked to xenobiotic metabolism, peroxisome proliferation and stress responses, indicating putative stressors with the potential for adverse outcomes in barramundi.

In Situ Quantification of the Suspended Load of Estuarine Aggregates from Multifrequency Acoustic Inversions	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												The study of the suspended particulate matter (SPM) transport is essential to understanding oceans and rivers, for their presence can impact the environment, from marine habitats or water quality degradations to important changes of the seabed morphology. Among a large number of surrogate techniques in traditional water sampling, acoustical methods have the advantage of providing nonintrusive measurements, with high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the ability of fine-grained sediments to aggregate under the process of flocculation complexifies the interpretation of acoustical measurements. The objective of this paper is to design a simple backscatteringmodel for flocculated sediment suspensions, in order to interpret the information provided by a multifrequency profiler and to retrieve both the concentration and the dominant size of a suspension of flocculated sediments in an estuarine context. In situ granulometry laser data, collected in the Aulne macrotidal estuary (France), showed that over the size distribution observed, a mean porosity of apparent particles in suspension can be used directly as input for model generation. The in situ acoustic signal was concurrently recorded at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4MHz, and then inverted using the nonnegative least squares algorithm after constraining the model with an optimal porosity, allowing for a discrete representation of the mass concentration distributed over several equivalent spherical radii. The inversion results are in good agreement with the in situ mass concentration obtained through in situ water samplings.				delacourt, christophe/A-8240-2008													0739-0572	1520-0426				AUG	2017	34	8					1625	1643		10.1175/JTECH-D-16-0079.1								WOS:000408107300001

Efficacy and residual toxicity of a sodium hydroxide based ballast water treatment system for freshwater bulk freighters	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The efficacy and residual toxicity of a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) based ballast water treatment system (BWTS) were tested aboard the Great Lakes carrier M/V American Spirit in 1000 L mesocosms containing water from the ship's ballast tanks. NaOH was added to elevate the pH to 11.5 or 11.7 for 48 h, after which pH was reduced to <9 before discharge by sparging with carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate. In 4 trials, pH 11.7 NaOH BW was highly effective in reducing the densities of organisms relative to uptake water and met the ballast water discharge standards of the US Coast Guard (USCG), the US Environmental Protection Agency vessel general permit (USEPA VGP) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) G8 for the classes of regulated organisms: >= 50 mu m, >= 10 mu m to <50 mu m and indicator bacteria <10 mu m. In addition, densities of heterotrophic bacteria were reduced >96% in pH 11.7 treated discharge water relative to uptake densities. Seven day whole effluent toxicity tests indicated pH 11.7 NaOH BW met the USEPA VGP daily maximum criteria for residual toxicity. Organism densities in uptake water did not meet the minimum densities for IMO G8 shipboard test validity in 2 of 4 trials for organisms >= 10 mu m to <50 mu m or in any trials for the <10 mu m size class. The high efficacy and low residual toxicity observed indicates that a NaOH BWTS has great potential for successfully treating large volumes of ballast water released into freshwater systems.

Spatial and Temporal Variability in Benthic Invertebrate Assemblages in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Upper Klamath Lake (UKL) in southern Oregon has experienced declines in water quality due to excessive nutrient loading. This has led to annual cyanobacterial blooms, primarily of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (AFA). Benthic invertebrates are important food resources for benthic feeding fishes; however, they can increase autochthonous nutrient cycling in lakes and as a result might be contributing to poor water quality in UKL. This study determined the density and taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrate assemblages in three geographic regions (north, central, and south) and three habitats (littoral, open-water and trench) across UKL. Sediment composition and water quality were also characterized at each of the 21 benthic invertebrate collection sites. Three sampling trips were made from May-July 2013. Mean lake-wide invertebrate density was 12 617 + 7506 individuals m(-2) (n = 63, based on 189 Ekman grabs) with oligochaetes, chirono-mids, and leeches representing 97% of all individuals. Mean invertebrate richness per sample was 16 +/- 4 (n = 63). Two and three-way repeated measures ANOVAs identified differences in invertebrate densities and richness among regions, habitats, and sampling periods. There were no differences in total density among sampling periods. Total density was higher in littoral compared to open-water habitats, and in the northern region, proximal to all riverine inputs to the lake, compared to the central or southern regions. Although variances were heterogeneous, the number of taxa appeared to differ between habitats and regions.																	0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	2017	91	3					257	271		10.3955/046.091.0306								WOS:000408014800004

The ecological stability of the biotic communities (phytoplankton and zooplankton) of Lake Kinneret was estimated using two different aggregating schemes. The first scheme used the combined stability index, based on the combined indices of the individual phytoplankton (SI[Comb](P)) and zooplankton (SI[Comb](Z)) taxonomic groups. The total community stability index was calculated based on the total abundances of these communities. The stability of the entire ecosystem was estimated for two sets of ecosystem state variables, a lake "trophic state" set and a "water quality" set, which provided considerably different estimates of the lake ecosystem stability. Good agreement between the results of this study and qualitative estimates of Lake Kinneret stability validates the suitability of this approach to estimate the stability of different ecological units.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				AUG	2017	20	5					1015	1028		10.1007/s10021-016-0090-z								WOS:000407846100012

The recent growth in the mining sector has the potential to contribute significantly to employment, income generation, and infrastructure development. However, the development of these mineral resources has significant environmental impacts that often go unnoticed. This paper presents an overview of the Liberian mining sector from historical, current development, and economic perspectives. The efforts made by government to address issues of environmental management and sustainable development expressed in national and international frameworks, as well as some of the environmental challenges in the mining sector are analyzed. A case study was conducted on one of the iron ore mines (China Union Bong Mines Investment) to analyze the effects of the water quality on the local water environment. The results show that the analyzed water sample concentrations were all above the WHO and Liberia water standard Class I guidelines for drinking water. Finally the paper examines the application of water footprint from a life cycle perspective in the Liberian mining sector and suggests some policy options for water resources management.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	23					18711	18720		10.1007/s11356-017-9647-4								WOS:000407723100001						
J	Gilbert, BM; Avenant-Oldewage, A				Gilbert, Beric Michael; Avenant-Oldewage, Annemarie			Parasites and pollution: the effectiveness of tiny organisms in assessing the quality of aquatic ecosystems, with a focus on Africa	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The aquatic environment represents the final repository for many human-generated pollutants associated with anthropogenic activities. The quality of natural freshwater systems is easily disrupted by the introduction of pollutants from urban, industrial and agricultural processes. To assess the extent of chemical perturbation and associated environmental degradation, physico-chemical parameters have been monitored in conjunction with biota in numerous biological monitoring protocols. Most studies incorporating organisms into such approaches have focussed on fish and macroinvertebrates. More recently, interest in the ecology of parasites in relation to environmental monitoring has indicated that these organisms are sensitive towards the quality of the macroenvironment. Variable responses towards exposure to pollution have been identified at the population and component community level of a number of parasites. Furthermore, such responses have been found to differ with the type of pollutant and the lifestyle of the parasite. Generally, endoparasite infection levels have been shown to become elevated in relation to poorer water quality conditions, while ectoparasites are more sensitive, and exposure to contaminated environments resulted in a decline in ectoparasite infections. Furthermore, endoparasites have been found to be suitable accumulation indicators for monitoring levels of several trace elements and metals in the environment. The ability of these organisms to accumulate metals has further been observed to be of benefit to the host, resulting in decreased somatic metal levels in infected hosts. These trends have similarly been found for host-parasite models in African freshwater environments, but such analyses are comparatively sparse compared to other countries. Recently, studies on diplozoids from two freshwater systems have indicated that exposure to poorer water quality resulted in decreased infections. In the Vaal River, the poor water quality resulted in the extinction of the parasite from a site below the Vaal River Barrage. Laboratory exposures have further indicated that oncomiracidia of Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon are sensitive to exposure to dissolved aluminium. Overall, parasites from African freshwater and marine ecosystems have merit as effect and accumulation indicators; however, more research is required to detail the effects of exposure on sensitive biological processes within these organisms.

Knowledge on the spatial-temporal distribution of cyanobacterial blooms is therefore crucial for public health organizations and environmental agencies. In this study, field data and charge coupled device (CCD) image were collected in Lakes Gaoyang and Hanfeng of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), China. We conducted the risky grade index (RGI) and coverage area index to develop a feasible estimation framework of cyanobacterial blooms. First, the close relationships between CCD reflectance spectral indices and water quality parameters were constructed based on water optical classification. Then, a regional algorithm for the RGI classification was established by density peaks. Finally, our proposed algorithm was applied to investigate dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms in the two lakes from 6-year series of CCD images. Encouraging results demonstrated that satellite remote sensing in conjunction with field observation can aid in the estimation of cyanobacterial blooms in the TGR.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	23					19044	19056		10.1007/s11356-017-9544-x								WOS:000407723100027	28660506					
J	Li, B; Yang, GS; Wan, RR; Hormann, G				Li, Bing; Yang, Guishan; Wan, Rongrong; Hoermann, Georg			Dynamic water quality evaluation based on fuzzy matter-element model and functional data analysis, a case study in Poyang Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Comprehensively evaluating water quality with a single method alone is challenging because water quality evaluation involves complex, uncertain, and fuzzy processes. Moreover, water quality evaluation is limited by finite water quality monitoring that can only represent water quality conditions at certain time points. Thus, the present study proposed a dynamic fuzzy matter-element model (D-FME) to comprehensively and continuously evaluate water quality status. D-FME was first constructed by introducing functional data analysis (FDA) theory into a fuzzy matter-element model and then validated using monthly water quality data for the Poyang Lake outlet (Hukou) from 2011 to 2012. Results showed that the finite water quality indicators were represented as dynamic functional curves despite missing values and irregular sampling time. The water quality rank feature curve was integrated by the D-FME model and revealed comprehensive and continuous variations in water quality. The water quality in Hukou showed remarkable seasonal variations, with the best water quality in summer and worst water quality in winter. These trends were significantly correlated with water level fluctuations (R = -0.71, p < 0.01). Moreover, the extension weight curves of key indicators indicated that total nitrogen and total phosphorus were the most important pollutants that influence the water quality of the Poyang Lake outlet. The proposed D-FME model can obtain scientific and intuitive results. Moreover, the D-FME model is not restricted to water quality evaluation and can be readily applied to other areas with similar problems.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	23					19138	19148		10.1007/s11356-017-9371-0								WOS:000407723100036	28660517

Spectral absorption of non-algal particles [a (NAP)(lambda)] was similar to that of total particles for most samples, suggesting that the absorption of the total particles [a (p)(lambda)] was dominated by a (NAP)(lambda). The CDOM absorption spectra [a (CDOM)(lambda)] of West Liaohe and Taizihe rivers were easily distinguished from those of Hunhe, Liaohe, and East Liaohe rivers. Redundancy analysis indicated that absorption by optically active substances and anthropogenic nutrient disturbances probably resulted in the diversity of water quality parameters. The environmental variables including dissolved organic carbon, total alkalinity (TAlk), and total nitrogen (TN) had a significant correlation with CDOM absorption at 440 nm [a (CDOM)(440)]. There was almost no correlation between a (p)(lambda) and chlorophyll a, TN, total phosphorus, and TAlk. Moreover, total copper ion concentration and mercury ion concentration had a strong correlation with a (p)(440), a (p)(675), a (NAP)(440), and a (NAP)(675). The concentration of total aluminum ions exhibited a positive correlation with a (p)(675) and a (NAP)(675) (p < 0.05), and a significant correlation was observed between total arsenic concentration and a (CDOM)(440). Furthermore, the interaction between metal ions and optically active substances provided an insight into particulates and CDOM properties linked to water quality characteristics for rivers in semiarid areas.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	23					19322	19337		10.1007/s11356-017-9480-9								WOS:000407723100053	28669093					
J	Srisapoome, P; Areechon, N				Srisapoome, Prapansak; Areechon, Nonthawit			Efficacy of viable Bacillus pumilus isolated from farmed fish on immune responses and increased disease resistance in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus): Laboratory and on-farm trials	FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY												Applications of viable Bacillus pumilus AQAHBS01 isolated from Nile tilapia farms as probiotics were studied in both laboratory and farm conditions. In the laboratory, feeding fish (approximately 50 g) with feed containing viable B. pumilus at concentrations of 1 x 10(7)-10(9) colony forming units (CFU)/kg elevated fish immune responses, as indicated by their phagooytic activity and superoxide anion levels, and led to more effective disease resistance against Streptococcus agalactiae. However, when these concentrations were applied to Nile tilapia cultures growing in cage culture systems, only B. pumilus AQAHBS01 at concentrations of 1 x 10(8) and 10(9) CFU/kg diet could effectively enhance disease resistance against S. agalactiae during the critical period of early to middle April when the temperature reached 33 degrees C, whereas control fish and fish that consumed B. pumilus AQAHBS01 at concentrations of 1 x 10(7) CFU/kg showed very rapid streptococcosis-induced mortality. However, in late April, massive levels of organic matter-containing water flowed into the culture areas, causing all fish groups to become infected with Flavobacterium columnare. Moreover, the dissolved oxygen levels in the river declined to critical levels of approximately 1.0-1.5 mg/L, causing anorectic effects in fish for long periods of time. This effect may have also gradually killed the cultured fish until the end of the experiment. This information strongly demonstrates the effective application of B. pumilus as a probiotic for streptococcosis resistance in both laboratory and field culture conditions. For on-farm cage culture practices, however, fluctuations in water quality remain a significant constraint for probiotic application, as they usually induce negative effects on fish health. This decline in health makes fish more fragile and more susceptible to problems from both infectious and non-infectious diseases, which farmers must consider carefully. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Little multi-country research has been published on WaSH in rural schools in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this multi-national cross-sectional WaSH study, we document WaSH access, continuity, quality, quantity, and reliability in 2270 schools that were randomly sampled in rural regions of six Sub-Saharan African countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zambia. Data collection included: school WaSH surveys containing internationally established WaSH indicators, direct observation, and field- and laboratory-based microbiological water quality testing. We found 1% of rural schools in Ethiopia and Mozambique to 23% of rural schools in Rwanda had improved water sources on premises, improved sanitation, and water and soap for handwashing. Fewer than 23% of rural schools in the six countries studied met the World Health Organization's recommended student-to-latrine ratios for boys and for girls. Fewer than 20% were observed to have at least four of five recommended menstrual hygiene services (separate-sex latrines with doors and locks, water for use, waste bin). The low access to safe and adequate WaSH services in rural schools suggest opportunities for WaSH interventions that could have substantive impact on health, education, and gender disparities.

Physicochemical parameters affecting the perception of borehole water quality in Ghana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Rural Ghanaian communities continue using microbiologically contaminated surface water sources due in part to undesirable organoleptic characteristics of groundwater from boreholes. Our objective was to identify thresholds of physical and chemical parameters associated with consumer complaints related to groundwater. Water samples from 94 boreholes in the dry season and 68 boreholes in the rainy season were analyzed for 18 parameters. Interviews of consumers were conducted at each borehole regarding five commonly expressed water quality problems (salty taste, presence of particles, unfavorable scent, oily sheen formation on the water surface, and staining of starchy foods during cooking). Threshold levels of water quality parameters predictive of complaints were determined using the Youden index maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity. The probability of complaints at various parameter concentrations was estimated using logistic regression. Exceedances of WHO guidelines were detected for pH, turbidity, chloride, iron, and manganese. Concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS) above 172 mg/L were associated with salty taste complaints. Although the WHO guideline is 1000 mg/L, even at half the guideline, the likelihood of salty taste complaint was 75%. Iron concentrations above 0.11, 0.14 and 0.43 mg/L (WHO guideline value 0.3 mg/L) were associated with complaints of unfavorable scent, oily sheen, and food staining, respectively. Iron and TDS concentrations exhibited strong spatial clustering associated with specific geological formations. Improved groundwater sources in rural African communities that technically meet WHO water quality guidelines may be underutilized in preference of unimproved sources for drinking and domestic uses, compromising human health and sustainability of improved water infrastructure.

Use, microbiological effectiveness and health impact of a household water filter intervention in rural Rwanda-A matched cohort study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Unsafe drinking water is a substantial health risk contributing to child diarrhoea. We investigated impacts of a program that provided a water filter to households in rural Rwandan villages. We assessed drinking water quality and reported diarrhoea 12-24 months after intervention delivery among 269 households in the poorest tertile with a child under 5 from 9 intervention villages and 9 matched control villages. We also documented filter coverage and use. In Round 1(12-18 months after delivery), 97.4% of intervention households reported receiving the filter, 84.5% were working, and 86.0% of working filters contained water. Sensors confirmed half of households with working filters filled them at least once every other day on average. Coverage and usage was similar in Round 2 (19-24 months after delivery). The odds of detecting faecal indicator bacteria in drinking water were 78% lower in the intervention arm than the control arm (odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.10-0.39, p < 0.001). The intervention arm also had 50% lower odds of reported diarrhoea among children < 5 than the control arm (OR = 0.50, 95% CrI 0.23-0.90, p = 0.03). The protective effect of the filter is also suggested by reduced odds of reported diarrhoea-related visits to community health workers or clinics, although these did not reach statistical significance.

The impacts of environmental variables on water reflectance measured using a lightweight unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based spectrometer system	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING												Remote sensing methods to study spatial and temporal changes in water quality using satellite or aerial imagery are limited by the inherently low reflectance signal of water across the visible and near infrared spectrum, as well as environmental variables such as surface scattering effects (sun glint), substrate and aquatic vegetation reflectance, and atmospheric effects. This study exploits the low altitude, high resolution remote sensing capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms to examine the major environmental variables that affect water reflectance acquisition, without the confounding influence of atmospheric effects typical of higher-altitude platforms. After observation and analysis, we found: (1) multiple water spectra measured at the same location had a standard deviation of 10.4%; (2) water spectra changes associated with increasing altitude from 20 m to 100 m were negligible; (3) the difference between mean reflectance at three off-shore locations in an urban water body reached 29.9%; (4) water bottom visibility increased water reflectance by 20.1% in near shore areas compared to deep water spectra in a clear water lake; (5) emergent plants caused the water spectra to shift towards a shape that is characteristic of vegetation, whereas submerged vegetation showed limited effect on water spectra in the studied lake; (6) cloud and sun glint had major effects and caused water spectra to change abruptly; while glint and shadow effects on spectra may balance each other under certain conditions, the water reflectance can also be unpredictable at times due to wave effects and their effects on lines-of-site to calm water; (7) water spectra collected under a variety of different conditions (e.g. multiple locations, waves) resulted in weaker regression models compared to spectra collected under ideal conditions (e.g. single location, no wave), although the resulting model coefficients were relatively stable. The methods and results from this study contribute to better understanding of water reflectance acquisition using remote sensing, and can be applied in UAV-based water quality assessment or to aid in validation of higher altitude imagery.

Uncertainties in vegetated buffer strip function in controlling phosphorus export from agricultural land in the Canadian prairies	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Vegetated buffer strips (VBSs) are widely encouraged as a cost-effective strategy to address phosphorus (P) pollution associated with agricultural production. However, there is a lack of evidence in the effectiveness of these measures for tackling diffuse P pollution in cold-climate regions under concentrated runoff flow conditions. This research aimed to investigate the effects of VBSs on reducing P concentrations in surface runoff at three different watersheds in Manitoba, Canada. Surface runoff samples were collected in four sub-catchments from each watershed by installing paired weirs at 0.5-m and at 5-m into the VBSs along the expected runoff flow path. In addition, P concentrations were measured in soil samples collected within and outside of the runoff flow path to gain further insight into P dynamics within VBSs at each study site. The results indicate that VBSs had little or no significant effect on reducing the concentration of P forms in surface runoff in the majority of situations, resulting in reduced runoff losses of total, dissolved and particulate P concentrations in only 23, 12 and 12% of the situations, respectively. In addition, Olsen extractable P concentrations in VBS soils were not significantly different from field soils both within and outside of the flow path. The ineffective P retention by VBSs in this region is likely associated with the fact that the majority of the runoff flow is concentrated through small portions of VBSs and occurs during snowmelt when biogeochemical processes responsible for P retention in VBSs are limited. Further research is needed to develop alternative management practices that enhance P retention during concentrated snowmelt runoff events in such cold-climate regions.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	22					18372	18382		10.1007/s11356-017-9406-6								WOS:000407577800037

Human adenovirus 41 (HAdV-41) is the most common serotype detected and is a leading cause of acute diarrheal disease. The focus of this study is to determine the prevalence of HAdVs in hot springs. Of 57 samples collected from four different geological sites, 16 samples have shown evidence of HAdVs (28.1%). HAdV-41 and porcine adenovirus 5 (PAdV-5) were the two types isolated, with a greater frequency of HAdV-41, which in other settings has been associated with acute diarrhea. The highest occurrence was found in private hot tubs/Yuya (37.5%), followed by an outlet of hot springs (30.8%); public pools and foot pools shared the same detection rate of 21.4% (3/14). However, there was no evidence supporting a link between water quality indicators and HAdV detection rate. From a phylogenic analysis and BLAST against the NCBI database, it was concluded that HAdV-41 obtained from hot spring areas are closely related to global environmental genotypes.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	22					18392	18399		10.1007/s11356-017-9513-4								WOS:000407577800039						
J	Ji, NN; Wang, SR; Zhang, L; Ni, ZK				Ji, Ningning; Wang, Shengrui; Zhang, Li; Ni, Zhaokui			Characteristics and effects of dissolved organic phosphorus from different sources on the water quality of Erhai Lake in Southwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												To establish the influence of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) from different sources on the water quality of Erhai Lake in August 2014, enzymatic hydrolysis technology was used to characterize enzymatically hydrolyzable phosphorus (EHP). The results indicate that the DOP represents a significant source of the bioavailable P in the lake water and its different sources of Erhai Lake, and the bioavailability of the P pool may be underestimated by up to 55% if DOP is ignored and only the soluble-reactive phosphorus (SRP) is considered. The significant differences in DOP characteristics from the different sources may be related to the origin of the DOP, regional pollution, and environmental factors. The DOP from the sediment porewater can act as an important source of DOP in the lake water based on its high DOP content and high DOP loads from the sediment release. In addition, the highest EHP loads from the sediment release can threaten the water quality of Erhai Lake and sustain the algal blooms when they occur. Therefore, for the protection of Erhai Lake, the contributions of not only the SRP but also the DOP to the bioavailable P pool should be considered, emphasizing the eutrophication risk caused by DOP from sediments, especially in the middle section of Erhai Lake. The effects of DOP from the inflowing rivers on the water quality should also not be ignored, due to its high bioavailability.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	22					18605	18618		10.1007/s11356-017-9474-7								WOS:000407577800057	28647876

As a noninvasive optical technique, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy is investigated for detecting contamination events. However, current methods for event detection exhibit the shortcomings of noise susceptibility. In this paper, a new method that has less sensitivity to noise was proposed to detect water quality contamination events by analyzing the complexity of the UV-Vis spectrum series. The proposed method applied approximate entropy (ApEn) to measure spectrum signals' complexity, which made a distinction between normal and abnormal signals. The impact of noise was attenuated with the help of ApEn's insensitivity to signal disturbance. This method was tested on a real water distribution system data set with various concentration simulation events. Results from the experiment and analysis show that the proposed method has a good performance on noise tolerance and provides a better detection result compared with the autoregressive model and sequential probability ratio test.

The plain covers an area of 533 km2 and lies in a Mediterranean sub-humid climate. Groundwater is the main source for domestic uses and agricultural activities in this area. Groundwater samples were collected from 15 wells during dry and wet seasons in 2015, and they were analyzed for major cations and anions and compared with drinking and irrigation specification standards. The comparison of chemical concentration with WHO drinking water standards of 2006 shows that more than 30% of groundwater samples are unsuitable for drinking, and the majority of groundwater samples fell on the hard and very hard categories. Suitability of groundwater for drinking was also evaluated based on the water quality index (WQI). It shows more than 80% of samples have good or permissible water quality for dry and wet seasons. In terms of the irrigation usage, generally, groundwater in the study area is suitable for different uses in both seasons according to SAR, %Na, RSBC, and PI. However, water rock exchange processes and groundwater flow have been responsible for the dominated water type Ca-Mg-Cl.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	15							333	10.1007/s12517-017-3119-5								WOS:000407429400015

The use of multivariate statistical analysis in the assessment of groundwater hydrochemistry in some parts of southwestern Nigeria	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Multivariate statistical methods including factor analysis (FA), cluster analysis (CA), and correlation analysis have been used to evaluate the spatial variations and the interpretation of a complex water quality data set of some parts of Oyo State in southwestern Nigeria. Thirty water samples were collected from different stations, and 16 parameters were determined. Correlation analysis shows that the relationship between the parameters with high character of ion was higher than that of the parameters with low character of ion and that the variation in relationship shows the complexity in ground-water quality and the effect of the interactions between rock and water. Regression analysis was used for the prediction of values of one variable using the knowledge of other variables, for which more data are available. FA shows five distinct factors, which explained 84.3% of the total variance in water quality data set. The five factors are anthropogenic, ion exchange, weathering/leaching, anthropogenic, and nitrogen, which explained 28, 23, 14.2, 10.0, and 6.9% of the total variance, respectively. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the parameters into three major clusters. This study shows the uses of multivariate statistical methods for the interpretation of complex data sets in the analysis of spatial variations in water quality. This would therefore enhance planning for future studies.

While the surface water resources are perfectly managed and operated by means of dams and small dams built for several years, the groundwater resources remain long unknown and unusable because of the lack of relevant working tools (e.g., methods, formulas, maps, etc.) for planners and engineers working in the field of water resources exploration. To highlight the hydrodynamic processes of groundwater in shallow aquifers of the basins of northern Algeria, we conducted a study using 81 subwatersheds collected from different locations at the basins; taking into account the climatic and geomorphological factors, to understand water usage trends, analyse patterns, tap good shallow aquifers and ensure long lasting supplies of water through arid periods, mapping and modelling of groundwater are fundamental to problem resolution. Multivariate statistical techniques as well as cluster and principal component analysis were applied to the data on groundwater flow, with the objective of defining the main controls on the groundwater flows at the basins. These statistical techniques showed the presence of three groundwater flow groups with increasing importance according to precipitation. The first group was mainly influenced by climatic factors, the second was more controlled by the communication between the surface and underground flows and the third group revealed the influence of geomorphological factors on groundwater flows.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	15							336	10.1007/s12517-017-3079-9								WOS:000407429400018

P, India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The unconfined coastal alluvial aquifers, although occurring in limited extent along ocean tracts, cater to the growing water requirements of most of the seaside habitation. By virtue of the physical location, the chemistry of ground-water in marine environment undergoes rapid modifications and is also susceptible to contamination. Through this paper, an attempt is made to chronicle the temporal changes in water chemistry and extent of contamination in the sandy aquifers utilizing the closely monitored data of 13 sampling sessions spread over 4 years. The water is of weak alkaline nature and less mineralized, electrical conductivity (EC) being <1000 mu S/cm in many samples. Major ion composition indicates that 60 to 80% of the samples are polluted with nitrates. Apart from nitrate, the water is also contaminated with respect to pH, EC, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, and SO4(2-) as about 5 to 20% of samples in different seasons have some of these parameters in more than the maximum permissible limits of Bureau of Indian Standards drinking water standards. Ionic abundance is in the order of WCl- > Na+ > Ca2+ > HCO3- > Mg2+ > SO42- > NO3-. Na+ and Cl-are almost in similar proportions implying affect of coastal climate on water quality. Even though spatial variations among constituent species are limited, the water can be classified into two distinct facies viz. Ca-Mg-Cl and Na-ClSO4 types. The stoichiometry analysis of long-term water chemistry data enunciate that multiple processes were involved in evolution of aquatic chemistry. Water-rock interaction with the aquifer matrix and carbonate dissolution was the most significant. It was further influenced by evaporation process and anthropogenic inputs which are authenticated by mean ionic ratios of Na+/Cl-, SO42-/Cl, Mg2+/Ca2+, and HCO3-/Cl-. Nitrate contamination, which is more rapid in habitat areas, can be attributed to poor sewerage and domestic waste disposal mechanism. Fertilizer inputs and continuous irrigation and agriculture activity can be accounted for the nitrate enrichment in agriculture areas. With the contaminant transport dynamics being uniform in the aquifer, difference in the intensity of contamination can be attributed to land use variations. Point source pollution from domestic and animal waste landfills is causing enormous damage to the groundwater. The study substantiate that shallow phreatic coastal aquifers suffers more from human interference than coastal climate effect.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				AUG	2017	10	15							321	10.1007/s12517-017-3114-x								WOS:000407429400003

However, desalination is undeniably recognized as one of the most energy-intensive techniques for creating a clean and safe water supply. Cost reduction in different aspects is necessary to make desalination processes affordable and accessible. In fact, the cost of water from desalination facilities is momentously impacted by the energy requirements for water production. As the water production cost cannot be separated from the issue of energy, the desalination community is continuously seeking ways to reduce energy consumption further. Current research focuses on assessing and alleviating the major energy issues by finding ways to improve the energy efficiency of desalination facilities, which would pave the way for overall cost reduction. Improving the process and the efficiencies of materials implies improved water quality and an increase in the quantity produced per unit of energy consumed. This review highlights recent emerging approaches that aim to reduce the energy consumption and, hence, the water production cost of desalination technology. In brief, the advances made in membrane science and technology, the development of emerging desalination processes and their integrated systems, as well as the use of renewable energy and energy-recovery systems are recognized as effective and feasible solutions towards energy-efficient desalination to address the water crisis.

In this work, we encapsulated electroactive biofilms with biocompatible polydopamine (PDA) to protect against extreme acid shock. The bacterial cells were completely encapsulated in similar to 50 nm films formed by PDA spheres, which protected their viability and current recoverability even after pH 0.5 and 1.5 shocks. The limiting current density of the PDA-encapsulated anode was 0.20 +/- 0.05 A/m(2), which was 1900% higher than that of the unprotected control (0.01 +/- 0.01 A/m(2)) after strong acid shock (pH 0.5, 30 min). Without PDA encapsulation, the biofilm partly disintegrated with a thickness decreased by 68% from 72 to 23 mu m, where 92% of the cells were dead. Our findings reported a novel and effective method for protecting electroactive biofilm under extreme conditions, which will greatly extend the use of BESs in the future.

An optical method for characterizing carbon content in ceramic pot filters	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Ceramic pot filter (CPF) technology is a relatively common means of household water treatment in developing areas, and performance characteristics of CPFs have been characterized using production CPFs, experimental CPFs fabricated in research laboratories, and ceramic disks intended to be CPF surrogates. There is evidence that CPF manufacturers do not always fire their products according to best practices and the result is incomplete combustion of the pore forming material and the creation of a carbon core in the final CPFs. Researchers seldom acknowledge the existence of potential existence of carbon cores, and at least one CPF producer has postulated that the carbon may be beneficial in terms of final water quality because of the presence of activated carbon in consumer filters marketed in the Western world. An initial step in characterizing the presence and impact of carbon cores is the characterization of those cores. An optical method which may be more viable to producers relative to off-site laboratory analysis of carbon content has been developed and verified. The use of the optical method is demonstrated via preliminary disinfection and flowrate studies, and the results of these studies indicate that the method may be of use in studying production kiln operation.																	1477-8920					AUG	2017	15	4					536	544		10.2166/wh.2017.049								WOS:000407037100007	28771151

Modeling effect of cover condition and soil type on rotavirus transport in surface flow	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Runoff from animal production facilities contains various microbial pathogens which pose a health hazard to both humans and animals. Rotavirus is a frequently detected pathogen in agricultural runoff and the leading cause of death among children around the world. Diarrheal infection caused by rotavirus causes more than two million hospitalizations and death of more than 500,000 children every year. Very little information is available on the environmental factors governing rotavirus transport in surface runoff. The objective of this study is to model rotavirus transport in overland flow and to compare the model results with experimental observations. A physically based model, which incorporates the transport of infective rotavirus particles in both liquid (suspension or free-floating) and solid phase (adsorbed to soil particles), has been used in this study. Comparison of the model results with experimental results showed that the model could reproduce the recovery kinetics satisfactorily but under-predicted the virus recovery in a few cases when multiple peaks were observed during experiments. Similarly, the calibrated model had a good agreement between observed and modeled total virus recovery. The model may prove to be a promising tool for developing effective management practices for controlling microbial pathogens in surface runoff.																	1477-8920					AUG	2017	15	4					545	554		10.2166/wh.2017.240								WOS:000407037100008	28771152

Modelling spatio-temporal heterogeneities in groundwater quality in Ghana: a multivariate chemometric approach	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Chemometric techniques were applied to evaluate the spatial and temporal heterogeneities in groundwater quality data for approximately 740 goldmining and agriculture-intensive locations in Ghana. The strongest linear and monotonic relationships occurred between Mn and Fe. Sixty-nine per cent of total variance in the dataset was explained by four variance factors: physicochemical properties, bacteriological quality, natural geologic attributes and anthropogenic factors (artisanal goldmining). There was evidence of significant differences in means of all trace metals and physicochemical parameters (p < 0.001) between goldmining and non-goldmining locations. Arsenic and turbidity produced very high value F's demonstrating that 'physical properties and chalcophilic elements' was the function that most discriminated between non-goldmining and goldmining locations. Variations in Escherichia coli and total coliforms were observed between the dry and wet seasons. The overall predictive accuracy of the discriminant function showed that non-goldmining locations were classified with slightly better accuracy (89%) than goldmining areas (69.6%). There were significant differences between the underlying distributions of Cd, Mn and Pb in the wet and dry seasons. This study emphasizes the practicality of chemometrics in the assessment and elucidation of complex water quality datasets to promote effective management of groundwater resources for sustaining human health.																	1477-8920					AUG	2017	15	4					658	672		10.2166/wh.2017.244								WOS:000407037100018	28771162					
J	Anagnostou, E; Gianni, A; Zacharias, I				Anagnostou, Eleni; Gianni, Areti; Zacharias, Ierotheos			Ecological modeling and eutrophicationA review	NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING												During the several last decades, environmental scientists use numerical modeling as a tool in their studies and investigations of aquatic systems. Ecological and hydrodynamic models are developed in parallel regarding their complexity, uncertainty, and computational power. Ecological models have been used to assess ecosystem processes and interactions, simulate future scenarios, evaluate remedial practices in response to eutrophication etc. This review paper deals with the progress in ecological modeling related to eutrophication processes, specifically in models that describe the trophic state dynamics of hypoxic/anoxic aquatic ecosystems. Nine dynamic ecological models coupled or noncoupled with hydrodynamic models have been discussed based upon their history, complexity, limitations, recent detailed modeling applications, and their important results. The advantages and disadvantages of these models are presented along with their application areas. Recommendations for Resource Managers Authorities and stakeholders need modeling systems adjusted to their territory/country characteristics to meet their own criteria (different physical and ecological forces from country to country). There are today a wide variety of available models for planning ecosystems' management and restoration projects. The choice of the appropriate model depends on application area and the geographical region, the ecosystem's size, the available data, and of course the modeled processes. This review can be used from researchers and managers as a guide for a comprehensive understanding of a eutrophication ecosystem, designing the water quality monitoring and modeling as well as the restoration plan.

The annual (1977-2015) mean river flow of 26.32 billion (109) cubic metres (BCM) with a range of 13.77 to 42.2 BCM and standard deviation of 6.026 BCM revealed no significant trend in annual inflow data of the Kabul River. Afghanistan planned developments in the basin were analysed in the light of reduction in the transboundary flow. Faecal coliforms, pH (7.90 to 8.06), Escherichia coli and other water quality parameters were found to be within permissible limits, however, dissolved oxygen was just above the permissible limits to sustain aquatic life. Water was found unsuitable for drinking while suitable for agriculture and aquatic life. Remote sensing data used for temporal change detection showed an increase in built-up-areas and cultivated areas along Kabul River inside Pakistan by 50 and 47%, respectively. Significant changes were observed at two locations in the river course. Insights of emerging Kabul River issues and a way forward have been discussed which could serve as the basis for formulation of adaption strategies leading to a 'Kabul River Water Treaty'.																	1366-7017					AUG	2017	19	4					650	672		10.2166/wp.2017.119								WOS:000407448400005						
J	Martinez-Santos, P				Martinez-Santos, P.			Determinants for water consumption from improved sources in rural villages of southern Mali	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Water supply must take into consideration a variety of factors, including consumer habits, options and needs. Little is known about water demands in rural areas of developing regions. Based on data from southern Mali, this paper banks on the hypothesis that water consumption in rural villages can be predicted by combining measurable variables with spatial analyses. A ten-day field campaign was carried out at the end of the dry season 2016. All improved water sources were checked for functionality, flow rate and water quality. Outcomes were coupled with those from over one-hundred household interviews and incorporated into a geographic database. Buffered network analyses were used to quantify the main spatial determinants for water use. Simple and multiple regression models were then developed to establish the main predictors for per capita and household water consumption. Multiple regression reveals that models based on the number of household members, travel time and total travel distance provide robust forecasts for water consumption (R-2 > 0.93). Conversely, potentially relevant parameters such as affordability or water quality were not statistically significant. This could be attributed to the presence of free water sources and to the absence of quality-monitoring, respectively. Outcomes also suggest that having access to basic means of transportation, such as pushcarts, doubles water consumption at the household level. In terms of access to improved water sources, coverage was found to be lower in practice than on paper. These outcomes contribute to the growing body of literature that challenges the widely accepted assumption that 90% of the world population has access to safe drinking supplices.

J	Xu, LQ; Liu, SY; Li, DL				Xu, Longqin; Liu, Shuangyin; Li, Daoliang			Prediction of water temperature in prawn cultures based on a mechanism model optimized by an improved artificial bee colony	COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE												To reduce aquaculture risk and optimize water quality management in prawn culture ponds, this paper uses mechanistic and statistical analytic methods to propose a hybrid water temperature forecasting model based on the water temperature mechanism model (WTMM) with optimal parameters selected by an improved artificial bee colony (IABC) algorithm. Because of existing problems with using an artificial bee colony algorithm in modeling, an improved ABC with a dynamically adjusted inertia weight based on the fitness function value was implemented to improve local and global search abilities. Then, IABC was employed to adaptively search for the optimal combinatorial parameters needed in the WTMM model, which overcomes the blindness of and limits to parameter selection for the traditional WTMM model. We adopted an IABC-WTMM algorithm to construct a non-linear mechanical prediction model. The IABC-WTMM was tested and compared to other algorithms by applying it to the prediction of water temperature in prawn culture ponds. Experimental results show that the proposed IABC-WTMM could increase prediction accuracy and execute generalization performance better than the original water temperature mechanism model (O-WTMM) and back-propagation neural network (BP-NN), but was inferior to the standard LSSVR model. Overall, it is a suitable and effective method for predicting water temperature in intensive aquacultures. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Time lags in watershed-scale nutrient transport: an exploration of dominant controls	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Unprecedented decreases in atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition together with increases in agricultural N-use efficiency have led to decreases in net anthropogenic N inputs in many eastern US and Canadian watersheds as well as in Europe. Despite such decreases, N concentrations in streams and rivers continue to increase, and problems of coastal eutrophication remain acute. Such a mismatch between N inputs and outputs can arise due to legacy N accumulation and subsequent lag times between implementation of conservation measures and improvements in water quality. In the present study, we quantified such lag times by pairing long-term N input trajectories with stream nitrate concentration data for 16 nested subwatersheds in a 6800 km(2), Southern Ontario watershed. Our results show significant nonlinearity between N inputs and outputs, with a strong hysteresis effect indicative of decadal-scale lag times. The mean annual lag time was found to be 24.5 years, with lags varying seasonally, likely due to differences in N-delivery pathways. Lag times were found to be negatively correlated with both tile drainage and watershed slope, with tile drainage being a dominant control in fall and watershed slope being significant during the spring snowmelt period. Quantification of such lags will be crucial to policy-makers as they struggle to set appropriate goals for water quality improvement in human-impacted watersheds.

A heavy pollution index (HPI) model was used to evaluate the metal contamination status in the groundwater of the study area. Spatial distribution maps of the HPI values were prepared using a geographic information system (GIS) technique so that the groundwater quality status of the area could easily be recognized. The concentrations of As, Ba, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn did not exceed the drinking water permissible limits for years considered. However, the concentrations of Al, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Se were above the drinking water permissible limits established by the World Health Organization (WHO 2006). The HPI values were above the critical pollution index of 100 during the years 2011 and 2012.

Current analytical methods mostly rely on gas chromatography (GC) or reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) coupled with (tandem) mass spectrometry. However, neither method can easily separate very polar molecules. This study presents two chromatographic separation strategies, a serial RPLC hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (RPLC-HILIC) coupling and an analytical scale supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) system, and validates their separation effectiveness as polarity-extended chromatographic methods for 274 environmentally relevant compounds. Compounds tested were grouped into three polarity classes, "very polar" {log D (pH 7) below -2.5}, "polar" {log D (pH 7) -2.5 to +2}, and "non-polar" {log D (pH 7) higher than +2}). Nearly all compounds could be retained in both systems with relative standard deviations of retention times (RT; n = 6) typically between 2 and 5%. Both techniques have considerable benefits when combined with accurate mass spectrometric detection. Molecules RT and accurate mass were recorded in a database for each set up. This information was used for compound screening measurements like "hidden-target screening" in complex environmental matrices (such as wastewater treatment plant effluents). Results of both techniques are complementary and useful for all types of molecules polarity. In this study, more than 80% of the compounds found in wastewater treatment plant effluent samples possessed a "negative log D (pH 7) value. This result highlights the basic necessity to include "very polar" compounds in water monitoring techniques and protocols.																	0003-2700	1520-6882				AUG 1	2017	89	15					7907	7914		10.1021/acs.analchem.7b00859								WOS:000406982500016	28650149

Distribution and habitat models of the Eurasian otter, Lutra lutra, in South Korea	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Eastern populations of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) have declined throughout Asia. Although the South Korean government designated the Eurasian otter as an Endangered Species and Natural Monument, limited information exists on the distribution and habitat of this top predator in riparian ecosystems at this terminus of its distribution. We documented the distribution and modeled the habitat of this species using sign survey data collected in 2009 and 2010. We analyzed otter presence with 21 raster data sets using environmental niche modeling. We evaluated 31 variables as explanatory variables for logistic regression models that considered detection and non-detection data. We detected otter sign at 83% (3,288 of 3,957) of survey sites within 63% (680 of 1,074) of survey cells. In our MaxEnt presence-only model, land cover type was the main contributing factor to predicting habitat suitability, with secondary influences from isothermality, precipitation in the wettest month, elevation, and temperature seasonality. Water quality and human disturbance were the main variables significantly associated with otter occurrence based on the regression model that included detection and non-detection data. Direct measures of human activity, such as traffic volume and land price, were better predictors than stationary factors such as density of buildings. Our results suggest that otters and humans can coexist in highly populated areas. Our information on the distribution and habitat characteristics of Eurasian otters in South Korea will assist habitat management and recovery projects in natural and anthropogenic environments.																	0022-2372	1545-1542				AUG 1	2017	98	4					1105	1117		10.1093/jmammal/gyx037								WOS:000406848500016

Rather, the mix of urban hubs surrounded by undeveloped expanses creates a ratchet process whereby anthropogenic activity is sufficient to introduce and spread invaders, but for which the costs of monitoring and managing remote ecosystems is prohibitive. Elodea spp. is the first aquatic invasive plant to become established in Alaska and has potential for widespread deleterious ecological and economic impacts. A rapid eradication response with herbicides has been identified as a priority invasion control strategy. We conducted a multi-lake monitoring effort to assess collateral impacts from herbicide treatment for Elodea in high latitude systems. Variability in data was driven by seasonal dynamics and natural lake-to-lake differences typical of high latitude waterbodies, indicating lack of evidence for systematic impacts to water quality or plankton communities associated with herbicide treatment of Modal. Impacts on native macrophytes were benign with the exception of some evidence for earlier onset of leaf senescence for lily pads (Nuphar spp.) in treated lakes. We observed a substantial increase in detected native flora richness after Elodea was eradicated from the most heavily infested lake, indicating potential for retention of native macrophyte communities if infestations are addressed quickly. While avoiding introductions through prevention may be the most desirable outcome, these applications indicated low risks of non-target impacts associated with herbicide treatment as a rapid response option for Elodea in high latitude systems.																	0006-3207	1873-2917				AUG	2017	212		A				300	309		10.1016/j.biocon.2017.06.015								WOS:000407186000033

Experiments with feedwater containing clays (kaolinite) and natural organic matter (humic acid) revealed that the combined effect of coagulation and electric field mitigated membrane fouling in the ECMR, resulting in higher water flux than the conventional combination of electrocoagulation and UF in separate units (EC-UF). Higher current densities and weakly acidic pH in the EMCR favored faster generation of large flocs and effectively reduced membrane pore blocking. The hydraulic resistance of the formed cake layers on the membrane surface in ECMR was reduced due to an increase in cake layer porosity and polarity, induced by both coagulation and the applied electric field. The formation of a polarized cake layer was controlled by the applied current density and voltage, with cake layers formed under higher electric field strengths showing higher porosity and hydrophilicity. Compared to EC-UF, ECMR has a smaller footprint and could achieve significant energy savings due to improved fouling resistance and a more compact reactor design.

The growth of the tourism industry is increasing rapidly. It has been able to accelerate the economic growth, but also followed by some negative effects, including rapid growth of population, changes in land use, reduced the catchment area and groundwater exploitation for tourism infrastructure development. The result showed that in several strategic areas have shown an indicator of water crisis, especially in North and East Denpasar. Based on the permeability analyses, the recharge area was in the north and a little part of west Denpasar. The rainfall was between 1500 - 1750 mm/year with 4 wet months a year. The shallow groundwater level reaches 16.10 m below ground level in the North, while in the West was 18.2 m with the maximum infiltration rate was 0.00000054 mm/sec. Based on those data, it has been designed the ergonomics shallow recharge wells for rainwater harvesting to offset the domestic water usage. The analyses showed that if all 220.150 households make at least one shallow recharge wells, it can harvest rainwater about 222.40 l/sec, and is able to return about 63.87% of water which should be recharge to the ground. In conclusion, making one-recharge wells for each household has not been able to recover the domestic water usage. It is recommended to create another innovation for water conservation program such as building the recharge wells along the drainage tunnel.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				AUG	2017	13	36					50	57		10.21660/2017.36.2828								WOS:000406909500010

JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The ornamental fish trade is estimated to handle up to 15 billion fishes. Transportation and handling of fishes imposes a range of stressors that can result in mortality at rates of up to 73%. These rates vary hugely, however, and can be as low as 2%, because they are generally estimated rather than based on experimental work. Given the numbers of ornamental fishes traded, any of the estimated mortality rates potentially incur significant financial losses and serious welfare issues. Industry bodies, such as the Ornamental Aquatic Trade Association (OATA), have established standards and codes of best practice for handling fishes, but little scientific research has been conducted to understand the links between stress, health and welfare in ornamental species. In aquaculture, many of the same stressors occur as those in the ornamental trade, including poor water quality, handling, transportation, confinement, poor social and physical environment and disease and in this sector directed research and some resulting interventions have resulted in improved welfare standards. This review considers the concept of welfare in fishes and evaluates reported rates of mortality in the ornamental trade. It assesses how the stress response can be quantified and used as a welfare indicator in fishes. It then analyses whether lessons from aquaculture can be usefully applied to the ornamental fish industry to improve welfare. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest how future research might be directed to help improve welfare in the ornamental trade.

In this study, the impact of irrigation water on product safety from different food production systems (commercial to small-scale faming and homestead gardens) was assessed. Hygiene indicators (total coliforms, Escherichia coli), and selected foodborne pathogens (Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7) of water and leafy green vegetables were analyzed. Microbiological parameters of all irrigation water (except borehole) exceeded maximum limits set by the Department of Water Affairs for safe irrigation water. Microbial parameters for leafy greens ranged from 2.94 to 4.31 log CFU/g (aerobic plate counts) and 1 to 5.27 log MPN/100g (total coliforms and E. coli). Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 were not detected in all samples tested but L. monocytogenes was present in irrigation water (commercial and small-scale farm, and homestead gardens). This study highlights the potential riskiness of using polluted water for crop production in different agricultural settings. Practical applicationsThese results show that the microbial quality of surface water is deteriorating in different agricultural settings. This may be a possible preharvest source of contamination of leafy green vegetables, which may then constitute a health risk to consumers. The presence of Listeria monocytogenes along the food supply chain is a potential health risk if the pathogen proliferates leading to high quantities suitable for onset of listeriosis. The absence of Salmonella and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in the samples tested is an encouraging result. Food safety protocols should be extended to the informal sectors and homestead gardens.																	0149-6085	1745-4565				AUG	2017	37	3							e12324	10.1111/jfs.12324								WOS:000407052900005

Channel routing is a typical example of the mathematical conceptualization of watershed landscape and processes in hydrologic modeling. We investigated the sensitivity of accuracy, equifinality, and uncertainty of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling to channel dimensions to demonstrate how a conceptual representation of a watershed system affects streamflow and sediment modeling. Results showed the amount of uncertainty and equifinality strongly responded to channel dimensions. On the other hand, the model performance did not significantly vary with the changes in the channel representation due to the degree of freedom allowed by the conceptual nature of hydrologic modeling in the parameter calibration. Such findings demonstrated good modeling performance statistics do not necessarily mean small output uncertainty, and partial improvements in the watershed representation may neither increase modeling accuracy nor reduce uncertainty. We also showed the equifinality and uncertainty of hydrologic modeling are case-dependent rather than specific to models or regions, suggesting great caution should be used when attempting to transfer uncertainty analysis results to other modeling studies, especially for ungauged watersheds.

J	Shabani, A; Zhang, XD; Ell, M				Shabani, Afshin; Zhang, Xiaodong; Ell, Mike			Modeling Water Quantity and Sulfate Concentrations in the Devils Lake Watershed Using Coupled SWAT and CE-QUAL-W2	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Devils Lake is an endorheic lake in the Red River of the North basin in northeastern North Dakota. During the last two decades, the lake water level has risen by nearly 10m, causing floods that have cost more than 1 billion USD in mitigation measures. Another increase of approximately 1.5m in the lake water level would cause spillage into the Sheyenne River. To alleviate this potentially catastrophic spillage, two artificial outlets were constructed. However, the artificial drainage of water into the Sheyenne River raises water quality concerns because the Devils Lake water contains significantly higher concentrations of dissolved solids, particularly sulfate. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was coupled with the CE-QUAL-W2 model to simulate both water balance and sulfate concentrations in the lake. The SWAT model performed well in simulating daily flow in tributaries with E-NS>0.5 and |PBIAS|<25%, and reproduced the lake water level with a root mean square error of 0.35m for the study period from 1995 to 2014. The water temperature and sulfate concentrations simulated by CE-QUAL-W2 for the lake are in general agreement with the field observations. The model results show that the operation of the two outlets since August 2005 has lowered the lake level by 0.70m. Furthermore, the models show pumping water from the two outlets raises sulfate concentrations in the Sheyenne River from similar to 100 to >500mg/L.

Agricultural drainage ditches function to remove water quickly from farmed landscapes. Conventional ditch designs lack the form and function of natural stream systems and tend to be unstable and provide inadequate habitat. In October of 2009, 1.89km of a conventional drainage ditch in Mower County, Minnesota, was converted to an alternative system with a two-stage channel to investigate the improvements in water quality, stability, and habitat. Longitudinal surveys show a 12-fold increase in the pool-riffle formation. Cross-sectional surveys show an average increase in bankfull width of approximately 10% and may be associated to an increased frequency in large storm events. The average increase in bankfull depth was estimated as 18% but is largely influenced by pool formation. Rosgen Stability Analyses show the channel to be highly stable and the banks at a low risk of erosion. The average bankfull recurrence interval was estimated to be approximately 0.30years. Overall, the two-stage ditch design demonstrates an increase in fluvial stability, creating a more consistent sediment budget, and increasing the frequency of important instream habitat features, making this best management practice a viable option for addressing issues of erosion, sediment imbalance, and poor habitat in agricultural drainage systems.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				AUG	2017	53	4					886	902		10.1111/1752-1688.12541								WOS:000407043700011

Improving Predictive Models of In-Stream Phosphorus Concentration Based on Nationally-Available Spatial Data Coverages	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Spatial data are playing an increasingly important role in watershed science and management. Large investments have been made by government agencies to provide nationally-available spatial databases; however, their relevance and suitability for local watershed applications is largely unscrutinized. We investigated how goodness of fit and predictive accuracy of total phosphorus (TP) concentration models developed from nationally-available spatial data could be improved by including local watershed-specific data in the East Fork of the Little Miami River, Ohio, a 1,290km(2) watershed. We also determined whether a spatial stream network (SSN) modeling approach improved on multiple linear regression (nonspatial) models. Goodness of fit and predictive accuracy were highest for the SSN model that included local covariates, and lowest for the nonspatial model developed from national data. Septic systems and point source TP loads were significant covariates in the local models. These local data not only improved the models but enabled a more explicit interpretation of the processes affecting TP concentrations than more generic national covariates. The results suggest SSN modeling greatly improves prediction and should be applied when using national covariates. Including local covariates further increases the accuracy of TP predictions throughout the studied watershed; such variables should be included in future national databases, particularly the locations of septic systems.

Biofloc growth was induced in treatment tanks by periodic additions of a carbon source (glucose) to maintain a C:N ratio of 12:1. Control tanks (no aeration and no carbon addition) accommodated densities equivalent to 1 million fish/ha, while treatment tanks (biofloc) had densities of 1, 2, 4, and 8 million fish/ha. Fish were fed 4% body weight using a 32% protein commercial diet. There were no significant differences in condition of fish harvested from control and treatment densities (P<0.05). However, fish growth indicators such as final individual weight, feed conversion efficiency, and specific growth rate were significantly impaired at higher stocking densities. Survival rate was significantly lower in the 8 million/ha treatment (P<0.05). Results were indicative of possible production efficiencies of twofold higher in biofloc systems stocked at or below 4 million/ha compared with traditional ponds. Although biofloc systems maintained the desired water-quality parameters, biofloc microbial biomass did not seem to significantly enhance feed conversion and specific growth rates of fathead minnows.																	0893-8849	1749-7345				AUG	2017	48	4					592	601		10.1111/jwas.12387								WOS:000407075000007

Molasses was added to the biofloc ponds with the C/N ratio of 20: 1 based on the amount of daily feed. The floc volume in the biofloc group increased gradually (28.72 mL L-1) along with molasses addition, but the value in the relative control group remained at low levels (0.40-4.97 mL L-1) (P < 0.05). A total of 4.97% Bacillus, 4.20% Lactococcus, and 9.65% Nitrospira were determined in the biofloc water, and these values were significantly higher than that in the control water (P < 0.05). AmmoniaN, nitrite-N, nitrate-N, and total nitrogen concentrations in the biofloc water were significantly lower than that in the relative control group (P < 0.05). Potassium orthophosphate (PO4- -P) and total phosphorous (TP) concentrations increased consistently in both groups. The same-day value of PO4- -P concentration in the control group (6.37-12.96 mg L-1) was 1.5 higher than that of the biofloc group (4.66-7.99 mg L-1) from day 60 to day 90 (P < 0.05). Significant differences in TP concentration (P < 0.05) were noted between the control and biofloc groups from the 15th day to the 30th day and from the 60th day to the 90th day. The biofloc treatment resulted in a 10.62% higher survival rate, a 27.55% higher weight gain rate, and a 7.13% higher specific growth rate (P < 0.05). The findings of the present study demonstrated that BFT effectively promoted water quality, as well as growth and survival of M. rosenbergii, by regulating the inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				AUG	2017	25	4					1409	1425		10.1007/s10499-017-0124-3								WOS:000406350200003

Based on an estimate production of 350,000 MT in 2015, soft-shelled turtle culture industry in China values US$5.22 billion. In central China, overwinter in greenhouse is necessary for the juvenile turtle. The use of coal boiler to heat up the water to 30 degrees C is a common practice, however, brings in air pollution and CO2 emission too. A modern greenhouse equipped with ground source heat pump was built in 2010 and operated during 2014-2015 for 10 months to culture juvenile turtle. Besides heating system, the other innovative features such as skirt-shaped 3-D shelter, underwater feeding platform wok-shaped tank bottom with central drainage, and semi-homemade soft shell-shaped pellet together achieved excellent rearing performance, such as high turtle productivity of 23.7 kg m(-2), high survival 86%, low feed efficiency-feed conversion rate 1.26 and good water quality-dissolved oxygen > 5 mg L-1, and nitrite and ammonia concentration all time within safe range. Moreover, it is a lucrative business which brought in an estimated net profit of 76%.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				AUG	2017	25	4					1607	1624		10.1007/s10499-017-0137-y								WOS:000406350200018

This study evaluated the effects of strain, body weight, and gender on low-oxygen tolerance in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) exposed to a lethal concentration of dissolved oxygen (0.1 mg/L). The variation in low-oxygen tolerance, assessed as the time to loss of equilibrium, of channel catfish from six strains (103KS, Kansas, KMix, Marion, Marion S, and Thompson) was examined. Catfish (15-179 g) showed a large variation in resistant time to hypoxia, ranging from 8 to 104 min, and both strain and body weight contributed significantly to this variation (P < 0.05). 103KS and Marion S strains had higher low-oxygen tolerance than the other strains, while the Marion strain had the poorest low-oxygen tolerance (P < 0.05). In addition to genetic background, body weight positively correlated with low-oxygen tolerance, but there were no significant differences between female and male catfish in low-oxygen tolerance. The results indicate that genetic background and body weight are important factors that contribute variations in low-oxygen tolerance.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				AUG	2017	25	4					1645	1652		10.1007/s10499-017-0125-2								WOS:000406350200020

Submersed Aquatic Vegetation in Chesapeake Bay: Sentinel Species in a Changing World	BIOSCIENCE												Chesapeake Bay has undergone profound changes since European settlement. Increases in human and livestock populations, associated changes in land use, increases in nutrient loadings, shoreline armoring, and depletion of fish stocks have altered the important habitats within the Bay. Submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) is a critical foundational habitat and provides numerous benefits and services to society. In Chesapeake Bay, SAV species are also indicators of environmental change because of their sensitivity to water quality and shoreline development. As such, SAV has been deeply integrated into regional regulations and annual assessments of management outcomes, restoration efforts, the scientific literature, and popular media coverage. Even so, SAV in Chesapeake Bay faces many historical and emerging challenges. The future of Chesapeake Bay is indicated by and contingent on the success of SAV. Its persistence will require continued action, coupled with new practices, to promote a healthy and sustainable ecosystem.

Chronic effects of nitrogenous compounds on survival and growth of juvenile pink shrimp	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												In response to growing worldwide market demand, intensive shrimp farming, based on high feed, has developed over the past decade. The nitrogenous compounds mainly generated by animal excretion can cause deterioration of water quality and produce chronic or even acute toxicity to aquatic animals. As prevention, theoretical safety levels have been estimated from acute toxicity tests and they are traditionally used to prevent toxic effects on biota. However, are those concentrations of nitrogenous compounds really safe to Farfantepenaeus paulensis? The current study aimed to investigate the lethal and sublethal effects of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate to juvenile F. paulensis based on safety levels. Each experiment was performed independently in 100 L tanks for 30 days. The survival rates and wet weight of all shrimps were recorded every 10 days. The concentrations tested for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate were respectively: treatment "T-1/4", a quarter of the safety level (0.91 mg/L TA-N, 2.55 mg/L NO2--N and 80.7 mg/L NO3--N); treatment "T-SL", the safety level (3.65 mg/L TA-N, 10.2 mg/L NO2--N and 323 mg/L NO3--N); and treatment "T-2X", twice the safety level (7.30 mg/L TA-N, 20.4 mg/L NO2--N and 646 mg/L NO3--N). For F. paulensis cultivation, the real safety level for nitrite was estimated to be 2.55 mg/L NO2--N. For ammonia and nitrate, the recommended concentrations were < 0.91 mg/L TA-N corresponding to 0.045 mg/L NH3-N and < 80.7 mg/L NO3--N, respectively.

Aquatic life protection index of an urban river Bacanga basin in northern Brazil, Sao Luis - MA	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Bacanga River Basin faces environmental problems related to urbanization and discharge of untreated domestic sewage, which compromise its ecosystem health. Due to the small number of studies that assessed its water quality, the present study aimed to assess the current status of this ecosystem based on the aquatic life protection index. Samples were carried out every two months, in a total of six events, in six sites along the basin, where the water samples were collected to assess physicochemical parameters and calculate the trophic state index and the index of minimum parameters for the protection of aquatic communities. The data were also compared with values determined by the resolution National Environment Council - CONAMA 357/05. Our results reveal significant changes in the water quality of Bacanga River Basin. An increase in nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentration led it to eutrophication. The surfactant values were high and put in danger the aquatic biota. Dissolved oxygen rates were below the values allowed by the resolution in most sites sampled. The current water quality is terrible for the protection of aquatic life in 61.92% of the sites sampled.																	1519-6984	1678-4375				AUG	2017	77	3					602	615		10.1590/1519-6984.01016								WOS:000406311700024	27706393

Because sulfate in surface waters is reduced to sulfide by anaerobic bacteria in sediments and historical information indicated that 10 mg/L sulfate in Minnesota (USA) surface water reduced Z. palustris abundance, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency established 10 mg/L sulfate as a water quality criterion in 1973. A 21-d daily-renewal hydroponic study was conducted to evaluate sulfide toxicity to wild rice and the potential mitigation of sulfide toxicity by iron (Fe). The hydroponic design used hypoxic test media for seed and root exposure and aerobic headspace for the vegetative portion of the plant. Test concentrations were 0.3, 1.6, 3.1, 7.8, and 12.5 mg/L sulfide in test media with 0.8, 2.8, and 10.8 mg/L total Fe used to evaluate the impact of iron on sulfide toxicity. Visual assessments (i.e., no plants harvested) of seed activation, mesocotyl emergence, seedling survival, and phytoxicity were conducted 10 d after dark-phase exposure. Each treatment was also evaluated for time to 30% emergence (ET30), total plant biomass, root and shoot lengths, and signs of phytotoxicity at study conclusion (21 d). The results indicate that exposure of developing wild rice to sulfide at >= 3.1 mg sulfide/L in the presence of 0.8 mg/L Fe reduced mesocotyl emergence. Sulfide toxicity was mitigated by the addition of Fe at 2.8 mg/L and 10.8 mg/L relative to the control value of 0.8 mg Fe/L, demonstrating the importance of iron in mitigating sulfide toxicity to wild rice. Ultimately, determination of site-specific sulfate criteria taking into account factors that alter toxicity, including sediment Fe and organic carbon, are necessary.

In mountain catchments, acidification also leads to difficulties in water resource management. In 2010-2012, acid atmospheric deposition was analysed in a small forest catchment located in the upper plain of the Jizera Mountains (Czech Republic). Patch observations included monitoring of the canopy interception in two mature stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies) at elevations of 745 and 975 metres a.s.l., and twelve passive fog collectors situated along an elevation gradient between 862 and 994 metres a.s.l. In the studied area, fog (and low cloud) precipitation starts to affect the interception loss of the spruce canopy at elevations above 700 metres. However, fog drip was found to also rise with the canopy area. At the catchment scale, methods of spatial interpolation (ArcGIS 10.2) were used to approximate the aerial atmospheric deposition of water and acidic substances (sulphate, nitrate and ammonia). In the watersheds of two adjacent drinking water reservoirs, Josefuv Dul and Sous, the mean annual fog drip from the canopy was between 88 and 106 mm (i.e., 7-8% of the mean annual gross precipitation, or 10-12% of the mean annual runoff). Simultaneously, this load also deposited 658 kg km(-2) of sulphur and 216 kg km(-2) of nitrogen (i.e., 55% and 48% of the "open field" bulk amounts). Therefore, in headwater catchments stressed by acidification, the additional precipitation (measured under the canopy) can increase the water yield, but can also contribute to a decline in water quality, particularly in environments of low buffering capacity.

In the present study, LNA and HNA bacterial growth characteristics and effect of water physicochemical properties on these two subgroups were analyzed at the branch ends of a DWDS. The results showed that LNA bacteria were in the majority in tap water (67.2% +/- 16.6%) and the specific growth rate (0.469 +/- 0.022/d) was lower than that of HNA bacteria (1.116 +/- 0.195/d). LNA and HNA bacteria showed different responses to water physicochemical properties. The LNA bacteria dominated the microbial community under relatively high conductivity conditions, and the HNA bacteria were predominant in high turbidity or alkalescence environments. The LNA bacteria growth rate was positively correlated to the assimilable organic carbon concentration. In addition, multivariate ordination illustrated that there were clear variances in water quality among outlets, which could result from different pipeline distances and hydraulic conditions.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				AUG	2017	66	5					300	307		10.2166/aqua.2017.108								WOS:000406745900002						
J	Tomas, D; Curlin, M; Maric, AS				Tomas, Damir; Curlin, Mirjana; Maric, Ankica Senta			Assessing the surface water status in Pannonian ecoregion by the water quality index model	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The results of a 3-year monitoring study of surface water status in the Pannonian ecoregion for three different water types (4, 5B, 5C) are presented and evaluated statistically with descriptive and multivariable analyses. A modified water quality index (WQI(M)) for the Pannonian ecoregion is performed based on 7 indicators of water quality (pH, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand (BOD), total organic carbon (TOC), nitrate, total nitrogen and total phosphorus). The applied analysis indicates correlation between individual variables with particularly strong correlation between BOD and TOC. Two linear prediction models (multivariable linear regression model (MLR) and piecevise linear regression model (PLR)) of WQI for assesment of water status in the Pannonian ecoregion were developed. In these linear models, indicator BOD was replaced with indicator TOC. In predicting WQI for the three different water types in the Pannonian ecoregion, better results were obtained with a correlation coefficients R-(4)(2) = 0.88, R-(513)(2) = 0.76 and R-(5c)(2) = 0.79 by piecevise linear regression model.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2017	79						182	190		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.033								WOS:000406436000021						
J	Nelson, WG				Nelson, Walter G.			Development of an epiphyte indicator of nutrient enrichment: A critical evaluation of observational and experimental studies	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												An extensive review of the literature describing epiphytes on submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), especially seagrasses, was conducted in order to evaluate the evidence for response of epiphyte metrics to increased nutrients. Evidence from field observational studies, together with laboratory and field mesocosm experiments, was assembled from the literature and evaluated for a hypothesized positive response to nutrient addition. There was general consistency in the results to confirm that elevated nutrients tended to increase the load of epiphytes on the surface of SAV, in the absence of other limiting factors. In spite of multiple sources of uncontrolled variation, positive relationships of epiphyte load to nutrient concentration or load (either nitrogen or phosphorus) often were observed along strong anthropogenic or natural nutrient gradients in coastal regions. Such response patterns may only be evident for parts of the year. Results from both mesocosm and field experiments also generally support the increase of epiphytes with increased nutrients, although outcomes from field experiments tended to be more variable. Relatively few studies with nutrient addition in mesocosms have been done with tropical or subtropical species, and more such controlled experiments would be helpful. Experimental duration influenced results, with more positive responses of epiphytes to nutrients at shorter durations in mesocosm experiments versus more positive responses at longer durations in field experiments. In the field, response of epiphyte biomass to nutrient additions was independent of climate zone. Mesograzer activity was a critical covariate for epiphyte response under experimental nutrient elevation, but the epiphyte response was highly dependent on factors such as grazer identity and density, as well as nutrient and ambient light levels. The balance of evidence suggests that epiphytes on SAV will be a useful indicator of persistent nutrient enhancement in many situations. Careful selection of appropriate temporal and spatial constraints for data collection, and concurrent evaluation of confounding factors will help increase the signal to noise ratio for this indicator.																	1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2017	79						207	227		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.04.034								WOS:000406436000024						
J	Peterson, EE; Cunningham, SA; Thomas, M; Collings, S; Bonnett, GD; Harch, B				Peterson, Erin E.; Cunningham, Saul A.; Thomas, Mark; Collings, Simon; Bonnett, Graham D.; Harch, Bronwyn			An assessment framework for measuring agroecosystem health	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												There are inherent social, environmental, and economic trade-offs in agricultural systems, which by definition have been altered from their natural state by humans for food and fibre production. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impacts of agriculture, and with the increasing influence of social media, agribusinesses and industries can be held accountable for their actions in the public domain. Thus, environmental sustainability reporting is increasingly being viewed as a cost of doing business in agriculture. There are a number of approaches used to measure agroecosystem health (AEH) around the world, but they are generally designed to make comparisons at coarse spatial scales (i.e. nations) or report on specific management actions implemented at the local scale (i.e. farm, catchment, or sub-region). Here we present a simple, yet scientifically robust assessment framework that can be used to benchmark and monitor the specific impacts of agricultural management practices on the environment. The general principles are drawn from environmental monitoring and experiences gained in environmental assessments that are not necessarily agriculturally focussed. However, many commonly used environmental indicators are not suitable for AEH assessment because they do not explicitly link environmental outcomes to management actions; or they fail to separate specific agricultural impacts from broader cumulative impacts resulting from other industries or land uses. We recommend using a combination of diagnostic, outcome-based indicators, in addition to practice- and product-based measures to communicate efforts to improve agroecosystem health outcomes. The framework presented here enables assessments at local scales, but can be aggregated or disaggregated to report at finer or coarser scales. This flexibility ensures that the assessment is relevant to the proponent and stakeholders, while also providing a way to make comparisons between producers, industries, or regions as part of an adaptive monitoring and assessment framework. This also opens the door for industry-based AEH monitoring program to provide, or make use of information from government-funded environmental monitoring programs, with benefits to both.

The applied database consisted of measurements from seven different sampling sites in the protected area over the study period 2007-2008. The cover percentage of the exotic fern was modelled based on various wetland characteristics. The predictive performances of the both data-driven methods were assessed based on the percentage of Correctly Classified Instances and Cohen's kappa statistics. The results of the Paired Student's t-test (p < 0.01) showed that SVMs outperformed the CTs and thus yielded more reliable prediction than the CTs. All data mining and multivariate techniques showed that both physical-habitat and water quality variables (in particular some nutrients) might affect the habitat requirements of A. filiculoides in the wetland.

A Novel Formulation for Designing a Monitoring Strategy: Application to the Design of a River Quality Monitoring System	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT												In this work, we propose a technique to automatically optimize the monitoring of any distributed indicator (concentration of a substance along a river, blood pressure of a patient over time, etc.) for which a reliable estimate is previously available. From a mathematical point of view, the problem is based on obtaining a reliable estimate of the chosen indicator (e.g., by numerical simulation), and then solving a multi-objective optimization problem (with mixed real and integer variables) whose solution must provide an efficient and satisfactory monitoring strategy. As an illustrative case, we show the steps to follow in order to implement that strategy when designing a system for monitoring water quality in a river. Finally, we present and analyze the results when applying the proposed technique to study a real case in the Neuse River (North Carolina, USA).

The goal of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of nutrient transformation processes on surface water quality, especially rivers in cold regions where ice-covered conditions persist for a substantial part of the year. We established a sensitivity analysis framework for water quality modelling and monitoring of rivers in cold regions using the Water Quality Analysis Program WASP7. The lower South Saskatchewan River in the interior of western Canada, from the Gardiner Dam at Lake Diefenbaker to the confluence of the North and South Saskatchewan rivers, is used as a test case for this purpose. The study reveals that parameter sensitivities differ between ice-covered and ice-free periods and biological model parameters related to nutrient-phytoplankton dynamics can still be sensitive during the ice-covered season. For example, sediment oxygen demand is an important parameter during the ice-on period, whereas parameters related to nitrification are more sensitive in the ice-off period. These results provide insight into important water quality monitoring aspects in cold regions during different seasons.																	1420-2026	1573-2967				AUG	2017	22	4					291	307		10.1007/s10666-016-9541-3								WOS:000406289700002

Evaluation of bank filtration as a pretreatment method for the provision of hygienically safe drinking water in Norway: results from monitoring at two full-scale sites	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Two case studies were carried out in central Norway in order to assess the performance of bank filtration systems in cold-climate fluvial aquifers relying on recharge from humic-rich surface waters with moderate microbial contamination. Three municipal wells and two surface-water sources at operative bank filtration systems were monitored for naturally occurring bacteriophages, fecal indicators, natural organic matter (NOM) and physico-chemical water quality parameters during a 4-month period. Aquifer passage effectively reduced the microorganism and NOM concentrations at both study sites. Bacteriophages were detected in 13 of 16 (81%) surface-water samples and in 4 of 24 (17%) well-water samples, and underwent 3 +/- 0.3 log(10) reduction after 50-80-m filtration and 20-30 days of subsurface passage. NOM reductions (color: 74-97%; dissolved organic carbon: 54-80%; very hydrophobic acids: 70%) were similar to those achieved by conventional water-treatment processes and no further treatment was needed. Both groundwater dilution and sediment filtration contributed to the hygienic water quality improvements, but sediment filtration appeared to be the most important process with regard to microbial and NOM reductions. A strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats analysis showed that bank filtration technology has a high potential as a pretreatment method for the provision of hygienically safe drinking water in Norway.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2017	25	5					1257	1269		10.1007/s10040-017-1576-2								WOS:000406286200005

Interpreting temporal variations in river response functions: an example from the Arkansas River, Kansas, USA	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater/surface-water interactions can play an important role in management of water quality and quantity, but the temporal and spatial variability of these interactions makes them difficult to incorporate into conceptual models. There are simple methods for identifying the presence of groundwater/surface-water interactions; however, identifying flow mechanisms and pathways can be challenging. More complex methods are available to better identify these mechanisms and pathways but are often too time consuming or costly. In this work, a simple method for interpreting and identifying flow mechanisms and sources using temporal variations of river response functions is presented. This approach is demonstrated using observations from two sites along the Arkansas River in Kansas, USA. A change in flow mechanisms between the rising and falling limbs of river hydrographs was identified, along with a second surface-water source to the aquifer, a finding that was validated with stable isotope analyses.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2017	25	5					1271	1282		10.1007/s10040-017-1545-9								WOS:000406286200006

The SBR method is validated against synthetic data competitively with other conventional robust and non-robust methods. From the results, it is verified that the estimation accuracies of the SBR method are consistent and superior to those of other methods, and the uncertainties are reasonably estimated; the others have no uncertainty analysis option. To validate further, actual groundwater data are employed and analyzed comparatively with Gaussian process regression (GPR). For all cases, the trend and the associated uncertainties are reasonably estimated by both SBR and GPR regardless of Gaussian or non-Gaussian skewed data. However, it is expected that GPR has a limitation in applications to severely corrupted data by outliers owing to its non-robustness. From the implementations, it is determined that the SBR method has the potential to be further developed as an effective tool of anomaly detection or outlier identification in groundwater state data such as the groundwater level and contaminant concentration.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2017	25	5					1491	1500		10.1007/s10040-017-1561-9								WOS:000406286200019

In this study, we used three biomanipulation approaches-including introducing filter-feeding bivalves, stocking planktivorous fish, replanting submerged macrophytes-as well as an approach that combined all three of these methods in order to investigate their effects on water quality and plankton communities within simulation experiment systems. The experimental results showed that only stocking filter-feeding bivalves or fish could not significantly control the total algal biomass and water nutrient concentrations compared to those of the controls. The cladoceran biomasses were reduced under the treatments of stocking filter-feeding bivalves or fish. However, replanting macrophytes and a combined biological restoration approach could significantly reduce the algal biomass and the nutrient content, and both of these methods increased cladoceran biomass. The results of factor analysis of ten environmental parameters suggested that a combined biological restoration treatment was the most effective at controlling the algal biomass and reducing the nutrient content. In conclusion, combination of biological restoration measures was the best treatment out of the three treatments that were tested, and we suggest that more whole-lake scale experiments are needed. Additionally, designing a combined approach should not be a simple superposition of individual measures, but the measures should be complementary to each other.																	1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2017	18	3					301	313		10.1007/s10201-016-0507-6								WOS:000406291700004

Balancing lake ecological condition and agriculture irrigation needs in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The Mississippi Alluvial Valley includes hundreds of floodplain lakes that support unique fish assemblages and high biodiversity. Irrigation practices in the valley have lowered the water table, increasing the cost of pumping water, and necessitating the use of floodplain lakes as a source of water for irrigation. This development has prompted the need to regulate water withdrawals to protect aquatic resources, but it is unknown how much water can be withdrawn from lakes before ecological integrity is compromised. To estimate withdrawal limits, we examined descriptors of lake water quality (i.e., total nitrogen, total phosphorus, turbidity, Secchi visibility, chlorophyll-a) and fish assemblages (species richness, diversity, composition) relative to maximum depth in 59 floodplain lakes. Change-point regression analysis was applied to identify critical depths at which the relationships between depth and lake descriptors exhibited a rapid shift in slope, suggesting possible thresholds. All our water quality and fish assemblage descriptors showed rapid changes relative to depth near 1.2-2.0 m maximum depth. This threshold span may help inform regulatory decisions about water withdrawal limits. Alternatives to explain the triggers of the observed threshold span are considered.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				AUG 1	2017	246						354	360		10.1016/j.agee.2017.06.022								WOS:000405973000036						
J	Safa, M; Soltani-Mohammadi, S; Kurdi, M				Safa, Mohammad; Soltani-Mohammadi, Saeed; Kurdi, Milad			Optimal design of additional sampling pattern for drinking-water quality control	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												A crucial step in complementary studies of the water quality determination is to design the additional sampling pattern or, in other words, to determine the number and location of the additional samples. Since location and number of samples highly affect decisions' uncertainties, and because sampling process is quite costly and time-consuming, optimization of the sampling pattern will enhance the efficiency and productivity. Solution of such an optimization problem requires defining an objective function and constraints. There exist many previous studies regarding locating additional samples in other environmental problems wherein the objective function is defined as the minimization of the kriging variance (based on the problem nature), but the point is that kriging variance is not sensitive to local variability. Since manner and extent of small-scale variations are both important and necessary in water quality studies, it is required to resolve this shortcoming of the traditional objective function. Solution is to make use of the combined variance consisting of kriging and local variances. In this study, the applicability and efficiency of the minimization of combined variance as the objective function of the additional sampling was adopted and proved for a salt marsh (east of Iran) on the basis of a simulated annealing-based algorithm. It was shown, practically, that the locational distribution of additional sampling points is quite logical and more compatible with experts' proposed methods using this objective function (compared to the traditional one).

These external nutrient load reductions interact with retention and removal processes (ecosystem services) in coastal and marine waters. Beside sedimentation, denitrification is the most important regulation ecosystem service provided by the sea, because it removes nitrogen (N) to the atmosphere and controls eutrophication. Denitrification is a spatially and temporally highly variable process and largely depends on temperature and N concentrations in the water. Climate change will have strong effects on denitrification. Increasing temperatures favour denitrification and changes in precipitation and discharge will alter the availability of N, with strong differences between river basins. We combine a 3D-ecosystem model of the Baltic Sea with economic marginal cost functions for three major Baltic river basins: Odra, Vistula and Neva. Objective is to calculate the monetary consequences of climate change (scenario A1B) for the implementation of water quality objectives, taking into account both, spatial changes in N loads and denitrification. In all regions over 90% of the entering N loads are subject to denitrification mainly in coastal waters. For the climate change scenario (A1B), our approach suggests reduced riverine N-loads of 7690 t/a (Odra), 6410 t/a (Vistula) and increased loads of 3200 t/a for the Neva. At the same time our model results suggest an increased denitrification of N-loads by 9.1% (Odra) and 9.9% (Neva) and minor changes with respect to the Vistula loads. In combination, in all three regions climate change helps to reach policy targets (lower N concentrations in the sea) at lower costs. The monetary benefit of load reduction measures that do not have to be implemented because of climate change are 11,270 million (sic)/a (Odra), 2000 million (sic)/a (Vistula) and 92 million (sic)/a (Neva). The valuations strongly depend on the assumed climate change scenario and the economic approach, but indicate that climate change effects differ much between river basins and should be taken into account in nutrient load reduction management plans.

Using both revealed and stated preference approaches, it is estimated that the park provides recreational benefits of US$35 per person for on-site respondents and US$14 for off-site respondents per visit to the park. Given that over one million people visit the lake and its parks every year, based on different scenarios, the annual estimated amenity value of the lake ranges from INR1.76bn (US$29m) to INR3.48bn (US$58m). Thus it is recommended that park authorities double the access fee to the park from the current INR10 (US$0.16). With this increase, the government can potentially earn US$0.36-1.48m in revenues per year, which will make it possible to improve the quality of the lake and its surroundings.																	1355-770X	1469-4395				AUG	2017	22	4					447	469		10.1017/S1355770X17000183								WOS:000405814900005

Potential distribution of endangered Mexican golden trout (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) in the Rio Sinaloa and Rio Culiacan basins (Sierra Madre Occidental) based on landscape characterization and species distribution models	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The Mexican Golden Trout (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) is a threatened native species inhabiting three river basins in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Despite some efforts from science groups to obtain information about this trout, the Rio Sinaloa and Rio Culiacan basins, to the south, remain the least studied area, compared to the Rio Fuerte basin. To overcome this gap, a survey (2014 to 2015) was undertaken to obtain new records and confirm the presence for historic records in both watersheds. After filtering records for this species, eighteen locations were used to model potential distribution, using the GARP and MaxEnt, including landscape characterization based on hydrologic analysis and satellite imagery classification. Coincidence between models was >85% for a potential distribution area of 4300 km(2), defined by six bioclimatic and physiographic variables, with the hydrologic network covering 3000 km. To avoid overestimation, the final distribution area included only the 100 m fringe surrounding the drainage network and its associated landscape features. Jackknife resampling was used to validate both the models, successfully predicting more than 80% of the locations (p < 0.001). The estimated area covers 275 km2, mainly defined by second- and third-order streams, at altitudes >2000 m, high water quality (transparent, dissolved oxygen >5 mg L-1; temperature < 26 degrees C), and was part of amatrix of undisturbed forests. This study provides new findings about this endangered species and new elements for designing appropriate monitoring programs supporting trout conservation and management.

J	Vatsos, IN				Vatsos, I. N.			Standardizing the microbiota of fish used in research	LABORATORY ANIMALS												Little attention has been paid to the effects of fish microbiotas on the reproducibility and comparability of fish studies so far. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors, such as water quality, environmental microbial populations, diet, host genetic profile, gender, age and stress status, affect fish microbiotas and create significant inter- and intra-species variations. Fish microbiotas play critical roles in many key aspects of host physiology, such as protection against pathogens, digestion and development of the digestive tract and the local immune system. Thus, greater effort should be invested in standardizing the microbiological profiles of research fish. In this context, issues requiring consideration include the establishment of isogenic and isobiotic fish lines, the standardization of rearing conditions and the development of appropriate tests to adequately describe microbial populations. There are many challenges involved in each of these issues, and the research community must decide which aspects should be standardized for each species and each type of research. For all studies in which microbiota is expected to exert an influence, thorough reporting is of paramount importance. Every step towards standardization increases study quality and simultaneously contributes to reducing the number of fish used in research, which is a legal and ethical obligation.

Pollutant loading from low-density residential neighborhoods in California	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This paper presents a comparison of pollutant load estimations for runoff from two geographically distinct residential suburban neighborhoods in northern and southern California. The two neighborhoods represent a single urban land use type: low-density residential in small catchments (<0.3 km(2)) under differing regional climates and irrigation practices. Pollutant loads of pesticides, nutrients, and drinking water constituents of concern are estimated for both storm and non-storm runoff. From continuous flow monitoring, it was found that a daily cycle of persistent runoff that peaks mid-morning occurs at both sites. These load estimations indicate that many residential neighborhoods in California produce significant non-storm pollutant loads year-round. Results suggest that non-storm flow accounted for 47-69% of total annual runoff and significantly contributed to annual loading rates of most nutrients and pesticides at both sites. At the Southern California site, annual non-storm loads are 1.2-10 times higher than storm loads of all conventional constituents and nutrients with one exception (total suspended solids). At the Northern California site, annual storm loads range from 51 to 76% of total loads for all conventional constituents and nutrients with one exception (total dissolved solids). Non-storm yields of pesticides at the Southern California site range from 1.3-65 times higher than those at the Northern California site. The disparity in estimated pollutant loads between the two sites indicates large potential variation from site-to-site within the state and suggests neighborhoods in drier and milder climates may produce significantly larger non-storm loads due to persistent dry season runoff and year-round pest control.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							386	10.1007/s10661-017-6104-2								WOS:000405440300025	28689320

Chemical analysis of the groundwater shows the cations is in the order of Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ while for anions it is HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3-. The F- concentration was found to vary from 0.01 to 18 mg/L in the pre-monsoon and 0.023 to 19 mg/L in post-monsoon period. 86% of samples show low F- content (<0.60 mg/L) whereas, 8% exhibit elevated concentration of F- (> 1.2 mg/L) mainly in the central and north-central parts of the study area at a depth of 46 to 98 m. The prime water type is CaHCO3 succeeded by F--rich NaHCO3 and NaCl waters. The suitability analysis reveals that the water at about 81% of the sampling sites is unsuitable for drinking and at 16% of sites unsuitable for irrigation. The alkaline nature of the water and/or elevated concentration of Fe, Mn and F- make the water unsuitable for potable purposes while the high F- and Na+ contents delimit the groundwater for irrigation uses. Multivariate statistical analysis suggests that chemical weathering along with ion exchange is the key process, responsible for mobilization of fluoride in groundwater of the study area.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							369	10.1007/s10661-017-6041-0								WOS:000405440300001	28676931

This degradation has led to concerns for the populations of the major cities of Nepal, including those of the Kathmandu Valley. The deterioration of the rivers in the valley is directly linked to the prevalence of poor sanitary conditions, as well as the presence of industries that discharge their effluents into the river. This study aims to investigate the water quality aspect for the aquatic ecosystems and recreation of the major rivers in the Kathmandu Valley using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment water quality index (CCME WQI). Ten physicochemical parameters were used to determine the CCME WQI at 20 different sampling locations. Analysis of the data indicated that the water quality in rural areas ranges from excellent to good, whereas in denser settlements and core urban areas, the water quality is poor. The study results are expected to provide policy-makers with valuable information related to the use of river water by local people in the study area.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2017	189	8							382	10.1007/s10661-017-6090-4								WOS:000405440300017	28685372					
J	Qian, C; Chen, W; Li, WH; Yu, HQ				Qian, Chen; Chen, Wei; Li, Wei-Hua; Yu, Han-Qing			A chemometric analysis on the fluorescent dissolved organic matter in a full-scale sequencing batch reactor for municipal wastewater treatment	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												Rapid monitoring of water quality is crucial to the operation of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) in combination with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) has been used as a powerful tool for the characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in WWTPs. However, a recent work has revealed the drawback of PARAFAC analysis, i.e., overestimating the component number. A novel method, parallel factor framework-clustering analysis (PFFCA), has been developed in our earlier work to resolve this drawback of PARAFAC. In the present work, both PARAFAC and PFFCA were used to analyze the EEMs of water samples from a full-scale WWTP from a practical application point of view. The component number and goodness-offit from these two methods were compared and the relationship between the relative score change of component and the actual concentration was investigated to evaluate the estimation error introduced by both methods. PFFCA score and actual concentration exhibited a higher correlation coefficient (R-2 - 0.870) compared with PARAFAC (R-2 < 0.771), indicating that PFFCA provided a more accurate relative change estimation than PARAFAC. The results suggest that use of PARAFAC may cause confusion in selecting the component number, while EEM-PFFCA is a more reliable alternative approach for monitoring water quality in WWTPs.

J	Radcliffe, JC; Page, D; Naumann, B; Dillon, P				Radcliffe, John C.; Page, Declan; Naumann, Bruce; Dillon, Peter			Fifty Years of Water Sensitive Urban Design, Salisbury, South Australia	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												Australia has developed extensive policies and guidelines for the management of its water. The City of Salisbury, located within metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia, developed rapidly through urbanisation from the 1970s. Water sensitive urban design principles were adopted to maximise the use of the increased run-off generated by urbanisation and ameliorate flood risk. Managed aquifer recharge was introduced for storing remediated low-salinity stormwater by aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) in a brackish aquifer for subsequent irrigation. This paper outlines how a municipal government has progressively adopted principles of Water Sensitive Urban Design during its development within a framework of evolving national water policies. Salisbury's success with stormwater harvesting led to the formation of a pioneering water business that includes linking projects from nine sites to provide a non-potable supply of 5 x 10(6) m(3) . year (-1). These installations hosted a number of applied research projects addressing well configuration, water quality, reliability and economics and facilitated the evaluation of its system as a potential potable water source. The evaluation showed that while untreated stormwater contained contaminants, subsurface storage and end-use controls were sufficient to make recovered water safe for public open space irrigation, and with chlorination, acceptable for third pipe supplies. Drinking water quality could be achieved by adding microfiltration, disinfection with UV and chlorination. The costs that would need to be expended to achieve drinking water safety standards were found to be considerably less than the cost of establishing dual pipe distribution systems. The full cost of supply was determined to be AUD$1.57 m (-3) for non-potable water for public open space irrigation, much cheaper than mains water, AUD $3.45 m (-3) at that time. Producing and storing potable water was found to cost AUD$1.96 to $2.24 m (-3).

J	Zhang, J; Wei, Z; Jia, HF; Huang, X				Zhang, Jiao; Wei, Zhen; Jia, Haifeng; Huang, Xia			Factors influencing water quality indices in a typical urban river originated with reclaimed water	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												The water quality in a typical urban river segment originated with reclaimed water in Beijing was monitored for two years to investigate the evolution of water quality along the river, and statistical analysis was applied to determine factors influencing water quality of such river recharged by reclaimed water. It was found that no significant change in pollutant concentrations (including COD, NH4 +-N, TN and TP) was observed during this time, and their average values were close to those of the original reclaimed water. However, turbidity and algal contents fluctuated temporally in the direction of river flow. Statistical analysis showed that turbidity was strongly positively correlated with algal contents for flow rate < 0.1 m . s (-1), whereas it was strongly positively correlated with both algal contents and TOC for flow rate > 0.1 m . s (-1). It was observed that diatom was the absolute predominant phyla with Melosira as the major species. In terms of algal bloom control, the specific growth rate of algae was strongly correlated to temperature, and was influenced by flow rate as well. Compared with two other rivers originated with reclaimed water and one originated with natural water, the ShannonWiener index in the objective river was the lowest, with values between 0.7 and 1.6, indicating a high risk for algal bloom. Statistics showed that Shannon-Wiener index was strongly negatively correlated to nutrient salts and cations.

Especially, the labile and bioaccessible fractions of heavy metal(loid) s in the sediments are posing serious risks to the biota and the overlaying water quality. This study aimed at developing a potentialmethod tomanage the activity of the labile fractions of heavy metal(loid) s in surface sediments. Materials and methods This study assessed the feasibility of adding iron powder, a low-cost industrial by-product, to sediments containing high levels of Pb, As, and Cd to adsorb labile fractions of heavy metal(loid) s onto the sorbent surfaces and to retrieve the heavy metal(loid) laden powders by applying external magnetic field. In addition, the redistribution of Pb, Cd, and As in different sediment fractions, the dissolved fraction and the sorbent-adsorbed fraction, was also investigated and characterized. Results and discussion The results indicate that the bioactive labile fractions (exchangeable and carbonate-bound fractions) of heavy metal(loid) s are prone to concentrating onto iron powders and can be selectively removed from the sediments by magnetic retrieval. In addition, iron addition induces conversion of labile fractions of heavy metal(loid) s into more stabilized fractions. Conclusions Overall, the process can effectively minimize the activity of labile fractions of heavy metal(loid) s in surface sediments.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				AUG	2017	17	8					2202	2213		10.1007/s11368-017-1670-z								WOS:000405581200018

A highly cause of heavy metal toxicity in the aquatic environments is considered a serious issue that required full attention to understand in order to solve it. Heavy metal accumulation is a vital parameter for studying the water quality. Therefore, there is a need to develop an accurate prediction model for heavy metal accumulation. Recently, the artificial neural networks have been examined for similar prediction applications and showed great potential to tackle and detect its nonlinearity behavior. In this paper, radial basis function neural network algorithm has been utilized to investigate and mimic the relationship of heavy metals with the climatic and pollution conditions in lake water bodies. Thus, the present study was implemented in different climatic conditions (tropical "Malaysia'' and arid "Libya'') as well as polluted and non-polluted lakes. Weekly records of physiochemical parameters data (e.g., pH, EC, WT, DO, TDS, TSS, CL, NO3, PO4 and SO4) and climatological parameters (e.g., air temperature, humidity and rainfall) were utilized as an input data for the modeling, whereas the heavy metal concentration was the output of the model. Three different scenarios for modeling the input architecture considering the climate, pollution or both have been investigated. In general, results obtained from all the scenarios are positively encouraging with high-performance accuracy. Furthermore, the results showed that an isolated model for each condition achieves a better prediction accuracy level rather than developing one general model for all conditions.

However, the limited investigations on bacteriophage restrict their further application. In this study, a novel and highly efficient method was developed for isolating bacteriophage from water based on the electropositive silica gel particles (ESPs) method. To optimize the ESPs method, we evaluated the eluent type, flow rate, pH, temperature, and inoculation concentration of bacteriophage using bacteriophage f2. The quantitative detection reported that the recovery of the ESPs method reached over 90%. The qualitative detection demonstrated that the ESPs method effectively isolated 70% of extremely low-concentration bacteriophage (10(0) PFU/100 L). Based on the host bacteria composed of 33 standard strains and 10 isolated strains, the bacteriophages in 18 water samples collected from the three sites in the Tianjin Haihe River Basin were isolated by the ESPs and traditional methods. Results showed that the ESPs method was significantly superior to the traditional method. The ESPs method isolated 32 strains of bacteriophage, whereas the traditional method isolated 15 strains. The sample isolation efficiency and bacteriophage isolation efficiency of the ESPs method were 3.28 and 2.13 times higher than those of the traditional method. The developed ESPs method was characterized by high isolation efficiency, efficient handling of large water sample size and low requirement on water quality.																	0167-7012	1872-8359				AUG	2017	139						143	149		10.1016/j.mimet.2017.05.019								WOS:000405154900025	28577899

Production of pellets has garnered much attention as US exports have grown from negligible amounts in the early 2000s to 4.6 million metric tonnes in 2015. Currently, 98% of these pellet exports are shipped to Europe to displace coal in power plants. We ask, 'How is the production of wood pellets in the SE USA affecting forest systems and the ecosystem services they provide?' To address this question, we review current forest conditions and the status of the wood products industry, how pellet production affects ecosystem services and biodiversity, and what methods are in place to monitor changes and protect vulnerable systems. Scientific studies provide evidence that wood pellets in the SE USA are a fraction of total forestry operations and can be produced while maintaining or improving forest ecosystem services. Ecosystem services are protected by the requirement to utilize loggers trained to apply scientifically based best management practices in planning and implementing harvest for the export market. Bioenergy markets supplement incomes to private rural landholders and provide an incentive for forest management practices that simultaneously benefit water quality and wildlife and reduce risk of fire and insect outbreaks. Bioenergy also increases the value of forest land to landowners, thereby decreasing likelihood of conversion to nonforest uses. Monitoring and evaluation are essential to verify that regulations and good practices are achieving goals and to enable timely responses if problems arise. Conducting rigorous research to understand how conditions change in response to management choices requires baseline data, monitoring, and appropriate reference scenarios. Long-term monitoring data on forest conditions should be publicly accessible and utilized to inform adaptive management.

Four treatments were used: BFT (biofloc system without feed and no addition of diatoms); BFT-F (biofloc system with feed and no addition of diatoms); BFT-D (biofloc system with the addition of diatoms and no feed); and BFT-FD (biofloc system with the addition of feed and diatoms), all in triplicate. The shrimp (16 +/- 0.02mg) were stocked at 2500 postlarvaem(-3) and fed a commercial feed. Diatoms were added on the 1st, 5th, 10th and 15th day at a density of 5x10(4) cellsmL(-1) for each species. No significant differences (P>0.05) between treatments were observed for gross primary production, net ecosystem production and water column respiration rate. However, significant differences (P<0.05) were observed for nitrite, orthophosphate, alkalinity, final weight, weight gain, yield, feed conversion ratio (FCR), phytoplankton and cyanobacteria composition. The BFT-FD treatment had better performance parameters for final weight (270mg), weight gain (254mg), yield (0.67 Kgm(-3)) and FCR (0.61), indicating the benefits of the diatoms C.calcitrans, Navicula sp. and P.tricornutum for decreasing cyanobacteria and improving growth of L.vannamei postlarvae reared in biofloc systems.					marinho, yllana/0000-0002-1790-1337												1355-557X	1365-2109				AUG	2017	48	8					4155	4164		10.1111/are.13235								WOS:000404982300014

Feeding costs represent a large portion of total operating costs in the aquaculture industry. In this context, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of food restriction on the reproductive performance of redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus. Females at the onset of sexual maturity were stocked with males and were fed daily a formulated diet at 1.5% (control group) and 0.5% (restricted group) of their mean weight. The experimental period lasted 105days. The percentage of ovigerous females and broods successfully hatched tended to be higher in restricted females compared with control females, but egg volume and weight did not differ between both experimental groups. However, the lipid concentration of rematuring ovaries was lower in restricted females than control females, suggesting that food restriction affects the amount of reserves transferred to the ovaries during vitellogenesis. The nutritional state of females was independent of the amount of food provided, as reflected by similar growth parameters and biochemical composition of the hepatopancreas in control and restricted females. Based on these results, we conclude that it is possible to reduce the feeding rate of C. quadricarinatus females to one-third of its original value without affecting their reproductive performance and somatic growth, at least for a 105-day period. This finding provides a useful tool for commercial producers to decrease production costs and improve water quality in culture systems.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				AUG	2017	48	8					4228	4237		10.1111/are.13244								WOS:000404982300021						
J	Sa, MVDE; Boyd, CE				do Carmo E Sa, Marcelo Vinicius; Boyd, Claude E.			Variability in the solubility of agricultural limestone from different sources and its pertinence for aquaculture	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												Samples of agricultural limestone were obtained from quarries in the USA as follows: Talking Rock, GA; Whitestone, GA; Austinville, VA; Bonham, TX; and Thomasville, PA, referred as GA-1, GA-2, VA, TX and PA respectively. The limestone products were tested initially for non-equilibrium pH, concentrations of calcium and magnesium, neutralizing value (NV) and fineness rate. Laboratory solubility test of the products was conducted in which pH, specific conductance (SC), total alkalinity (TA), total and calcium hardness were measured weekly for 9weeks. It was found that the agricultural limestone samples had comparable chemical compositions, that is NV (97-108%), Ca (19.8-32.1%), Mg (3.2-12.2%), pH of slurry (8.1-9.7), but somewhat different solubilities in water. Total alkalinity concentrations at equilibrium ranged from 30 to 60mgL(-1). It was possible to quickly estimate the relative solubility of different agricultural limestone samples by comparing their specific conductance under standardized conditions (2.0g samples w/0.15-0.25mm fineness; 3.5L distilled water; 24h). This procedure might be helpful in achieving better results when liming aquaculture ponds, that is choosing the agricultural limestones with the highest solubilities in water.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				AUG	2017	48	8					4292	4299		10.1111/are.13250								WOS:000404982300027

Fingerlings with an average body weight 0.98 +/- 0.06g were stocked in triplicate at different stocking densities of 200 (SD1), 250 (SD2), 300 (SD3) and 350 (SD4)m(-3) in biofloc-based treatments and 150 (C)m(-3) in control (clear water). Biofloc-based units (SD1 and SD2) obtained significantly better (P<0.05) growth performances at the end of the experimental period. Mean body weight of fish in biofloc-based units showed a decreasing trend with increase in stocking density with 100% survival in all units including control. The stress parameters were significantly lower in biofloc-based rearing units especially in treatments SD1 and SD2 as compared to the control. The fish from the biofloc-based units (SD1 and SD2) possessed significantly (P<0.05) higher immune status as compared to control and other biofloc treatments in terms of respiratory burst, serum lysozyme and myeloperoxidase activity. Relative survival percentages were significantly better in biofloc treatments with highest in SD1 and SD2 (83.33%) after challenge study. GIFT strain of Tilapia at higher stocking densities 200-250nosm(-3) can be taken as optimum stocking density whereas higher stocking densities up to 350nosm(-3) can be reared in the biofloc systems without compromising the growth and immunity.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				AUG	2017	48	8					4346	4355		10.1111/are.13256								WOS:000404982300032

Two treatments were designed: T-1=culture with natural sunlight and T-2=culture in darkness. After 28days, in both treatments, the final weight of shrimp was over 0.6g with a specific growth rate over 7.4% d(-1), and a survival rate over 70%. In both treatments, Vibrio sp. concentration presented low values (culture with natural sunlight=0.1 to 9.9x10(2) CFU mL(-1), culture in darkness=0.4 to 11.7x10(2) CFU mL(-1)) and Bacillus sp. had high values (culture with natural sunlight=0.7 to 66.0x10(4) CFU mL(-1), culture in darkness=0.7 to 65.8x10(4) CFU mL(-1)). All water quality parameters remained within the ranges suitable for shrimp culture, except for alkalinity during the first stage of the study. Although in some sampling periods some significant differences were found in bacterial counts and water quality parameters, shrimp productive performance under culture with biofloc at low salinity was not affected significantly by light limitation.
