Environmental Benefits and Cost Considerations	SUSTAINABLE SYNERGIES FROM BUILDINGS TO THE URBAN SCALE	Procedia Environmental Sciences				International Conference on Sustainable Synergies from Buildings to the Urban Scale (SBE)	OCT 16-19, 2016	Thessaloniki, GREECE	Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Fac Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Lab Building Construct & Building Phys, Tech Chamber Greece				Water resources management is the scientific task of matching water supply to water demand. Indicators show that many regions in the European area already suffer from water stress conditions. Meeting domestic water demand is a top priority and may require water transport to urban centers from rather long distances and from different hydrologic basins, in addition to its costly and energy demanding treatment. The EU recognizes the need and the importance of sustainability and more efficient water management through the Water Framework Directive 2000/60. A significant percentage of domestic water is consumed for secondary uses, which do not require potable water quality. In this paper we study the substitution of potable water by ground water that could be pumped from a rather shallow aquifer, in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, in secondary uses (building cleaning, toilet flushing) and irrigation. It is proved that this solution, which serves the goals of the Water Framework Directive, is economically viable.

To date, there is limited information about the diversity of this genus from Thailand. In this study, Thai Planktothricoides strains were isolated from fish ponds and reservoirs in North, Northeast and Central regions for morphological examination, phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA, rbcLX and MIB synthase genes as well as GC/MS/MS analyses. The morphological results and the 16S rRNA and rbcLX phylogenies of Thai Planktothricodes strains enabled them to be designated as Planktothricoides raciborskii. Cell dimensions of Thai strains tested were in 1.86 to 5.96 mu m length (L), 2.83 to 13.70 mu m width (W), and the L/W ratio ranged from 1:6 to 1:1. Among Planktothricoides strains, the 16S rRNA phylogenies demonstrated that three subclades (A, B and C groups) were apparently divided. The similarity of 16S rRNA genes between subclades were 96-98%. From the detection of MIB synthase genes and GC/MS/MS analyses, some strains grouped into A group were considered as MIB-producers. In this study, most Thai Planktothricoides strains belonging to the A group were found in all three regions, while the strains forming the B and C groups were not distributed in the North region. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report investigation and characterization of the potential MIB-producing Planktothricoides from Thailand. Therefore, providing a valuable tool as a model for the early prediction and detection of taste and odor event is necessary.																	1516-8913	1678-4324				JAN-DEC	2017	60								UNSP e17160567									WOS:000410083300001

This increases the threat on the environm ent for being over exploited and contaminated with m anmade products and synthetic chemicals. Of all, clean water is one of the resources that can be easily contaminated since it is a universal solvent and of high mobility. This work reports the development and optimization of a water quality monitoring system based on metal oxide sensors. The system is intended to a ssist the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in water sources online and onsite. The sampling mechanism was based on contactless mode, where headspace partial pressure of the VOCs formed above the water body in a close chamber was drawn for detection at the sensor platform. Pure toluene was used as standard to represent the broad spectrum of VOCs, and the sensor dynamic range was achieved from 1-1000 ppb. Several sensing parameters such as sampling time, headspace volume, and sensor recovery were s tudied and optimized. Besides direct detection of VOC contaminants in the water, the work has also been extended to detect VOCs produced by microbial communities and to c orrelate the size of the communities with the reading of V OCs recorded. This can serve to give b etter indication of water quality, not only on the conce ntration of VOCs c ontamination from chemicals, but also the content of microbes, which some can have severe effect on human health.

Preliminary Studies on Oleochemical Wastewater Treatment using Submerged Bed Biofilm Reactor (SBBR)	29TH SYMPOSIUM OF MALAYSIAN CHEMICAL ENGINEERS (SOMCHE) 2016	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				29th Symposium of Malaysian Chemical Engineers (SOMChE)	DEC 01-03, 2016	Miri, MALAYSIA	Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Inst Chem Engineers, Curtin Univ, Sarawak Convent Bur, Sarawak Shell Berhad, Solut Engn, MMI Engn, CREST NanoSolut, Young Scientists Network Malaysia, Inst Mat Malaysia, Sarawak Toursim Board, ACS Malaysia Chapter				Wastewater discharge from the industry into water sources is one of the main reason for water pollution. The oleochemicals industry effluent produces high content of chemical oxygen demand (COD) with value between 6000-20,000 ppm. Effective treatment is required before wastewater effluent is discharged to environment. The aim of the study is to develop submerged bed biofilm reactor (SBBR) with packing materials in the cosmoball (R) carrier. Water quality such as chemical oxygen demands (COD), turbidity and pH were analysed. The result shows that the initial COD of 6000 ppm was reduced below 200 ppm. The optimum conditions for SBBR were obtained when green sponges used as packing material in cosmoball (R); effluent flowrate set at 100 mL/min; 1: 1 ratio of cosmoball (R) volume to reactor volume and 1: 1 ratio of active sludge (mixed culture) volume to reactor volume. Turbidity and pH were recorded with 9.0 NTU and 7.0 respectively, which indicated that SBBR is feasible as an alternative for conventional biological treatment in oleochemical industry.																	1757-8981						2017	206								UNSP 012087	10.1088/1757-899X/206/1/012087								WOS:000409334500087

Performance Study of Ceramic Filter Module in Recirculated Aquaculture System (RAS)	29TH SYMPOSIUM OF MALAYSIAN CHEMICAL ENGINEERS (SOMCHE) 2016	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				29th Symposium of Malaysian Chemical Engineers (SOMChE)	DEC 01-03, 2016	Miri, MALAYSIA	Curtin Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Inst Chem Engineers, Curtin Univ, Sarawak Convent Bur, Sarawak Shell Berhad, Solut Engn, MMI Engn, CREST NanoSolut, Young Scientists Network Malaysia, Inst Mat Malaysia, Sarawak Toursim Board, ACS Malaysia Chapter				The growth of world population has led to significant increase in seafood demand over the world. Aquaculture has been widely accepted by many countries to increase the seafood production owing to the decline of natural seafood resources. The aquaculture productivity, however, is directly linked to the pond water quality. In this study, attempts were made to employ ceramic micro-filter to improve the pond water quality through filtration processes. There were two batches of filtration processes, short term (1 hour) and long term (48 hours). Significant improvements on real pond water quality were recorded through the short term microfiltration process, which reduced turbidity (96%), total suspended solids (TSS) (80%), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) (72%), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (55%), ammonia (60%), nitrate (96%) and phosphorus (83%). The long term filtration process also showed high efficiency in the removal of solid particle and organic matters. The results showed that all of the parameters were successfully reduced to acceptable ranges (turbidity<80 NTU, TSS<400 mg/L, BOD<5 mg/L, COD<70 mg/L, phosphate<3 mg/L and ammonia<0.05 mg/L) for fish culturing activity. Based on current study, there was a drastic increase in nitrate content after 24 hours due to the nitrification process by regenerated bacteria in the filtered pond water. Current study showed that the microfiltration using ceramic micro-filter has high potential to be used in recirculating aquaculture system throughout the aquaculture activities in order to maintain the pond water quality, thus, increase the survival rate of cultured species.																	1757-8981						2017	206								UNSP 012080	10.1088/1757-899X/206/1/012080								WOS:000409334500080

The annual dataset belonging physical and chemical features in the reservoir was obtained by the monthly intervals between the years 2010 and 2011. A total of 15 parameters (temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), light permeability, conductivity, salinity, chloride, pH, total hardness, Ca, Mg, NO2-N, NO3-N, o-PO4, SO4) have been monitored at three different sampling stations in the reservoir and a total of 495 observations were grouped statistically. The sampled periods have been classified into three different groups by using the BCCA. The results were supported by the PCA and CA statistical methods. Consequently, in order to determine and to evaluate for large complex datasets that belong to environmental properties, multivariate analyses are very useful techniques. Thus, the sampling periods to monitor the physicochemical including in a water resource can be determined.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	8					5007	5012										WOS:000409399600012

The water supplied from the wells in Uluova region is used as drinking, domestic and irrigation water. In the study, the groundwater samples were taken from several wells in Uluova region in March, April, May and September 2007 and March and April 2014 to examine the quality of groundwater in the Uluova region, Elazig, Turkey. They were assayed for quality parameters including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), hardness, NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N, sulfate, chloride, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Al, Cd, Pb, Ni and total and fecal coliforms. The results obtained were checked against the national and international drinking water standards and indicated that the groundwater samples were utilizable as drinking water based on the physical and the chemical parameters analyzed. Moreover, its suitability for irrigation purpose was evaluated in terms of sodium percentage (Na %) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). It was determined that the obtained concentrations of cadmium, lead, nickel and aluminum were lower than the guideline values; the studied water samples were appropriate for both drinking and irrigation purpose.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	8					5092	5102										WOS:000409399600023

In the 2011 monitoring in the tributary Djetinja, in the lake accumulation Vrutci with the sampling points at the rivers flow in the Lake, Brana, Nikolici was carried out. In the 2014, monitoring of tributary Djetinja, and representative sampling points Brana, Nikolici and Omar were conducted. The obtained results, at all measuring profiles of river and lake water, showed that concentrations of hazard cations (mu g/L) of Pb2+, Cd2+ and Hg2+ significantly exceeded the maximum allowable concentrations (MAC), and could cause negative impact on the environment. Concentrations of As3+ in water samples at all measured sampling points were within the MAC according to Serbian low and by-lows. The pH of the lake water was from 7.42 to 8.72, the concentration of dissolved oxygen from 3.53 mg/L to 8.82 mg/L and according to those results water lake belong to the fifth class of ecological potential. The higher concentration of Hg cation was in the lake than in the river waters sample tributaries, which indicate the high anthropogenic activities (unsanitary landfills, solid waste, etc.) as the pollution sources on the lake banks. Determined results showed that concentrations of mercury, cadmium, arsenic and lead cations (mg/kg) in sediment and tributaries were significantly lower than the MAC values. Based on two years monitoring results in water sample of tributaries, mathematical regression model was developed to predict the concentrations of heavy metal cations in lake water. High level of correspondence was achieved between dendrograms and real situation in lake accumulation. In December 2013, toxic contamination with cyanobacteria was occurred and use of lake water for production of drinking water for city Uzice and surround settlements was banned. The research activities on lake water quality presented in this paper are the unique model of the Case Study for the first time performed for the ecological status of artificial lake accumulation Vrutci in Serbia.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	8					5184	5189										WOS:000409399600035

In this study, we constructed five kinds of bio-trickling filters loaded with different size distribution of zeolite to systematically investigate the removal characteristics of turbidity, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of black water. The results showed that under the same hydraulic loading and influent water quality, the filter filled of small (5mm or less) size zeolite and another one covered with large-size (15-30mm), medium-size (5-15mm), small-size in sequence were better than those filled with large and medium size zeolite respectively or the mixture of three size on the removal efficiency of turbidity, NH4+-N, TN, TP and COD. Although the removal efficiency of the filter filled of small size zeolite was similar to layered model, layered model gave optimal performance for treating water considering the issues of cost and clogging. When the average concentrations of turbidity, NH4+-N, TN, TP, COD were 286.5 NTU, 116.1 mg/L, 159.8 mg/L, 14.9 mg/L, 742.4 mg/L in black-water, the layered model reached them reduction of 88.6%, 97.3%, 70.5%, 22.5%, 77.2%.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	8					5190	5197										WOS:000409399600036

For this reason, the management of rivers for sustainable water management needs to be well managed and its pollution must be well identified and monitored. In this study, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids (SS), pH, conductivity (CE) and temperature (T) values were examined in five locations between December 2012 and December 2013 in Bartin River. Then multiple linear regression (MLR), Radial Basis Neural Network (RBANN), Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP) models were applied for water quality forecasting. In these models, BOD value was estimated by using T, pH, COD, SS, CE parameters as input data. Forty-one measurement data belonging to the locations were used in the training and the other 18 measurement data were used in the test process. According to the obtained results, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models have shown better results than multiple linear regression model. Compared to the established models, the best performance values were achieved with a radial based artificial neural network model. In this model MAE, RMSE and R2 values obtained 0.998, 1.230 and 0.890 respectively. According to the results of the present research the most successful estimation by ANN models was achieved for the monthly BOD values in Bartin River.

Bare-root strawberry plugs were grown in 1-gallon plastic pots. The treatments consisted of two media: (1) a peat:perlite soil-less mix and (2) a fine sand soil. Each media was amended with three levels of dairy manure vermicompost: 0, 10, and 25% by weight, and a biweekly synthetic fertilizer treatment of 150mg N-P-K L-1 evaluated in a full factorial randomized block design. Drainage water from each plant was collected each week for 18weeks and analyzed for NO3- concentration. In the first 2weeks, high (1000-5000mg L-1) amounts of NO3- leaching occurred in all vermicompost-amended media relative to non vermicompost-amended media, but this leaching significantly (p < 0.01) decreased over time across all vermicompost treatments. Strawberry growth response to 10% vermicompost was similar to synthetic fertilizer only treatments. Plants grown with vermicompost at 25% with synthetic fertilizer had the highest above-ground vegetative biomass (15.3g) relative to plants with synthetic fertilizer only (5.3g). These data suggest vermicompost addition rates of 10 and 25% by weight promote high vegetative biomass in greenhouse strawberry but may facilitate high initial nitrate leaching, which can negatively affect water quality and environmental health.																	1065-657X	2326-2397					2017	25	3					194	205		10.1080/1065657X.2016.1277806								WOS:000410918800005

Current international monitoring estimates by the Joint Monitoring Programme for water and sanitation suggest that at least 1.1 billion people practice HWT. These estimates, however, are based on surveys that may overstate the level of consistent use and do not address microbial effectiveness. Wesought to assess how HWT is practiced among households identified as HWT users according to these monitoring standards. After a baseline survey (urban: 189 households, rural: 210 households) to identify HWT users, 83 urban and 90 rural households were followed up for 6 weeks. Consistency of reported HWT practices was high in both urban (100%) and rural (93.3%) settings, as was availability of treated water (based on self-report) in all three sampling points (urban: 98.8%, rural: 76.0%). Nevertheless, only 13.7% of urban and 25.8% of rural households identified at baseline as users of adequate HWT had water free of thermotolerant coliforms at all three water sampling points. Our findings raise questions about the value of the data gathered through the international monitoring of HWT as predictors of water quality in the home, as well as questioning the ability of HWT, as actually practiced by vulnerable populations, to reduce exposure to waterborne diseases.																	0002-9637	1476-1645					2017	97	1					259	270		10.4269/ajtmh.16-0428								WOS:000409523900041	28719314

In April 2013, a prodigious storm front caused unprecedented flooding in the city and environs that resulted in extensive loss of life and property, especially in the Del Gato stream basin. Through an analysis of water quality and the conditions of the habitat on the basis of the macroinvertebrates present as bioindicators of environmental quality, this work aims to contribute to a reevaluation of the role of the marshes adjacent to the stream as flood-alleviation elements, and then propose alternatives for flooding management in the basin. Consequently, quantitative seasonal samples of vegetation, sediments, and benthic organic matter were taken and limnologic parameters measured in three sectors of the basin having different land uses: rural, periurban, and urban-industrial. The macroinvertebrate assemblages, as analyzed through the application of ecological indices, exhibited a marked decline in richness and in the Pampean Biotic Index towards the low-lying basin. Principal-components analysis associated Site 1 with the dissolved-oxygen concentration, Site 2 with high nitrate values, and Site 3 with oxygen demands. Redundancy analysis indicated a positive relationship between Baetidae and Aeolosomatidae with the dissolved-oxygen concentration and between Enchytraeidae and Stratiomyidae with the conductivity. These marshes are fundamental in maintaining good environmental conditions and attenuating the effects of the flooding that is predicted to become increasingly catastrophic in this region as the climate changes.																	1961-9502						2017		418							32	10.1051/kmae/2017022								WOS:000410533900002

According to the European Water Framework Directive, the limits between physico-chemical quality classesmust be set consistently with biological quality elements. Onewayto do this consists in analyzing the response of aquatic communities to environmental gradients across monitoring sites and in identifying ecological community thresholds, i.e. zones in the gradients where the species turnover is the highest. In this study, fish data from196 lakes in France were considered to derive ecological thresholds using the multivariate method of gradient forest. The analysis was performed on 25 species and 36 environmental parameters. The results revealed the highest importance of maximal water temperature in the distribution of fish species. Other important parameters includedgeographical factors, dissolved organic carbon concentration and water transparency, while nutrients appeared to have low influence. In spite of the diversity of species responses to the gradients, community thresholds were detected in the gradients of the most important physico- chemical parameters and of total phosphorus and nitrate concentrations as well. The thresholds identified in such macroecological study may highlight new patterns of species natural distribution and improve niche characterization. Moreover, when factors that may be influenced by human activities are involved, the thresholds could be used to set environmental standards for lake preservation.

Assessment of long-term trends for management of Candlewood Lake, Connecticut, USA	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Candlewood Lake, the largest;lake in Connecticut, is a pumped-storage reservoir formed in the 1920s for hydropower generation. Since its inception, the lake has experienced shifts in water quality coupled with watershed development and, in the 1980s, the introduction and spread of the invasive macrophyte, Myriophyllum spicatum. In response, a monitoring program to track water quality, and a winter drawdown program to mitigate growth of M. spicatum were initiated in 1985. Recently it was sugpested that the drawdovvn program exacerbated eutrophication of the lake. To test this hypothesis, statistical analyses of the long-term (1985 to 2012) database was conducted with a focus on trophicrelated variables. We examined the database using principal component analysis (PCA) and multivarite singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). MSSA is an extension of PCA for multivariate time series data that accounts for both temporal and cross-sectional dependencies We found no evidence that the trophic condition declined, or that the drawdowns have deteriorated the water quality. Instead, we found that lower TS, TSIchi, and TSSD values corresponding with improved trophic conditions occurred in summers following deep drawdowns, while significantly higher values correlated with shallow and less effective drawdowns. Overall, there has been a modest improvement in the trophic condition overtime, attributed to a combination of the winter drawdowns and management efforts. In contrast, a steady and significant increase in dissolved salts, likely due to enhanced use of road deicing treatments, was documented.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	3					280	300		10.1080/10402381.2017.1335812								WOS:000410569400008

In some regions of the lake, fish habitat that was formerly dominant has disappeared completely. A few areas of desirable habitatpersist as a result of purposeful restoration actions, and these areas provide important conservation and restoration opportunities. In this study, the ecological conditions of Qianling Lale were assessed to identify hydrodynamic conditions, sediment deposition, and fish habitat suitability to recommend strategies for, improving and restoring, these areas. Two restoration strategies, "flood flush" and "add an artificial island were proposed and modeled to predict the restoration effects. Simulation results showed that the restoration scheme "add an artificial island' could improve spinibarbus (Spinibarbus sinensis Bleeker) habitat quality. The analysis also indicated that this restoration strategy could succeed in restoring the fish habitat under natural dynamic processes.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	3					301	313		10.1080/10402381.2017.1336739								WOS:000410569400009

INVESTIGATING KEY TRENDS OF WATER RESOURCES ATTRACTION INTO ECONOMIC TURNOVER	SCIENTIFIC BULLETIN OF POLISSIA												Urgency of the research. Saving water is the biggest problem of modern humanity. The water quality generates quality of life and health of everyone. Thus, there is a need to analyse water condition, to find the ways of effective water management and implement the measures for sustainable environmental management. Target setting. Today water is extremely exposed to pollution, furthermore, issues around effective use of water resources are the number one problem worldwide. Actual scientific researches and issues analysis. A number of well-known Ukrainian scientists R. H. Dubas, A. V. Yatsyk, L. H. Melnyk, O. I. Karintseva, S. M. Shevchenko, M. A. Khvesyk, Y. M. Hryshchenko, as well as other researchers conducted investigations on salient and emerging trends in water resources' attraction into economic turnover. Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. The research objective. Water use in different sectors of economy still faces a number of issues which have to be rganized, investigated and resolved. The purpose of this study is to establish guidelines of effective water use in line with sustainable development and environmental management principles by identifying salient trends of water use in modern Ukraine, as well as to reveal its issues in order to determine the ways to overcome existing deficiencies. The statement of basic materials. In our study, we consider the impact of water use on the actual water bodies to be the most important criterion in the classification of water consumption. The impact may be focused on quantitative or qualitative characteristics of water bodies, or on none of them. The level of qualitative changes in water use is pretty high. Attraction of water resources to the economy should be based on sustainable development approach. Sustainable development of hydro-economic complexes is defined by the criterion of maintaining renewable water resources at acceptable levels and by water use efficiency. Conclusions. The authors suggest taking measures in order to rationalize water use basing on existing hydro economic systems and establishing cooperation with potential foreign institutions by creating a system of global national water complex through the institutionalization of water environment. the researchers offer to implement step-by-step decentralization and to create the interaction algorithm between the centralized and decentralized approaches to water supply in the municipal sector; they also recommend creating economic conditions for changeover to closed system in agriculture in order to save 1.8-2.5 thousand cubic meters of water per each hectare of irrigated, which will allow creating a more effective mechanism of water management in Ukraine with the use of the best foreign experience.																	2410-9576	2225-5508					2017		1					70	75										WOS:000409465200010

Phytoplankton ecology of a culturally eutrophic embayment: Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is a chronically eutrophic embayment located at the western end of Lake Ontario that has experienced many decades of agricultural, industrial, and urban contamination. It has been identified as an Area of Concern under the terms of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the United States. This study examines the ecology of the phytoplankton communities at one centrally located station during the ice-free period (May-October) of three non-consecutive years: 2002, 2004 and 2006. This was the first comprehensive study to be conducted since the 1970s. It was found that the phytoplankton communities are diverse and fluctuate throughout the year, along with changing nutrient, physical and environmental conditions. No consistent patterns of seasonal succession were observed throughout the study. Phytoflagellates including Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae had a tendency to outnumber and out-compete other phytoplankton since they are mobile and able to seek out optimal habitats within the water column. For a highly eutrophic water body, algal biomass (annual mean approximate to 2.0 g m(-3)) was lower than expected and more consistent with mesotrophic conditions-an observation first made by researchers in the 1970s and attributed to the highly variable physical environment. While our study supports these earlier results, we also conclude that zooplankton grazing likely has a significant role in limiting the size of the algal standing crop. Several algal bloom events were captured during our study. In addition to the somewhat predictable blooms of Diatomeae in the spring and Cyanophyta in the summer, we also observed blooms of Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae. In one case we observed a bloom with no dominant taxon-it contained a diverse mixture of Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyta and Dinophyceae-challenging the commonly held notion that algal blooms are essentially monocultures. Our results show that such a variable and stressed ecosystem requires frequent sampling to capture the rapid changes that occur.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		201	213		10.1080/14634988.2017.1307678								WOS:000410570900002

Elevated zooplankton production in a eutrophic Lake Ontario embayment: Hamilton Harbour 2002-2014	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is an Area of Concern in western Lake Ontario, long stressed by cultural eutrophication, urbanization and invasive species. Despite high nutrient levels leading to hypolimnetic hypoxia and contaminated sediment, it is a highly productive environment. To better understand zooplankton dynamics in Hamilton Harbour, we conducted biweekly May to October sampling of zooplankton and rotifer composition at open water harbour sites from 2002-2014. May to October zooplankton density, dry biomass and total production averaged 265 +/- 16 animals l(-1), 306 +/- 19 mg m(-3) and 4131 +/- 359 mg m(-3), (+/- SE), respectively. These values are among the highest reported in the Great Lakes, with biomass two to seven times greater than in other eutrophic embayments. Zooplankton populations and taxonomic seasonality have remained relatively stable in Hamilton Harbour since 2002. Biomass is often dominated by smaller taxa such as Bosmina, Eubosmina and juvenile copepods, suggestive of high fish planktivory, but Daphnia retrocurva and D. galeata mendotae are also dominant during the summer, indicating improvements in the zooplankton community since the 1970s when Daphnia and cyclopoids were uncommon. Conversely, rotifers have declined over the last 40 years, though while still numerically dominant, now comprise <4% of total biomass and production compared to 40% in the 1970s. Both adult Dreissenid Mussels and their veliger larvae are less abundant in Hamilton Harbour compared to nearshore Lake Ontario. Zooplankton appear to be effectively utilizing high production rates of edible algae and microorganisms in the harbour. More work is needed to explore trophic interactions in this eutrophic ecosystem and the effects of hypolimnetic hypoxia on the zooplankton community.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		230	241		10.1080/14634988.2017.1294425								WOS:000410570900004

Perceived changes in environmental degradation and loss of ecosystem services, and their implications in human well-being	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Rural communities worldwide face a decrease of critical ecosystem services caused by replacement of native forests by commercial plantations. Replacement of native forest by commercial plantations decreases water provisioning, with possible negative impacts over well-being. We tested this hypothesis in Central Chile. We assessed subjective well-being (SWB) and local perceptions of changes in forest cover and water provision among 78 rural families. We also assessed if the Shifting Baseline Syndrome (SBS) affects the perceptions of environmental changes and their implications in SWB. Individuals perceived less forest cover than 20years ago, and this is seen as a factor of decreased livelihood, availability of forest products, and water provisioning for households. People also reported less water available than 20years ago. The main drivers associated with decreased water provision were the establishment of pine plantations (44% of individuals) and drought (44%). A better-off SWB was associated with perception of lower rate of deforestation. The perceptions of forest degradation and its association to SWB are affected by SBS. Paradoxically, a better-off SWB was also associated with an improvement of water quality, although the quantity and quality of water have decreased according to biophysical data, which ought to decrease the SWB. Impacts of environmental degradation in SWB are masked by factors such as more infrastructure for drinking water, assisted by governments. This masking of environmental degradation reduces the opportunity to avoid negative impacts over well-being among rural communities that are dependent on assistance around the world.																	1350-4509	1745-2627					2017	24	6					561	574		10.1080/13504509.2016.1255674								WOS:000410913600010

Temperature is one of the rate-controlling parameters for many chemical and microbiological processes and is, therefore, considered as a surrogate parameter for water quality processes. In this study, a mathematical model is presented that predicts temperature dynamics of the drinking water in DDWSs. A full-scale DDWS resembling a conventional system was built and run according to one year of stochastic demands with a time step of 10s. The drinking water temperature was measured at each point-of-use in the systems and the data-set was used for model validation. The temperature model adequately reproduced the temperature profiles, both in cold and hot water lines, in the full-scale DDWS. The model showed that inlet water temperature and ambient temperature have a large effect on the water temperature in the DDWSs.

Monitoring of physicochemical parameters and acute toxicity tests allow us to measure water quality of the influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plants in accordance with the parameters established by the NOM-003-SEMARNAT-1997. Goals. We measured water quality of the influent and effluent of the wastewater treatment plant of the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes during 2007-2008. Methods. Every 15 days physicochemical parameters were taken and acute toxicity tests were conducted with the cladoceran Daphnia magna and the rotifer Lecane quadridentata. Results. The influent showed median lethal concentration to be between 25.71 and 3.88 toxic units with L. quadridentata, while with D. magna the median lethal concentration was between 31.51 and 3.17 toxic units. The effluent showed median lethal concentration to be between 60.71 and 1.64 toxic units with L. quadridentata, whereas the D. magna showed no toxicity. Conclusions. We concluded that the wastewater treatment plant of the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes in 2007-2008 fulfilled Mexico's water quality criteria after treatment.																	0188-8897						2017	27	1					87	92										WOS:000410073900009

Groundwater is a vital source of water for domestic and agricultural activities and the water of the Mocorito River Coastal Aquifer (MORCA), located in the agricultural valley of Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico, is not an exception. Goals. To assess MORCA's groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation purposes and the geochemical processes affecting its composition. Methods. Twenty-two well samples were collected during the dry and rainy seasons. Physical and chemical parameters, major ions, drinking quality (WQI and PHASECH water quality index), and irrigation suitability Richards (1954) and Wilcox diagrams) were studied. Results. Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) ranged from 1688 - 8762 mg L-1 for the dry season and 89-10016 mg L-1 for the rainy season. From inland to the coastal zone, MORCA's groundwater was considered hard and very hard, with non-dominant hydrochemical facies in the dry season and calcium, magnesium and sodium (cationic), and bicarbonate and chloride (anionic) types, in the rainy season. US Salinity Staff and Wilcox diagrams revealed that MORCA's groundwater is not suitable for use in irrigation. Further, the geochemical processes controlling the chemical composition of MORCA were evaporation and weathering. Conclusions. According to the TDS and water quality index (WQI and PHASECH) classifying just 4.5 % and over 50 % of the samples, respectively, MORCA water can be considered suitable for human consumption; only the groundwater from site EE-1, in the rainy season, was considered suitable for human consumption. US Salinity staff and Wilcox diagrams indicate that almost 50% of MORCA's groundwater is not suitable for irrigation use. MORCA's groundwater composition is dominated by evaporation and weathering of minerals such as anorthite, illite, and kaolinite.																	0188-8897						2017	27	1					103	113										WOS:000410073900011

Intersections of gender and water: comparative approaches to everyday gendered negotiations of water access in underserved areas of Accra, Ghana and Cape Town, South Africa	JOURNAL OF GENDER STUDIES												A large and growing body of literature suggests that women and men often have differentiated relationships to water access, uses, knowledges, governance, and experiences. From a feminist political ecology perspective, these relationships can be mediated by gendered labour practices (within the household, at the community level, or within the workplace), socio-cultural expectations (e.g. related to notions of masculinity and femininity), as well as intersectional differences (e.g. race, income, and so forth). While these relationships are complex, multiple, and vary by context, it is frequently argued that due to responsibility for domestic provision or other pathways, women may be particularly affected if water quality or access is compromised. This paper reports on a statistical evaluation of a 478 household survey conducted in underserved areas of Accra, Ghana and Cape Town, South Africa in early 2012. Interrogating our survey results in the light of the ideas of gender differentiated access, uses, knowledges, governance, and experiences of water, we open up considerations related to the context of each of our study sites, and also invite possible revisions and new directions for these debates. In particular, we are interested in the instances where differences among male and female respondents were less pronounced than expected. Highlighting these unexpected results we find it helpful to draw attention to methods - in particular we argue that a binary male-female approach is not that meaningful for the analysis, and instead, gender analysis requires some attention to intersectional differences (e.g. homeownership, employment, or age). We also make the case for the importance of combining qualitative and quantitative work to understand these relationships, as well as opening up what might be learned by more adequately exploring the resonances and tensions between these approaches.																	0958-9236	1465-3869					2017	26	5					561	582		10.1080/09589236.2016.1150819								WOS:000410775600007

Physico-chemical limnology and plankton dynamics of Mazvikadei, a tropical reservoir in Zimbabwe	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The limnology of Mazvikadei Reservoir, northern Zimbabwe, was investigated in 2015 to determine whether it had changed since filling in 1990. The reservoir is characterised by low algal biomass, low nutrients (i.e. N and P) and high water clarity/transparency. Fifty-four species of phytoplankton were recorded, comprising Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, Desmids, Dinophyta and Euglenophyta. Chlorophyta numerically dominated in the hot dry season, whereas Bacillariophyta, Desmids, Dinophyta and Euglenophyta dominated in the cool dry season. Species richness was highest at the onset of the cool dry season, in response to high nutrient concentrations. Phytoplankton abundance and composition were significantly correlated with temperature, nitrates and total nitrogen. Nineteen zooplankton species were recorded, including Copepoda, Cladocera and Rotifera. Overall, Cladocera were numerically dominant and became most abundant during the cool dry season. Rotifers and copepods dominated during the hot dry season. The zooplankton abundance was correlated with reactive phosphorus and phytoplankton abundance. The trophic state of Mazvikadei Reservoir seems to have stabilised and to have assumed the physico-chemical characteristics and plankton community typical of an oligotrophic lake.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					93	108		10.2989/16085914.2017.1336074								WOS:000410575700002

ICP-MS and ICP-OES analyses of trace metals based on total concentration of unfiltered lake water samples showed the presence of trace metals. All fish species accumulated Al, Mn and Sr in the highest concentrations in their gills, with Cu, Cd, Co, Cr, Pb and U highest in the liver. Pungu maclareni accumulated Al, Cr, Co, Sr and Pb in the highest concentrations. The highest mean gill Al concentration of 140 mu g g(-1) dry weight was measured in P. maclareni gills, this being one of the critically endangered cichlids of the lake. Stable isotope analyses of carbon delta C-13 and nitrogen delta N-15 showed that P. maclareni had the highest mean delta C-13 (-30.2%) and highest concentrations of Cr, Co, Pb and U in liver, probably linking the carbon source to the accumulation of metals. Though trace metal levels in the lake water were low, their presence in fish tissues suggest they are bioavailable, bioaccumulate and may pose a threat to the aquatic biota, and therefore should be monitored.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					161	169		10.2989/16085914.2017.1297695								WOS:000410575700008

Whereas monitoring these rivers is required to detect biodiversity losses, record pollution events and devise mitigation strategies, current monitoring programmes are inadequate. In 2009, the South African Earth Observation Network initiated an intensive long-term research programme on the Lowveld reaches of the Olifants River. Physico-chemical parameters, aquatic macroinvertebrates and fish abundances were recorded at four Lowveld sites in the Olifants River. We review six years of this programme. The results suggest deterioration in the ecological condition of the Olifants River with no discernible improvement through protected areas. Trends could not be detected. The parameters measured, sampling methods and/or sampling frequency might be responsible for the limited trends observed, or alternatively the results simply reflect stable conditions despite on-going pollution. Real time monitoring and an expansion in the parameters monitored would add value to the monitoring programme.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					171	179		10.2989/16085914.2017.1334501								WOS:000410575700009

Analysis of the 2009-2015 data from four Olifants River sites showed deterioration in the river's ecological condition between where it enters the Lowveld and where it enters the Kruger National Park, with a slight recovery within the Kruger National Park. Physico-chemical, aquatic macroinvertebrate and fish data collected in 2009-2015 at six sites on the Steelpoort, Blyde, Klaserie and Selati tributaries of the Olifants River corroborated the ecological condition of these tributaries. The Selati was the most polluted and was in a critically modified condition, whereas the Klaserie and Steelpoort were in fair condition and the Blyde was in good condition. The Selati appeared to have a significant negative impact on the water quality, macroinvertebrates and fish of the Olifants River within the Kruger National Park.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					181	190		10.2989/16085914.2017.1353477								WOS:000410575700010

Physico-chemical water characteristics and aquatic macroinvertebrates of Lake Tsimanampesotse, south-western Madagascar	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Saline lakes are known to be amongst the most productive ecosystems in the world. Tsimanampesotse, a 'conservation hotspot' soda lake in southwestern Madagascar, was integrated into the Ramsar wetland network in 1998. Despite its importance for aquatic birds, knowledge of its water characteristics and aquatic biota is scarce. Water quality and aquatic invertebrates were investigated in April and August 2013 to provide baseline data in order to measure possible changes of the area in the future. Changes in water temperature (19.5-25.9 degrees C) and in dissolved oxygen (9.3-11.3 mg l(-1)) were detected. The water was highly mineralised (EC > 41 000 mu S cm(-1)) and moderately alkaline (pH similar to 8.0). The maximum concentrations of ammonia and phosphate were relatively high (39.1 and 57.6 mg l(-1), respectively). Freshwater runoff from the plateau makes the water quality in the eastern part of the lake better than that in the west. Of the 15 taxa of macroinvertebrate assessed, the crustaceans Grandidierella mahafalensis and Apseudes thaumastocheles were dominant. Decreased water salinity in April increased the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates. Despite its incorporation to the protected area, Lake Tsimanampesotse is still impacted by human activities and needs supplementary preservation.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	2					191	199		10.2989/16085914.2017.1357532								WOS:000410575700011						
J	Vandenberghe, C; Colinet, G				Vandenberghe, Christophe; Colinet, Gilles			The management of soil organic matter, an important issue in reducing nitrate leaching to groundwater	BIOTECHNOLOGIE AGRONOMIE SOCIETE ET ENVIRONNEMENT												Description of the subject. The nitrate concentration in half of the groundwater bodies of the Walloon Region (Belgium) has justified their classification as vulnerable zones under the Nitrates Directive (ND). This vulnerable area has a relatively high diversity of agro-soil environments. Thus, the nitrogen content of agricultural soils can vary locally by a factor 4. Objectives. This study aimed to establish whether the carbon content of a soil is a significant risk factor in nitrate leaching to groundwater. Method. The article is based on measurements of nitrate nitrogen residue (APL) and soil total organic carbon (TOC) at the beginning of the leaching period. The measurements were made in 2012 in 1,500 plots, during inspections organized by the Wallonia Public Service. This was as part of the application of the Program for the Sustainable Management of Nitrogen in Agriculture, the scheme for implementing the ND within the Walloon region. Results. Examination of the results showed both that the APL was positively correlated to the TOC and that plots with "noncompliant" APL results had a significantly higher average TOC than the other plots. Conclusions. Since APL is an environmental indicator of the risk of nitrate leaching, it appears that the TOC may constitute a risk of groundwater contamination by nitrate. It is therefore advisable to improve the inclusion of this parameter in advice regarding nitrogen fertilization and secondly, in the case of summer harvest, to better manage the sowing of catch crops.																	1370-6233	1780-4507					2017	21	3					201	208										WOS:000410109500004

Spectroscopic investigation of the plasma jet interaction with water	FRONTIERS IN THEORETICAL AND APPLIED PHYSICS/UAE 2017 (FTAPS 2017)	Journal of Physics Conference Series				International Conference Frontiers in Theoretical and Applied Physics (FTAPS)	FEB 22-25, 2017	Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U ARAB EMIRATES	Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Phys, Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Ctr	Amer Univ Sharjah			In this paper, the emission spectra from plasma jet-water interaction is investigated. The plasma system consists of a quartz tube which is surrounded by two copper strips separated by 14 mm, the upper stripe is connected to AC high voltage power supply and the lower is grounded. A quartz-cuvette containing the water sample is placed at 13 mm down to the tube nozzle. Emission spectra from three regions; the distance between the two electrodes (A), the distance between the grounded electrode and the sample surface (B), and through the sample (C), are investigated. The results show clear differences between the spectra emitted from the three regions. Region A emits the highest intensities for the line spectra and argon 763 nm was the maximum. As well as, O radical emission spectra were detected with the highest intensities in region B. However, new bands and lines appear in the spectra from region C, due to interaction of the jet with water, depending on the water conditions and plasma operating parameters. These results declare that plasma jet interaction with water can be used as indicator for water quality and a detector for which species play the rule in plasma sterilization too.

The humic acid solution and titanium dioxide (TiO2) were used as tested water and catalyst, respectively. Controlled operating parameters include ozone gas flow rate, catalyst dosage and ozone dosage. The results reveal that the permeate flux of membrane could be recovered up to 98% of the initial permeate flux when ozone gas was injected into the membrane module at the time of permeate flux decreased to 60% of the initial permeate flux. Two monitored water quality parameters, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and UV absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) were both removed up to 97% under tested experimental conditions. When TiO2 was used as the catalyst in catalytic ozonation, the permeate flux of membrane was only recovered up to 93% of the initial permeate flux when catalysts and ozone gas were introduced into the membrane module at the time of permeate flux decreased to 60% of the initial permeate flux. However, the decrease of DOC and UV254 achieved up to 97% and 100%, respectively. This indicates that the application of catalytic ozonation in the ceramic membrane ultrafiltration system could obtain higher permeate water quality than using ozonation alone. Both ozonation and catalytic ozonation could effectively reduce membrane fouling and maintain stable permeate flux of the tested ceramic membrane system.																	0272-8842	1873-3956					2017	43			1			S758	S764		10.1016/j.ceramint.2017.05.313								WOS:000409285800130						
J	Rajee, O; Mun, ATK				Rajee, Olaganathan; Mun, Alicia Tang Kar			Assessing the efficiency of different sustainable farming practices in reducing the environmental impacts caused by Aquaculture	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED BIOTECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH												Sustainability of aquaculture is achieved when aquaculture farming systems are capable of preserving the natural resource base and involves an institutional change to the environment by the attainment and continued satisfaction for present and future generations. Sustainable farming practices produce sufficient aquaculture output to satisfy the seafood demand while not burdening the environment more. The potentiality and efficiency of different sustainable aqua farming practices in reducing anthropogenic impacts to the environment by aquaculture are assessed in this paper. Polyculture is mostly adopted by small-scale rural farmers as it requires low entry barrier and help in income diversification. The input of inorganic fertilizer in polyculturing should be also minimized, replacing with efficient nitrogen use for better sustainability means. While green technologies like Recirculating aquaculture system (RASs), designed integrated aquaculture-wetland ecosystem (AWE) and Bioflocs involves more complicated interactions between the water treatment, the feed, and the fish. Hence, results with more variables in results and higher cost of adoption. However, the implications are much wider, not limited no nutrient uptake, salinity and pH, but the removal of total dissolved solids. While GIS analysis could serve as a guide for the site-selection in minimizing environmental impacts and preventing aquaculture failure. Different approaches should be adopted to fulfil different needs depending on the species being cultured and adjacent environmental context.																	0976-2612	2278-599X					2017	8	1					305	314										WOS:000410376600006						
J	Long, P				Long, Peter			Benchmarking practices support grazing practice change	RURAL EXTENSION AND INNOVATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL												Grazing BMP is a benchmarking program available to beef cattle graziers in four focus catchments in Queensland. From 2013 to 2015 over 1000 grazing businesses completed Grazing BMP modules. The benchmarking standards are based on the best available science, current regulations, codes of practice and sound business principles. Program delivery and follow-up extension support is focused in the priority Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchments. Grazing BMP standards have been mapped to the GBR water quality management practice framework that aligns them against modelled water quality outcomes for the range of grazing practices. Independent program evaluation identified that 82 per cent of survey participants had implemented at least one change because of participation, with the benefits of the program being improved decision making, identification of improved practices and peer networking opportunities. Of the practices most closely related to water quality improvement, 30 per cent said they had made a change in grazing management.																	2204-8758	2204-8766					2017	13	1					41	46										WOS:000409500800006

The studies on the health status of past populations are usually focused on the causes of death. Our purpose is to present some descriptive analyses on non-deadly diseases. The present work focuses on the province of Friuli (north-eastern Italy) in the second half of the nineteenth century. The used sources are military call-up records. We collected about 300,000 records relative to military recruitment that took place between 1866 and 1909 (birth cohorts 1846-1890). Our main concern was the health status of the 20-year male population, and its association with environmental, socio economic and genetic factors. Generally speaking, we observe that the northern mountain area was the most advantaged, while young adults from the eastern and western parts of the province were the most disadvantaged. A lot of factors and causes contributed to determine the spatial distribution of specific diseases in Friuli, whilst others remain unknown because simple descriptive analyses are not sufficient to highlight them all. In particular, the distribution of the thyroidal hypertrophy was almost certainly due to the water quality, while the distribution of dental caries was probably related to genetic and dietary factors.																	1334-4366	1334-6253					2017	15	1					31	50										WOS:000409015400002	28767261					
J	Nayak, S				Nayak, Shailesh			Coastal zone management in India - present status and future needs	GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE												The coastal zone is a region where land, ocean and atmosphere interact and hence it is dynamic in nature. India has a long coastline which was not adequately monitored until the advent of the satellite remote sensing era in the 70s. India has a very robust remote sensing program that the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) series of satellites were effectively used to monitor coastal habitats, landforms, shoreline, water quality, etc., and changes were identified during the last 40 years. The classification system for coastal habitats and the classification and geometric accuracies of products were standardized. Detailed information for mangroves communities and characteristics of coral reefs were generated. The high and low tide lines were delineated seamlessly for the entire coastline using satellite data. All these data were organized in a GIS and the coastal database for the entire country was created. Impacts of various hazards on such as cyclones, tsunami and sea level changes on coastal habitats were documented. Based on topography, shoreline changes and tides, coastal multi-hazard vulnerability maps were characterized by employing the elevation data derived from satellite data and were prepared for the coastline of India. The information on ocean color and sea surface temperature was used to generate potential fishery advisories, which are provided daily to fishermen. The coastal database was utilized effectively to identify coastal regulation zones, marine protected areas, vulnerable zones, etc. Various services for tsunami, fishery and coral reef bleaching were generated for societal benefits. It is planned to develop models for the coastal zone, so that impeding dangers and likely changes in the coastal zone can be predicted and suitable actions can be undertaken. It is necessary to integrate socio-economic data with the knowledge database of coastal zone to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities and the changing climate on the coastal zone.																	1009-5020	1993-5153					2017	20	2			SI		174	183		10.1080/10095020.2017.1333715								WOS:000409348200011

Their concentrations were analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy, and it was found that their concentrations were several fold higher in downstream Swan River water samples of the Kahuta Industrial Triangle as compared to upstream. Heavy metal soil concentrations taken from the downstream site were 149% for Cr, 131% for Ni, 176% for Cd, 139% for Zn, 224% for Pb, and 182% for Cu when compared to samples from the upstream site. Quantitative analysis concluded that these metals were higher in milk samples collected from downstream as compared to the samples from upstream water-irrigated sites. The order of metal in milk was as Zn > Cr > Cu > Cd > Pb = Ni. Heavy metal contaminations may affect the drinking water quality, food chain, and ecological environment. It was also suggested that the toxicity due to such polluted water, soil, and milk are seriously dangerous to human health in future.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	7					1564	1572		10.1080/10807039.2017.1321956								WOS:000409110300003

Quantifying sustainability indicators in striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus downstream and upstream ponds	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												To assess the potential for improving sustainability and efficiency in an important Vietnamese finfish culture, we quantified sustainability indicators for 2 downstream and 2 upstream 3 to 4 m deep ponds for striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus (Sauvage, 1878) production along the Mekong River, Vietnam. The resources used per kg fish produced were (downstream vs. upstream): 2.8 vs. 7.1 m(3) water, 0.04 vs. 0.14 kWh energy, 0.06 vs. 0.11 h human labour and 0.06 vs. 0.15 g antibiotics (p < 0.05). The feed conversion ratio (kg feed dry matter per kg fish wet weight) was 1.50 vs. 1.65 and feed dry matter utilization efficiency was similar (28 vs. 30%) for both types of ponds (p > 0.05). Nitrogen and phosphorus utilization efficiencies were 44 vs. 40% for nitrogen (p < 0.05) and 17.7 vs. 17.6% for phosphorus (p > 0.05). An advantage of production in deep ponds is the breakdown of organic matter through denitrification and fermentation. Based on the difference between feed input and monitored outputs and sinks, an estimated 29-37% of dry matter volatilized as CO2 and 30-34% of nitrogen was lost as N-2. A major disadvantage of the deep pond production system is its dependency on water exchange with the Mekong River, resulting in low biosecurity, which is aggravated by the lack of availability of disease-free fingerlings. Dealing with disease caused farmers to apply suboptimal feeding rations and to lengthen the culture period. Developing (semi-)closed systems that adopt elements from recirculation technology could improve both culture performance and sustainability.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2017	9						293	309		10.3354/aei00231								WOS:000409341200001

The Sebou river estuary is an area with high agricultural potential becoming one of the most important industrial zones in Morocco. However, salt water intrusion along the estuary is a natural phenomenon that affects the economic development of the whole region. Analytical models of salinity distribution are simple and efficient tools to study salt intrusion in alluvial estuaries since they require minimum data for their application. In this paper, an analytical model based on Savenije theory is used to assess salinity variation in the Sebou river estuary. A two optimization key parameters of the model (Van Der Burgh's and dispersion coefficients) are estimated by comparing computed and observed salinity distribution for high water slack and low water slack. Additionally, statistical performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis were conducted on the model results. The results show good agreement with salinity observations, which suggests that the predictive model can be used to obtain a first-order estimation of salt intrusion along the Sebou estuary axis.																	2324-9676						2017	5	1					40	50		10.1080/23249676.2015.1124029								WOS:000409046700005

Epiphytic diatoms as indicators of ecological condition in New Zealand's lowland wetlands	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The condition of New Zealand's remnant wetlands has been documented by landscape-scale assessments such as the Index of Ecological Integrity and Wetland Condition Index. We explored the potential for microscopic aquatic biota (epiphytic diatoms) to provide complementary information about wetland condition using data from 77 lowland sites (mainly palustrine swamps) with circumneutral pH. In the South Island, correspondence between diatoms and wetland indices or water quality was weak. In the North Island, conductivity and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) together explained 49% of the variance in assemblage composition and several diatom genera were indicative of high or low conductivity, dissolved phosphorus and TDN. Changes in these water quality variables may trigger changes in wetland condition, which are eventually reflected by the landscape-scale indices. Diatoms respond rapidly to water quality changes suggesting potential for diatom indicator taxa to provide early warning of wetland degradation or to track restoration.																	0028-8330	1175-8805					2017	51	4					505	527		10.1080/00288330.2017.1281318								WOS:000409201900004

This study examined motivations of South Dakota landowners for enrolling in the James River Basin CREP. All 517 newly enrolled landowners were mailed a questionnaire in 2014 measuring demographics, behaviors, opinions, and motivations (60% response rate). Cluster analysis of 10 motivations for enrolling identified three motivation groups (wildlife = 40%, financial = 35%, environmental = 25%). The financial group had the youngest mean age (62 years), followed by the wildlife (65) and environmental groups (68). Among respondents, 43% favored the public access requirement of this CREP with the environmental group most in favor.

Therefore, the determination of salt intrusion length in estuaries is a challenge for managers as well as scientists in this field. The managers tend to use simple and reliable tools for salinity variation. Although 2-D and 3-D numerical models are common tools for the prediction of salinity intrusion now, analytical models of salinity variation are much more efficient, and also require minimal sets of river data. In this paper, two analytical solutions, Brockway and Savenije used worldwide to assess longitudinal salinity variation in alluvial estuaries, are applied to the Moroccan Atlantic semi-closed estuaries, i.e., Sebou and Loukkos. The solutions are derived from salt convection-dispersion equations, with different assumptions for the dispersion coefficient. The estuaries' bathymetry is described by an exponential function. The performance of these two solutions was evaluated by comparing their results with field-measured salinity data. The Brockway model's salinity predictions performs well to observations especially in downstream reaches of the two estuaries (Sebou: R-2 = 0.95, root mean square error [RMSE] = 1.50 parts per thousand, normalized root mean square error [NRMSE] = 3.45 parts per thousand; Loukkos: R-2 = 0.95, RMSE = 1.13 parts per thousand, NRMSE = 3.01 parts per thousand), while the Savenije model outperformed the Brockway's model and is better to predict salt intrusion length and salinity variation along the two estuaries (Sebou: R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 1.15 parts per thousand, NRMSE = 2.85 parts per thousand; Loukkos: R-2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.95 parts per thousand, NRMSE = 1.94 parts per thousand). This revealed that both analytical solutions apply well to the estimation of salinity variation and the prediction of salt intrusion in these two estuaries.																	0149-0419	1521-060X					2017	40	5					275	296		10.1080/01490419.2017.1319446								WOS:000409192800001

In recent years, rapid development has created an increased demand for drinking water, which is increasingly being fulfilled by groundwater abstraction. The groundwater samples collected from a panjapur area near korai river Tiruchirappalli district Tamil Nadu India. Groundwater samples collected seasonal variation Pre monsoon (May), Monsoon(August), and Post monsoon (November) during the Year 2014. Ten groundwater samples analyzed for major physicochemical parameters such as pH, Electrical Conductivity, Total DissolvedSolids, Total Hardness, Dissolved Oxygen, Biological Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Bicarbonate, Calcium, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Sulphate, Chloride and Nitrate, in order to understand the different geochemical processes affecting the groundwater quality. The analytical data were interpreted using WQI. The Calculated WQI value is (101.6). The analytical results indicate the majority of the groundwater samples are unsuitable for drinking purposes. The typical sewage comprising of domestic and other waste is discharged directly into the open land without any proper treatment will cause contamination. This contamination poses serious health impacts in the local residents. The correlation and regression provide an excellent tool for the prediction of parameter values within a reasonable degree of accuracy.																	2454-3225					JAN	2017	1	7			SI													WOS:000408669900006

A DISSOLVED OXYGEN PREDICTION METHOD BASED ON K-MEANS CLUSTERING AND THE ELM NEURAL NETWORK: A CASE STUDY OF THE CHANGDANG LAKE, CHINA	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												According to mass data from the internet, prediction is an important application of information processing. Predicting the amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) of a water environment is vital and can improve the aquaculture production efficiency. Using water quality and meteorological data for the Changdang Lake (Jiangsu, China) from 2014 to 2016, this study proposes a new strategy for predicting short-term DO based on K-means clustering and extreme learning machine (ELM) neural networks. First, the weights of the environmental factors on the DO are obtained using Pearson correlation analysis, and similar days are defined. Subsequently, according to the defined similarity, the K-means clustering algorithm divides the historical data into several clusters and identifies similar sample sets that have characteristics that are similar to the forecast day. Finally, after the ELM neural network model establishes the training and testing data, the DO is predicted using the similar sample set and the real-time environmental factors of the forecast days as input data. The prediction efficiency of our model was compared to that of others in terms of the mean absolute percentage error and the mean square error. The experimental results showed that our approach had higher forecasting accuracy and faster computation speed, which is beneficial for water management.																	0883-8542	1943-7838					2017	33	4					461	469		10.13031/aea.11786								WOS:000408588000003

While N. brasiliana var. platensis is widely recorded in several regions of the African continent and Argentina, N. brasiliana is often recorded in Central America, almost certainly because of uncertainty over their identities, to date based only on line drawings. We conclude that Cosmioneis brasiliana (Cleve) C.E. Wetzel & Ector comb. nov. is a distinct species, while N. brasiliana var. guadalupensis is a taxonomic synonym of Cosmioneis platensis (Frenguelli) C.E. Wetzel, E. Sar & Ector comb. nov.

A total of 14,234 morphotaxa from 72 families were identified: Oligochaeta (1 family), Clitellata (2 families), Gastropoda (5 families), Bivalvia (1 family), Malacostraca (3 families), and Insecta (60 families). The score of BMWPTHAI and ASPTTHAI in each site (PC1 to PC8) found that the BMWP was 187.33 206.00 140.67 194.33 184.67 and 239.00, respectively. The ASPT was 6.43 6.94 6.11 6.34 6.30 6.21 6.47 and 6.46, respectively. The ASPT in each site was significantly different (p<0.05). These scores indicated good water quality. The BMWP was negatively related with nitrate-nitrogen, whereas number of aquatic families was positively related with nitrate-nitrogen. The ASPT was negatively related with water turbidity (p<0.05). The water quality of the Phachi streams was found to be unpolluted/slightly polluted according to the physicochemical data and the BMWP and ASPT.																	2277-3657						2017	6	1					89	98										WOS:000408738400002

Our objective was to assess the range of disturbances for two large tropical reservoirs and their influences on benthic macroinvertebrates. We tested three hypotheses: i) a wide variation in the level of environmental disturbance can be observed among sites in the reservoirs; ii) the two reservoirs would exhibit a different degree of disturbance level; and iii) the magnitude of disturbance would influence the structure and composition of benthic assemblages. For each reservoir, we assessed land use (macroscale), physical habitat structure (mesoscale), and water quality (microscale). We sampled 40 sites in the littoral zones of both Tres Marias and Sao Simao Reservoirs (Minas Gerais, Brazil). At the macroscale, we measured cover percentages of land use categories in buffer areas at each site, where each buffer was a circular arc of 250 m. At the mesoscale, we assessed the presence of human disturbances in the riparian and drawdown zones at the local (site) scale. At the microscale, we assessed water quality at each macroinvertebrate sampling station using the Micro Disturbance Index (MDI). To evaluate anthropogenic disturbance of each site, we calculated an integrated disturbance index (IDI) from a buffer disturbance index (BDI) and a local disturbance index (LDI). For each site, we calculated richness and abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates, Chironomidae genera richness, abundance and percent Chironomidae individuals, abundance and percent EPT individuals, richness and percent EPT taxa, abundance and percent resistant individuals, and abundance and percent non-native individuals. We also evaluated the influence of disturbance on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at the entire-reservoir scale. The BDI, LDI and IDI had significantly greater average scores at Sao Simao than at Tres Marias Reservoir. The significantly greater differences in IDI scores for Sao Simao Reservoir were reflected in 10 of the 13 Ekman-Birge dredge biotic metrics and in 5 of 13 of the kick-net biotic metrics. We also observed clear ranges of disturbances within both reservoirs at macro (BDI) and mesoscales (LDI) and in water quality, but an insignificant range in MDI results. However, we found no significant relationship between the benthic macroinvertebrate metrics and the BDI, LDI, and IDI among sites within a single reservoir. Hence, we believe that benthic macroinvertebrate distributions in those reservoirs were influenced by other factors or that reservoir macroinvertebrates (dominated by chironomids) were poor indicators of disturbance at the site scale.																	1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76	2					240	252		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1547								WOS:000408234800003

Herein we present results on some limnological aspects of surface waterbodies in this water-scarce region before shale gas exploration. Thirty-three waterbodies (nine dams, 13 depression wetlands and 11 rivers) were sampled in November 2014 and April 2015. Principal component analysis revealed that depression wetlands and rivers had distinct physicochemical signatures, whereas dams were highly variable in their physicochemical attributes and exhibited characteristics similar to those of either rivers or depression wetlands. Non-parametric multivariate regressions and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated that landscape variables such as underlying geology, altitude and land use poorly explained the physicochemical characteristics of the sampled waterbodies. Waterbody type was the only factor that explained a significant amount of the variation in physicochemistry during both sampling events. These data need to be supplemented by water quality information from additional sites and over longer time periods, as well as supporting data relating to other aspects, such as algae and invertebrates, before they can be used as a baseline for the long-term monitoring of freshwater ecosystems in the region.

Rapid appraisal links feral buffalo with kunkod (Melaleuca spp.) decline in freshwater billabongs of tropical northern Australia	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Freshwater wetlands have great ecological, social, cultural and economic importance and are considered some of the most threatened ecosystems globally, especially in the tropics. In the tropics of northern Australia, much land is owned by Aboriginal people, thus requiring community-based approaches to monitoring and decision making. Herein we present a collaborative community-based rapid appraisal of an observed decline in a culturally and ecologically important tree genus of the freshwater wetlands in northern Australia, locally known as kunkod (Melaleuca spp., Myrtaceae) by Bininj (local Aboriginal people). We conducted collaborative research with the local Aboriginal Djelk Rangers incorporating local and scientific knowledge and preferred research methods. The decline in kunkod was more common in the water zone than in the mud and dry zones of freshwater billabongs in the Djelk Indigenous Protected Area. Kunkod decline and poor regeneration were significantly correlated with high water electrical conductivity, turbidity and ammonium. Feral buffalo activity was also positively correlated with these parameters, suggesting an indirect effect of buffalo on kunkod population health (large and small trees) through reduced water quality rather than direct rubbing on the trees, as was initially expected. Ongoing monitoring will allow assessment of potential recovery of kunkod following planned feral buffalo control.

In each river, we sampled five sites with different types of substrate. These sites were characterised in situ according to the predominant material type (macrophytes, moss, pebbles and sand). A one-way ANOVA was used to test for significant differences in species abundance among substrates, and a nested ANOVA was used to test for significant differences in physical and chemical variables among rivers and sampling sites. A similarity percentage-species contribution analysis was performed to estimate the contribution of each species to the characterisation of each substrate. We observed significant differences in the abundance of seven species (Drusus bolivari, Glossosoma privatum, Larcasia partita, Micrasema longulum, M. servatum, M. gr. moestum and Sericostoma sp.) among substrates, confirming that these species have substrate preferences. According to similarity percentage-species contribution, the species that contributed most to differences were as follows: for sand, Sericostoma sp.; for macrophytes, Rhyacophila adjuncta, Hydropsyche ambigua, Sericostoma sp.; for moss, Micrasema gr. moestum, M. servatum, M. longulum, Hydropsyche tibialis and R. adjuncta; and for pebbles, Sericostoma sp., Larcasia partita and H. tibialis. These preferences can be explained by the fact that different species use different materials from the substrate to build their cases and also as a source of stability, protection and food.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	9					1686	1694		10.1071/MF16246								WOS:000408576800010

Determination of the physical drivers of Zostera seagrass distribution using a spatial autoregressive lag model	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Seagrass mapping has become a key tool in understanding the causes of change in seagrass habitats. The present study demonstrates a method for examining relationships between seagrass habitat polygons and environmental data generated by hydrodynamic, wave, catchment and dispersion models. Seagrass abundance data are highly spatially autocorrelated and this effect was corrected using a spatially simultaneous autoregressive lag model (SSARLM). The physical processes that determine the spatial distribution of seagrass in Port Phillip Bay, Australia, were investigated by examining the links between seagrass distribution and abundance and broadscale hydrodynamic (waves, currents), physical (light, depth, salinity and temperature) and catchment (nutrient and suspended sediment concentrations) processes. The SSARLM indicated that the distribution of Zostera spp. meadows is principally constrained by two physical thresholds, namely, wave height or exposure and light. The former excludes seagrasses from colonising wave-exposed coastlines, whereas the latter directly determines the depth profile of seagrasses through its influence on light availability. In total, 95% of all seagrass occurred within grid cells with a mean significant wave height of < 0.38 m and a mean percentage irradiance of > 33% surface levels. By comparison, variation in water quality, represented by variables such as modelled total nitrogen, suspended solids or salinity, had little influence on seagrass distribution.

CLASSIFICATION AND PREDICTION OF GOLDFISH POPULATION AND WATER QUALITY USING A POTENTIOMETRIC E-TONGUE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												In this study, a potentiometric E-tongue was employed for comprehensive evaluation of water quality and goldfish population with the help of pattern recognition methods. Four water quality parameters, i.e., pH and concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrite (NO2-N), and ammonium (NH3-N), were tested by conventional analysis methods. The differences in water quality parameters between samples were revealed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The cultivation days and goldfish population were classified well by principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA), and the distribution of each sample was clearer in CDA score plots than in PCA score plots. The cultivation days, goldfish population, and water parameters were predicted by a T-S fuzzy neural network (TSFNN) and back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN). BPANN performed better than TSFNN in the prediction, and all fitting correlation coefficients were >0.90. The results indicated that the potentiometric E-tongue coupled with pattern recognition methods could be applied as a rapid method for the determination and evaluation of water quality and goldfish population.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	4					1033	1040		10.13031/trans.9488								WOS:000408589300003

DEVELOPMENT OF A COUPLED WATER QUALITY MODEL	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Nonpoint-source (NPS) pollutants, especially from agriculture, continue to be a primary source of water quality degradation problems. Effective land management decisions at the field scale must be made to minimize nutrient losses that could pollute streams. Existing NPS models often cannot directly estimate the impacts of different land management practices or determine the effectiveness of combined best management practices (BMPs) in a distributed way at the farm scale. In many cases, they rely on application of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) or its improved versions, which represent fields in a lumped fashion and use empirical rather than process-based modeling methodologies. In this study, a coupled Water Erosion Prediction Project and Water Quality (WEPP-WQ) model was completed, updated, improved, and evaluated for simulation of hydrology, soil erosion, and water quality. The WEPP model is a well-established process-based model that simulates runoff and erosion processes from a hillslope. The water quality components are based on those of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). A single overland flow element (OFE) on a hillslope is used to represent a single soil and land use management. The WEPP-WQ model was tested by comparing simulated values from the coupled model with observed nutrient and sediment concentrations in surface runoff following storm events at experimental sites near Waterloo in northeastern Indiana and at the Throckmorton Purdue Agricultural Center in west central Indiana. Time series evaluation of the WEPP-WQ model was performed with observed nutrient and sediment losses from an experimental plot near Tifton, Georgia. The model performed quite well in simulating nutrient losses for single storm events, with R-2 greater than 0.8, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) greater than 0.65, and percent bias (PBIAS) less than 31% for runoff, sediment, nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, soluble phosphorus, and total phosphorus losses. In predicting time series nutrient loss, the WEPP-WQ model simulated daily nitrate nitrogen losses adequately, with the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) less than 0.7, NSE greater than 0.55, and PBIAS within the range of +/- 40%. Comparisons between simulated soluble phosphorus, total phosphorus, and literature results were performed due to the absence of an available observational dataset. The WEPP-WQ model with a single OFE in this study provides a basic but important step for the development of WEPP-WQ models with multiple OFEs that can evaluate the effectiveness of BMPs.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	4					1153	1170		10.13031/trans.12002								WOS:000408589300013

MOESHA: A GENETIC ALGORITHM FOR AUTOMATIC CALIBRATION AND ESTIMATION OF PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY AND SENSITIVITY OF HYDROLOGIC MODELS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Characterization of the uncertainty and sensitivity of model parameters is an essential facet of hydrologic modeling. This article introduces the multi-objective evolutionary sensitivity handling algorithm (MOESHA) that combines input parameter uncertainty and sensitivity analyses with a genetic algorithm calibration routine to dynamically sample the parameter space. This novel algorithm serves as an alternative to traditional static space-sampling methods, such as stratified sampling or Latin hypercube sampling. In addition to calibrating model parameters to a hydrologic model, MOESHA determines the optimal distribution of model parameters that maximizes model robustness and minimizes error, and the results provide an estimate for model uncertainty due to the uncertainty in model parameters. Subsequently, we compare the model parameter distributions to the distribution of a dummy variable (i.e., a variable that does not affect model output) to differentiate between impactful (i.e., sensitive) and non-impactful parameters. In this way, an optimally calibrated model is produced, and estimations of model uncertainty as well as the relative impact of model parameters on model output (i.e., sensitivity) are determined. A case study using a single-cell hydrologic model (EXP-HYDRO) is used to test the method using river discharge data from the Dee River catchment in Wales. We compare the results of MOESHA with Sobol's global sensitivity analysis method and demonstrate that the algorithm is able to pinpoint non-impactful parameters, demonstrate the uncertainty of model results with respect to uncertainties in model parameters, and achieve excellent calibration results. A major drawback of the algorithm is that it is computationally expensive; therefore, parallelized methods should be used to reduce the computational burden.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	4					1259	1269		10.13031/trans.12179								WOS:000408589300019

Water currents and water quality parameters (salinity and turbidity) were measured at the river mouth and upstream, and surface water samples were analyzed for nutrient concentrations (NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, SiO2-Si, suspended solids [SS], total nitrogen [TN], and total phosphorus [TP]). Observations were conducted on both clear and rainy days, which revealed the effect of weather. SS flux at the river mouth (outflux to sea) and upstream (influx from land) showed that sediment deposition occurred in the mangrove swamp, and the amount of sediment deposition on a rainy day (324 kg d(-1)) was approximately 14 times greater than that on a clear day (24 kg d(-1)). The higher influx from upstream on the rainy day caused levels of TN and TP deposition in the mangrove swamp that were 9.1 and 3.4 times higher, respectively, than levels on a clear day. Our findings highlight the importance of considering local weather conditions in the estimation and management of nutrient budgets, especially in a small mangrove river.																	0022-2402	1543-9542				JAN	2017	75	1					2	18										WOS:000408608700001

INDIAN TREATY FISHING RIGHTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT: AFFIRMING THE RIGHT TO HABITAT PROTECTION AND RESTORATION	WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW												In 1970, several tribes in the Pacific Northwest, along with their federal trustee, sued the state of Washington claiming that numerous state actions violated their treaty rights, which assured them "the right of taking fish in common with" white settlers. The tribes, and their federal trustee maintained that the treaties of the 1850s guaranteed the tribes: (1) a share of fish harvests for subsistence, cultural, and commercial purposes; (2) inclusion of hatchery fish in that harvest share; and (3) protection of the habitat necessary for the salmon that were the basis of the treaty bargain and the peaceful white settlement of the Pacific Northwest. By 1985, the tribes and the trustee persuaded the courts of the merits of the first two propositions, but the Ninth Circuit deferred on the third issue, declining to declare that the treaties supplied habitat protection in the absence of a specific factual dispute. Some two decades later, in 2007, the tribes and the federal government convinced United States District Court Judge Ricardo Martinez that the state's construction and maintenance of road culverts blocking salmon access to their spawning grounds violated the 1850s treaties. In 2013, after settlement talks failed, the district court issued an injunction that required most of the offending barrier culverts to be remedied within seventeen years, or by 2030. Claiming exaggerated costs of compliance, the state appealed, and in 2016 a unanimous panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed, rejecting the state's allegations wholesale. This Article examines the reasoning of both the district court and the Ninth Circuit and the path ahead, which may implicate road culverts owned by other governments and other habitat-damaging activities like dams, water diversions, and land management actions affecting water quality and quantity. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit's reliance on foundational rules of treaty construction to interpret the scope of the treaty right of taking fish could influence other Indian treaty cases beyond the issue of off-reservation fishing rights. Even if confined to treaties with off-reservation rights, the case represents the most significant interpretation of treaty fishing rights in nearly four decades.																	0043-0617						2017	92	1					1	38										WOS:000404944500001

Strategies to Reduce Water Footprint in Palm Oil Production: A Case of PTP Mitra Ogan, Baturaja, South Sumatra	ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE 2016 (ETIC 2016)	MATEC Web of Conferences				Engineering Technology International Conference (ETIC)	AUG 05-06, 2016	Ho Chi Minh City, VIETNAM					The massive expansion of palm oil industry in Indonesia has triggered environmental issues including water-related problems which have become an important concern. Regarding the issues, sustainable practice standard has been set up as a requirement for palm oil to enter global market. Inevitably, water consumption in this sector is very crucial to be analyzed. One of the methods that can be used as a tool for sustainable appropriation of fresh water resources is water footprint analysis. The primary aim of this study was to formulate the strategies to reduce the water footprint in the palm oil production based on the best practice criteria. Both quantitative and qualitative research was conducted to get the value blue water (volume of surface or groundwater evaporated) and grey water (dilution volume to dilute pollutants according to agreed water quality standards). The values of water footprint in palm oil production obtained were used to represent the existing water use and were utilized as the basis for formulating strategies in reducing water use in the palm oil milling processes which was compared with the best practice criteria. The result showed that the blue water of CPO was 109.6 m(3)/ton and the grey water was 537.7 m(3)/ton, while the blue water of palm kernel was 62,4 m(3)/ton and grey water was 306,2 m(3)/ton. The value indicated that there was an inefficient use of water in the production of palm oil. The use of steam accumulator has been proposed to reduce the use of blue water by optimizing the steam supply. Besides, the reuse of water from fat-pit pond for pressing purposes, or recovery of condensate water as dilution water in the press unit which will affect the amount of wastewater discharged can be done as the strategies in reducing both blue and grey water, as well as reuse of cooling water turbines.																	2261-236X						2017	97								UNSP 01122	10.1051/matecconf/20179701122								WOS:000407851400122

And the results showed that, through the quality of influent water was fluctuant, the quality of final effluent water was quite stable and met the discharge limits. Specifically, the concentration of oil in effluent was 3.6 mg/L and met its discharge standard; COD concentration was 83.3 mg/L, much lower than the design standard (350 mg/L); as for NH3-N, the effluent concentration was 9.3 mg/L, and its design standard of effluent concentration was 17-30 mg/L, and the sulfide concentration in effluent was only 0.037 mg/L, also lower than the design standard. The total removal efficiency of oil, COD, NH3-N and sulfide were 97.9%, 83.9%, 81.4% and 88.88%, respectively. So all actual results met the required demands, and the ultimate removal rates were also relatively high.																			978-1-315-37510-6; 978-1-138-02964-4				2017							299	302										WOS:000408464800063

We report on changes in water quality in these lakes during recent decades. We integrated data on key limnological variables during the last 55 years by supplementing historical literature data with our own field measurements. Our analyses provide strong evidence for a steady increase in nutrient concentrations and decrease in water transparency. Total phosphorus and total nitrogen concentrations in both lakes over the study period increased 5- and 7-fold, respectively. Similarly, water transparency decreased, especially in Lake Chamo, which used to have clear water but is now becoming a sediment-loaded lake similar to Lake Abaya. We reconstructed fertilizer use and land use changes in the region during the past decades. The combined data suggest that the dramatic eutrophication we observed in the lakes is likely associated with increased fertilizer use or other activities related to intensified agricultural practices, and the decline in water transparency is probably associated with low tree cover due to deforestation. The profound changes in the ecology of both lakes may jeopardize the delivery of ecosystem services in the region, including water supply, fisheries, and ecotourism. Our results stress the urgent need for measures that prevent further environmental deterioration of the unique heritage provided by the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	2					129	137		10.1080/20442041.2017.1301309								WOS:000408584600001

Catchment, morphometric, and water quality characteristics differ between reservoirs and naturally formed lakes on a latitudinal gradient in the conterminous United States	INLAND WATERS												Constructed lakes and impoundments (reservoirs) likely exhibit substantial differences in their physics, chemistry, and biology from naturally formed lakes; however, because reservoirs and natural lakes generally have different latitudinal distributions, less is known about quantitative, generalized differences between the 2 waterbody types. We compared a suite of limnological variables among 1033 reservoirs and natural lakes across multiple size classes on a latitudinal gradient in the conterminous United States. In general, reservoirs had significantly greater perimeters, catchment areas, and catchment area: surface area ratios than natural lakes. Interestingly, several lakeshore land use, morphometric, and water quality response variables exhibited significant interactions between waterbody type and latitude. Southern reservoirs were deeper and had higher proportions of forested land and less agriculture and developed land use in their lakeshore than southern natural lakes, whereas northern reservoirs were shallower and had less forest and more agriculture and developed land in their lakeshore than northern natural lakes. Following the waterbody depth and land use data, natural lakes also had greater total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at lower latitudes, whereas reservoirs had greater TP concentrations and shallower Secchi disk depths at higher latitudes. Overall, natural lakes were more eutrophic than reservoirs, having greater total nitrogen and chlorophyll a concentrations, regardless of latitude. Our findings indicate that many physical, chemical, and lakeshore land use characteristics of reservoirs and natural lakes vary on a latitudinal gradient, which has implications for the water quality, ecology, and management of these waterbodies.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	2					171	180		10.1080/20442041.2017.1293317								WOS:000408584600005

Cover system is utilized as an environmentally-friendly and an effective way for prevention of AMD in many cases in open cast coal mines in Indonesia. Waste rocks are classified into Potentially Acid Forming (PAF) or Non Acid Forming (NAF) on the basis of geochemical properties of rocks. PAF which is a cause of AMD is covered with NAF which is considered rocks unrelated to AMD at waste dump in order to prevent the contact of PAF with water and oxygen. The placement of backfill of waste rocks in waste dump is determined only by the classification at the aim of the prevention of AMD. According to past studies, pH affects the progress of AMD through the change of dissolution behavior of metals. In regard to the occurrence of AMD on the inside of waste dump, waste rocks in the lower part of waste dump are possibly affected by leachate from the upper part. Thus, the placement of waste rocks in waste dump need to be discussed in terms of not only the types of PAF or NAF but also the effects of water quality on the occurrence of AMD. This study presents the effects of pH on the progress of AMD with the results of leaching test under various pH conditions using rock samples taken in coal mine: pH was set at 3.0, 6.0, and 8.0. The results indicate that pH is not important factor as compared to the supply of oxygen to discuss the progress of AMD for a long term. In other words, the placement of waste rocks in cover system has to be determined by considering not so much the effect of water quality as the supply of oxygen.																	1640-4920					JAN-JUN	2017		1					97	102										WOS:000407742700017

This condition has an impact on the environment and public health because of the higher concentration of pollutants. Knowing the dispersion of pollutants is very important in order to manage and monitor the water quality in the Dumai estuary. This research simulated a numerical model that was developed using MIKE 21 to study pollutant dispersion in the Dumai estuary as an impact of domestic sewage from Dumai city. Three important parameters of pollutants were discussed in this study, such as ammonia, nitrates and nitrites. The data used for modeling included winds, tides, bathymetry, and the pollutant concentration. The result of the numerical simulations shows that the concentration of all pollutant parameters tends to increase in the Dumai estuary. The concentration of ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites increase to 0.4 mg/L, 0.15 mg/L, and 0.14 mg/L respectively. Those concentrations exceed the standard maximum value that has been appointed by Indonesian regulations. It means the domestic sewage from Dumai city should be treated before it is discharged into the river.																	2261-236X						2017	101								UNSP 04001	10.1051/matecconf/201710104001								WOS:000407968500058

The province is the second largest tin producer in the world. Secondary data from studies which took place in all four regencies in Bangka Island were discussed to show the impact of mining activities and its reclamation studies. In order to add plant selection criteria for regevetate mined soil, the greenhouse and laboratory experiment was carried out with fourteen herbs and grass species in Tennessee. The mining activities increase the wealth of the community, but the other hand they change and decrease the environmental stability, and cause horizontal conflicts. Offshore mining reduced water quality, change sea bed caused the change of biodiversity. Onshore mining activity reduces biodiversity and causes floods and damages infrastructure. While the more economic species are demanded, planting local tree species is challenging. An evaluation with local tree species concluded that best adapted species based on anatomical and physiological measurements was not those that showed the best performance in the field. The greenhouse and laboratory findings indicate that some physiological characteristics i.e. plant height and cover, transpiration rate, and foliar pigments may be used to select plant adaptability to mined soil.																	2261-236X						2017	101								UNSP 04010	10.1051/matecconf/201710104010								WOS:000407968500067

In industries, this will also lead to overall plant operational cost reduction. In this study, a pilot-scale surface-flow constructed wetland system filled with water hyacinth was used to treat effluent from existing sewage treatment plant at Batamindo Industrial Park. The sewage treatment plant effluent with quality fulfilling the regulation of Indonesian Ministry of Environment No.5/2014/XLVII-Group I was treated further to meet the raw water quality standard of Class I defined by Indonesian Government Regulation No.82/2001 as potable water resource. The system was able to maintain high chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of around 80% from initial value of 100 mg/L in sewage treatment plant effluent despite the change of flow rate from 10 to 40 m(3)/day (corresponding to hydraulic retention time of 2 to 0.5 days in constructed wetland respectively). The constructed wetland could successfully increase dissolved oxygen concentration, remove coliform bacteria and improve clarity (reduce turbidity) of water while maintaining neutral pH and low TSS values. Some additional post-treatments such as simple aeration and ultraviolet irradiation may improve the water quality further to meet the Class I Standard of potable water resource.																	2261-236X						2017	101								UNSP 04007	10.1051/matecconf/201710104007								WOS:000407968500064

Recently, water quality has been degraded due to diverse forms of pollution caused by disposal of human wastes, industrial wastes, automobile wastes. The increasing pollution affects water quality and the quality of people's life. Hence, water quality evaluation, monitoring, and prediction become an important and hot research subject. In the past, many environmental researchers have dedicated their research efforts on this subject using conventional approaches. Recently, many researchers begin to use the big data analytics approach to studying, evaluating, and predicting water quality due to the advances of big data applications and the availability of environmental sensing networks and sensor data. This paper reviews the published research results relating to water quality evaluation and prediction. Moreover, the paper classifies and compares the applied big data analytics approaches and big data based prediction models for water quality assessment. Furthermore, the paper also discusses the future research needs and challenges.																			978-1-5090-6318-5				2017							224	232		10.1109/BigDataService.2017.40								WOS:000408271500030

In this aquifer, spatiotemporal patterns of groundwater flow and chemistry were investigated during dry (October 2011) and wet (May 2012) seasons utilizing 25 shallow hand-dug wells. In addition, representative samples of snow, rock, and soil were collected and analyzed to constrain the PHREEQC inverse geochemical models used for simulating water-rock interaction (WRI) processes. Hydrochemistry of the aquifer shows a strong interseasonal variability where Mg-HCO3 and Mg-Ca-HCO3 water types are prevalent, reflecting the influence of ophiolitic and carbonate rocks on local groundwater chemistry. R-mode factor analysis of hydrochemical data hints at geochemical processes taking place in the groundwater system, that is, WRI involving Ca- and Si-bearing phases; WRI involving amorphous oxyhydroxides and clay minerals; WRI involving Mg-bearing phases; and atmospheric/anthropogenic inputs. Results from the PHREEQC modeling suggested that hydrogeochemical evolution is governed by weathering of primary minerals (calcite, chrysotile, forsterite, and chromite), precipitation of secondary minerals (dolomite, quartz, clinochlore, and Fe/Cr oxides), atmospheric/anthropogenic inputs (halite), and seasonal dilution from recharge.

Biological assessment of the Tang Sorkh River (Iran) using benthic macroinvertebrates	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												A biological assessment of the Tang Sorkh River (Iran) was studied from July 2013 to August 2014 using benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Samples were gathered every two months, from five stations using a Surber sampler(30x30cm), fixed in formalin (4%) and then separated and identified in the laboratory. Environmental conditions (current velocity, temperature, depth, width, dissolve oxygen, conductivity, pH, alkalinity, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and grain size) were measured. In addition, diversity and biotic indices were used to determine the water quality of the river. Results showed that 5 classes, 9 orders and 20 families were identified in this river. The families Hydropsychidae (Trichoptera), Simuliidae (Diptera) and Baetidae (Ephemeroptera) were dominant. Shannon-wiener and Simpson indices showed the highest diversity at station 1 and the lowest diversity in station 4. According to the Hilsenhoff, ASPT and BMWP indices, station 1 had good water quality for aquaculture.																	1562-2916						2017	16	3					1008	1020										WOS:000408236700012

The effects of Oncorhynchus mykiss culture on the limnological conditions of Hanna Reservoir, Isfahan, Iran	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												This study was conducted at the Hanna Reservoir located in the southwest of Isfahan Province. According to this study, chemical analyses were conducted to evaluate the magnitude and variations of COD, BOD5, O-2, NH3+ and NO2- concentrations in the Hanna Reservoir. In the headwaters the magnitude values of BOD5, COD and early morning oxygen minima were quite identical to the recommended optimum levels. However the concentrations of unionized ammonia in winter and spring and the concentration of nitrite in summer and autumn exceeded the allowable levels cited in different literature and might have exerted some growth retarding or lethal effects on the fish population. Water quality, zooplankton, benthos and sediments were monitored at sites of 20 m depths to determine the effects of rainbow trout cage culture on the lake environment. Oxygen depletion occurred in the vicinity of the farms due to respiration of the farmed fish. Zooplankton had stronger nutritional value in all six ecosystems of the Hanna Reservoir, and in seasons during which fish feed on these nutritional sources, breeding occurs with higher efficiency. Benthic invertebrates were rare at all six sites of the lake. The sediments below the cages had a pH and organic matter comparable to areas of the lake receiving the natural input of allochthonous material.																	1562-2916						2017	16	3					1085	1097										WOS:000408236700017

Collections of samples were realized regularly at monthly intervals, always about in the half of the month. Sampling sites were determined in order to assess the impact of natural and anthropogenic source of surface water quality. The results were compared from the limit values set out in Government Regulation No. 269/2010 Coll. The average value of BOD5 for the whole period was 1.58 mg O-2 dm(-3). The highest average concentration of biodegradable organic matter was in February and the minimum in May. Depending on the sampling site, we found the highest average value for the whole monitored period in the northeastern part of Cicov Reserve, and the lowest in the sampling site situated approximately 150 m from the mouth of Cilizian Stream in the reserve. The average value of CODcr for the entire monitored period represented 60.69 mg O-2 dm(-3). Depending on the time of sampling, minimum average value was in February and maximum in September. Depending on the sampling site, we found the highest average value for the whole monitored period in the sampling site located approximately 150 m from the mouth of the Gilizian. The average value of the BOD5/CODcr ratio during the years 2010, 2011, and 2013 was 0.026.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	4					1607	1613		10.15244/pjoes/67749								WOS:000408078000019

An experiment was performed in tanks consisting of three treatments: 1) without fish (control treatment, CON), 2) with fish unable to feed on submerged macrophytes (excretion treatment, EXCR), and 3) with fish swimming free (herbivory plus excretion treatment, HERB-EXCR). Treatments were conducted with varying macrophytic compositions (Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara, Ceratophyllum demersum L., and both species) and carp densities (low, medium, and high: 0.15, 0.30, and 0.45 g.L-1 respectively, in EXCR and HERB-EXCR). Results indicated that in EXCR and HERB-EXCR, water quality was better with a lower density of grass carp. In EXCR, the water quality in tanks with V. natans was worse than in other tanks, and water quality in C. demersum tanks was better under the HERB-EXCR treament. Compared to EXCR, grass carp in HERB-EXCR significantly increased concentrations of NH4+-N, NO2--N, and chlorophyll a. The effects on biomasses of protozoa, copepods, and total zooplankton in HERB-EXCR were greater than in the other treatments. Integrated analysis showed that grass carp herbivory on submerged macrophytes could be the central mechanism accounting for the changes in water quality and zooplankton communities.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	4					1681	1691		10.15244/pjoes/68855								WOS:000408078000026

In this study, multivariate statistical techniques, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to data on Yaglidere water quality. Thus, we aimed to determine main pollution factors and time risky polluted areas. During the study, water samples were taken by monitoring 23 physicochemical parameters at five different sites every month between June 2013 and May 2014. In addition, Pearson correlation was used to determine the relationships of all physico-chemical parameters. According to the results of HCA, five sampling areas were grouped into two clusters. From the PCA results, it may be estimated that river pollution is mainly from agricultural runoff and soil weathering, soil erosion, hydroelectric power plant installation activities, domestic disposal, and leaching from solid waste disposal sites. Consequently, the Yaglidere is of good quality according to the physico-chemical data by national and international permissible limits, but it is under pressure. These temporal and spatial scale effects indicate that water-monitoring schemes,need to be scaled-sensitive to water management for coming years.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	4					1715	1723		10.15244/pjoes/68952								WOS:000408078000029

In accordance with this statement, the objective of this study was to assess the water quality of "Las Piedras" river located in an Andean basin with 6626 ha in Colombian Highlands. This study analyzed nutrient inputs from agricultural production, spatial crops distribution, human activities and their influence on the ecological state of the river. The evaluation integrated physicochemical and biological parameters in the indexes of water quality, pollution and the aquatic macroinvertebrates community. Results showed that aggregated crop fields occupy 25.2 % in the basin and the biological water quality through the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) index denotes the presence of tolerant-pollution organisms, additionally the biodiversity was low (Shannon H 1.1). The water quality in the river satisfies the Colombian regulation criteria for human consumption, even higher concentrations of nutrients in the lower area with 2.20 mg/L nitrates and 1.49 mg/L of phosphates, besides the loss of nutrients by runoff, which was 2.57 mg/L nitrates in the middle area and 0.18 mg/L phosphates in the upper area. In this sense, the nutrient concentration input increases toward the lower area of the basin because of the crop distribution. The agricultural land use modified the hydrological ecosystem services by decreasing the basin water regulatory capacity and nutrients input to the main stream.																	0188-4999						2017	33	3					361	375		10.20937/RICA.2017.33.03.01								WOS:000408053400001

Economic perspectives on nitrogen in farming systems: managing trade-offs between production, risk and the environment	SOIL RESEARCH												Economic insights are crucial for making sound decisions about farm-level management of nitrogen and also about regional or national policy such as for water pollution. In the present review, key insights are presented from a large and diverse literature on the economics of nitrogen in agriculture and the economics of the consequences of nitrogen fertilisation. Issues covered include (1) the economics of nitrogen as an input to production, (2) nitrogen and economic risk at the farm level, (3) the economics of nitrogen fixation by legumes, (4) the existence of flat payoff functions, which often allow wide flexibility in decisions about nitrogen fertiliser rates, (5) explanations for over-application of nitrogen fertilisers by some farmers, and (6) the economics of nitrogen pollution at both the farm level and the policy level. Economics helps to explain farmer behaviour and to design strategies and policies that are more beneficial and more likely to be adopted and successfully implemented.

Estimating nitrogen excretion and deposition by lactating cows in grazed dairy systems	SOIL RESEARCH												Large N surpluses are a feature of most dairy farms worldwide. Despite the predominance of grazing systems in Australia, increasing animal densities and greater reliance on purchased feed mean that feed nutrient inputs and the role of grazing animals in N flows and deposited loads have grown. However, quantifying nutrient intakes and N excretion is difficult on commercial farms due to challenges in estimating pasture dry matter (DM) intake by grazing cattle. The aim of the present study was to quantify for commercial dairy farms, N excreted by lactating herds, the relative amounts of excreta N versus farm N inputs, and N loads deposited to different within-farm locations. Data were collected on at least five occasions from 43 diverse grazing system farms located in different climatic zones. An animal performance method for estimating annual DM intake was modified to calculate daily N intake and excretion and animal feed N use efficiency (NUE; milk N secreted/feed N intake). On average, these herds received 52% of their energy requirements from supplementary feeds despite the grazing base. Mean N intake (545g cow(-1) day(-1)), which greatly exceeded recommended dietary intakes, resulted in mean excretion of 433g N cow(-1) day(-1) and low mean NUE (21%; range 11-39%). Calculated annual N flows through the lactating herds were equivalent to 69% of total N inputs onto these farms. When excreted N was apportioned to the locations visited by the lactating herds, deposition to pasture paddocks was not uniform. Almost 50% more excreted N was deposited to paddocks that were closer to the dairy shed, and approximately twice as much N was returned to feedpads and holding areas as deposited in dairy sheds and yards, with the potential for N accumulation and loss in these places. On average, 20% more N was deposited as excreta on pasture paddocks by the lactating herd than was applied as commercial fertiliser (168 vs 141kg N ha(-1) respectively). These results demonstrate that quantifying excreta N loads and spatial nutrient distribution by lactating cows can assist in improving N management in grazing system dairy farms.																	1838-675X	1838-6768					2017	55	5-6					489	499		10.1071/SR17033								WOS:000408321100009

Two sampling stations were selected in the system, one in tropical forest areas restored after forest fires, and the other in unrestricted areas adjacent. The physicochemical parameters evaluated were dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, nitrites, nitrates, phosphates and conductivity, and the analysis of the community of macroinvertebrates was performed through biotic indexes of diversity, dominance and similarity. For the two study areas four classes were recorded (Gastropoda, Arachnida, Malacostraca, Clitellata and Insecta); 8 orders, 26 families and 25 macroinvertebrate morphotypes. As a result of the physical-chemical and biological quality analysis in the La Colorada quebrada for the study periods, an improvement was obtained in the water quality, where it is concluded that the restoration process has influence on the water system, Since this study showed a positive impact on some actions such as biological diversity, change in the physicochemical structure of the system, variation of microhabitats, changes in rainfall history of sampling times, nutrient contribution and productive capacity of the ecosystem.																	2027-8101					JAN-DEC	2017		9					77	91										WOS:000407839000007

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the situation of groundwater salinity in Mazandaran for use in agriculture. In this study, statistical analysis of collected data, proper semivariogram model selection, cross validation of predictions and preparing probabilistic and zoning maps using geostatistical tools in the ArcGIS software, were performed. To investigate the spatial variations and preparing zoning maps of water salinity, ordinary kriging (OK) was used and the zoning maps were prepared. Spatial structure of electrical conductivity (EC) assessment showed a moderate spatial dependence in most years. Zoning and probabilistic maps of EC showed that the salinity of groundwater will be added and the most probable salinity is related the lowland areas in the eastern part of the plain. The use of this groundwater for irrigation in the long term can decrease the rice yield and faced rice production with a serious risk. The results of the Mann-Kendall and the Sen tests indicated a decreasing trend in the area of groundwater with EC higher than one dS/m in Mazandaran plain that this expressing an improvement in the quality of groundwater in the plain.																	0352-3659	1846-6346					2017	34	1					119	139		10.15233/gfz.2017.34.4								WOS:000408100600007

Although many studies have been figure out of utilizing optical fibers as sensors for turbidity measurements, still the topographical map of suspended particles in water as rare as expected among all of works in literatures in this scope. The effect of suspended particles are highly affect the water quality which varies according to the source of these particles. A two dimensional array of optical fibers in a 1 litter rectangular plastic container with 2 cm cladding off sensing portion prepared to point out 632.8 nm laser power at each fiber location at the container center. The overall output map of the optical power were found in an inhomogeneous distribution such that the top to down layers of a present water sample show different magnitudes. Each sample prepared by mixing a distilled water with large grains sand, small grains sand, glucose and salt. All with different amount of concentration which measured by refractometer and turbidity meter. The measurements were done in different times i.e. from 10 min to 60 min.

Zooplankton Community of Lake Lebyazh'e (Kazan, Russia) under Changing Conditions	UCHENYE ZAPISKI KAZANSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA ESTESTVENNYE NAUKI												The paper presents the results of long-term observations (1991-2015) of zooplankton community in Lake Lebyazh'e (Kazan, Russia). Lake Lebyazh'e is a system of four water bodies: Bol'shoe, Maloe, Svetloe, and Sukhoe Lebyazh'e lakes, all interconnected with channels. Under the influence of anthropogenic and natural factors, a decrease of the water level and shrinkage of Lake Lebyazh'e took place. In order to save the valuable recreational facility, a range of hydrotechnical measures have been carried out. To date, the lake area has decreased by about 13 times; the water level is maintained artificially by supplying groundwater, which caused an increase in water mineralization, prevalence of sulfate ions. This, in turn, has led to changes in the structure of zooplankton community. The values of species composition have reduced significantly (by more than 20%). According to the recently obtained data, zooplankton of Lake Lebyazh'e comprises 44 species: 26 rotifer species (59%), 14 cladoceran species (32%), 4 copepod species (9%). New species, which were previously uncommon in the lake, have been found. It has been revealed that the range of dominant species of zooplankton changed, and their abundance decreased. The quantitative values of zooplankton decreased. It has been demonstrated that the abundance and bio-mass of zooplankton prior to the exposure corresponded to mesotrophic-eutrophic water bodies, but today's quantitative characteristics of zooplankton are more of oligotrophic water bodies. Based on Shannon's index, the species diversity of zooplankton has not decreased. However, most species are represented by either single or low number of individuals. This suggests that all organisms forming the community of Lake Lebyazh'e have evenly become less abundant. According to the saprobity index, the lake is beta-mesosaprobic, moderately polluted, and corresponds to class III of water quality. It has been concluded that the characteristics of zooplankton can be used as indicators to describe changes in the ecosystem initiated by variations in hydrological conditions, salinity, and main ions.

With the rapid development of environmental technology, TiO2 particle has become promising material to adsorb fluoride ion because of its low cost, non-toxic, good chemical stability, and good sorption ability. This work used sol-gel and hydrothermal synthesis methods to prepare TiO2 particles and load them onto SiO2 particles. The physicochemical properties such as heat stability, particle size, and surface area of the resulting TiO2 adsorbents were characterized with various analytical methods. In addition, their adsorption abilities to fluoride were determined under various conditions including different initial fluoride concentration, pH and coexisting ions. The maximum adsorption capacity of the TiO2 adsorbents can reach up to 94.3 mg/g. The adsorption isotherms of fluoride onto the TiO2 adsorbents can be closely described by the Langmuir model, suggesting the monolayer adsorption process.																	0954-2299	2047-6523					2017	29	1					25	32		10.1080/09542299.2016.1269617								WOS:000408007400004

More and more attention thus has been paid to understand the release mechanisms of nutrients from river sediments, especially in estuary and water transfer areas. In this work, flume experiments were conducted to measure the release characteristics of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and nitrogen (TDN) from sediments collected from a river bed near Lake Tai under various flow conditions. The release of TDP and TDN was the most dramatic in the initial 30 min, then slowed down from 30 to 60 min, and finally achieved equilibria. Total amount of TDP and TDN released and their equilibrium concentrations were all significantly increased with the increase of flow rate, but slow down after a critical velocity was reached, which could be described as a Logarithmic relationship. A process-based mathematical model was established to describe the distribution of nutrients in the water columns and model simulations matched experimental data well. The re-suspension of sediments induced by flow rate higher than the threshold, is the dominant process affecting nutrient release from sediments.																	0954-2299	2047-6523					2017	29	1					70	77		10.1080/09542299.2017.1320950								WOS:000408007400009

Impact of Mix Water Quality on Bentonite-Water Slurry for Soil-Bentonite Cutoff Wall Applications	GEOTECHNICAL FRONTIERS 2017: WASTE CONTAINMENT, BARRIERS, REMEDIATION, AND SUSTAINABLE GEOENGINEERING	Geotechnical Special Publication				3rd Conference on Geotechnical Frontiers	MAR 12-15, 2017	Orlando, FL	Ind Fabr Assoc Int, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Int Geosynthet Soc				The influence of mix water hardness and salinity on bentonite-water slurry used in soil-bentonite cutoff walls was investigated. Slurries prepared by blending 5-12% sodium bentonite with aqueous solutions containing CaCl2 and/or NaCl were tested for Marsh viscosity, filtrate loss, and bleed. Slurries containing 5% bentonite exhibited acceptable bleed, filtrate loss (<= 25 mL), and viscosity (32-45 s) when mixed with solutions containing <= 5 mM CaCl2 (hardness <= 500 mg/L) and <= 50 mM NaCl (salinity <= 2,900 mg/L). Increasing the CaCl2 concentration to 10 mM or the NaCl concentration to >= 100 mM yielded inadequate viscosity and excessive filtrate loss, but these properties were improved by increasing the bentonite content to 6 or 7 %. Slurries prepared with water containing 25 mM CaCl2 (hardness approximate to 2,500 mg/L) required 12 % bentonite to exhibit acceptable viscosity, filtrate loss, and bleed. Overall, hardness had a greater impact on the slurries relative to salinity.																	0895-0563		978-0-7844-8043-4				2017		276					468	477										WOS:000406406400048

Comparison of Various Filter Media Mixtures' Hydraulic Properties from a Laboratory Testing Program	GEOTECHNICAL FRONTIERS 2017: WASTE CONTAINMENT, BARRIERS, REMEDIATION, AND SUSTAINABLE GEOENGINEERING	Geotechnical Special Publication				3rd Conference on Geotechnical Frontiers	MAR 12-15, 2017	Orlando, FL	Ind Fabr Assoc Int, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Int Geosynthet Soc				This paper describes the laboratory investigation of hydraulic properties in filter media mixtures designed for use in bioslopes along roadways. The accumulation of pollutants on roadways can result in contaminated stormwater runoff that has a negative effect on receiving water quality, groundwater quality, and aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, roadways increase impervious surface area resulting in an increase in runoff volume and peak discharge intensity. Therefore, current requirements focus on retention of the first inch (2.54 cm) of highway stormwater runoff. Current Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) specifications were developed using mixtures of clean sand and organic compost. However, mixtures of locally available organic materials in rural areas have not been tested. While there are industry-accepted methods of measuring infiltration rates in situ (i.e., the double ring infiltrometer and the modified Phillip-Dunne infiltrometer (MPDI)), there is no current standard for testing new mixtures on a smaller scale prior to field implementation. This project compares filter media mixtures to material passing current MnDOT specifications using a laboratory testing program. Laboratory constant and falling head tests were used to determine steady-state infiltration rate on samples using different combinations of various locally available organic material with screened sand or taconite tailings. Data from new filter media mixtures are compared to filter material passing current MnDOT specifications. Alternative media mixtures of peat, muck and taconite tailings were found to match the hydraulic conductivity of compost-sand mixtures. These results indicate that alternative media mixtures are suitable for stormwater biofiltration applications, allowing the authors to select mixtures for larger-scale field testing. Applying this laboratory testing program to previously untested filter media mixtures will allow for better design of filter media mixtures.																	0895-0563		978-0-7844-8043-4				2017		276					534	541										WOS:000406406400055						
J	Li, HQ; Zheng, F; Zhao, YY				Li Hong-qing; Zheng Fei; Zhao Yao-yang			Farmer behavior and perceptions to alternative scenarios in a highly intensive agricultural region, south central China	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE												Intensive agriculture has caused unintended environmental consequences, such as water quality degradation. It is necessary for policymakers to make proper planning of sustainable agricultural development. Using a Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework, we conducted surveys focused on farmer behavior toward agriculture and environmental protection in 2009 and 2011. The surveys indicated that farmer behavior was complex and contradictory, and caused some environmental effects. Therefore, we used normative landscape scenario method to develop two scenarios. Both scenarios emphasized on stable economic growth along with water quality improvement and presented good effects. A feedback survey was organized in 2013 to interpret farmers' perceptions of the alternative scenarios. The results indicate Scenario I is likely to be accepted by farmers; however, the beautiful rural landscape in Scenario II represents what farmers want, and Scenario I or II can be achieved by changing farm behavior in the future. By logistic regression model analysis, increasing agriculture benefits and new technology popularization were key factors affecting farmer behavior. Relevant policy implications on farmers were proposed. This paper showed how important to understand farmer behavior and perceptions to agricultural development, and a description of the alternative scenarios and policy implications are meaningful for policymakers to manage nature resources.																	2095-3119						2017	16	8					1852	1864		10.1016/S2095-3119(16)61547-2								WOS:000408078300022

Water samples were collected from 10 sampling points located along the median line of the lake at different depths (at surface, at 5 m, 10 m, 15 m and 20 m). The experiments were carried out in the winter, spring, summer and autumn of 2015. We determined the concentration - depth profiles, both for the heavy metals iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and also for sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). We determined the concentrations of heavy metals by atomic absorption spectrometry. We found that concentrations of heavy metals increase with depth. Generally, the concentrations of heavy metals are within the legal limits for the water used as drinking water sources. Mathematical models with high correlation coefficients were obtained in the case of heavy metal concentrations depending on depth and also for the seasonality of heavy metals upload.

We found only eight out of 79 sites in the Nam River areas. The habitats were greatly reduced and restricted compared with the historic sites, which mainly cause from habitat modification, such as various types of river renovations at the main stream and tributary streams of the Nakdong River. The present habitats are higher water temperature and more number of fish species than the absent ones, but conductivity, total nitrogen, and number of weir are lower. In addition, the present sites are lower low velocity at pool and higher mean substrate at pool. From this study, we suggest that maintaining good water quality and preventing anthropogenic impacts greatly aid conservation of the M. rapidus in South Korea.																	1976-8354	2151-2485					2017	21	4					286	293		10.1080/19768354.2017.1347104								WOS:000407966700008

This article examines this question in the context of the cleanup of illegal dumpsites organized by a Slovenian NGO, Ecologists without Borders, in 2010. This community cleanup effort sought to produce local public goods such as improved aesthetics, sanitation, and ground water quality. Local participation levels (percentage of adults contributing to the cleanup effort) varied across 192 districts of Slovenia. Analyzing an original, micro-level dataset, this article finds that, all else equal, social capitals rooted in frequent faceto- face interactions (the common Catholic religion and membership in Hunters clubs) are associated with increased participation levels. However, social capital generated via common native language does not show statistical association with participation levels.																	2194-6035	2154-3348				JAN	2017	8	1					25	44		10.1515/npf-2016-0025								WOS:000407855400003

Calibration of these devices requires sampling campaigns to elaborate relations between recorded spectra and measured concentrations. In order to build robust calibration data sets, several spectra must be recorded per sample. This study compares two approaches - principal component analysis and data depth theory - to identify outliers and select the most representative spectrum (MRS) among the repetitively recorded spectra. Detection of samples that contain outliers is consistent between the methods in more than 70% of the samples. Identification of spectra as outliers is consistent in more than 95% of the cases. The identification of MRS differs depending on the approach used. In their current form, both of the proposed approaches can be used for outlier detection and identification. Further studies are suggested to combine the methods and develop an automated ranking and sorting system.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	9					908	921		10.1080/1573062X.2017.1280515								WOS:000407953200004

A representative water quantity and quality safeguard system served urban lake, including multi-source water supply facilities, recirculating water purification facilities and surplus water discharge facilities, is widely used in Chinese water deficient cities. Because it is complicated, any mismanagement will result in water quality deterioration, water waste and high operation cost.

Impact of combined sewer overflow on urban river hydrodynamic modelling: a case study of the Chicago waterway	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Combined sewer overflow (CSO) can be a critical inflow source for urban rivers during storm events. This paper presents a case study of the Chicago waterway. A three-dimensional (3D) river hydrodynamic model was developed and integrated with an urban rainfall-runoff model using the Open Modelling Interface (OpenMI). Both the effects of CSO discharge on river and river water levels on CSO outlets were considered by the integrated model. A historical storm, which was similar to a 100-year return period rain event, was simulated and compared with field measurements. This study highlights the necessity of quantifying CSO for hydraulic modelling of urban rivers under extreme storm event conditions, and shows that an integrated hydrologic and hydraulic approach can be used to address this challenge. The 3D river hydrodynamic model can deal with the complex hydrodynamics at river confluences and provide better hydrodynamic results for water quality modelling in the future.

In particular, the ion content of river water and precipitation are assessed for two distinct periods (October-December of years 1992 and 2011). These time frames are characterized by a change of air quality management rules for the study area which came into force after year 2000. Furthermore, late Autumn months, which are considered in this study, are characterized by a peak of recorded precipitations in the area under study. Moreover, this is a period of the year where atmospheric emission intensity and distribution are greater with respect to Spring and Summer. The chemical nature of the monitored water body was assessed through the use of Piper diagram. Research found evidence of erosional processes, which chemically altered the water compared to the quality of precipitation. The signature of air chemistry was also evident, through a shift to less sulphate, after the change of air quality regulations introduced in year 2000. The presence of marine ions, in case of major weather perturbations, typical of the late Autumn in the monitored area, was recorded. This fact was particularly evident for the month of November 2011, in association to a major flooding event occurred in the Piemonte Region. The presence of a minor ionic component, associated to rainfall waters, depending upon soil particle resuspension and transport was also detected. Finally, the prevailing origin of the measured ions was defined. The results show the importance of improved management actions, which should be taken in order to further reduce the trans-boundary atmospheric pollution, which constitutes a threat to water quality and a further element of indirect water pollution transfer across different areas.

Many integrated system models have been developed since the 1970s. However, their fixed structure limits flexibility and applicability in urban landscape lakes. An ecosystem dynamic model was constructed to simulate ecological restoration of an urban shallow lake under the interference of chlorine. The model was validated using the monitoring data of an urban lake in Guangzhou. The correlation coefficient (R), root mean squareerror-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) and index of agreement (IOA) were calculated to evaluate accuracy and reliability of the model and their values for all of the compared variables were significant, less than 0.7, and larger than 0.6, respectively, which reflected good agreement of the model. The results give important insight into understanding eutrophic dynamic process in urban shallow lake. Furthermore, the exhibit model has great applicability in management of urban shallow lakes.

This review sums up the outcomes of various research studies conducted for drinking water quality status of different areas of Pakistan by taking into account the physicochemical properties of drinking water as well as the presence of various pathogenic microorganisms. About 20% of the whole population of Pakistan has access to safe drinking water. The remaining 80% of population is forced to use unsafe drinking water due to the scarcity of safe and healthy drinking water sources. The primary source of contamination is sewerage (fecal) which is extensively discharged into drinking water system supplies. Secondary source of pollution is the disposal of toxic chemicals from industrial effluents, pesticides, and fertilizers from agriculture sources into the water bodies. Anthropogenic activities cause waterborne diseases that constitute about 80% of all diseases and are responsible for 33% of deaths. This review highlights the drinking water quality, contamination sources, sanitation situation, and effects of unsafe drinking water on humans. There is immediate need to take protective measures and treatment technologies to overcome unhygienic condition of drinking water supplies in different areas of Pakistan.

Water samples were collected on 11 December 2016 from the springs Vidovec, Bacun, Bliznec, the spring at the top of the Leustek trail and from the Queen's Well. The number of total heterotrophic bacteria, faecal coliforms, intestinal enterococci and bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas as well as the concentrations of suspended solids and pH of water were determined. The analysis results indicate that water from the springs Vidovec, Bacun and Bliznec was suitable for drinking at the sampling time, whereas water from the spring at the top of the Leustek trail (due to excessive heterotrophic bacteria numbers) and water from the Queen's Well (due to Escherichia coli found in one sample) were unsuitable for drinking at the sampling time. In order to gain a more comprehensive insight regarding the suitability for drinking of water from the investigated springs, a systemic monitoring of water quality should be performed.																	1330-1144						2017	25	99					13	16										WOS:000407249700003

Varying numbers of water heating elements and water levels in the evaporator unit were analyzed to determine the ideal device configuration. The distillation device consisted of a container unit, a water level control unit, and an evaporation chamber unit. Distillation was conducted in two experiments, one with a water level of 8 cm and the other, 4 cm, in the evaporation unit. Each experiment comprised eight tests, in which 1-6 water heating elements were used in various configurations; identical configurations were used in both experiments. The seawater used was obtained from the Indian Ocean off Balekambang Beach, Malang Regency, Indonesia. The largest purified water volume obtained among the 16 experimental conditions was 3.94 L at a cost of IDR 790 per liter. The effectiveness percentage toward water quality improvement in terms of pH, electrical conductivity, TDS, and maximum salinity was 9.88%, 99.98%, 99.96%, and 100%, respectively. In the future, a full-scale experiment will be conducted on site. The use of this device will therefore benefit people in areas with water scarcity.

Recent declines in abundance of this species have driven progressive management actions throughout its range, including protection of spawning females by establishing "no-take" zones on the Atlantic coast. To date, no-take zones have not been established in the western Gulf of Mexico, although annual closures associated with mitigation of derelict traps exist in both Texas and Louisiana. In this study, we used long-term data acquired via fishery-independent sampling by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to assess spatial and seasonal distribution of spawning females in order to inform future evaluations of no-take areas. The presence of spawning females was modeled statistically by using water quality and spatial variables as predictors. Distance to the nearest Gulf pass was the most reliable predictor of presence, accounting for over 43% of the deviance observed in models from two independent sampling eras. Salinity (>21% of deviance) and temperature (>12% of deviance) were also reliable predictors, and the values of salinity and temperature that were associated with peak presence remained consistent over an approximately 30-year span despite increasing mean annual values of both variables through time. Peak presence in spawning grounds now occurs in early spring (March-April), contrasting with historical peak presence in the summer (June-July). These data imply seasonal shifts in spawning behavior despite relative spatial consistency through time, suggesting that Gulf pass areas would be ideal for protection of spawning blue crabs via no-take zones if such a measure is deemed necessary.																	0275-5947	1548-8675					2017	37	4					920	934		10.1080/02755947.2017.1335255								WOS:000407192600019						
J	Liu, F; Sun, JC; Wang, J; Zhang, Y				Liu, Fan; Sun, Jichao; Wang, Jia; Zhang, Ying			Groundwater acidification in shallow aquifers in Pearl River Delta, China: Distribution, factors, and effects	GEOCHEMICAL JOURNAL												The improper discharge has brought many environment problems in Pearl River Delta, China. As important reserve resources, groundwater resources have been affected by acidification. It is urgent to clarify the mechanism of groundwater acidification and take measures to alleviate this situation. The purposes of this study were to determine the main factor causing groundwater acidification in shallow aquifers, to quantify and analyze the hazard of acid precipitation on groundwater, and to analyze the characteristics of groundwater chemistry under acid precipitation. Acid rain hazard index (AHI) was defined and introduced to characterize the effects of the actual input of hydrogen ion on groundwater. The techniques of geographic information system (GIS) and principal components analysis (PCA) were used in this new analysis method. By analyzing the groundwater chemical data of 407 samples and meteorological data, the results showed that acid rain was the dominant factor leading to groundwater acidification rather than pyrite oxidation. Four principle components were derived. PC1 represented seawater intrusion effect and was consisted of Cl-, Na+, Mg2+ and TDS. PC2 demonstrated the water-rock interactions occurred in acidic groundwater environment, which was consisting of pH, Ca2+, HCO3-, PO43- and SO42-. PC3 represented agricultural activities with the variables of K+ and NO3-. PC4 was associated with Mn2+, Al and AHI and represented the directly influence resulting from the input of acid deposition. Therefore, to strengthen supervision of discharge and improve the industrial desulfurization technology could alleviate the deterioration of acidification.																	0016-7002	1880-5973					2017	51	4					373	384		10.2343/geochemj.2.0476								WOS:000406535000008

Water quality was determined at five stations in the reservoir at three different depths and one downstream station. The results show that seasons impacted the water quality of the Bakun Reservoir, particularly in the deeper water column. Significantly lower turbidity, SRP, and TP were found during the wet season. At 3-6m, the oxygen content fell below 5 mg/L and hypoxia was also recorded. Low NO2--N, NO3--N, and SRP and high BOD5, OKN, and TP were observed in the reservoir indicating organic pollution. Active logging activities and the dam construction upstream resulted in water quality deterioration. The outflow decreased the temperature, DO, and pH and increased the turbidity and TSS downstream. Elevated organic matter and nutrients downstream are attributable to domestic discharge along the river. This study shows that the downstream river was affected by the discharge through the turbines, the spillway operations, and domestic waste. Therefore, all these factors should be taken into consideration in the downstream river management for the health of the aquatic organisms.

J	Spitale, D				Spitale, Daniel			Performance of the STAR_ICMi macroinvertebrate index and implications for classification and biomonitoring of rivers	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Although biomonitoring is the core approach adopted by the European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD), many biotic indices still lack a thorough analysis of their performance and uncertainty. The multihabitat sampling and the application of STAR_ICMi index on macroinvertebrates are the standard methods to assess the ecological status of rivers in Italy. Ever since the Italians' implementation, dates back to 2010, few studies have tested the index performance with different sampling efforts, and even rarer are those assessing index uncertainty. However, these are worthwhile topics to investigate because all the Environmental Agencies are applying this index with both ecological and economic consequences. Aims of this study were (i) to assess the effect of subsampling on the STAR_ICMi index, (ii) to propose a standard method to calculate the index precision, and (iii) to test several less time-consuming alternatives to census all the individuals in the sample. I showed that the index is strongly affected by subsampling, and unbiased comparisons of ecological status can only be done at the same sampling effort. The index precision, calculated by bootstrapping the observed abundance of taxa, was so low in some circumstances, to increase the risk of misclassification. Finally, I showed that to avoid counting all the individuals in a sample, it is possible to estimate the most abundant taxa using a rank-abundance model. With this less time-consuming method, the STAR_ICMi index is predicted with sufficient precision.																	1961-9502						2017		418							20	10.1051/kmae/2017012								WOS:000406714700001						
J	Tronstad, LM; Hotaling, S				Tronstad, Lusha M.; Hotaling, Scott			Long-term trends in aquatic ecosystem bioassessment metrics are not influenced by sampling method: empirical evidence from the Niobrara River	KNOWLEDGE AND MANAGEMENT OF AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS												Choosing an aquatic invertebrate samplingmethod for biomonitoring depends upon study goals, resources, and ecosystem conditions. In this study, we compared two methods that are widely used in stream ecology, but have not been directly compared: Hester-Dendy (HD) and Hess sampling. Hester-Dendy sampling uses artificial substrate that invertebrates colonize over a specific period of time. In contrast, Hess samplers surround a fixed area of natural substrate with a net. To compare approaches, we combined 5 years of simultaneous HD and Hess data collection (2010-2014) from the Niobrara River with a 14-year (1996-2009) historical HD data set for the same study sites. We used this full 19-year data set to assess how ecosystem health has changed in the Niobrara River over time, while also testing the influence of HD versus Hess data (20102014) on historical trends (1996-2009). Our results showed that HD samples are more taxonomically variable and bias bioassessment metrics because they collect more sensitive taxa versus Hess sampling. However, when combined with the 1996-2009 HD data set, both recent HD and Hess data sets recovered the same trend of declining ecosystem health in the Niobrara River. These results provide empirical evidence that even when historical HD data are combined with recent Hess data, long-term bioassessment trends remain unchanged despite more accurate perspectives of invertebrate assemblages being collected.																	1961-9502						2017		418							28	10.1051/kmae/2017020								WOS:000406714700009

Maritsa River, located in the Thracian Valley, Balkan Peninsula, on the territory of Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, is one of them. Apart the water quantity, the performance of irrigated agriculture depends also on its quality. In the present study, the quality of Maritsa River water as a source for irrigation was assessed at two monitoring points (MPs) in Bulgaria-MP-1 (upper river) and MP-2 (middle course of the river). The samples were taken in June and August 2014 and 31 physicochemical and microbiological parameters were screened. Water sampling and preparation were performed according to Bulgarian standard complied with ISO standards. Physicochemical parameters were determined spectrophotometricaly, by Multi/340i SET and AAS. For the estimation of total and specific microbial load, selective chromogenic culture medium sheets were used. It was found that river water quality meets the requirements of Bulgarian standard for irrigation water with respect to: temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total hardness, Ca, Mg, dissolved oxygen, BOD5, COD, N-NH4 (except for June), N-NO3, SO42-, P-PO4 (except for August), suspended solids (except for June), Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Cd, Cr and As. Deviations from the standard were observed for all microbiological parameters at both MPs. The metal concentrations decrease in the order of Fe>Zn>Ni>Pb>Cr>Cu>As>Mn>Cd. Many significant correlations were revealed between controlled water parameters.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	7					4367	4374										WOS:000406355800007

Construction activities usually include dredging, filling, soil excavation or replacement; whereas the operations phase involves anchoring, shading, as well as extensive human activity in a small scale area. These activities may impact the marine environment through physical and chemical disturbances including an increase in the rate of sedimentation, discharge of chemicals, nutrient enrichment, increased wastewater, oil spills, increase in organic matter and heavy metals loads as well as solid waste generation, etc. This paper provides guidelines for conducting an EIA of a fishing port in a semi-enclosed water body, such as the Arabian Gulf or the Red Sea. The purpose of the guidelines is to outline issues that may be relevant to the design and construction of the port and to identify important factors for consideration in an EIA study. Elements to be studied in depth include impacts on water quality, sediment and habitat loss. The paper also provides suggested mitigation measures for minimizing potential impacts along with key aspects to be considered in the development of an adequate Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	7					4504	4516										WOS:000406355800023						
J	Sonmez, F				Sonmez, Feray			OCCURRENCE OF EPILITHIC DIATOMS IN A STREAM WITH CLEAN WATER CONDITIONS: HARINGET STREAM, TURKEY	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												In the study, species composition of diatoms and their seasonal variations in epilithic associations occurring in a clean water stream (Haringet) were determined between January and December 2014. Sampling was performed monthly at three stations chosen in upper, middle and lower parts of the stream. Water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solid matter, dissolved oxygen, flow rate, total hardness, total alkalinity, organic matter, salinity, nitrate, ortho-phosphate, sulfate and silica values in water were measured and analysed monthly. A total of 48 diatom taxa all belonging to pennales were identified throughout the study. Members of the genera Cymbella, Diatoma, Epithemia, Gomphonema, Navicula, Nitzschia and Surirella were common epilithic diatoms in the Stream. Nitzschia was the richest in species composition. Cocconeis pediculus, Cymbella affinis, C. helvetica, Diatoma elongata, Fragilaria acus, Gomphonema intricatum, G. olivaceum, Navicula radiosa, Nitzschia sigmoidea and Ulnaria ulna were noticable diatoms with respect to frequency of occurence and individual numbers in epilithon at all stations. Variations in occurrence of diatom species and their abundance were compared at stations and discussed in relation to physical and chemical properties of stream water. The physicochemical values yielded that Haringet Stream has Class I Water Quality according to the Inland Water Quality Criteria. This finding is somehow supported by the occurrence of certain clean water diatom species.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	7					4774	4782										WOS:000406355800059

Using historical climate dataset, stream flow, and water quality data, the improved export coefficient model (IECM) was selected to simulate changes in TN and TP loads characteristics under different hydrological year. The results demonstrate that: 1) The major source of TN and TP was livestock, which accounted for 49.4% of the total, followed by rural living (26%), land use (24.6%), while for the TP ranked differently from those of TN with rural living first (71%), followed by livestock (26.15%) and land use (2.85%); 2) The impacts of precipitation amount change on pollution load are relatively greater when compared to the impacts of rural living, livestock and poultry breeding and land use pollution load increase; the effects from rainfall increment leads to approximately 24% and 27% increases of TN and TP pollution load, respectively; 3) The high-risk areas of TN and TP load were distributed accordance to the amount of precipitation in different hydrological years and the most of the CSAs were locates beside the main stream. Total nitrogen and total phosphorous load per unit area in Miyun, Chicheng and Fengning counties were higher than others. These data will be useful and valuable in evaluating potential NPS pollution load for the control of watershed pollution in the future and understanding its migration and transformation in a large-scale watershed where meteorological and hydrological data are mutative.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	7					4808	4816										WOS:000406355800063

Water Quality Index (WQI), Metal Index (MI), Hazard Quotient (HQ), Hazard Index, and Cancer Risk were calculated in order to evaluate the water quality of these lakes. Correlation analysis revealed that Mn and Fe were derived from natural geological weathering processes and Pb, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd might have originated from anthropogenic sources. The results revealed that WQI of the remote lake fell into excellent water quality and urban lake fell into poor water quality, which is also supported by the MI calculation. Moreover, the HQ of Mn in urban lake showed values greater than unity suggesting its health risk to the local inhabitants. The cancer index values indicated "high" risk due to Cr, whereas Cd possesses "very low" cancer risk on local population residing nearby areas.

The translocation factors (TFs) and bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) for heavy metals in O. sativa and estimated daily intake (EDI) and health risk index (HRI) were measured. The samples were analyzed for heavy metals using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Pb and Cr concentrations in water samples within and near the electronic-waste dumping area exceeded water quality standards for surface water sources from the Pollution Control Department in the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Thailand (PCD). The Pb concentration in soil samples within the area also exceeded soil quality standards for habitat and agriculture from PCD. Most of the metals were highly concentrated in roots, except for Mn which has the highest concentration in leaves. Pb concentrations in rice grains exceeded the FAO/ WHO standard (0.2 mg/kg). The average TF values for heavy metals from the soil to roots, roots to stems, stems to leaves, and stems to grains were Mn > Pb > Ni > Cr, Mn > Cr > Ni > Pb, Ni > Pb > Mn > Cr, and Pb > Ni > Cr > Mn, respectively. The average BAF values in O. sativa were Mn > Ni > Pb > Cr. The EDI for Cr, Pb, Mn, and Ni via O. sativa consumption were 6.19, 6.02, 370.57, and 3.80 mg/kg/day, respectively.

Reducing groundwater extraction is a primary method for alleviating these problems. However, this reduction may create new pollution issues because of an increase in groundwater vulnerability. A case study was done using the DRAOTIC evaluation method (an improved DRASTIC method for organic pollutant in aquifer vulnerability; soil (S factor) has been updated by organic matter (O factor) in the method) for the Hun River Basin, northeastern China, where groundwater intensive extraction had caused serious environmental and hydrogeological problems. The assessment results show that moderate vulnerability level is the main vulnerability level in the Hun River Basin; high vulnerability level and low vulnerability level categories occupy a smaller area; while very high and very low vulnerability categories occupy the smallest area. By combining the predicted groundwater level distribution and DRAOTIC model, the responses of groundwater vulnerability to different groundwater extraction reductions could be studied. The results show that groundwater vulnerability levels increased as groundwater extraction was reduced; this is because the rising groundwater levels make it easier for pollution coming from the surface to reach the aquifer. The more the reduction in groundwater extraction, the greater the increase in the area with higher vulnerability levels, and the greater the increase in pollution risk.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	5					1121	1139		10.1080/10807039.2017.1300858								WOS:000406365900011

The problem of coastal groundwater salinity was tackled by considering its hydrological, agronomic and economic aspects. Economic analysis for competitive use vs. regulated management regimes was carried out, considering constant and adaptive watering techniques. We concentrate on the farmers' perspective of water as an input in agriculture, and assess discounted net present value over a period of 30 years. The ultimate goal of this research is to raise the awareness of farmers and policy makers by demonstrating the economic impacts (from the farmer's point of view) of over-exploitation. Our findings for Apulia Region (Southern Italy) indicate that the slowness of the long-term effect of salinity and the ability of farmers to adapt irrigation profiles suggest broadening the perspective of policy intervention. For an effective management of this common resource, policy makers should follow a more comprehensive approach based on economic analysis.																	1943-815X	1943-8168					2017	14	1					59	72		10.1080/1943815X.2017.1351993								WOS:000406721700001

J	Chen, CS; Lin, HL				Chen, Chienhsun; Lin, Hui-Ling			Applying Benthic Foraminiferal Assemblage to Evaluate the Coral Reef Condition in Dongsha Atoll lagoon	ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES												Coral reefs in the South China Sea are threatened by environmental changes and anthropogenic disruptions. Foraminifera, a group of unicellular shelled protists, has been considered a reliable indicator of water quality and reef health. However, this indicator has not yet been used to study coral reefs in the South China Sea. In this study of foraminifera in the lagoon of Dongsha Atoll, both the assemblage diversity and the functional group composition were investigated. The FORAM index (FI), a numerical indicator based on functional group composition, was used to evaluate the condition of the coral reef of the Atoll lagoon. A typical assumption is that FI = 4 is the minimum index value corresponding to a suitable environment for the growth of calcifying organisms. Environments with FI values between 2 and 4 are unsuitable to marginal for recovery of coral communities after a mortality event. Data were recorded regarding a total of 287 foraminiferal species. Approximately 68% of the tests belonged to the porcelaneous taxa; the Quinqueloculina, Triloculina, and Pseudomassilina species were well represented. Hyaline foraminifera were less abundant than porcelaneous foraminifera; the agglutinated foraminifera were the least abundant. Multivariate analyses revealed four clustering groups. The functional groups were classified according to FI's definition; the heterotrophic group was the most abundant, accounting for 82% of foraminiferal abundance. The symbiont-bearing group was the second most abundant, with a relative abundance of 12%; and the stress-tolerant group was the least abundant. Two samples had FI values slightly higher than 4; Amphisorus and Calcarina were dominant, but the other symbiont-bearing foraminifera had lower values. These high FI values can be associated with seagrass meadows or relict shells in an altered environment. Eighty percent of the sediment samples had FI values lower than 4, indicating that most of the benthic habitats in the Dongsha lagoon are not suitable for coral growth and reef recovery. The present findings provide an alternative evaluation method based on foraminiferal assemblages for future studies on the environmental changes of coral reefs.																	1021-5506	1810-522X					2017	56								20	10.6620/ZS.2017.56-20								WOS:000406790900013

DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF A MODEL WATER RECIRCULATING SYSTEM FOR INCUBATION AND REARING OF Cyprinus carpio	BANATS JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												This study was designed to design and construct a model Water Recirculatory System and use same to carryout induced breeding and larvae rearing of Cyprinus carpio using hormonal techniques. A simple 660 litres capacity Water Recirculation System (WRS) technology was developed, built and evaluated for this study. The WRS was designed and constructed in relation to waste production and waste removal kinetics. The system rearing troughs were made of black and white rectangular plastic containers. Efficiency of the design method and the effect of color of rearing unit were tested on growth performance and survival of Cyprinus carpio hatchlings, to assess the technical functionality of the system. The experiment was divided into two phases; artificial propagation of each Fish species using synthetic hormone and rearing the Fry for 14 days; and rearing the 14 days old fry for 42 days. In the first phase of the experiment, hatchability was estimated, while in the second phase, growth performance and nutrient utilization were investigated. Daily water replacement was maintained at 10 % of total volume of water in the WRS throughout the experimental period. Results of breeding/rearing trial gave high survival rate and fast growth rate of hatchlings. Hatchability results indicated that Black troughs had higher hatchability rate of 69.80 +/- 0.55 than white troughs 67.45 +/- 0.99. There was no significant difference (p>0.05) between the Treatments in Mean Weight Gain (MWG), Specific Growth Rate (SGR), Food Conversion Ratio (FCR), Food Conversion Efficiency (FCE) and Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER). High % Shooters was recorded in Black troughs than in white troughs for the specie studied. % Survival rate was high (71.33 %) in Black troughs than in white troughs (53.33 %). Based on the results of the water quality parameter analysis, the system was technically able to deliver optimum water quality for Fish growth and survival of Cyprinus carpio incubated and reared within system facility. This study revealed that the designed system can be used to incubate and culture hatchlings of Cyprinus carpio.																	2068-4673					JAN-JUN	2017	8	15					5	11		10.7904/2068-4738-VIII(15)-5								WOS:000406340500001

Water Quality Assessment of the South-Eastern Part of Lake Lanao, Philippines	INTERNATIONAL LETTERS OF NATURAL SCIENCES												This paper aimed at underlying some physico-chemical characteristics of the water of Lake Lanao at Poona-bayabao, Lanao Del Sur during the first quarter of 2015, by evaluating a total of eight (8) water quality parameters. Physical parameters were temperature, depth, transparency, and total suspended solids. On the other hand, the chemical parameters were pH, dissolved oxygen, phosphate and nitrate. Three sampling stations were considered in the study. Community's knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes towards the utilization and condition of the lake were also evaluated through interview. Results showed that all assessed physico-chemical parameters still conformed to the Philippines standards set by Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) for fresh surface water as Class A as for the year 2015. One-way Anova showed no significant difference in the overall average of the physico-chemical characteristics in the three sampling stations of Lake Lanao (p > 0.05). With the results obtained, the Lake can still be a source of water supply that require complete treatment in order to meet National Standards for Drinking Water (NSDW) of the Philippines, within the year of the conduct of the study. For the assessment of community's knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes, Kruskal-Wallis test showed that the knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes are not significantly different in terms of stations. A more comprehensive and wider range monitoring is recommended for future study about the lake.																	2300-9675						2017	63						34	41		10.18052/www.scipress.com/ILNS.63.34								WOS:000406299800005

The monitoring was performed during the minimum and maximum rainfall periods. The concentrations of As, Cr, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn in water exceeded the permissible limits set by the Interim National Water Quality Standards for Malaysia (INWQS). The risk index (RI) values determined for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn in sediment presented a low degree of ecological risk. The order of the top three heavy metals measured in fish muscle was Zn >F e> Al. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of As and Cr exceeded the allowable limits in both rainfall periods. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) values of Zn in water hyacinth were 24.865 and 3.214, respectively. The concentrations of Cu and Zn in the plant tissue were significantly correlated (p < .05) with the concentrations of heavy metals in water. Overall, climbing perch and water hyacinth are excellent bioindicators of environmental impacts on water bodies.																	0275-7540	1029-0370					2017	33	7					637	651		10.1080/02757540.2017.1351553								WOS:000406482600004

Variations in carbon-to-phosphorus ratios of two Australian strains of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskiis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The toxic cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii can form large blooms in freshwater systems, causing water quality problems. The availability of the essential macronutrient phosphorus (P), has a big impact on bloom formation but the variation in physiological response of different strains of C. raciborskii to available P has not previously been examined. This study investigated the carbon:phosphorus (C:P) ratio of two toxic Australian strains of C. raciborskii, AWT205 and NPD, under a range of P concentrations in batch and continuous cultures. P was added as a single dose to batch cultures and in continuous cultures at P concentrations of 0.032, 0.16, 0.64 and 16 mol P l(-1). Cellular carbon and phosphorus content of both strains increased under P-limited conditions (0 mol P l(-1) addition) with zero growth. Strain NPD had a lower C:P ratio (34:1) than AWT205 (150:1) indicating higher P storage capacity, and strain NPD survived P-limited conditions for longer. There was no significant difference in exponential growth rates (0.2 d(-1), P 0.5) under all P concentrations for both strains, with the exception of no P, demonstrating non-P-limited growth even at the lowest concentration (0.032 mu mol P l(-1)) and no increase in growth rate with additional P. P-33 uptake measurements were used to show that these strains both have very low half saturation constants (K-s = 0.02 mol P l(-1)) compared with other phytoplankton and strains of C. raciborskii. This is indicative of high uptake affinities and suggests that these strains are highly adapted to a low P supply. Overall the results of this study are consistent with the P strategy of storage prioritization over growth rate, and demonstrate differences between the strains in the C:P ratio under P-limitation, indicating variation in P storage.

Quantifying Streambank Erosion Using Unmanned Aerial Systems at Site-Specific and River Network Scales	GEOTECHNICAL FRONTIERS 2017: WALLS AND SLOPES	Geotechnical Special Publication				3rd Conference on Geotechnical Frontiers	MAR 12-15, 2017	Orlando, FL	Ind Fabr Assoc Int, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Geo Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Int Geosynthet Soc				Streambank erosion is an important component of geomorphic responses to channel changes that affect a wide range of physical, ecological, and socio-economic issues in the fluvial environment including water quality and on-and near-stream infrastructure. A number of direct (e.g., longitudinal surveys, erosion pins, remote sensing) and indirect (e.g., process-based models) methods have been used to quantify streambank erosion. These methods are not only very resource intensive, but many are feasible and appropriate only for site-specific studies and not suitable or practical for erosion estimates at larger scales. Recent developments in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide opportunities for rapidly and economically quantifying streambank erosion and deposition at variable scales (from site-specific to river network), and is the focus of this paper. At the site-specific scale, the capability of UAS to quantify streambank erosion was assessed by comparing it to terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and RTK (real time kinematic) GPS for validation. At the individual site level, the estimation of bank erosion using UAS was within 4% of the actual erosion at a surveyed cross-section. At the river network-level scale, initial results indicate even bank retreats of less than a meter can be detected, provided banks are not completely obscured by dense vegetation.																	0895-0563		978-0-7844-8045-8				2017		278					499	508										WOS:000406407200051

However, some coastal areas frequently suffer from typhoon with extreme precipitation, which results in the water quality deterioration of the reservoirs. The influence of typhoons with extreme precipitation on Jiaokou reservoir and the emergency treatment process of Maojiaping water treatment plant in the past three typical typhoons with extreme precipitation from the year of 2012-2015 were studied. It was found that the degradation of water quality, such as the increase of turbidity and bacteria index, may not merely appear during the events, but last for several days. Changing the dosage of water purification agent, such as coagulant and disinfectant at right time and place may be an efficient emergency water treatment process. Based on the analysis of water quality variation rule during and after the events, it was also found that emergency treatment can be fully prepared before the arrival of a typhoon with extreme precipitation. And in order to better respond to the typhoon with extreme precipitation, several suggestions are also proposed in this paper as follows: establishing vegetated buffers at right place, such as macrophanerophytes, shrub or herbage, increasing investments in infrastructure management, merging or cancelling the small-scale water treatment plants, preparing adequate water purification agent before the typhoon comes, etc.																	1004-2857	2325-4262					2017	15	2					103	108		10.1080/10042857.2017.1319171								WOS:000406361900003

Effect of waste mixed with biochar as soil amendment on trace element solubility in a mine soil	SPANISH JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Abandoned mining sites often cause contamination of surface and subsurface waters. A 3-month pot experiment was performed to evaluate the influence of waste mixed with biochar as a soil amendment on a series of chemical characteristics and trace element solubility in a mine soil. Trace element concentrations were measured in pore water of the mine soil reclaimed with different proportions of waste-biochar amendment (20, 40, 80 and 100%) and grown with Brassica juncea. The results showed that amendment application improved soil conditions such as pH, total carbon, dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, and strongly reduced the concentration of Al (99.99%), Co (99.95%), Cu (99.97%), Fe (99.79%) and Ni (99.91%) in pore water, compared to the unamended soils. Waste and biochar also promoted the establishment of B.juncea in the mine soil. These results highlight the importance of mitigating the impacts from abandoned mines sites on water quality. The use of waste and biochar as soil amendment combined with B.juncea plants was effective in reducing metal concentrations in pore water and the associated toxicity risk.																	2253-6574						2017	7	2					109	121		10.3232/SJSS.2017.V7.N2.03								WOS:000405628400003

This is consequent upon the failure of government to provide safe water to the people. This paper looks at the vulnerability of HDWs in the core area of Akure, Nigeria. The study area is made up of 11 residential quarters with 1149 buildings; 10% of buildings and five wells in each quarter were randomly selected for the study. Data were collected using structured questionnaires and laboratory examinations. Water quality assessment showed that most parameters fall within WHO permissible limits for drinking water. However, microbial examinations indicated that drinking water quality was compromised in two residential quarters as there was evidence of coliform and e-coli. The study also identified other possible sources of water contamination in the study area. This paper recommends regular treatment of wells and the adoption of pipe-borne water supply systems in the city and other similar cities in developing countries.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	8					797	803		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1254257								WOS:000406135200004

Bryan; Lundy, Lian			Assessing the impact of swales on receiving water quality	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Swales are one type of sustainable drainage system (SuDS) which contribute to the management of water quality in receiving waterbodies. Using a semi-quantitative approach, an impact assessment procedure is applied to the residual water quality that is carried forward to surface waters and groundwaters following treatment within a swale. Both volumetric and pollutant distributions are considered as stormwater passes through the swale system. The pollutant pathways followed by TSS, nitrate, chloride, metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are determined for a swale receiving highway runoff. For TSS, metals and PAHs between 20% and 29% of the total mean influent pollutant load is predicted to be directed to infiltration through the underlying soils compared to between 4% and 16% of chloride and nitrate. Although surface water impacts are deemed possible, the discharges of swales to groundwaters are assessed to represent a negligible impact for effectively maintained systems.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	8					839	845		10.1080/1573062X.2017.1279187								WOS:000406135200009

This results both from regulatory requirements and a desire to maintain consistency with long-standing data collection procedures. Despite the fact that both bed sediments and/or flood plain deposits have been used to identify substantial water quality issues, they rarely are used in traditional water quality monitoring programs. The usual rationale is that bed sediment chemistry does not provide the temporal immediacy that can be obtained using more traditional sample media (e.g., suspended sediment, water). However, despite the issue of temporal immediacy, bed sediments can be used to address/identify certain types of water quality problems and could be employed more frequently for that purpose. Examples where bed sediments could be used include: (1) identifying potential long-term monitoring sites/water quality "hot spots", (2) establishing a water quality/geochemical history for a particular site/area, and (3) as a surrogate for establishing mean/median chemical values for suspended sediment.																	2199-899X						2017	375						11	17		10.5194/piahs-375-11-2017								WOS:000406401700003

The objective of the study was to assess the impact of heated water from the Ostroleka Power Station on selected water properties and the macroinvertebrate community in the Narew River. Samples were collected in years: 2013-2016 along two river stretches: upstream and downstream of the canal. The water temperature was higher and the oxygen concentrations were lower at the downstream sites compared to the upstream sites of the canal. The values of conductivity, concentrations of nitrates, phosphates, chlorides and calcium were similar at the sampling sites. A total of 33 families of macrozoobenthos were found. The numbers of families were positively correlated with the temperature and conductivity and negatively correlated with oxygen. The heated waters were found to have no effect on the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. The inflow of heated waters increased the percentage of Gammaridae, represented by species Dikerogammarus haemobaphes (Eichwald, 1841) and decreased the percentage of Chironomidae.

To estimate the annual disease burden of campylobacteriosis, nontyphoidal salmonellosis, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, and norovirus attributable to waterborne transmission in Australia, we multiplied regional World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of the proportion of cases attributable to waterborne transmission by estimates of all-source disease burden for each study pathogen. Norovirus was attributed as causing the most waterborne disease cases (479,632; 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 0-1,111,874) followed by giardiasis and campylobacteriosis. The estimated waterborne disability-adjusted life year (DALY) burden for campylobacteriosis (2,004; 95% UI: 0-5,831) was 7-fold greater than other study pathogens and exceeded the WHO guidelines for drinking water quality (1 x 10(-6) DALY per person per year) by 90-fold. However, these estimates include disease transmitted via either drinking or recreational water exposure. More precise country-specific and drinking water-specific attribution estimates would better define the health burden from drinking water and inform changes to treatment requirements.																	0002-9637	1476-1645					2017	96	6					1400	1403		10.4269/ajtmh.16-0907								WOS:000405659100024	28719263

Sometimes professional software (such as DHI's MIKE11) is not available online to run simulations for various pollution scenarios. A system able to accurately assess the concentration of the pollutant at any points along a river in respect to a given pollution scenario was implemented. This system reuses historical offline data resulted from previous executions of MIKE11 software. The pollution scenario consists of a set of user specified input parameters (chainage, pollutant concentration, discharged volume, type of pollutant, etc.). Numerical methods are used to address the problem of multivariate interpolation and compute the result. The validation of the system was done using data from a real scenario on Dembovita river, the obtained results being estimated with a mean percentage error less than 1.3%. To efficiently cope with millions of records, the computing intensive application was deployed on Jelastic Cloud in order to take the advantage of on demand elastic RAM and CPU resources.																	2286-3540	2286-3559					2017	79	2					25	36										WOS:000405770800003

Since water quality and soil environment cannot be completely specified along a pipeline, a management methodology for AC water pipelines is required to estimate the probability of pipe failure as ageing proceeds. The paper describes the technique and its application to experimental data, which illustrates in three parts. First, the degradation rates in AC pipes are computed from 360 aggregated independent pipe segments residual strength test data taken from different pipe diameter sizes used in various water utilities locations in Thailand. Second, the predictions of service lifetime for AC pipes are estimated using Monte Carlo simulation in conjunction with the physical failure state formulations. Output from the simulation provides a number of failures recorded over time, which then allows the economic analysis for optimal pipe replacement scheduling. All is described in the third part. The end results can be used for water utilities to allocate government funds for future pipe maintenance activities.																	0125-8281						2017	21	2					1	13		10.4186/ej.2017.21.2.1								WOS:000405903800001

Should they focus their advocacy at the local, state, or national level of government? This article examines interest group behaviors in water quality policy in the Great Lakes region from 1960 to 2000. I evaluate the reasons for interest group decisions about which level of government to target, using historical analysis of Great Lakes water quality policy in the United States and Canada. The results of this analysis show that in many cases groups are influenced in their decision-making based on the level of government that has the greatest jurisdiction over the policy, supporting a neoinstitutional argument.																	0272-2011	1943-9954					2017	47	1					89	100		10.1080/02722011.2017.1299773								WOS:000406003000007						
J	Boholm, A; Prutzer, M				Boholm, ASa; Prutzer, Madeleine			Experts' understandings of drinking water risk management in a climate change scenario	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT												The challenges for society presented by climate change are complex and demanding. This paper focuses on one particular resource of utmost necessity and vulnerability to climate change: namely, the provisioning of safe drinking water. From a critical perspective on the role of expertise in risk debates, this paper looks at how Swedish experts understand risk to drinking water in a climate change scenario and how they reason about challenges to risk management and adaptation strategies. The empirical material derives from ten in-depth semi-structured interviews with experts, employed both at government agencies and at universities, and with disciplinary backgrounds in a variety of fields (water engineering, planning, geology and environmental chemistry). The experts understand risk factors affecting both drinking water quality and availability as complex and systemically interrelated. A lack of political saliency of drinking water as a public service is identified as an obstacle to the development of robust adaptation strategies. Another area of concern relates to the geographical, organizational and institutional boundaries (regulatory, political and epistemological) between the plethora of public actors with partly overlapping and sometimes unclear responsibilities for the provisioning of safe drinking water. The study concludes that climate change adaptation regarding drinking water provisioning will require a new integration of the knowledge of systemic risk relations, in combination with more efficient agency collaboration based on a clear demarcation of responsibility between actors.

Using historical data we also estimated the internal phosphorus load (IPL) between 1972 and 2015. EPL reached its maximum in the mid-1980s with phosphorus (P) values similar to 21 t yr(-1) compared to the current value close to 6 t yr(-1). IPL was one order of magnitude less and ranged between 0.25 t yr(-)1 (2015) and 3.6 (1985) t yr(-1). The strong reduction of the P load determined a marked decrease of both P (from 200 to 23 mu g L-1) and chlorophyll a (from 18 to 8 mu g L-1) in-lake concentrations. The process of eutrophication and subsequent recovery, however, showed hysteresis between P load and in-lake P concentrations. In recent years, in particular, the P concentrations at winter overturn seem to be independent from the P load, related to modifications in the hydrological management of the lake that favored P flushout in October-November, when the EPL is maximal. This process led to a marked decrease of the total P concentrations at winter overturn (23 mu g L-1), which recently resulted in lower-than-target concentrations (30 mu g L-1) established by the Lombardy Region. The lake, nevertheless, suffers from the presence of the toxic cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, and eradicating this species and further improving water quality will likely require an additional abatement of the EPL.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	1					100	108		10.1080/20442041.2017.1294354								WOS:000405859800011

Detection of Trace Elements in DI Water and Comparison of Several Water Solutions by Using EF-FLRD Chemical Sensors	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL ADVANCES IN APPLIED PHYSICS AND MATERIALS SCIENCE CONGRESS & EXHIBITION (APMAS 2016)	AIP Conference Proceedings				6th Congress and Exhibition on International Advances in Applied Physics and Materials Science (APMAS)	JUN 01-03, 2016	Istanbul, TURKEY					Detection of trace elements in DI water and comparison of several types of water respons such as DI water, tap water, and ocean water were studied by using EF-FLRD chemical sensors. Solutions of Mg, Fe, P, and Cd elements with a concentration of 1000 mu g/ml mg/ml) which corresponds to 1000 ppm by weight were tested. DI water, tap water, and real ocean water were utilized as medium to observe refractive index difference of solutions. The EF sensing technique which is based on the EF scattering effect was employed for the detection of trace chemicals and recording of solution responses. Due to the refractive index differences between solutions, optical loss of the sensor was different when the sensor head was immersed into solutions of approximately 10 ml each. The differences of the refractive indices are presented by recording ringdown times when the sensor head was inunersed into the solutions. Fast response (similar to 1s), high sensitive, and reproducible EF-FLRD chemical sensors were fabricated and tested in laboratory conditions. High sensitivity of the sensors due to being capability of detecting smaller differences between measurands without any additional components or treatment makes the EF-FLRD sensors more attractive. Enhanced sensitivity of the EF-FLRD chemical sensors as a result of the multi-pass nature of the FLRD technique has potential application in detecting of trace elements in monitoring of water quality.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1477-8				2017	1809								UNSP 020027	10.1063/1.4975442								WOS:000405202000027

In the present study, 5 experimental polyculture systems combining abalone and sea cucumber (SC) as different inter-species biomass ratios, i.e. 100: 0, 70: 30, 50: 50, 30: 70 and 0: 100 (referred to as Group A, B, C, D and E, respectively), were set up to evaluate the potential of sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus as scavengers to alleviate the farming wastes derived from the co-culture of abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Growth performance and significant isotopic shifts of the SCs in Groups B, C and D demonstrated the uptake of farming wastes, i.e. feces and uneaten feed residues. The proportional contributions of SC assimilated from uneaten feed residues, feces and sea mud were 21.7, 62.5 and 15.8% in Group B, 18.5, 54.3 and 27.2% in Group C, 11.5, 44.4 and 44.1% in Group D, respectively. The results revealed that sea cucumber had great potential to become an effective organic extractive species and aid in the concordant reduction of farming wastes in polyculture systems. The biomass ratio of abalone to sea cucumber 70: 30 was recommended for aquaculture practice as providing the greatest economic and environmental benefits.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2017	9						223	230		10.3354/aei00226								WOS:000405734400002

CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient pollution is a pervasive water quality problem. Stream restoration has been proposed as a novel approach to reduce loading and increase nutrient processing within streams. We summarize evidence from the literature on the efficacy of stream restoration for reducing nutrient loading and increasing nutrient removal in stream ecosystems. We also analyze published data on streambank phosphorus concentrations and riparian and stream denitrification rates to improve understanding of the potential benefits of stream restoration for phosphorus retention and nitrogen removal. Finally, we discuss the role of stream restoration in nutrient management and provide recommendations for practice and future research.																	1064-3389	1547-6537					2017	47	6					335	371		10.1080/10643389.2017.1318618								WOS:000405564100001

Economic valuation of river restoration: An analysis of the valuation literature and its uses in decision-making	WATER RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS												This paper provides an analysis of existing non-market valuations of river restoration primarily in the United States and Europe. The goals of the river restoration in terms of ecosystem services are identified, as are the valuation methods used. More than two-thirds of the 38 river restorations reviewed sought to restore and protect fish populations, including in many cases threatened or endangered species. River restorations were also frequently undertaken to improve wildlife habitat, and water quality for boating. In terms of the use of non-market valuations in decision making, six of 38 restorations reviewed involved benefit-cost analyses or environmental assessments or equivalent decision documents. While both revealed preference and stated preference methods were used for valuing river restorations, the majority of restoration valuations (27 out of 38, about 70%) utilized stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation method (CVM) and choice experiments (CE). Annual willingness-to-pay per household estimated from the stated preference methods appear logically and positively related to the miles of river restored demonstrating weak scope.																	2212-4284					JAN	2017	17				SI		9	19		10.1016/j.wre.2016.12.001								WOS:000405585100002

The main components of the study include a field sampling analysis of groundwater collected from three different sites. Water Quality Index is calculated from physico-chemical analysis of eight parameters taken together, which ranges from 235.56 to 576.59 indicating the heavy pollution load in water. The result of this study indicate that the drinking water supply of the city do not conform the recommendation standards, which is a major cause of various health problems in the city, and hence it is suggested to take all necessary precautionary measures before it is sent to public consumption to avoid adverse health impacts and to prevent various intestinal epidemics. It is concluded that WQI is a useful tool and can be used in comparing the water quality of different sources.																	0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	3					49	55		10.3233/AJW-170025								WOS:000405333600007

Presence of excessive quantities of salts in groundwater is one of the major constrains in agro-well farming in Ganga-Sone Divide. Irrigation with poor quality waters may bring undesirable elements to the soil in excessive quantities affecting its fertility. Electrical conductivity (EC), sodium percentage (Na%), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and residual sodium carbonate (RSC) can be used as criteria for finding the suitability of irrigation waters. The objective of this study is to evaluate the suitability of the irrigation water quality of the Ganga-Sone divide region. Major cations, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+ and major anions, Cl, SO4, HCO3, CO3 were determined from 26 observation sites selected by CGWB located in Ganga-Sone divide region to assess the hazards of salinity, sodium and bicarbonate. Out of selected sites, based on EC, 46% of the wells have medium salinity water, 50% of the wells have high salinity water and 4% of the wells have very high salinity water. Based on percent of sodium, 69% of the wells have excellent irrigation water quality, 19% of the wells have good irrigation water quality, 4% of the wells have permissible irrigation water quality, 4% of the wells have doubtful irrigation water quality and 4% of the wells have unsuitable irrigation water quality. Based on SAR, almost all the wells have the good quality of irrigation water. Based on RSC, 100% of the wells have good irrigation water quality.																	0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	3					75	83		10.3233/AJW-170028								WOS:000405333600010

These two villages are situated in the industrial area of Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh, India. These two villages are surrounded by industries like BHPV, HPCL, Zinc smelter and Coromondel fertilizers. During a preliminary survey in the two villages it was found that the residents of the two villages were suffering from dental flourisis. In view of this, the authors carried out experiments on the determination of physico-chemical characterization. The results were compared with BIS standards. In the two villages, concentration of fluoride was found to be in the range 1.432-2.944 mg/L. Water quality index (WQI) for the two villages was found to be 101.1 for the village Mulagada and 87.5 for the village Yeduruvanipalem. A strong correlation between phosphate and fluoride in the water of the village Mulagada was observed. From the results obtained it was inferred that the water of the two villages is unfit for human consumption.																	0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	3					91	101		10.3233/AJW-170030								WOS:000405333600012

The fauna of this river includes an invertebrate fauna composed of both endemic and widespread species, which has, however, been only poorly studied until now. The aim of the present study was to make a review of the ecological role of the benthic inland water crustaceans of the River Cautin, in order to understand their importance in the ecosystem of the river. The literature revealed the presence of abundant populations of amphipods and freshwater crabs as well as of aquatic insects along the river's course. Many of these crustaceans are prey for both introduced salmonids and native fishes. Similar results have been reported for other southern Argentinean and Chilean Patagonian rivers.

Based on the historical data of Xijiu River from January 2012 to July 2014, 21 conventional water quality indicators were chosen according to the Surface Water Environment Quality Standard (GB3838-2002), with the application of fuzzy mathematics method for quantitative calculation and analysis. Two weight calculation methods and evaluation principles were used with four evaluation results obtained, suggesting that Xijiu River is identified as a class III water and reaches the minimum standard for drinking water. Specifically, the parameter of total nitrogen (TN) is assigned to class V, with ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) ranked between class V and class III, permanganate to class III, dissolved oxygen to class II, and other 16 indexes to class I. Therefore, water purification process for Jiubin waterworks should be focused on removal of primary pollutants, comprising nutrients (N and P) and organic compounds. Detection and control of these contaminants in the headstream of Xijiu water ought to arouse more attentions.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	6					3778	3787										WOS:000405360700008

ODONATA AS INDICATORS OF RIVERINE HABITATS IN CENTRAL GREECE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Riverine ecosystems offer many valuable services to human societies. Easy-to-use, reliable, inexpensive and efficient assessment and monitoring methods that investigate ecosystem integrity need to be developed for their conservation and protection. Such tools are the bio-indicators, with many recommending the Odonata (dragonflies) as a very appropriate indicator. This study is the first attempt to evaluate the potential of utilizing diversity indices on Odonata species for riverine habitats in Greece. The studied areas were along Sperchios River, Thermopyles spring and Kakavorema stream, located in Sperchios River Basin (Central Greece). The analysis based on the number of different species and three diversity indices, found differences among the three habitats. Sperchios River had the highest biodiversity and Thermopyles spring the lowest. This was also indicated by the water quality parameters and riparian area widths measured. Overall the differences found in these three habitats indicate the potential usefulness of Odonata for evaluating riverine habitats in Greece and the Balkans.

Waterbirds are potential sentinel species of these environments. To analyze how habitat conditions affect the health of Fulica americana, early-warning biomarkers, histopathology, somatic indices, and water quality were examined in two wetlands of the Basin of Mexico: Xochimilco, an urban wetland highly eutrophic with a mixture of pollutants, and Tecocomulco (the reference site), a rural wetland with hunting migratory birds in winter, and with some agricultural contaminants. Coots were collected over 1 year, and the birds were aged, eviscerated, and weighed. Liver samples were analyzed biochemically and histologically. Biomarkers revealed that coots displayed higher lipid peroxidation and elevated activities of gamma-glutamyl transferase and alanine aminotransferase, suggesting hepatic damage during autumn and winter. In Tecocomulco, coots during winter has the highest thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (as a measure of oxidative stress), which may be associated with the presence of predators. In Tecocomulco, the higher gonadosomatic index was detected in spring and summer, while in Xochimilco it was elevated in summer, indicating a delayed egg laying and reproduction in coots from the latter study site. In both wetlands, leukocyte infiltration, alone or combined with vasocongestion, reflected alterations in the inflammatory processes in liver throughout the annual cycle and thus potentially altered hepatic function and organism survival. In both wetlands, coots were permanent residents and chronically exposed to different stressors, suggesting damage may be irreversible with potentially adversely reproductive consequences.

Constructed treatment wetlands are low-cost, require minimal maintenance, can be implemented in a decentralized fashion, and contribute to ecosystem preservation. All of these reasons have brought treatment wetlands to the forefront for consideration by communities working to reduce CSOs and improve water quality, especially in small cities with limited resources. Goals of this study were to compare the removal of stormwater pollutants including total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) through subsurface flow (SSF) and free-water surface (FWS) wetland configurations. Additionally, each wetland system was composed of multiple basins optimized to remove certain stormwater contaminants. Stormwater, pond and synthetic waters were used to test the efficiency of contaminant removal. Over the course of two years, undergraduate students built wetlands and performed experiments to investigate contaminate removal efficiency. Overall, we found that both wetlands were effective in removing TSS, BOD and nitrate. BOD removal (up to 47%) occurred in the basins with highest organic content, and TSS (up to 82%), nitrate (58-88%) and nitrite (up to 50%) removal occurred in the basins with the highest sand content. The FWS configuration was advantageous for nitrate and nitrite removal, but was not significantly more effective than the SSF. We did not observe significant phosphate removal. Follow up studies will consider additional wetland configurations and operational methods.																			978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							10	33										WOS:000405216400002

It is surrounded by local agricultural activities and one seasonal river is terminated to it. Due to recent years the aquatic life of Zarivar Lake was under serious threat. Water quality study is one of the substantial measures that could be carried out since water quantity has been subjected to drought and low precipitation. Field study was planned in structured regular sampling stations in two straight routes and 24 samples in aggregation. Hypoxia potential investigation in closed shallow water body via current standards was done. Results of analysis demonstrate the potential of hypoxia in closed shallow water body. Significant effects of geological characteristics in hypoxia potential in figure out due to matrix analysis. Comparison of the results with the long-term data on water quality led the conclusion toward a suggestion on the effects of water catchments' activities during land use and land cover (LU/LC) changes over the years. Sources of nutrients associated biological parameters and macro indicators like submerged plants continue to verify and strengthen the relationship between the nitrogen loads of the LU/LC changes. The additional findings support the new hypoxia potential indicator in Zarivar Lake.																			978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							511	518										WOS:000405216400047

The World Bank also noted Panama's progress in the last decade by reporting a remarkable decrease in poverty and increase in access to improved water and sanitation (World Bank 2016). Despite improvements at the national level, pockets of extreme poverty persist in rural areas, especially in the comarcas, the indigenous provinces of Panama. The first two authors served with the U.S. Peace Corps as water and sanitation volunteers in two such remote communities on the Comarca Ngabe Bugle. Both observed how the presence of water and sanitation infrastructure could be counted as "coverage" by the national government and bilateral aid agencies. However, without regular water quality testing, system maintenance, or the presence of a regulating body, calculations of "coverage" fail to capture the reality facing Panama's rural poor. Field research focused on how the connectivity between urban and rural spaces affects water and sanitation system functionality, as well as the relationship between micro-watershed management and water quality.																			978-0-7844-8059-5				2017							687	693										WOS:000405216400061

This is of great importance because aquaculture is a lagging area of technology compared to other areas such as agriculture. So it is important to solve the problems that are in this area with the support of technology. Among the problems is the slow response time in the care of water quality, the waste of resources and losses. The system proposed in this work monitors the water quality based on wireless sensor networks and on the Internet of Things (IoT). This information is important for the development of this area, since it allows sharing the different conditions in the breeding of aquatic organisms between different breeders and organizations. This information is useful to know the conditions in which there is a better development of a product, worse development, what conditions can mean a possible disaster in the environment and how to optimize resources for the care of the pond.																	1934-5070		978-1-5090-3599-1				2017																		WOS:000405194500021						
J	Kaine, G; Young, J; Lourey, R; Greenhalgh, S				Kaine, Geoff; Young, Justine; Lourey, Ruth; Greenhalgh, Suzie			Policy choice framework: guiding policy makers in changing farmer behavior	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												There is a substantial literature on the characteristics of policy instruments. Unfortunately, there is an unhelpful degree of overlap in the strengths and weaknesses of different instruments. As a consequence, rarely is it the case that one particular instrument is obviously superior to all others. Policy makers must then make choices about which instrument(s) to use. The economics discipline can provide some insights for instrument choice through its exploration of market failures related to natural resource management. Few attempts, however, have been made to encapsulate these economic concepts in way to that could aid policy makers in these choices and ensure that policy instrument choice aligns with the fundamental cause of the behavior to be changed. We describe and provide example applications of the policy choice framework (PCF). The PCF was developed to assist policy makers to deliberately and systematically choose policy instruments to influence the behavior of farmers. The PCF is unique among methods for choosing policy instruments because it links the microeconomic reasons underpinning the choice of a primary policy instrument (stage one) with predictions of the behavior of farmers (stage two) and predictions about the organizational needs of agencies responsible for implementing policy (stage three). We describe the PCF using two applications: wild dog management and the control of agricultural nitrogen discharges. Our purpose was to show how the PCF could be employed to assist in policy instrument selection. We then discuss the implications for policy design and instrument choice.																	1708-3087						2017	22	2							2	10.5751/ES-09135-220202								WOS:000404997600009

Method: Environmental or river samples were assayed for NP by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique. Results: The concentration for NP measured in Xiangjiang River, ranging from 0.174 to 3.411 g/L with a mean value of 1.73 g/L, was lower than the Water Quality Criteria for NP of the US (6.6 g/L); however, the NP concentration was maintained at a higher level compare to the developed countries and other civil cities. NP concentration in downstream water was markedly higher than that both in midstream and upstream water. Tissue accumulation of NP was observed in aquatics. A ratio of mean concentration of NP in aquatic (chlamys farreri and hemiculter leucisculus) to that in river water was 241 and 1087, respectively. The presence of NP in tap water in two urban districts of Zunyi was common with a detectable rate reached 100.0%. Mean NP concentration in terminal tap water in Huichuan district was six times as high as Honghuagang district, which was above Standards for the Drinking Water Quality for Phenols of China (2 g/L). Conclusion: The pollution of NP in Xiangjiang River, tap water, and aquatic in Zunyi belongs to moderate or severe level in the world.																	0960-3123	1369-1619					2017	27	3					179	190		10.1080/09603123.2017.1332345								WOS:000405312700003	28587474

The limnological monitoring occurred from 2006 to 2015, and we investigate the behavior of water bodies when they stopped receiving domestic sewage in natura from urban areas of these municipalities. We selected sample sections at points located after the urban influence areas of Presidente Prudente and Pirapozinho. We monitored water temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen using portable digital devices, and we used protocols of evaluation by Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Waste water 22nd Edition (2012) to monitor sedimentary sludge, ammonium nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total coliforms and Escherichia. Results indicate an improvement in water quality in both sections. From 2008, the streams recovered their water quality standards in accordance with the framework classes, advocated by the Brazilian environmental legislation.																	2178-7298	1517-543X					2017	1	24					182	203										WOS:000404953800009

In this study, the trend of changes of water quality of main branches of Yamchi Dam and water of dam reservoir during the time series were evaluated according to the Spatiality changes and the most sensitive branch was identified due to produce contamination as well as the time and location of changes (amounts) of water quality parameters to Yamchi Dam were evaluated. According to the statistical results in 2001 to 2015 related to the stations studied, it can be concluded that Nir River among all the variables studied is as the most pollutant river from the three main rivers of the upstream region of Yamchi Dam. According to the results, the river's water quality parameters from 2001 onwards has been increasing process, variables of fecal coliform, bicarbonate, DO, BOD and sodium respectively, as main factors have the greatest impact on water quality survey of the main branches of Yamchi Dam. Three main branches of Yamchi Dam are different in terms of rate and amount of variables mentioned and have had significant effect on water quality of Yamchi Dam.

Integrated Weighted Overlay Model Using Inverse Distance Weightage for Assessing Groundivater Quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Groundwater management is a potential solution to the global water crisis. This study assessed the groundwater quality at Mettupalayam, Tamil Nadu, India in order to determine its suitability for drinking. Groundwater samples were collected and their physicochemical parameters such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total hardness (TH), total dissolved solids (TDS), Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42- and Cl- were determined and benchmarked with standard drinking water requirements. The variations of these parameters were presented spatially. The groundwater is generally brackish and hard; and of low alkalinity and high salinity. CoriSequently, the groundwater in most parts of the study area is unsuitable for-drinking without treatment. It is recommended that point and nonpoint sources of groundwater pollution at Mettupalayam should be identified, monitored and managed in order to protect the groundwater resource.																	0119-1144						2017	20	1					26	32										WOS:000404946000004						
J	Ball, E; Weber, MJ				Ball, Emily; Weber, Michael John			Validating a Diabetic Glucose Meter to Assess Walleye Glucose Concentrations	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Fisheries biologists have long been interested in monitoring stress in fish by observing changes in glucose concentrations. However, measuring glucose in the field is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. Diabetic glucose meters may provide a rapid, cost-effective monitoring tool that can be used in the field or laboratory, but they need to be evaluated for a particular species before they can be integrated into monitoring programs. Our objective was to evaluate the FreeStyle Lite diabetic glucose meter across a broad range of glucose concentrations exhibited by advanced fingerling Walleyes Sander vitreus (197 +/- 20 mm [mean +/- SD]; 73.5 +/- 18.8 g). Eleven groups of five advanced fingerling Walleyes were chased for up to 10 min with a dip net, sequentially removed at 5-min intervals, and blood samples were collected. Glucose concentrations were determined using both the FreeStyle Lite diabetic glucose meter and the traditional colorimetric laboratory method for individual samples. The percent difference in glucose concentrations (glucose meter minus colorimetric laboratory glucose) was nearly always (95% of observations) within 2 SDs of the average glucose concentration reported by both methods. Costs associated with the use of the glucose meter as well as the required sample size were less for the glucose meter than the colorimetric laboratory method. Combined, results from this study suggest the glucose meter detected changes in glucose concentrations of advanced fingerling Walleyes and offers an alternative method that is cheaper, faster, and less invasive than the traditional colorimetric laboratory method.																	1522-2055	1548-8454					2017	79	3					245	249		10.1080/15222055.2017.1310158								WOS:000405082700006

The conceptual model analyzes a simply food web (nutrients, primary producers and secondary consumers), and reproduces the spatial and temporal concentration of water quality constituents. The results provided by the model show a good correlation with the recorded values of the studied parameters.

Cost effective, continuous assessment of water quality able to rapidly and sensitively signal the occurrence of noxious compounds is still a demanding, open issue. Since continuous monitoring of aquatic environment using biosensors is not sustainable, we propose a multitiered i.e. a two-step approach: the first one based on dynamics of selected aquatic species (e.g. fish) able to sensitively respond to occurrence of various types of contaminants for triggering the second step based on biosensors for specifically outline the actual perturbing cause. We address this challenge by advancing a new system based on the ICB proprietary solution for assessing the dynamics of fish, using a 3D array of ultrasound transducers, to relate fish behavior to the quality of their environment. Whereas fish behavior is already an established indicator of water quality, there are rather few systems able to effectively monitor and quantitatively assess fish dynamics. Most of such systems are based on image acquisition and processing, and are quite dependent on water turbidity or light level. The ICB proprietary fish behavior monitoring system - deploys a non-invasive technique for continuous monitoring of fish position not dependent on water transparency or lighting and uses a method for data analysis to provide real time information on the dynamics/behavior of (selected) fish species according to water quality and different stimuli.

Assessment of water quality in selected shallow wells of Keiyo Highlands, Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION & DEVELOPMENT												A supply of potable water is important for the sustenance of a healthy population. This study was conducted in the Keiyo Highlands, Elgeyo Marakwet County, in Kenya. The aim was to assess seasonal variation in physico-chemical and microbiological water quality parameters of shallow wells. The water quality parameters were analyzed during the wet season of 2015 and during the dry season that followed. Water samples were collected from 10 randomly selected wells and analyzed for pH, turbidity, total hardness, nitrates, phosphates, fluorides, faecal coliforms, total suspended solids (TSS) and total dissolved solids (TDS). The results were compared with water quality guidelines, such as those of the WHO. pH was low during both the dry (5.35 +/- 0.09) and wet (6.14 +/- 0.26) seasons, showing the water to be acidic. Faecal coliform values were higher than those recommended by the WHO (0/100ml) for drinking water in both the wet (2.70 +/- 1.34/100ml) and dry (21.56 +/- 10.0/100ml) seasons. In conclusion, the elevated values of faecal coliforms indicate that utilization of water from the wells is of concern to public health. It is recommended that wells should be located away from potential sources of contamination, such as pit latrines, and should be properly covered.																	2042-1338	2042-1346					2017	9	3					329	338		10.1080/20421338.2017.1327476								WOS:000404931500011

ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF AGRICULTURAL DRAINAGE WATER IN IOWA	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												Assessing the effectiveness of management strategies to reduce agricultural nutrient efflux is hampered by the lack of affordable, continuous in-situ monitoring systems. Generalized water quality monitoring is possible using electrical conductivity. However environmental conditions can influence the ionic ratios, resulting in misinterpretations of established electrical conductivity and ionic composition relationships. Here we characterize specific electrical conductivity (k(25)) of agricultural drainage waters to define these environmental conditions and dissolved constituents that contribute to k(25). A field investigation revealed that the magnitude of measured k(25) varied from 370 to 760 mu S cm(-1). Statistical analysis indicated that variability in k(25) was not correlated with drainage water pH, temperature, nor flow rate. While k(25) was not significantly different among drainage waters from growing and post-growing season, significant results were observed for different cropping systems. Soybean plots in rotation with corn had significantly lower conductivities than those of corn plots in rotation with soybeans, continuous corn plots, and prairie plots. In addition to evaluating k(25) variability, regression analysis was used to estimate the concentration of major ions in solution from measured k(25). Regression results indicated that HCO3-, Ca2+, NO3-, Mg2+, Cl-, Na2+, SO42- were the major drainage constituents contributing to the bulk electrical conductivity. Calculated ionic molal conductivities of these analytes suggests that HCO3-, Ca2+, NO3-, and Mg2+ account for approximately 97% of the bulk electrical conductivity.																	0883-8542	1943-7838					2017	33	3					369	378		10.13031/aea.12040								WOS:000404836800008

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ON RUNOFF, SEDIMENT, AND NUTRIENT LOADS IN AN AGRICULTURAL WATERSHED IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER BASIN	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												Projected climate change can impact various aspects of agricultural systems, including the nutrient and sediment loads exported from agricultural fields. This study evaluated the potential changes in runoff, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus loads using projected climate estimates from 2041-2070 in the Beasley Lake watershed in Mississippi, USA, using the Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source (AnnAGNPS) pollution watershed model. For baseline conditions and model inputs an earlier validated simulation of the watershed was used with an event-based NSE of 0.81 for runoff and 0.54 for sediment without calibration. Fifteen global climate models (GCMs) for the climate change scenario RCP8.5 in Western Mississippi were used. Daily precipitation and air temperature were generated with the weather generator SYNTOR. Daily climate data derived from all 15 GCMS were used in AnnAGNPS simulations to generate ensemble projected loads, and climate data from four GCMs were used in simulations to assess the effectiveness of five different conservation practices for reducing projected loads. Predicted median annual-average pollutant loads increased by 9% to 12% with ensemble projected climate change. However, no-tillage and cover crop conservation practices were predicted to reduce pollutant loads from 20% to 75% below historical levels despite the impacts of climate change. This study suggests that greater implementation of conservation practices can be effective at mitigating water quality degradation associated with projected climate change.

Relative change in stream discharge from a tropical watershed improves predictions of fecal bacteria in near-shore environments	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Statistical models poorly predict bacteria in near-shore environments of tropical islands due to inaccuracies in runoff and discharge characterization of storm events. Intense, short duration storms on small, steeply sloped watersheds produce high rates of runoff, resulting in rapid pulses of discharge that influence the physical and physiological conditions of the fate and transport of pathogens. As such, increasing rates of discharge are expected to have a different influence on sediment transport and pathogen load compared to decreasing rates of discharge. Regression modeling was used to examine the affect of antecedent streamflow on the interaction between environmental parameters and two fecal indicator bacteria, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens. Including the relative change in discharge incorporates a proximate representation of the energy available to transport particulates, improving predictions of near-shore water quality. Understanding factors that influence pathogen loads improves management of watersheds and protects public health.																	0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	9					1381	1393		10.1080/02626667.2017.1310381								WOS:000404851900004

Integrated Urban Modeling and the Reconfiguration of Expertise	JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY												Much has been spoken and written about the rationalization and optimization of services and amenities in urban territories. In this context, there is increasing use of numerical modeling techniques addressing the design, selection and/or calibration of policy instruments. The question of the relations between appraisal tools and policymaking has been widely studied. However, few studies have specifically focused on the role of modeling in policymaking processes. Drawing on two case studies, this paper suggests a change in the nature of multi-expertise: neither conflicting nor cross-sectoral, we observed in both cases an interwoven configuration with a network of experts making use of integrated models. We call this configuration distributed expertise, arguing that it is a novel configuration and that its emergence is closely linked to the development of integrated modeling techniques. Other authors have discussed the idea that the growing need for new appraisal tools is linked with the proliferation of wicked policy problems. From our case studies we would conclude that the emergence of integrated modeling is not a response to complex problems but to complex systems of actors who need to reach a consensus on actions.																	1063-0732	1466-1853					2017	24	2					89	108		10.1080/10630732.2017.1284990								WOS:000404844900006

The Index of Trophic State (ITS) was used to assess trophic state of both reservoirs as well as to determine dynamics of its changes for the analyzed period. Since the main function of both reservoirs is drinking water storage for the Silesian agglomeration with about 3.5 min population, special attention was paid to the physico-chemical indices describing the utility function of water and reflecting impact of eutrophication on water quality. Despite similar functions, the two reservoirs differ fundamentally in terms of their morphometric parameters, level of impact of the catchment area and potential vulnerability to degradation. The land utilization structure for both reservoir catchments varies too. Water quality was determined on the basis of temperature, electrical conductivity, BOD5, and the amount of total suspended solids, nitrates and phosphates. For both dam reservoirs, indicators values remained within the levels of very good water quality that corresponded to the A1 category of water utility for a public water supply. Only a few BOD5 measurement results for water from Goczalkowice dam reservoir corresponded to the A2 water category. According to the trophic state assessment, the Goczalkowice dam reservoir was classified as a mesoeutrophic while Czaniec dam reservoir - as a mesotrophic water body. In the examined 5-year period, the dynamics of trophic state changes in both dam reservoirs was comparable, and their ecological status was characterized as stable. This ensures good quality of water near the discussed intakes, despite the relatively high trophic status of the reservoirs.																	1230-6169						2017	39	2					11	16										WOS:000404834800002						
J	Olsinska, U				Olsinska, Urszula			Characteristics of bromate formation prevention methods in water intended for human consumption	OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												Bromate content following ozonation of bromide-containing water may range from 0.4 to 60 mgBrO(3)(-)/m(3). Based on toxicological studies, bromates are classified as potential human carcinogens and are subject to legal regulations in many countries. In Europe, since the 25th of December 2008 their maximum permissible content in water intended for human consumption must not exceed 10 mgBrO(3)(-)/m(3). As bromates are stable compounds, difficult to remove using conventional water treatment technologies, novel techniques to control their formation in water need to be developed. Technologies meant to control the bromate content in water can be divided into two groups: (1) methods allowing limitation of bromate formation and (2) methods for bromate removal. Methods that may be applied to control the bromate formation in water intended for human consumption are briefly reviewed herein. Evaluation of progress in their development was performed as well as feasibility of their application in water treatment systems was assessed. The review outlines both the well-known methods (e.g. lowering of pH, water ammonification, bromide removal in conventional water treatment processes, operational parameter optimization, multi-stage ozonation, addition of (OH)-O-center dot radical scavengers, hydrogen peroxide dosing) and the novel ones (e.g. membrane processes for bromide removal, catalytic ozonation, strong oxidant dosing). Selection of an appropriate solution to the problem of increased bromate presence in water should always be preceded by pilot studies. The main reasons include a complex mechanism of bromate formation and simultaneous effect of various water quality indicators on the effectiveness of different bromate formation prevention methods.																	1230-6169						2017	39	2					17	26										WOS:000404834800003						
J	Sakson, G; Brzezinska, A; Zawilski, M				Sakson, Grazyna; Brzezinska, Agnieszka; Zawilski, Marek			Prospects for reduction of the impact of wastewater discharge from urban areas on surface water quality in view of legal regulations	OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												Despite full adoption of EU requirements into current legal regulations in Poland, surface waters as sewage receivers in urban areas still cannot be considered fully protected, especially against contamination from sewer overflows and storm water systems. The examples discussed demonstrate that urban wastewater discharged from sewer overflows and storm water systems during rainfalls has a clearly dominant share in the load of pollutants emitted to the receiver. It is therefore important to develop efficient tools of water protection against these contaminants. Uniform but rather limited provisions applicable throughout the country do not take account of specific local conditions, especially size of wastewater receivers and size and characteristics of the catchment area, preventing therefore effective and economically viable water protection. The results of this research, carried out in Lodz, examining pollution loads discharged from the urban catchment area, illustrate that current approach to surface water protection issues requires a revision. Feasibility of regulatory changes in the area of setting requirements for effective receiver protection against pollutants discharged from urban areas was presented, considering the impact of untreated wastewater on the receiving water. It is also necessary to take comprehensive measures both in terms of research on pollutant emissions and their impact on the receiver and the method to utilize the results of such studies. This would enable more widespread use of urban wastewater discharge system modeling, which in turn would enable a reliable assessment of their impact on the receiver and taking appropriate modernization decisions.

The aim of this research was to evaluate suitability of Unio tumidus bivalve mollusks as bioindicators of water quality in a surveillance system. The experiment involved a 72-hour observation of the mollusks behavior in tap water containing about 0.04 mgFe/dm(3) (almost no iron ions), 0.2 mgFe/dm(3) (limit value for drinking water) and 1.7 mgFe/dm(3) (average iron ion content for the deep sea). Three behavioral variables considered were: time of activity (time period of water filtering activity), average shell opening degree and its frequency. It was determined that presence of iron ions exceeding the threshold value reduced daily activity time by 5 hours, while the shell opening degree - by over 20%. Variations in frequency of the shell movements were not observed, which might indicate no iron ion impact on the nervous system of the individuals tested. Similarly, lethal states were not demonstrated, even at the relatively high iron concentrations in water. Results of the research conducted demonstrate that the bivalves Unio tumidus may be employed in tap water surveillance system for detection of water contamination with iron compounds.

The aim of these studies was to evaluate potential to discharge the backwash water from rapid filter beds to a river or to drain them into the ground. Based on the physico-chemical and microbiological analysis of backwash water samples, degree of their contamination was determined with regard to the current quality requirements for wastewater discharged into surface water or soil as well as the requirements under the Water Law Act that defined water quality to be discharged from the analyzed pool. It was demonstrated that direct routing of the eluate from backwashing into the river or soil was impossible due to a high amount of total suspended solids and chlorine content. The concurrent efficacy testing of sedimentation and alum coagulation of backwash water performed under laboratory conditions demonstrated that the obtained supernatant water complied with the requirements and might be discharged into the river or drained into the ground.																	1230-6169						2017	39	2					45	50										WOS:000404834800006						
J	Grace, JM				Grace, J. M., III			PREDICTING FOREST ROAD SURFACE EROSION AND STORM RUNOFF FROM HIGH-ELEVATION SITES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Forest roads are a concern in management because they represent areas of elevated risks associated with soil erosion and storm runoff connectivity to stream systems. Storm runoff emanating from forest roads and their connectivity to downslope resources can be influenced by a myriad of factors, including storm characteristics, management practices, and the interaction of management practices and successive storm events. Mitigating sediment export and ensuring that storm runoff has negligible impacts on downstream resources requires a more complete understanding of forest road erosion and sediment delivery dynamics. Progress in the area of road and stream connectivity issues hinges on reliable prediction tools to inform broader-scale modeling of watershed-scale effects of forest roads and management practices. In this study, the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was evaluated based on the results from 156 runoff-generating storm events during a continuous five-year study of nine high-elevation road sections in the Appalachian Mountains. The model adequately predicted sediment yield from the road sections with an overall Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (E) of 0.76, Willmott refined index of agreement (dr) of 0.56, percent error of 5%, and average storm difference (ASD) of 1.2 kg. In contrast, WEPP predictions of storm runoff were not as good, and the poor agreement was attributed to an inability to determine the source area for runoff from some of the larger runoff events. In general, the WEPP model for these high-elevation sites adequately described the sediment yield for the road sections.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	3					705	719		10.13031/trans.11646								WOS:000404839000013

EFFECTIVENESS OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WITH CHANGING CLIMATE IN A MARYLAND WATERSHED	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												The potential impacts of climate change on BMP effectiveness were investigated using SWAT simulations for an agricultural watershed that drains into the Chesapeake Bay in the U.S. Northeast climate region. Critical source areas (CSAs) for sediments, nitrogen, and phosphorus, identified for current and future climate (SRES scenarios A1B and A2), were classified by density to support BMP prioritization schemes. BMPs were designed for these CSAs and tested against current and future climate using SWAT simulations to evaluate their robustness. A second set of BMPs was designed by optimization for all agricultural and urban lands in the study watershed and was similarly tested for robustness. In both cases, the design goal was for the watershed's water quality response to meet the bay TMDLs once BMPs were implemented. Results indicated that density 2 and 3 CSAs (hotspots exporting excess amounts of 2 or 3 constituents) may be good prioritization targets, but reaching the bay TMDLs would still require targeting all CSAs. BMPs designed for CSAs under current climate were effective to reach bay TMDLs under current climate but not under scenarios A1B and A2. BMPs designed for CSAs under scenario A2 were effective to reach the bay TMDLs under all climates, except for nitrogen under A2. Similarly, BMPs optimized for agricultural and urban lands, when designed for current climate, were effective in meeting TMDLs for current climate only. Optimizing these BMPs for future climate produced a design that met TMDLs under both current and future climates, except for nitrogen with future climate. However, in this case, the nitrogen TMDL was exceeded by a smaller amount than in the CSA design. It was concluded that, in the U.S. Northeast, BMPs designed to remediate water quality problems under current climate will be insufficient to maintain water quality with climate change. Increased annual rainfall and storm intensity will increase the proportion of watershed area needing BMPs, and current hotspots will generate excess amounts of new constituents that will require re-design of existing BMPs. Community-based participatory strategies will likely be required to foster BMP adoption and sustain water quality gains in the Chesapeake Bay region.

PHOSPHORUS, IRON, AND ALUMINUM LOSSES IN RUNOFF FROM A ROTATIONALLY GRAZED PASTURE IN GEORGIA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Well-managed grazing systems can provide valuable ecosystem services, such as reducing sediment and phosphorus (P) loading to nearby waterways. However, the available long-term data to fully support this hypothesis are limited. In this article, we describe flow-weighted concentrations (FWCs) and loads for dissolved reactive P (DRP), total P (TP), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) over 11 years (1999-2009) from a 7.8 ha rotationally grazed pasture (W1) near Watkinsville, Georgia. The region is characterized by Fe and Al rich and acidic Ultisols. Cattle numbering 21 to 224 (mean 91) grazed W1 on 69 occasions for 1 to 71 d (mean 19.2). Of 74 runoff events, 20 occurred when the monthly rainfall was below the long-term average (deficit period) and 54 occurred during non-deficit periods. Samples were collected from 43 of 74 runoff events for nutrient analyses. Event FWC (mg L-1) ranged from 0.38 to 7.07 for DRP (mean 1.91), from 0.36 to 7.60 for TP (mean 2.43), from 0.03 to 0.55 for Fe (mean 0.23), and from 0.43 to 553. g L-1 for Al (mean 65. g L-1). Event load (kg ha(-1)) ranged from 0.00 to 0.45 for DRP (mean 0.10), from 0.00 to 0.55 for TP (mean 0.12), from 0.00 to 0.11 for Fe (mean 0.02), and from 0.00 to 0.10 for Al (mean 0.01). The total load (kg ha(-1)) was 4.12 for DRP, 5.12 for TP, 0.71 for Fe, and 0.25 for Al. DRP accounted for 80% of the TP FWC and load. Cattle presence increased sediment load, but the difference was not statistically significant. There was high correlation between Fe and DRP loads (r = 0.87), a likely indicator of erosion-induced losses due to cattle treading. Cattle presence increased FWCs but not loads for DRP and TP. The FWCs for DRP and TP were not different between deficit and non-deficit periods, but mean loads were 3-fold to 4-fold greater during non-deficit periods. Means from the six largest P loss events were 3-fold greater for FWC and 7-fold greater for load than the remaining 37 events. These six large events accounted for 53% of the total P load. Less than 1% of the inorganic P applied and redeposited through manure was lost in runoff. The study demonstrated that hydrologic transport processes were the dominant drivers of pollutant fluxes and highlighted the possible mitigation of pollutant fluxes through grazing management that includes maintenance of good grass cover, effective rotational grazing, and limited fertilization.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	3					861	875		10.13031/trans.12053								WOS:000404839000026

Arsenic Removal Potential Using Naturally Occurring Iron in Groundwater: A Geo-Spatial Assessment of Household Potable Drinking Water in Bangladesh	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: GROUNDWATER, SUSTAINABILITY, AND HYDRO-CLIMATE/CLIMATE CHANGE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Arsenic removal from drinking water by co-precipitation with naturally occurring iron is considered a low-cost water treatment option at the household level but its efficiency depends on the concentration of iron as well as other competing phosphate and silicate salts present in water. This study utilizes the available household-level potable water quality data to estimate upazilla-wise arsenic removal efficiency applying a previously developed competitive sorption model. Assuming a neutral pH and no competing anions, for varying arsenic and iron concentration combinations in potable water, a removal efficiency ranging from 6.34% to 100% is estimated. But considering the interference of phosphate and silicate salts the maximum removal efficiency can potentially be reduced to 71.38%. Consequently, the population exposure in Bangladesh to arsenic contamination above WHO guideline value of 10 ppb, which is currently 32.59%, can only be reduced to 27.77% if interference of phosphate and silicate salts are taken into consideration. These estimates show that treatment of arsenic-contaminated water by co-precipitation with naturally occurring iron will only be marginally efficient for Bangladesh given the prevailing groundwater composition.																			978-0-7844-8061-8				2017							147	160										WOS:000404787300015

Evaluation of Soil Mixes in Shallow Bioretention Systems	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: GROUNDWATER, SUSTAINABILITY, AND HYDRO-CLIMATE/CLIMATE CHANGE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Bioretention systems have become common in stormwater management. Bioretention typically requires a large footprint to accommodate required water quality volumes, which may not be feasible in high traffic areas such as ferry terminals, bridges, and other urban areas. Shallow, portable planters with sandy loam and compost were evaluated for zinc and copper retention using synthetic stormwater. The addition of vermiculite, tree bark, and plants (tufted hairgrass) were evaluated. The mass of zinc retained was consistently greater than 90% for both the vermiculite and tree bark systems, and greater than 80% for all planters in every test. Copper and zinc retention varied with each simulated storm event in the control and tufted hairgrass systems. To better understand copper and zinc distribution within the bioretention systems, simulations were conducted in Hydrus 2D. Model simulations showed copper and zinc accumulating near the surface, indicating physical processes are likely the primary mechanism of metal retention in the planters. Our results indicate that shallow bioretention systems, which have a relatively small footprint, effectively retain copper and zinc.																			978-0-7844-8061-8				2017							212	222										WOS:000404787300021

The activated sludge process is a complex process involving physical, chemical and biological processes. A rapid evaluation of the effluent water quality in activated sludge systems would help engineers improve operation conditions and consequently bring economic benefits to wastewater treatment plant. In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to inform an activated sludge model (ASM1) for the chemical and biological processes, serving to provide a rapid evaluation of effluent water quality. The CFD-ASM1 was validated with the use of measured data, such as the effluent concentrations of chemical oxygen demand, ammonium, and nitrate, from a full-scale activated sludge tank. This study also studied the impacts of air flow rate and bubble size on air volume fraction distribution in the activated sludge tank using the CFD-ASM1. The model developed in this study can further serve as a tool to optimize operation conditions (e.g., air flow rate and bubble size) of activated sludge systems at a low cost.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							12	23										WOS:000404788200002

The potential impacts of urban stormwater have given rise to solutions such as Low Impact Developments (LID) to remove pollutants from entering river/ocean and provide groundwater replenishment/water supply benefits. The Broadway Neighborhood Stormwater Greenway (Project) is a joint partnership between City of Los Angeles, California State Water Resources Control Board, Water Replenishment District of Southern California, Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission, and Geosyntec Consultants, to develop a neighborhood system of LID stormwater capture/infiltration in South Los Angeles. The Project is located in public right-of-way and retrofits segments of the Broadway neighborhood with stormwater LID designed to capture, infiltrate and treat stormwater runoff, recharge groundwater, and help address Los Angeles River Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) water quality requirements. Total Project cost was $ 4.9 million and has four levels of LID: parcel based (19 residential rain gardens/infiltration trenches); street-ends (eight dry wells); commercial green streets (four parkway infiltration swales); and subregional infiltration gallery (417,000-gallon underneath parking). Water quality monitoring with continuous flow meters are installed to quantify water quality/groundwater recharge. Design drainage area is approximately 45 acres and benefits from a total of tributary area of 220 acres. With its particular location above the "Los Angeles Forebay", the project is expected to recharge on average 41 acre-feet/year into the underlying Central Groundwater Basin. The Project meets TMDL requirements for the design drainage area through the removal of pollutants such as trash, bacteria, and metals. The Project provides educational, ecological, community benefits leading to a healthier, vibrant neighborhood.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							82	96										WOS:000404788200006

We present a design case study of a multiport diffuser for a 1 MGD dense discharge into a shallow 60-foot wide river. CORMIX mixing zone modeling software was used to design the diffuser to achieve dilution to meet water quality criteria within a mixing zone for regulatory compliance. An iterative design process was employed using the CORMIX mixing zone model and the CorHyd internal diffuser hydraulics model. CORMIX simulates the multiport diffuser as a line source to predict downstream water column dilution values needed for regulatory compliance. CorHyd is used to (i) calculate port and pipe velocities, (ii) verify uniform discharge distribution from the ports, and (iii) determine the diffuser head requirements. To decrease the diffuser-induced near-field acceleration zone and enhance mixing, a fanned unidirectional multiport diffuser was designed. The diffuser riser lengths vary to conform to the river bathymetry. The riser ports were fitted with duckbill valves to maintain high port velocity over a range of effluent discharge rates. The design was optimized for dilutions at the mixing zone with port geometry, exit velocity, and spacing that allows individual plumes to merge by the end of the near-field and minimizes the potential for scouring the river bed.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							97	111										WOS:000404788200007

The satisfactory results of water quality parameters of the pilot wetland effluent were compared with the performance of the wastewater-natural treatment facility located at Arcata Bay, CA. The results provide motivations for further large scale wetland applications in the available land of Maryout Valley where fresh water supplies are low. Highlights are presented on use of safe wastewater sludge and bio-solids for restoration of constructed and natural wetlands, which serve for coastal defense; e.g. at the Nile Rosetta headland, San Francisco Bay, and the Central Wetlands in Louisiana, USA.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							126	139										WOS:000404788200009

Estimation of Surface Water Temperature of the Tigris River System in Iraq	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATER, WASTEWATER, AND STORMWATER; URBAN WATERSHED MANAGEMENT; AND MUNICIPAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Monitoring surface water temperatures (Tw) in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs is a key component of environmental management and influences water quality by affecting bio-geo chemical reaction rates, altering the saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), and influencing the susceptibility of fish to disease. Temperatures in the Tigris River, one of the largest rivers in the Middle East, are influenced by factors such as heat fluxes at the air-water and human activities such as direct discharge of water to the river. However, modeling and management of water temperature is limited by a paucity of in-situ data, which prevents calibration of models. In this study, we infill data gaps by estimating Tw using the thermal bands of both the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors. These satellite-based estimates, typically measured once or twice a month with 60-120m resolution, are then used to develop a regression model that relates daily water temperature to daily air temperature and river flow. These estimates are used to define the Tw boundary conditions for a hydrodynamic and water quality model of the Tigris River based on a 2D implementation of the CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) numerical model. Initial results suggest that there is a significant agreement between modeled and remotely estimated data of Tw. Results suggest that short-wave solar radiation is the most important factor that controls seasonal Tw variations. However, anthropogenic influence is observed as a result of return irrigation flows and flows from Tharthar Lake.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							223	233										WOS:000404788200016

Several green infrastructure technologies on the Villanova University campus have been recently retrofitted to include real-time control to achieve this improved volume removal goal. These systems utilize the physical processes present in green infrastructure (infiltration, evapotranspiration, etc.) tomanipulate the hydrologic timing to optimize performance through actively controlled inflows and discharges from the system. The control is implemented through a cloud-native platform developed by OptiRTC, a technology firm focused on control of stormwater infrastructure. A modeling study was completed of a real-time controlled green and gray roof system on the Villanova University campus. The study site is comprised of an existing extensive green roof and an adjacent gray roof that has been retrofitted to capture excess runoff from the system. Stored runoff is actively released onto the green roof during dry periods to fully utilize the evapotranspiration potential of the green roof while increasing total capture from the system. The system as a whole demonstrates how forecast information, remote sensing, and self-learning components can be integrated into a green infrastructure system to optimize performance. The long-term continuous simulation compared performance of the green roof system to the performance prior to being retrofitted, allowing for the benefit of the real-time control to be evaluated.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							357	364										WOS:000404788200028

This new type of SBR modified the original tank structure, utilizing fixed weir as the effluent pattern. We made a comparative analysis for effluent water quality between fixed weir SBR and original SBR. As a result, making the water level stable inside of water tank is a good method to raise the water quality of effluent. In conclusion, we believe that the fixed weir SBR can become one replaced type of SBR in the future.																			978-0-7844-8063-2				2017							497	505										WOS:000404788200041

As part of a larger reservoir reoperation study, a continuous simulation model of the Russian River watershed in California, USA, was developed using the Hydrologic Engineering Center's Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). Modelling focused on quantifying soil moisture and reproducing observed runoff through the wet/dry annual cycles of a 60 year simulation period, 1950 through 2010. The Russian River model simulated soil moisture using the soil moisture accounting (SMA) and deficit and constant loss methods coupled with the Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration method. Model calibration focused on reproducing observed basin runoff signatures including flood flow-frequency, seasonal runoff, and the runoff hydrograph. Performance measures quantified the model's ability to reproduce observations and proved the model useful for subsequent reservoir reoperation analyses. This paper presents model development using HEC-HMS for continuous simulation of the Russian River watershed; steps include forming precipitation and evapotranspiration boundary conditions, initializing and calibrating model parameters, and evaluating results, to arrive at a final useful model.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							12	21										WOS:000404786200002

Four major rivers, many smaller creeks, five wastewater treatment plants, and groundwater discharge to the Chehalis River. Flooding is a major problem in the relatively flat areas surrounding the cities of Chehalis and Centralia. As a result, construction of a flood-control dam in the upper basin has been proposed. One major concern of constructing a dam is the potentially severe impacts to fish health and habitat. The Chehalis River has routinely violated water quality standards for primarily temperature and dissolved oxygen. CE-QUAL-W2, a two-dimensional (longitudinal and vertical) hydrodynamic and water quality model, was used to simulate the Chehalis River, including free flowing river stretches and stratified (in summer) lake-like stretches. The goals of this research were to assess the flood retention structure's impacts to water quality, as well as river responses to potential climate change scenarios. In order to use the model to achieve these goals, calibration to field data for flow, temperature, and water quality constituents was performed for the years 2013 and 2014. Once calibration was complete, model scenarios for future climate conditions and dam operating regimes were conducted. Future conditions showed predictions of warmer water temperatures and slight changes to water quality conditions on the river. As fish in the area prefer cooler water temperatures, this could pose a threat to fish health and habitat. Flood retention structures with the purpose of flood retention only (only operating during times of flooding) gave model predictions for daily maximum temperature higher than structures that employed flood retention and flow augmentation (operating during all times of the year). This suggested the management of flow passage or retention by the dam is important for water quality on the river.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							203	217										WOS:000404786200019

These models were coupled to a fish bioenergetics model and used to explore management strategies to improve water quality in the reservoirs affecting kokanee production. The models were also applied to evaluate the impacts of the proposed implementation of the Kachess Drought Relief Pumping Plant (KDRPP) projects. The public domain model, CE-QUAL-W2 Version 4 (Cole and Wells, 2016) was adapted to model the reservoirs. CEQUAL-W2 is a 2-dimensional (longitudinal-vertical) hydrodynamic and water quality model capable of predicting water surface, velocity, temperature, nutrients, multiple algae, zooplankton, periphyton, and macrophyte species, fish bioenergetics, sediment diagenesis, dissolved oxygen, pH, alkalinity, multiple CBOD groups, multiple suspended solids groups, multiple generic constituents (such as tracer, bacteria, toxics), and multiple organic matter groups, both dissolved and particulate. The model is set up to predict these state variables at longitudinal segments and vertical layers. Comparisons of field data to model predictions were made for water level, temperature, NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P, total N, Total P, total organic carbon, alkalinity, zooplankton, pH, chlorophyll a, and dissolved oxygen at multiple reservoir sites at various depths.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							218	232										WOS:000404786200020

Many studies have measured pollutant loads from agricultural or urban landuses and majority of them have focused on total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) pollutant loading into watershed in a specific region. In some cases, the EMC or export load values reported in each of the studies have a wide range of magnitude for a specific landuse. The sources of the difference in the pollutant loading values for each of the landuses could be due to the region and physical characteristics (e.g. slope and soil type) of watershed, methods of measuring EMCs and loads, the number of samples taken from watershed outlet and rainfall intensity. This paper summarizes and combines some published EMC and load values separately categorized for urban and agricultural lanuses. Then, for each of the landuses, a box and whisker or statistic plots were created using median EMC and load values, which are reported in different literatures. Because the results of this study are supposed to be used as an input for Kentucky Nutrient Model (KYNM), the studies that report EMC and load values in State of Kentucky were incorporated in the data as much as possible. The provided range of EMC and load values could be very useful for the users of water quality models who need to have a holistic idea of pollutant magnitude released from each landuse in watershed outlets.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							273	282										WOS:000404786200024

Estimating Risks for Water-Quality Exceedances of Total-Copper from Highway and Urban Runoff under Predevelopment and Current Conditions with the Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model (SELDM)	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				The Stochastic Empirical Loading and Dilution Model (SELDM) was used to demonstrate methods for estimating risks for water-quality exceedances of event-mean concentrations (EMCs) of total-copper. Monte Carlo methods were used to simulate stormflow, total-hardness, suspended-sediment, and total-copper EMCs as stochastic variables. These simulations were done for the Charles River basin upstream of Interstate 495 in Bellingham, Massachusetts. The hydrology and water quality of this site were simulated with SELDM by using data from nearby, hydrologically similar sites. Three simulations were done to assess the potential effects of the highway on receiving-water quality with and without highway-runoff treatment by a structural best-management practice (BMP). In the low-development scenario, total copper in the receiving stream was simulated by using a sediment transport curve, sediment chemistry, and sediment-water partition coefficients. In this scenario, neither the highway runoff nor the BMP effluent caused concentration exceedances in the receiving stream that exceed the once in three-year threshold (about 0.54 percent). In the second scenario, without the highway, runoff from the large urban areas in the basin caused exceedances in the receiving stream in 2.24 percent of runoff events. In the third scenario, which included the effects of the urban runoff, neither the highway runoff nor the BMP effluent increased the percentage of exceedances in the receiving stream. Comparison of the simulated geometric mean EMCs with data collected at a downstream monitoring site indicates that these simulated values are within the 95-percent confidence interval of the geometric mean of the measured EMCs.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							313	327										WOS:000404786200028

The model tool contains three main modules; the pre-processing tool based GIS functions, the runoff calculation for water balance and nutrient load based on the theory of Generalized Watershed Loading Functions with a number of enhancements and modifications, and the routing calculation engaging with HEC-RAS model for the hydrodynamics and transport processes in river systems. All components are immersed into an open source GIS MapWindow software (www.mapwindow.org) as plug-ins. The modeling tool is programming in VB.NET, and designed to complement and interoperate with enterprise and full-featured under MapWindow GIS functions. A GIS-based numerical tool makes watershed and water quality studies easier by bringing key data and analytical components under one GIS (Geographic Information System) roof. Through the use of GIS, the model has the flexibility to clip, integrate and display a wide range of information (e.g., basins, streams, weather, land use, soils, point source discharges, water supply, withdrawals, nutrient loads, etc.) at a scale chosen by the user. Minimum data requirements and effective application are advantages of this modeling tool. The model has been verified and validated against available well-known watershed models and observation data obtained from real applications for watershed systems in USA and Vietnam.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							373	383										WOS:000404786200033

In this lake, wind shear is the major driving force for flow hydrodynamics. The flow fields, nutrients and chlorophyll concentration in Beasley Lake were simulated using CCHE2D, a hydrodynamic and water quality model developed at the National Center for Computational Hydroscience and Engineering. The effects of runoff and sediment from upland watershed on the lake water quality were taken into accounted. The simulated results were validated using field measurements. It was found that the chlorophyll concentration is greatly affected by suspended sediment concentration in the lake.

Agricultural Drainage in the Northeastern US: Past History and Future Challenges	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Agriculture drainage increased from the early 1900s to the early 1980s. During the 1970s and 1980s increasing environmental concerns increasingly viewed agricultural drainage as being against the public's best interests. The Clean Water Act amendments in 1977 and the Food Security Act of 1985 all had an effect on agricultural drainage. Water quality effects of agricultural drainage projects started to be reported in the literature in the 1970s and 1980s. There were a number of projects conducted in the Northeast. To address water quality concerns, some controlled drainage systems were installed on the Delmarva Peninsula in the 1990s. Research has shown subsurface drainage can transport large amounts of nitrogen to surface waters. New York has a large dairy population, so manure is the largest input of nitrogen to surface problems in a number of watersheds. Also of concern is the rapid transport of nitrates and bacteria by preferential flow to subsurface drains when liquid manure is spread on fields. On the Delmarva Peninsula poultry manure has been a great concern for many years of in the Chesapeake Bay and Inland Bays watersheds. With the release of the TMDL by EPA in 2010 for the Chesapeake Bay it has become more of a concern																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							439	452										WOS:000404786200038

The Total Phosphorus with Point and Non-Point Inflows to Great Lakes-A Critical Review and GLWQA Targets	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				The occurrence of algae blooms in the US waterbodies has become an annually recurring phenomenon. Lake Erie of the Great Lakes (North America) has been experiencing significant and harmful algae-blooms (HABs) during the mid-July to mid-September for more than ten (10) years now. The watersheds in the US are significantly affected by algae-bloom formations during the summer months, and, this has been a vicious cycle that the point and non-point wastewater effluents contribute nutrients to waterbodies, specifically during the Spring time, and the need to draw those intake waters to effectively treat those complex algal-blooms forming during the summer time in maintaining the uninterrupted supply of the potable water to cities and towns. Good reductions of total phosphorus (TP) loadings to Great Lakes, specifically to the Lake Erie, were accomplished compared to the 1970s; however, the non-point source TP loading to Lake Erie has been significant and varying year-to-year. More effective TP estimation methodology with respect to the phosphorus discharging sources will be required. Additional TP reductions are necessary toward a good water quality of Great Lakes. Interim open water TP concentrations and loadings are in effect since 2012, until updated. The Phosphorus Task Committee has recommended that March to July total Spring phosphorus loads should be reduced, and some of the basins of Lake Erie the nutrient load must be reduced as much as by 40%. The best management practices (BMPs) have been identified and recommended to be put into practice. In this work, authors focused on: Great Lakes' water-asset; nutrient TP loadings to Great Lakes and effects; the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA), on nutrient TP concentration and loading targets; TP including the dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loading targets to the Lake Erie; a review on Lake Michigan; and, the binational (Ca and USA) action plans for TP reductions and, nutrient and excessive algae-bloom control requirements.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							453	467										WOS:000404786200039

To account for a range of uncertainty in future conditions through 2100, a scenario-based approach was developed using climate projections available from Couple Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model simulations and sea level rise projections consistent with National Research Council (NRC) and the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report 5 (AR5). The performance of the Central Valley water system was evaluated for a range of metrics including water deliveries, water quality, hydropower, flood control, recreation, fish, and wildlife habitats, ESA species, flow dependent ecological resiliency and the economic impacts of water supply changes using an integrated model package that simulates the federal Central Valley Project, the State Water Project and local system operations and regulatory requirements. The study also included the development and evaluation of a range of water management actions that can help reduce or manage future risks posed by potential changes in climate and socioeconomic conditions. Seven adaptation portfolios were explored that each consisted of a variety of water management actions. These thematic portfolios were evaluated to determine their effectiveness in adapting to potential risks posed by future socioeconomic and climate changes and to assess tradeoffs between their relative performances.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							558	566										WOS:000404786200048

In coastal areas, natural hazards such as flood can significantly threat the coastal infrastructures' functionality. One way to evaluate the infrastructures performance during flooding is to measure its reliability. Reliability of the system is regarded as the probability of successful operation within the assumed time period. In this study, a framework is presented to analyze the wastewater treatment plants reliability during the time of flooding. The case study is New York City which have had experienced severe storms during the past decades and two major disasters in the last 5 years. Here, the reliability is referring to the ability to maintain water quality standards of effluent in wastewater. In this way, the effluent concentration during flooding is considered as a random variable and it is compared with the discharge standards. The effluent concentration is computed by considering the status of different unit operations of WWTP during the flooding time, which may cause a disturbance and/or reduction in the unit's performance. For effluent concentration, different distributions functions are fitted and the water quality reliability of all different distributions are compared. The expected compliance with the discharge standards is computed by assuming a level of confidence which shows the reliability of the system. Results show the significant value of quantifying reliability to assess the performance of WWTP. The methodology can be applied to other coastal settings that are subject to coastal and inland flooding.																			978-0-7844-8060-1				2017							630	641										WOS:000404786200053

Tribenuron methyl exposure inhibits oogenesis in zebrafish Danio rerio (Hamilton, 1822)	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												Tribenuron methyl is a herbicide that is used to control annual and perennial dicots in cereals and fallow land. Pesticides can access aquatic ecosystems via groundwater and affect water quality and aquatic life. Our study evaluated histopathological effects of tribenuron methyl on ovary of the zebrafish Danio rerio (Hamilton, 1822). Ovary of the fishes in control group not exposed to the herbicide showed normal histological architecture. In the fishes exposed to tribenuron methyl, vacuolisation, edema and dysmorphism were recorded. Significant decrease in the number of primary and mature oocytes as well as dose dependent increase in the number of atretic oocytes were recorded in fishes exposed to tribenuron methyl.																	0970-6011						2017	64	2					127	131		10.21077/ijf.2017.64.2.68148-20								WOS:000404759500020

This management as an integral institutional policy should facilitate the interaction of stakeholders and stakeholders, determining roles for each actor and minimizing the negative consequences of misuse of these resources. Therefore, the following research questions were considered: Are the sustainability policies in the Institutional Development Plan (IDP) not expressed in order to manage the water quality of the Campus Itaperi? As these policies, if any, are being implemented? The specific objectives are: (a) to identify the evidence of sustainability policies in relation to the quality of the dam water located in the main campus of the State University of Ceara; (B) to compare the microbiological and physicochemical quality of water with the results of Cajado (2002). The methods used were: direct observation, document analysis, interviews and laboratory water analysis. The results show that the technically relevant parameters, analyzed and compared, reveal increases in their levels, indicating a growth of water pollution and confirms the finding of a lack of water resources management policy in the university.																	2237-3667						2017	7	1					34	48		10.18696/reunir.v7i1.444								WOS:000404661500003

The goal of this research is to develop a modeling ensemble for estimating sediment transport within large-scale mountainous catchments (>1000 km(2)). The results from four sediment modules inserted into a common hydrologic framework are presented to quantify uncertainty and improve predictability. The ensemble includes empirical modules: monovariate rating curve (MRC) and the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE), a stochastic module: multi-variate regression using a generalized linear model (GLM) and a physically-based module: Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) sediment model. Calibration results from a multi-objective optimization routine are presented that optimize parameters and identify performance tradeoffs. The GLM module had the overall highest performance for both daily (NSE=0.84) and eventbased (NSE=0.99) predictions. The MRC module performed well under both time steps (NSE=0.64, NSE=0.91). The MUSLE module had the highest performance in percent bias (0.56%) of all the modules, though it performed poorly in timing and variability for both time steps (NSE=0.22, NSE=0.49). The DHSVM module performed the poorest under the daily simulation (NSE=-0.24), but the skill was greatly enhanced for event-based predictions (NSE=0.96) reflecting the influence of temporal discretization. This work highlights the tradeoffs in sediment prediction across a range of model structures with key differences in daily versus event-based model performance.

Characteristic Spatiotemporal Scales of Runoff and Sediment at the Plot Scale: Implications to Sediment Transport Modeling	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: HYDRAULICS AND WATERWAYS AND WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS ANALYSIS					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Changing climate and topography gradients are factors that collectively account for the variability in water and sediment fluxes in large agricultural systems. This variability hinders the effective management and monitoring of water quality and nutrient cycling, and emanates from the characteristic spatiotemporal scales of runoff and sediment processes for both the smaller and larger systems. The aim of this study is to describe these characteristic spatiotemporal scales at the plot scale by accounting for the interplay between relevant erosion processes and the forcing characteristics. Two experimental cases with uniform slope are considered, rainfall simulators are used to generate rainfall, and runoff and sediment are continuously measured at a downstream weir. Our results show how the coevolution of the aforementioned processes affect the characteristic spatiotemporal scales of runoff and sediment transport. A qualitative assessment of the coevolution of the dominant processes and their impact on the hydrologic response and landscape evolution at the plot scale, combined with the observed spatial features of the plot throughout the rainfall event provide insight into the interplay between these processes. This study is a step towards understanding patterns of runoff and sediment and the associated propagation across scale, as well as informing sediment transport modeling.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							429	438										WOS:000404784900039

Problems that needed priority attention included contaminated sediment, poor water quality, and lost or altered habitat. The transport of nutrients, sediments and contaminants plays an important role on the biogeochemistry, ecology and health of the bay. Local, state and federal agencies have studied the problems caused by excessive nutrients and contaminated sediments. In 1989 Gottlieb et al. deployed tracked drifters from six locations in the bay to map flow patterns. In 2015 Hamidi et al. examined the role of circulation and heat fluxes in the formation of stratification and hypoxia in the bay. Their hydrodynamic model calculates horizontal dispersion using the Smagorinsky turbulence closure model. In 2014 Nguyen et al. used a hydrodynamic model to examine circulation and exchange in the Saginaw Bay-Lake Huron system. Their model was tested against data from a Lagrangian drifter experiment. For this study drifters were deployed in the bay in 2014. Locations of drifters were tracked using GPS transmitters, and those locations were used to calculate one-point dispersion statistics. A Lagrangian particle-tracking model was used to simulate the drifter trajectories. Cross-bay and along-bay velocities were used to compute diffusivities in those directions for observed and simulated drifter tracks. Diffusivity values were estimated using statistical analysis of particles released from a point source in isotropic turbulent flow. The field-data validated diffusivities will be used to improve predictions of the transport and fate of nutrients and sediments in the bay.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							439	448										WOS:000404784900040

The quality of water delivered in a WDS is difficult to maintain and monitor, as water quality can degrade within a water distribution system's pipes. A network of online monitoring stations designed to sample water quality in real-time, and to be strategically placed in a water distribution system has proven an effective method to monitor water quality and provide early warning of a contaminant intrusion. A difficult task for an online monitoring station is to distinguish natural variability in water quality from variability caused by the presence of a contaminant in the water. Prior studies have shown how common water quality indicators (free chlorine, pH, conductivity, total organic carbon) respond to contaminants, and methods to ease the task of recognizing true contaminant presence. This work proposes an objective function incorporating the uncertainty in a monitoring station's detection employed in the framework of a genetic algorithm to place sensors at locations which minimize the expected consequence of a contamination event, and where water quality data are most indicative of true contamination events. Early warning systems composed of fixed water quality stations and inline mobile water quality sensors are designed in a multi-objective framework for a sample water distribution system.

Potential for contaminations and cross connections make it difficult to ensure that the water being delivered to consumers is truly of high quality. The placement of water quality monitoring stations within a WDS system has proven a successful method to prevent the delivery of contaminated water. The locations of monitoring stations in a WDS is critical to the performance of a water quality monitoring station network (early warning system or EWS); ideally sensors will be placed at a limited number of locations which can quickly detect all contamination events. Designing a EWS to protect against every possible contamination event is computationally infeasible; however it is crucial that high impact contamination events will be detected. In this study a contamination event is defined as an intrusion taking place at a specific junction and time in a WDS. A probability distribution is generated according to the portion of a network's population served by water that flows "downstream" from a specific junction at a specific time, within a defined interval of time; this portion of population would be most at risk to exposure of the corresponding junction and time. The newly generated probability distribution is then used for sampling a set of contamination events used to design an EWS. The downstream nodes are calculated using breadth first search and the nodal populations are calculated according to the temporal demands. The relative consequence of a junction being contaminated is calculated using steady state and dynamic hydraulic models; elevating the need to perform numerous complex water quality simulations. Monitoring station networks designed using the proposed importance sampling technique and traditional random sampling are compared.

Utilities developing these monitoring systems are faced with the decision of what locations are optimal for deployment of sensors. The TEVA-SPOT software was developed to analyze the vulnerability of systems and aid utilities in designing sensor networks. However, many small utilities do not have the technical or financial resources needed to effectively use TEVA-SPOT. As a result, a sensor placement algorithm (i. e. Water Quality Sensor Placement Tool -WQSPT) was developed and implemented in a commercial network distribution modeling software (i.e. KYPIPE) as a simple tool to aid small utilities in sensor placement. The developed tool was validated using 12 small distribution system models and multiple contamination scenarios for the placement of one and two sensors. Results were compared with data from identical simulations runs in TEVA-SPOT to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Because the proposed algorithm uses a simple complete enumeration strategy for sensor placement, the algorithm was able to select the same or superior nodes to those selected by TEVA-SPOT.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							534	548										WOS:000404784900050

While widely used, the approach has not been examined fully on how it impacts the modeling fidelity. This study intends to evaluate these consequences in a typical water distribution system. We first analyzed tracer test data at 13 locations using a calibrated EPANET model with generalized water demand patterns. Modeling results agree with actual measurements in six locations with high water demand and flow velocity near the storage tank, while fail to replicate the variations in network abundant of dead- ends and Tee/ Cross junctions. Then we further investigated the causes of model inaccuracy using real- time water demand data covering similar to 35% water users. This paper compares several levels of pipe skeletonization and water demand aggregation in water age simulation, and shows significant impacts on water age results because of discrete water demand at pipe nodes. The analysis reveals varying flow properties and the movement of highly aged water parcels in two types of pipe configurations. These results have the implications on network modeling and further studies of water quality simulations.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							593	601										WOS:000404784900055

In the case of a contamination event the contaminated section of the water distribution system should be located, isolated and cleaned before it can be returned to regular service. Depending on the specific contaminant, the cleaning process mainly includes flushing and disinfection. All of the disinfection methods (for example: tablet, continuous and slug) require that the disinfectants will have minimal contact time (T) in a predefined concentration (C) with the pipes and the system's apparatuses. The regulatory agencies, such as the Ministry of Health in Israel or the American Water Work Association, publishes procedures for the disinfection of water systems in which usually only a single water main is considered and no specific procedures are given for larger portions of the water system. This paper presents an optimal operation plan for the disinfection of water distribution systems using the slug feed method while considering the injection times, flow rates and drainage locations while keeping variable disinfection C*T values in different areas of the network. The method is a two stage GA-EPANET procedure. It is demonstrated on a small real-world network section.

It's necessary to establish of a set of water quality early warning system which can quickly and accurately identify contamination. The existing anomaly detection methods are either simple fusion of abnormal judgment results from single index [1], or correlation analysis of multiple parameters at the cost of high time complexity. Aimed to solve these problems, this paper describes a multivariate correlation analysis method based on the longest common subsequence (LCSS) analysis combined with Dempster- Shafer (D- S) evidence theory. The proposed method utilizes adaptive sliding window scale to acquire water quality parameter time sequence, LCSS to describe similarity between different water quality series fluctuation, and D- S evidence theory to calculate abnormal probabilities. The ROC curve is introduced to verify the algorithm performance. Tested by data from the laboratory contaminant injection experiment, this approach shows nice ability in dealing with time series deformation problem rapidly, which to a certain extent can improve the reliability of multi- index correlation degree analysis, and ultimately reduce the abnormal water contamination event detection false alarm rate.																			978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							624	636										WOS:000404784900059

To tackle these challenges, new sustainable water management strategies, like water sensitive urban design (WSUD), have been gaining increasing interest in the last couple of years. The software tool UrbanBEATS (Urban Biophysical Environments and Technologies Simulator) supports decision makers in the planning and implementation of such WSUD strategies, by combining and processing spatial and non-spatial data (e.g. land use, population, elevation, rainfall/ climate). In the field of water distribution system (WDS) analysis, the implementation of decentralized rainwater harvesting or gray water reuse measures can strongly influence the water quality performance of an existing central pipe system. Here, we show how demand reduction scenarios modelled with UrbanBEATS through the implementation of different water efficiency or water use restrictions impact WDS quality analysis undertaken in Epanet2.					rathnayaka, suranji/0000-0001-5454-8336; Zischg, Jonatan/0000-0002-7506-1073; Bach, Peter/0000-0001-5799-6185; Sitzenfrei, Robert/0000-0003-1093-6040														978-0-7844-8062-5				2017							692	702										WOS:000404784900064

When dissolved in ultrapure water, adsorption of the ECs followed the trend of AH > MS > PE, with a positive effect of the adsorbent dose. According to the analysis of the adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics, PAC showed strongly higher adsorption efficiency in both capacity and velocity of the adsorption, in agreement with its higher mesoporosity. Equilibrium isotherm data were fitted by Langmuir and Freundlich models. Pseudo-second order kinetics modeled very successfully the adsorption process. Finally, the effect of the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the water matrices (ultrapure water, surface water and two effluents from wastewater treatment plants) on the adsorption of the selected ECs onto PAC was established, as well as its performance on the removal of water quality parameters. Results show a negative effect of the DOM content on the adsorption efficiency. Over 50% of organic matter was removed with high PAC doses, revealing that adsorption onto PAC is an effective technology to remove both micro-pollutants and DOM from water matrices.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	8					727	734		10.1080/10934529.2017.1301751								WOS:000404661400004	28358290

In this research, through two simultaneous experiments, we assessed the effects of different land uses (urban, agriculture, cattle grazing, farms and recreation) on the growth and survival of snails from native populations. The survival was not affected by the water quality of the three streams studied, whereas the growth of snails exposed to the water of the urban stream was impaired. Therefore, our results suggest that the growth rate of P. canaliculata could be useful for the assessment of a moderate urban impact.																	0165-0521	1744-5140					2017	52	2					95	102		10.1080/01650521.2017.1294359								WOS:000404652300002

Drought assessment using drought indices have widely conducted for drought monitoring. Remote-sensing-based indices defined as an index which using remote sensing data for mapping the drought condition in particular area or region. This research aims to compare remote-sensing-based drought indices, namely TCI, VCI and VHI to obtain a better understanding about the differentiation between each index, and their application for monitoring drought in East Java on El Nino year 2015. LST and EVI data were used to construct the indices. The result showed, each index proved to be useful, quick, sufficient and inexpensive tool for drought monitoring. However, each index has its differences. TCI proved to be detected drought sensitively in dry season or months when high temperature occurred. While VCI detected drought more sensitive in wet season as well (December-January-February to May) than TCI and VHI. Meanwhile, VHI which the enhancement of TCI and VHI has combined two indicators to provide better comprehension about drought occurrence.																	1755-1307						2017	54								UNSP 012009	10.1088/1755-1315/54/1/012009								WOS:000404120100009

Based on satellite imagery classification, protected region covers 885.76 ha (22.71%), while cultivated region occupied 3,041.69 ha (77.29%) in 2011. It means that the land use and covers change (LUCC) to be cultivated rapidly increase. Those conditions had impacted positively to the local economy development, however it had negatively degrades water quality in Ciputen Agung river. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to analyze LUCC impacts to the water quality (WQ) in Cipunten Agung watershed. Supervised classification method and Water Pollution Index (WPI) approach were correlated to define the optimal solution to reduce the rate of LUCC. The result shows that area of cultivation tree and paddy field are higher than others in midstream, and settlement is higher in downstream, particularly at riparian landscapes. The concentration of total phospate, nitrite, and nitrate which indicated from agriculture land were complies with WPI class 2 until 4 standart. The rate of LUCC of Cipunten Agung watershed and the density of settlement are potential to be the driving factor of water quality degradation. Regional planning with ecology approach was recommended for sustainable development of Cipunten Agung Wateshed.																	1755-1307						2017	54								UNSP 012025	10.1088/1755-1315/54/1/012025								WOS:000404120100025

The main causes of the problems encountered in the Cidanau Watershed are associated with the human factors, especially encroachment and conversion of forest into farmland. The encroachment has made most forest in Cidanau Watershed become bare land. To preserve the ecological function of agroforestry systems in Cidanau Watershed, monitoring of the condition of the vegetation canopy in agroforestry systems is really needed. High intensity thinning of crown density due to deforestation can change stand leaf area index dramatically. By knowing LAI, we can assess the condition of the vegetation canopy in agroforestry systems. LAI in this research was obtained from Hemispherical Photographs analysis using the threshold method in HemiView Canopy Analysis Software. Our research results indicate that there are six types of agroforestry in Cidanau Watershed i.e. Sengon Agroforestry, Clove Agroforestry, Melinjo Agroforestry, Chocolate Agroforestry, Coffee Agroforestry, and Complex Agroforestry. Several factors potentially contribute to variations in the value of LAI in different types of agroforestry. The simple assumptions about differences ranges of LAI values on six types of agroforestry is closely related to leaf area and plant population density.																	1755-1307						2017	54								UNSP 012050	10.1088/1755-1315/54/1/012050								WOS:000404120100050

In monitoring program biotic indices are now widely established in water quality monitoring around the world, including in the tropical countries. The aim of this study was to reveal the ecological status of Cisadane River's headwaters in inside and outside of Mount Halimun-Salak National Park by using benthic macroinvertebrates. The research was conducted in the headwaters of Cisadane River located in Mount Halimun-Salak National Park. Macroinvertebrates were collected from four sites, i.e. inside the park (station 1, 2, 3, and 4) and from two sites outside the park (station 5 and 6). Collections were made twice a month, starting from April to June 2015 by means of Surber sampler (frame area 30x30 cm). A total of 65 genera from 38 families and 11 orders were found in the river. The results showed that based on diversity index, Lincoln Quality Index (LQI), Family Biotic Index (FBI), and Stream Invertebrate Grade Number Average Level 2 (SIGNAL 2), stations located within national park were ecologically better than those outside national park. Rivers with well-preserved riverside vegetation, as in the national park area have greater ecological status.																	1755-1307						2017	54								UNSP 012023	10.1088/1755-1315/54/1/012023								WOS:000404120100023

It is 119 km long with a catchment area of 476 km2. It flows from Bogor Regency and crosses Bogor City, Depok City, and Jakarta before finally flowing into Java Sea through Jakarta Bay. The water quality in Ciliwung River has degraded. Many factors affect water quality. Understanding the relationship between land use and surface water quality is necessary for effective water management. It has been widely accepted that there is a close relationship between the land use type and water quality. This study aims to analyze the influence of various land use types on the water quality within the Ciliwung Watershed based on the water quality monitoring data and remote sensing data in 2010 and 2014. Water quality parameters exhibited significant variations between the urbandominated and forest-dominated sites. The proportion of urban land was strongly positively associated with total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentrations.

The assessment of drinking water that supplies the purification system allowed good-quality physical, chemical, and microbiological specifications. The physicochemical specifications of the distributed purified water were approved, but the heterotrophic bacteria count was higher than allowed (> 2 log CFU mL(-1)). The sanitation of the storage tank with chlorine decreased the number of bacteria adhered to the surface (4.34 cycles log). By sequencing of the 16SrDNA genes, six species of bacteria were identified. The contact angle was determined and polypropylene surface and all bacteria were considered to be hydrophilic, and adhesion was thermodynamically unfavorable. This case study showed the importance of monitoring the water quality in the purified water systems and the importance of sanitization with chemical agents. The count of heterotrophic bacteria on the polypropylene surface was consistent with the predicted thermodynamics results because the number of adhered cells reached approximate values of 5 log CFU cm(-2).

The area has a 40 year plus history of legal and illicit industrial waste disposal and public debate on the associated environmental degradation. The study focuses on the perceptions and beliefs of a sector of the community likely to be directly and negatively affected by stigma, that is small business owners in the tourism and hospitality sector. The qualitative analysis explores awareness and viewpoints on environmental degradation and water quality within the local context, implications for the local economy and the individual's own enterprise, views on industrial environmental management as well as corporate responsibility and future prospects for the environmental problems of Asopos. Findings reveal a noticeable variation in views on industrial pollution and ecosystem deterioration among the respondents, but overall a strong environmentally induced stigmatization of the area. They also uncover an information asymmetry and lack of credible commitment by government bodies and industry members in disclosing accurate information, a situation likely to increase speculation and uncertainty within the community. The paper concludes by addressing implications of the findings to policy-making and managerial considerations, along with future research perspectives which aim to increase considerations of sustainability aspects for local development.

Shoreline change near inlet includes change in position and shape of inlet, inlet channel length, and spit growth/erosion. These variable features of lagoon inlet(s) critically depend on alongshore sediment transport (LST) and discharge (water and sediment) from the lagoon to the sea. The LST and the processes responsible for sand spit growth/erosion, considered as important attributes of inlet stability, are the subject matter of the present investigation and hence the study assumes importance. The study includes integration of observational and modeling framework. Observations include nearshore wave, bathymetry, beach profile, shoreline and sediment grain size of spits while numerical modeling includes simulation of the wave using MIKE 21 Spectral Wave model and LST simulation using LITtoral DRIFT. The results indicate that the predominant wave directions as S and SSE, which induces round the year south to north alongshore transport with significant seasonal variation in magnitude. The estimated LST closely matches with previous studies near Chilika inlet and for other locations along the Odisha coast. Besides temporal variability, the study reveals spatial variability in alongshore transport near Chilika inlet and considers it as one of the important attributes along with northward spit growth for inlet migration/closure/opening.

A Deep Learning Paradigm for Detection of Harmful Algal Blooms	2017 IEEE WINTER CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER VISION (WACV 2017)	IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision				17th IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)	MAR 24-31, 2017	Santa Rosa, CA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Biometr Council				Effective and cost-efficient monitoring is indispensable for ensuring environmental sustainability. Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (CyanoHABs)are a major water quality and public health issue in inland water bodies. The recent popularity of online social media (OSM) platforms coupled with advances in cloud computing and data analytics has given rise to citizen science-based approaches to environmental monitoring. These approaches involve the lay community in the acquisition, collection and transmission of relevant data in the form of tweets, images, voice recordings and videos typically acquired using low-cost mobile devices such as smartphones or tablet computers. While cost effective, citizen science-based approaches are highly susceptible to noise, inaccuracies and missing data. In this paper we address the problem of automated detection of harmful algal blooms (HABs) via analysis of image data of inland water bodies. These image data are acquired using a variety of smartphones and communicated via popular OSM platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. To account for the wide variations in imaging parameters and ambient environmental parameters we propose a deep learning approach to image feature extraction and classification for the purpose of HAB detection. The current system is a first step in the design of an automated early detection, warning and rapid response system that can be adopted to mitigate the detrimental effects of CyanoHAB contamination of inland water bodies.																	2472-6737		978-1-5090-4822-9				2017							743	751		10.1109/WACV.2017.88								WOS:000404165800079

Steam exiting the turbines is condensed in surface condensers to be returned to boilers. Therefore, surface condenser performance and quality of condensate water are very important. One of the recent problem was caused by the leak of a surface condenser of Steam Turbine Power Generator. Thesteam turbine was overhauled, leaving the surface condenser idle and exposed to air for more than 1.5 years. Sea water ingress due to tube leaks worsens the corrosionof the condenser shell. The combination of mineral scale and corrosion product resulting high conductivity condensate at outlet condenser when we restarted up, beyond the acceptable limit.After assessing several options, chemical cleaning was the best way to overcome the problem according to condenser configuration. An 8 hour circulation of 5%wt citric acid had succeed reducing water conductivity from 50 mu mhos/cm to below 5 mu mhos/cm. The condensate water, then meets the required quality, i.e. pH 8.3-9.0; conductivity <= 5 mu mhos/cm, therefore the power generator can be operated normally without any concern until now.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1491-4				2017	1823								UNSP 020085-1	10.1063/1.4978158								WOS:000404123700085

Current wastewater treatment still causes pollution in the river. This thesis aims to analyze the performance of wastewater treatment in natural stones industry. The data was collected from water quality test (parameters: temperature, pH. DO, and TSS). The wastewater treatment performance was in a slightly higher position compared to the 2nd class quality standards of Government Regulation No. 82/2001. The parameter that exceeded quality standards was the concentration of TSS, which was up to 240.8 mg/I. The high concentration of TSS was affected by the absence of sludge management schedule, which resulted in non-optimal precipitation. Besides that, the design of sedimentation basin was still not adapted with wastewater debit. Referring to the results, this study suggests the government of Cirebon District to provide wastewater treatment development through the village staff. Furthermore, the government also needs to give strict punishment to business owner who does not treat waste correctly and does not have a business license. Moreover, the sale value of sludge as byproduct of wastewater treatment needs to be increased.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1491-4				2017	1823								UNSP 020056-1	10.1063/1.4978129								WOS:000404123700056

Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate the spatial variation of water quality along the coastline of the southwestern region of Sarawak using multivariate statistical techniques. Seventeen physicochemical parameters were measured at 11 stations along the coastline with approximately 225 km length. The coastal water quality showed spatial heterogeneity where the cluster analysis grouped the 11 stations into four different clusters. Deterioration in coastal water quality has been observed in different regions of Sarawak corresponding to land use patterns in the region. Nevertheless, nitrate-nitrogen exceeded the guideline value at all sampling stations along the coastline. The principal component analysis (PCA) has determined a reduced number of five principal components that explained 89.0% of the data set variance. The first PC indicated that the nutrients were the dominant polluting factors, which is attributed to the domestic, agricultural, and aquaculture activities, followed by the suspended solids in the second PC which are related to the logging activities.

The hair mineral content was compared in Koniks raised in a barn and a nature reserve. The foals bred in the reserve were divided into two groups based on the area occupied by the herds from which they originated. Hair samples were collected from 53 Koniks born over two consecutive years. Green forage and hair samples were analyzed to determine the concentrations of macro-elements (P, K, Mg, Ca and Na) and microelements (Cu, Zn, Mn and Fe). Water quality was evaluated based on its pH and the concentrations of N-NO3, N-NH4, P-PO4, K, Ca, Mg, Na and Cl. The hair coats of foals raised in the reserve had a significantly higher content of K and Na than the hair coats of stabled Koniks. Significant differences in the concentrations of K, Na, P and Ca in the hair coat were also noted between the two groups of horses in the reserve. The hair coats of foals born and raised in a stable had a higher content of Fe, Mn, and Cu. No significant differences in the hair macromineral content were found between the sexes. As regards microminerals, higher concentrations of Fe and Mn were determined in the hair coats of mares. Environmental and management conditions exerted a significant effect on the mineral composition of the hair coat of Polish Konik horses. Differences were observed not only between foals raised in a barn and a nature reserve, but also between Koniks kept in the reserve.																	1644-2296						2017	22	3					857	867		10.5601/jelem.2016.21.4.1340								WOS:000404270000001

Livestock Production and Its Impact on Nutrient Pollution and Greenhouse Gas Emissions	ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 141	Advances in Agronomy											The livestock sector provides more than one-third of human protein needs and is a major provider of livelihood in almost all developing countries. While providing such immense benefits to the population, poor livestock management can potentially provide harmful environmental impacts at local, regional, and national levels which have not been adequately addressed in many countries with emerging economies. Twenty-six percent of global land area is used for livestock production and forest lands are continuously being lost to such activities. Land degradation through soil erosion and nutrient depletion is very common across pastures and rangelands. The intensification of livestock production led to large surpluses of on-farm nitrogen and phosphorus inputs that can potentially contribute to nonpoint source pollution of water resources in many parts of the world. The sector is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributing around 14.5% of all human-induced GHG emissions, a major driver of use and pollution of freshwater (accounting 10% anthropogenic water use) and a contributor to the loss of biodiversity. About 60% of global biomass harvested annually to support all human activity is consumed by livestock industry, undermining the sustainability of allocating such large resource to the industry. Despite the negative impacts of livestock production, opportunities exist to balance the competing demands of livestock production and the environment. These include (1) improved technologies and practices that increase livestock productivity with optimal use of land and water, (2) reorienting grazing systems to provide environmental services for water, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and resource conservation, (3) reducing GHG emission from livestock production, and (4) an effective management strategy for efficient and sustainable use of manure in livestock production. Further research, appropriate policy development, and institutional support are important to ensure the competitiveness of the industry. Integration of crops with livestock production provides opportunities for increasing resource use efficiencies and reducing environmental pollution, making the system resilient to impacts of climate change, reducing GHG emissions from the system, enhancing soil quality and fertility, and improving water quantity and quality. Appropriate techniques for assessing and monitoring impacts of livestock production are necessary for developing strategies and making the system profitable, sustainable, and resilient. Isotopic and nuclear techniques play an important role in such assessment and monitoring.																	0065-2113		978-0-12-812424-6; 978-0-12-812423-9				2017	141						147	184		10.1016/bs.agron.2016.10.002								WOS:000403551300005

Agriculture land use can negatively impact water quality of lakes due to nutrient pollution. This research investigates the impacts of agricultural land use on the water quality of Lake Ripley in Oakland, Wisconsin from 1993 to 2011. This study performs a regression analysis which incorporates four years of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) data, eight spatial categories based on hydrological flow length across topographic surface, and a weighting technique to calculate land use percentages. The results indicate that the combination of agricultural land use and rainfall variables are significantly related to chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations, while these variables do not appear to affect Secchi depth measurements. Due to the near flat topography of the Lake Ripley watershed, agricultural land use within the two spatial regions closest to Lake Ripley and its inlet stream had the largest impact on Lake Ripley's water quality.																	2471-2132						2017	3	1					14	36		10.3934/geosci.2017.1.14								WOS:000404166000002

The present paper addresses a "Fuzzy River Health Index" (FRHI) which is capable of dealing with subjectivities and uncertainties concerning river health at various sites of the Chambal River, India. By considering the parameters like temperature, total solids (TS), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total coliform (TC), phosphate (P) and nitrate (N), the fuzzy model is established. The model uses triangular membership functions for fuzzification and centroid method for defuzzification. The proposed proficient method includes a fuzzy model which include IF-THEN ideas that help to determine River health using WQ parameters. The comparative performance models used are Carlson's trophic index (C-TSI),and Ecological health index (EHI). This study reveals that FRHI provides fairly good results; therefore, it concludes that the health of Chambal River is within excellent range (FRHI > 80). However, there is an urgent need to develop an effective and sustainable WQ monitoring for this study site, this proposed FRHI provides the flexibility for decision making in an integrated WQ management policies.

In this paradigm, the general uncertainty model represented by coprime factor uncertainty (CFU) description is able to cover both unmodeled dynamics and physical parameter variations at all frequencies. By using 2-DOF H-infinity loop-shaping technique, the designers can shape the frequency response of the original model into the desired shape which satisfies both transient response and robustness against various uncertainties. Top brine temperature and recycle brine flow rate have been chosen to stand for MSF plant performance. The simulation results demonstrate that the achieved controller has high stability margin, excellent abilities of disturbances and noises attenuations. In fact, it can deal with approximately 60% of parameter variations, reject at least 84% of exogenous disturbances, and 80% of sensor noises. Note that most currently used controllers reported cannot cope with those high levels of plant uncertainties and disturbances. Thus, it is necessary to implement the advanced control schemes for effectively controlling MSF plants, ensuring high water quality and optimizing water monitoring system. Finally, this robust control method with reduced-order can help prevent machine faults, stabilize MSF plants, optimize energy usage, and lower water production costs, with overcoming various limitations of some conventional controllers.

Domestic water demand of the city is supplied by the Degirmendere and Galyan streams after treatment at the drinking water treatment plants of the Trabzon Metropolitan Municipality. The main purpose of this study is to monitor and assess drinking water quality of these surface water resources before treatment with reference to 30 water-quality indicators. The monitoring results covering 1-year period revealed that each stream had high-quality water except for total Kjeldahl nitrogen, orthophosphate phosphorus, and total iron, by which each stream was classified as slightly polluted according to the Turkish Surface Water Quality Regulation. The results for the untreated stream waters were well below the permissible levels mandated or proposed by national and international references except for total iron. However, the post-treatment quality and safety of the stream waters used for drinking purposes matched the standards as indicated in the drinking water-quality reports of the Trabzon Metropolitan Municipality.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	62						120	139		10.5004/dwt.2017.1761								WOS:000403566800013

The main flow gradient of groundwater in the region is from a brackish aquifer in the east, to one of Israel's main freshwater aquifers (the coastal aquifer) in the west. To prevent salinization of the freshwater aquifer, a buffer zone has been created in-between the two aquifers, comprised of approximately 40 wells. These wells act as a barrier to salinization by pumping the brackish water before it reaches the coastal aquifer. This brackish water feeds the Granot BWRO and Lahat BWRO desalination plants. This aquifer rehabilitation project consists of three main parts: (1) a line of wells along the boundary between the two aquifers, (2) the BWRO desalination plants, and (3) a unique, exceptionally long (30 km) brine disposal pipeline to the Mediterranean Sea. From the outset, this project was designed to accommodate expansions in the production capacity of the system as well as to cope with increasing salinity of the source water. Accordingly, since 2004 there has been a gradual expansion over the years, in the number of desalination units within the Granot Plant. Currently, three desalination units are in operation, and a fourth unit is targeted to initiate production in June 2015. The total capacity at the Granot plant will be 41,600 m(3) d(-1) in 2015, and subsequent to the planned fifth unit, production is expected to reach 52,900 m(3) d(-1). This paper discusses the optimal design of the desalination plant, including considerations of RO membrane type, configuration, and post-treatment processes. This design is chosen to meet the permeate water quality regulations, and to minimize energy consumption. The design and construction of the Granot Plant meets all of the regulations of the Israeli Water Authority and the Israeli Ministry of Health, including respective boron and chloride concentration limits in the permeate, of 0.35 ppm and 20 ppm, respectively. Mekorot has also overcome several issues in the design phase as a result of an expected increase TDS and silica concentrations which might increase the scaling tendency. TDS and silica concentrations (and consequently, scaling) are expected to increase further by more than 20% during the coming decade. Experiments were carried out to address the challenge of preventing scaling on the RO membrane and within the brine disposal pipeline. These experiments have led to adjustments in the design features of the desalination units, including the operational conditions and chemical usage.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	61						206	214		10.5004/dwt.2016.11135								WOS:000403566100023						
J	Li, XX; Zhang, YJ; Zhao, XL; Liu, C				Li, Xiaoxiao; Zhang, Yuejun; Zhao, Xiaolei; Liu, Cheng			The performance of several enhanced treatment processes for treatment of algae-containing raw water in typical seasons	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The turbidity and algae removal effects of enhanced treatment processes, including the pre-chlorination process and the enhanced coagulation process using composite coagulants composed of poly-aluminum chloride and poly-dimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride (PDMDAAC) for algae-containing raw water in Taihu Lake, were investigated through jar tests in situ in this paper. And the dependence of the treatment effects on both the water quality in the typical seasons and the working mechanism of enhanced processes was analyzed and summarized. The results indicated that the pre-chlorination improved the treatment effect of conventional coagulation process in both the turbidity and algae removal effect for the raw water with the characteristics of high temperature, high algae and organic pollutants content in summer, and it improved also the algae removal effects, but weakened the turbidity removal effects for the raw water with the characteristics of low temperature, low algae content and tiny organic pollutants in winter. However, the enhanced coagulation process using composite coagulants improved even more remarkably the treatment effect of the conventional process using poly-aluminum chloride (PAC) only, for the algae-containing raw water both in summer and in winter. Especially, the improvement extent of the effects of using composite coagulants for algae-containing raw water in summer was more obviously than that in winter due to the characteristics of PDMDAAC and raw water. Besides, the turbidity and algae removal effects of enhanced coagulation process using composite coagulants could not only exceed that of the combined process of pre-chlorination and conventional coagulation using inorganic coagulants, but also indubitably replace the function of pre-chlorination for reducing the risks caused by excessively used chlorine.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	60						1	10		10.5004/dwt.2017.1198990								WOS:000403564800001						
J	Dehnoei, A; Taheri, R				Dehnoei, Ali; Taheri, Reza			A new strategy to reduce factors number in water quality measurements using Taguchi method - case study: the Karaj River	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												For water quality assessment, there are several water quality indices, such as National Sanitation Foundation-Water Quality Index (NSF-WQI). These indices are determined by measuring several parameters in different samplings. Because the value of some of the measured parameters is constant during the different samplings; hence, these parameters can be measured in the earlier samplings and be used in the later one. The identification of these parameters can reduce the time as well as the cost of water quality evaluation. In this study, a new strategy by Taguchi method was used to propose a method (proposed method) to determine the mentioned parameters in a case study of Karaj River, Iran. For demonstrating capability of this strategy, water quality was calculated by standard (NFS-WQI), adjusted, and proposed methods and then the results were compared. Nine measured parameters in standard method were reduced to four by using the proposed method. In contrast to standard and adjusted methods that showed significant differences (p < 0.1), there were no differences between proposed and standard method results. Therefore, the proposed method may be recommended for water quality evaluation with reduction of the cost and the time.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	60						106	113		10.5004/dwt.2017.1477								WOS:000403564800009

J	Kim, T; Park, H; Kim, H; Han, M				Kim, Tschungil; Park, Hyunju; Kim, Hyoungjun; Han, Mooyoung			Flocculation options in DAF for water quality	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The focus of this study was on exploring flocculation and the removal efficiency of particles in the DAF process using high hydraulic energy in the contact zone. First, a batch test was performed to compare the turbidity removal efficiency with and without flocculation. Results showed that flocculation could be omitted under specific conditions using hydraulic energy in the DAF process. Next, the turbidity removal efficiency, according to the hydraulic loading rate, was compared for the following cases: without flocculation, installation of baffles in the contact zone without flocculation, inclusion of a flocculator in the contact zone without flocculation, and inclusion of a flocculator with flocculation. The results showed that application of conventional flocculation, operation of a flocculator in the contact zone, installation of baffles in the contact zone, and elimination of flocculation are highly efficient. In particular, when the hydraulic loading rate was as low as 6, the efficiency of the process was >90%. When the hydraulic loading rate was 10, as in current water treatment plants, installation of either a flocculator or baffles in the contact zone resulted in over 90% efficiency. The hydraulic energy is high due to the injection of pressurized water into the contact zone, and appropriate installations in the contact zone lead to a decrease in the load of flocculation in DAF.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	59						89	93		10.5004/dwt.2016.1211								WOS:000403563700011						
J	Bagchi, S; Bokade, S; Shashibhushan				Bagchi, Surjyoti; Bokade, Suraj; Shashibhushan			Acid conductivity monitoring at demineralization plant: an important performance parameter	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The acid conductivity measurement is universally adopted for the monitoring of water-steam cycles as it can detect low level of contaminant on a continuous basis. This paper discusses the monitoring of acid conductivity at the inlet of the demineralization plant for assessing the output of the ion exchangers. An observation of data collected over a period of 14 months shows a strong correlation between output between regeneration (OBR) and acid conductivity. OBR is inversely proportional to acid conductivity with a correlation coefficient of -0.907. A drastic change in acid conductivity was observed when water level of the freshwater reservoir went below a depth of 3.8 m. The present study was undertaken with the intention to develop a simple and rugged method to measure the performance of ion exchangers in service and to find out the root cause of change in water quality after the freshwater reservoir level drops below a certain depth.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2017	59						123	126		10.5004/dwt.2016.0337								WOS:000403563700015

The study activity uses the data that carried out by Geological Agency, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Indonesia from March to April 2015. The methods used in this study are direct observation and hydrogeological measurement to measure physics and chemistry parameters. The results show that most places in the study area have the low quality of groundwater which is below the drinking water quality standards according to the government. However, at the unconfined aquifer (depth of 0-40 meters), the certain areas such as in the Kramat Jati, Halim Perdana Kusuma, Tongkol-Pademangan, and Duren sawit are still relatively safe for consumption as drinking water. In addition, the confined aquifer (depth> 40 meters) such as in the area of Cibubur, Pasar Rebo, and Jagakarsa are considered safe for consumption as drinking water. This study is expected to be used as a benchmark for researchers, especially academics in the region in order to maintain the sustainable groundwater resources in the area.																	1757-8981						2017	180								UNSP 012063	10.1088/1757-899X/180/1/012063								WOS:000403405700063

EVALUATION OF GRAPHICAL AND MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL METHODS FOR CLASSIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF GROUNDWATER IN ALATHUR BLOCK, PERAMBALUR DISTRICT, INDIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This paper assesses the quality of water using different graphical and statistical methods like Durov, Schoeller, Piper - Tri linear diagram, Box and Whisker plot for three seasons in the study area Alathur block, Perambalur District. The graphical representation provides limitations compared with the multivariate method for large data sets. A total of 10 groundwater samples were collected from hand dug wells in this area and they were analyzed for various physical and chemical parameters. The sequence of the dominance of the major ions are in the following order Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and Cl-> SO42-> HCO3- > NO3-. The dominating hydrochemicals of facies of groundwater are Ca-Cl and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl and alkaline earth metals (Ca2+, Mg2+) and strong acids (SO42-, Cl-) that dominate over alkalis (Na+, K+) and weak acids like HCO3-, CO3-. Based on the analytical result, groundwater in the study area is generally hard to very hard, slightly alkaline to brackish in nature. This indicates that leaching of salts, rock weathering and evaporation are among the most dominant processes in controlling water quality. For industrial purposes, the quality of water was assessed by using the Langeliner saturation index (LSI) and Ryznar saturation index (RSI). Seasonal variations in different parameters were also determined.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					105	116		10.15666/aeer/1503_105116								WOS:000403811200009

FORECASTING DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND IN A RIVER WITH NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL BOD-DO MODEL	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												As a main measure of water quality, the concentration of DO always gets much attention. The chemical reactions in water bodies are mainly related to DO, so the concentration of DO has much relationship with the water quality. Biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen (BOD-DO) model is used to show the relationship of the concentration of BOD or DO with the physical characteristic of the river. For this model, it is difficult to determine the analytical solution, so numerical solution of the model is obtained with Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial. With this method, the model is rewritten with differential form, and then the four order differential of the oxygen deficit was expressed with the Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial, which had coefficients. Lastly, a simulation test was conducted to verify the rationality of the model. The actual BOD and oxygen deficit values are calculated using the original model. With the actual values and formulas, the coefficients could be solved and the predicted values calculated. The forecasting values of concentration of BOD and DO are compared with the actual values. Five statistical measures were used to evaluate the predicted results.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					323	333		10.15666/aeer/1503_323333								WOS:000403811200023

DYNAMICS OF LAND COVER CHANGES AND DELINEATION OF GROUNDWATER RECHARGE POTENTIAL SITES IN THE AGUANAVAL AQUIFER, ZACATECAS, MEXICO	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Currently, human activities in ecosystems have led to adverse effects in aquifers, with the main consequences being the loss of vegetation and water availability. This paper presents a multi-criteria qualitative matrix which is developed to assign different values which estimate the potential of a specific land cover to be a groundwater recharge site. The matrix was coupled with a quantitative analysis of land cover changes in the Aguanaval aquifer, within the central zone of Zacatecas State, Mexico. Land cover changes were determined using four satellite images from 1986, 1992, 2002 and 2016. The results indicate that from 1986 to 2016 croplands and pasture increased by approximately 33,483 ha, but the most important change for croplands and pasture occurred between 2002 and 2016 with an increase of 31,607 ha; mixed forest land class occupied 16.49% in 1986, but an increase in the period from 1986 to 1992 reached 18.69% and decreased to 13.30% and 11.76% for 2002 and 2016, respectively. For the mixed rangeland covering 61.26% of the aquifer area, the major land cover in 1986 decreased substantially in 2016 reaching only 17.09% of total area. It was identified that the sites with a high recharge potential are located in the east and central-southeast and the medium recharge potential sites are located in the central part while the low potential sites are distributed to the north and southwest side of the aquifer.

In the present study, suitability of lands from the perspective of water resources is modeled regarding sheep as the grazing livestock. FAO (1991) method was used for the model. The study area is located at Savadkooh, Mazandaran province of Iran. The model comprised three submodels; water quality, water quantity and the distance of water resources to grazing area. According to the climatic conditions and number of permanent water resources, there was no shortage in water quantity. Results of water analysis also revealed no restricted elements for sheeps to drink the water. In the study area, in terms of water quality, the water resources were in S1 suitability class. However, steep slopes and stoniness were two barriers for water accessibility. As demonstrated by the model, 5552.32 ha (57.99%) of the study rangelands were in good class, 1523.85 ha (25.91%) in fair to moderate class while 5.76 ha (0.06%) were in poor suitability class. Non suitable rangelands were 2369.15 hectares which is equal to 20.4% of the surface area.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					1149	1156		10.15666/aeer/1503_11491156								WOS:000403811200083

SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND WATER QUALITY IN A CHINESE EUTROPHIC RIVER	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												To collect information about the community structure of zooplankton and to study how zooplankton respond to environmental conditions, zooplankton samples were collected from seven stations in a heavily polluted river (the Nanfei River, China). Samples were collected in March (spring) and June (summer) 2014, September (autumn) and December (winter) 2013. A total of 275 species of zooplankton belonging to 79 genera were identified, the total zooplankton abundance was 193 040 ind./L. Protozoa and rotifer comprised a high proportion of species number and abundance of zooplankton. The upper reaches had higher greater species number and lower abundance than those in middle and lower reaches, and at the entrance of Chaohu Lake. The species number and abundance of zooplankton were the highest in autumn, and the lowest in winter. The habitats of Nanfei River had high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, revealed by unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustering analyses on environmental factors and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) clustering analyses on zooplankton abundance. In addition, water quality of upper reaches was better than the middle and lower reaches, and the entrance; and better in autumn than in other three seasons in terms of species number, abundance, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index. Results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicate that the combination of water temperature, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, pH, chemical oxygen demanded, soluble phosphate, and conductance rate were responsible for the variations in zooplankton community structure. Results of the present study indicated that zooplankton communities of the Nanfei River had obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and the environmental factors played an important role in the changes in zooplankton community in Nanfei River.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					1417	1442		10.15666/aeer/1503_14171442								WOS:000403811200101

In this paper, we are proposing a novel and efficient technique for detecting a single fault and identifying the fault location within the biochip. Along with that it can also calculate the traversal time if the biochip is fault free. The traversal of the microarray is carried out by scanning the intermediate cells and the edges by special types of movement pattern RDRD (Right-Down-Right-Down) and DRDR (Down-Right- Down-Right) for left and right diagonal electrode traversal respectively and the boundary cells and edges are traversed in clockwise direction by moving the test droplets. If a fault is detected then the proposed technique also locates it by backtracking the droplet. The simulated result suggests that the proposed technique is efficient and represents significant improvement in fault detection and calculating traversal time of a fault free biochip over existing methods.

Using data from a household survey, we compare concerns about water shortage, climate change impacts on water supply, poor water quality, and flooding. We assess the combined influence of social and locational factors on each concern and variations across three valleys in northern Utah. Generalized linear mixed modeling is used, given the ordinal nature of most variables. Water shortage was the greatest concern, and female, older, nonwhite, and recreationally active respondents were generally more concerned about water issues than their counterparts. Education, income, and religious identity presented more complicated relationships with water concerns, with significant interaction effects with valley geography.

Development of a Plastic Optical Fiber Oxygen Optode with a Fluorescence Intensity Measurement System	SOUTHEASTCON 2017	IEEE SoutheastCon-Proceedings				IEEE SoutheastCon Conference	MAR 30-APR 02, 2017	Charlotte, NC	IEEE				Environmental measurements are nowadays gaining momentum due to availability of open software/hardware solutions, which made them affordable to industry, academia, and technology enthusiasts. Air and water quality conditions are some environment related measurements that have several applications in ecology, industry and aquaculture. Here, an optical fiber probe or "optode" for oxygen concentration measurement is presented. Due to its low cost and availability; plastic optical fibers with commercial Ru(II) oxygen patch were chosen to build a probe. Also, to extract information from the sensor a fluorescence intensity measurement system was employed due to its simplicity in implementation. To test this development, an experiment was made where 10 gaseous oxygen concentration levels were applied to obtain a calibration relation for the optode. It was demonstrated, due to the non-linearity of the sensor patch that a solubility model has good correlation to data instead of the usual linear relationship between intensity and oxygen concentration.																	1558-058X		978-1-5386-1539-3				2017																		WOS:000403420500038

So, there is a need for a better knowledge and understanding of the water quality determinants of groundwater abstraction to meet the municipal and agricultural uses. In this paper, the artificial neural network (ANN) models were used to model and predict the relationship between groundwater abstraction and water quality determinants in the lower Seybouse River basin. The study area chosen is the lower Seybouse River basin and real data were collected from forty five wells for reference year 2006. Results indicate that the feed-forward multilayer perceptron models with back-propagation are useful tools to define and prioritize the important water quality parameters of groundwater abstraction and use. The model evaluation shows that the correlation coefficients are more than 95% for training, verification and testing data. The model aims to link the water quantity and quality with the objective to strengthen the Integrated Water Resources Management approach. It assists water planners and managers to better assess the water quality parameters and progress towards the provision of appropriate quantities of water of suitable quality.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1482-2				2017	1814								UNSP 020013-1	10.1063/1.4976232								WOS:000403041200013

Juvenile Steelhead Locate Coldwater Refugia in an Intermittently Closed Estuary	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Many coastal estuaries in Mediterranean climates are susceptible to inlet closures resulting from barrier beach formation. These closures are ecologically important because they eliminate tidal exchange and connectivity of nekton movement to the coastal ocean and, depending on closure duration, can convert a dynamic estuary into a quiescent lagoon. Although closures can create lethal or stressful conditions for nekton and benthic communities, especially obligate diadromous species, under some conditions they can enhance survival of juvenile steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss. However, the mechanisms explaining how closed conditions enhance the growth of juvenile steelhead and how inhabitants avoid physiologically stressful conditions remain unknown. In the present study, recent technological advances in sensor-encoded acoustic telemetry provided the ability to simultaneously locate and determine the temperature of juvenile steelhead as small as 93 mm FL by using mobile and stationary tracking. In the Russian River estuary, an intermittently closed estuary in northern California, we used acoustic telemetry to infer water quality exposure by linking the temperature of individually tagged fish with water quality profiles collected in close proximity. Under open-inlet conditions, juvenile steelhead experienced primarily brackish and saline water in the lower and middle reaches and warm freshwater in the upper reach, whereas under closed-inlet conditions they experienced warm freshwater in the middle and upper reaches. During closed conditions, juvenile steelhead displayed behavior that suggested the ability to mediate stressful environmental conditions; specifically, they responded to closed conditions by moving greater distances and aggregating near thermal refugia. Our findings show the importance of recognizing these strategies when contemplating changes to estuary management and highlight the significance of tributary hydrogeomorphic processes and groundwater linkages in subwatersheds that are sources of cool water for thermal refugia in intermittently closed estuaries.																	0002-8487	1548-8659					2017	146	4					680	695		10.1080/00028487.2017.1301993								WOS:000403848200009

However, using SWRL, which has become the de facto standard rule language in Semantic Web, has never been used in stream data applications. Its open world assumption and monotonic nature makes SWRL powerless for doing continuous inference over stream data. For example, using aggregate functions on a particular window of streams cannot be expressed in SWRL. C-SPARQL is a framework which supports continuous querying over data streams. We introduce here C-SWRL, a unified Semantic Web stream reasoning system that further supports continuous reasoning over stream data. C-SWRL utilizes C-SPARQL filtering and aggregation of RDF streams to enable closed-world and time-aware reasoning with SWRL rules. Moreover, the non-monotonic behavior is supported with the use of OWLAPI constructs. The system is presented by means of examples in water quality monitoring.																	2325-6516		978-1-5090-4284-5				2017							395	400		10.1109/ICSC.2017.64								WOS:000403391300074						
B	Mohammed, H; Hameed, IA; Seidu, R			IEEE	Mohammed, Hadi; Hameed, Ibrahim A.; Seidu, Razak			Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System for Predicting Norovirus in Drinking Water Supply	2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATICS, HEALTH & TECHNOLOGY (ICIHT)					International Conference on Informatics, Health and Technology (ICIHT)	FEB 21-23, 2017	Riyadh, SAUDI ARABIA					Norovirus represent a leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in most developed countries. Modeling of general microbial occurrence in drinking water is a very active field of study and provides reliable information for predicting microbial risks in drinking water. In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed as a predicting model of the total number of Norovirus in raw surface water in terms of water quality parameters such as water pH, turbidity, conductivity, temperature and rain. ANFIS model combines in a transparent manner the linguistic representations of fuzzy logic and the learning capabilities of artificial neural networks. It also provides an automated rule generation and parameter optimization procedure that simplifies the complex process of model development and finally creates a transparent solution that is expected to offer useful insights into either the physical processes involved or the resultant modeling mechanisms. This study is based on the analysis of raw water samples from Nodre Romrike water treatment plant in Oslo, Norway. The ANFIS model has shown remarkable prediction ability of the number of Norovirus in drinking water with high accuracy. Significant relationship between Norovirus, turbidity, conductivity and temperature is obtained based on model results. The findings suggest that Norovirus outbreaks may be predicted based on certain environmental factors. The ability to predict the Norovirus in drinking water would make the prevention of potential outbreaks possible by applying the proper water treatment for better health risk management.																			978-1-4673-8765-1				2017																		WOS:000403395000015

In their original status, many of these ecosystems have native vegetation in their surrounding drainage basins, but in the last decades the native vegetation was replaced by agricultural, urban, and industrial zones, with as a result of these human alterations that those aquatic communities changed. The aim of the present study was to make a literature review about the ecological role of crustaceans in Chilean north Patagonian lakes and rivers. The literature mentioned the presence of amphipods (Hyalella), crayfishes (Samastacus spinifrons), and freshwater crabs (genus Aegla), and many of these species hold a conservation risk due to the consequences of habitat damage and/or their high endemism. These crustaceans are important for the degradation of particulate organic matter originating from the surrounding vegetation, and are prey for native and introduced salmonid fishes. Similar patterns had already been observed for Argentinean Patagonian rivers.

Integrated evaluation of urban groundwater hydrogeochemistry in context of fractal behaviour of groundwater level fluctuations	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												The present study was carried out as part of a complex survey of urban groundwater quality and quantity in Szeged, southeast Hungary. The concentrations of 12 inorganic contaminants in 28 shallow groundwater monitoring wells were determined over a 2-year period (2010-2012). The evaluation of concentrations indicates remarkable contamination all over the city. Discriminant analysis (DA) was used to evaluate the spatial changes of groundwater quality. The groundwater levels were measured over a 14-year period (2000-2013). The fractal properties of water level fluctuations time series characterizing the groundwater system and Tisza River were investigated using rescaled range (R/S) analysis. The resulting Hurst exponents clearly showed the persistency and thus long memory effects of both the groundwater and the river flow. Comparison of the results of DA with the results of R/S analysis thus implies that the geological conditions and the changing groundwater quantities are not related to groundwater quality.																	0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	8					1216	1229		10.1080/02626667.2017.1306861								WOS:000403800000003

Water samples were collected from precipitation, glacier melt, streams and karst springs for H-2 and tritium analysis during 2012 and 2013. High tritium values were observed in winter precipitation and low values in summer precipitation. The variation of tritium in karst springs was similar to that of the streams, whereas glacier melt showed lower tritium values. The MRT of cold karst springs was shorter than that of warm karst springs. The tracer breakthrough curves (TBC) retrieved for different springs suggested a short travel time for groundwater and possibly conduit flow. Deterioration of water quality and variation in flux magnitude are the two main practical consequences of the short travel time of karst groundwater in the region. <disp-quote>EDITOR D.

An evaluation of the hysteresis in chemical concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships from drained, intensively managed grasslands in southwest England	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												This study examined the hysteresis exhibited in concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships in the runoff from four hydrologically separated fields (catchments) at an intensively managed grassland. The objectives were to examine C-Q relationships constructed from high-resolution time series of flow, temperature, pH, conductivity, nitrate and turbidity, and their implications for hydrological processes. High-resolution datasets from the quality assured records of the Rothamsted Research North Wyke Farm Platform in the UK were examined using a graphical method and cross-correlation statistics. The study found that storm events based C-Q hysteresis reflects the cross-correlation that is generally hidden in time series analysis of large datasets, and that although Q and water quality variables can be effectively influenced by catchment size, the C-Q relationship is less significantly influenced. The dominant C-Q relationships of the water variables in the study area reflect that saturated overland flow was prevalent during the study period in the catchments, while the CCF results indicate coupled transfer of sediments and solute in the area at lag 0.<disp-quote>EDITOR D.

Hydrological modelling of the Vistula and Odra river basins using SWAT	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												This paper presents a large-scale application of the SWAT model for water balance and natural streamflow simulation in the entire basins of the Vistula and the Odra, covering most of the territory of Poland. A tailored calibration approach was designed to achieve satisfactory goodness-of-fit across a range of catchment sizes. Model calibration and evaluation driven by high-resolution climate data showed overall good behaviour for 80 benchmark catchments divided into eight clusters, and spatial evaluation for 30 gauges showed that the designed regionalization scheme performed well (median KGE of 0.76). Basin-averaged estimates of blue and green water flow and green water storage estimated using the calibrated model were 185, 517 and 206mm, respectively. This study provides a basis for future work, such as assessing climate change impacts on hydrology, assessing flow alterations, and water quality simulation.

Firstly, the water quality parameters collected by the sensor are processed by the signal conditioning circuit and then transmitted to the sensor nodes so as to realize the data acquisition of the water quality parameters. Afterwards, through the function analysis of each node in the ZigBee network, the hardware design and software program design of the network coordinator node and the routing node are completed. After joint debugging of the hardware and software, point-to-point communication and system networking of the ZigBee network are achieved. Finally, the results of experiments show that the system can realize the data acquisition and wireless transmission of the temperature and PH parameters of different solutions. Furthermore, each node realizes its own function and meets the design requirements of the system.																	1868-1646	1861-2121					2017	13	3					63	74		10.3991/ijoe.v13i03.6860								WOS:000403340300006

Results showed that dissolved metals in surface waters, which were analyzed by means of flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry, followed the concentration levels (Pb>Ni>Fe>Cu>Cr>Co>Mn>Cd>Zn) on the southern and (Ni>Pb>Fe>Cu>Cr>Zn>Mn>Co>Cd) on the northern coasts of Sfax, and (Ni>Fe>Pb>Cu>Cr>Zn>Co>Cd>Mn) in the Ghannouch area. In the southern and the northern coasts of Sfax, all analyzed metals were detected in 100% of sampled stations except Co, which was revealed in 90 and 80% of stations, respectively. However, in the Ghannouch area all analyzed metals were detected in 100% of sampled stations except Mn, which was revealed in 70% of stations. These trace elements, except for Fe and Mn, exceeded the safety limit of the USEPA water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic fauna and flora survival and their uses. The Sfax and Ghannouch coastal areas should be considered relatively polluted with metals (Zn, Ni, Pb, Co, Cr, Cd, and Cu). The elevated metal contents were attributed to anthropogenic waste inputs around the study area. The main sources of Ni and Co loading in the seawater were the SIAPE phosphoric acid and fertilizer plant and a waste water treatment plant located close to station 1. Whereas the fishing harbor of Sfax, which is situated on the southern coast (station 9), is the second source of high amounts of Cd, Mn, Cr, and Pb. This situation has led to serious human health risks and chronic toxicity caused by their potential bioaccumulation in some aquatic fauna such as shrimp, fish, crab, shellfish, mollusk, and cephalopoda.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	3					1057	1069		10.15244/pjoes/67529								WOS:000403567900011

The objective of this study was to analyze the occurrence of cyanotoxic risk in the catchment area of the Obrzyca River, which is a source of drinking water for the inhabitants of Zielona Gora. At the points of Uscie and at its tributary at Wojnowo, the river was more exposed to the blooms of toxigenic algae, whose active microcystins synthesize more here than in other places (Sadowo, Chwalim, Ostrzyce, Lubiatow). Throughout the study, conducted in 2008-12, we observed several times that the amounts of cyanobacteria exceeded 500.10(3) individuals per litre (ind. .dm(-3)). The observed cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by the following species: Dolichospermum flos-aquae and Planktothrix agardhii in the Obrzyca River at Uscie, and D. spiroides, D. affinis, and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae at its tributary in Wojnowo. The maximum value of intracellular MC-LR, totalling 21.4 mu g.dm(-3), was found at Wojnowo in September 2011. The analysis of the physico-chemical water quality indicators showed that the places along the Obrzyca River where periodic cyanobacterial blooms took place were characterized by eutrophic conditions, and the total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N/P) fell within the range of 10 to 16, and the water temperature exceeded 20 degrees C. In order to assess the toxic hazard caused by periodic cyanobacterial blooms in the catchment area of the Obrzyca River for drinking water for Zielona Gora residents, regular monitoring of the cyanobacteria and their toxins is required-especially at the points in Uscie and Wojnowo as well as at the water intake at the water treatment plant (WTP) in Zawada (in central-western Poland).

To solve such incompatibility and evaluate the health condition of a river ecosystem objectively we can use the river health integrated index (RHI), which was determined by the fuzzy matter-element extension assessment model (FMEAM). FMEAM was established by combining the fuzzy matter-element extension assessment method with the proposed aggregative index system. By employing the model above, as well as data from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, we evaluated the health state of the Luanhe River. The results showed that the Luanhe River was in a sub-healthy state in the 1980s and in an unhealthy state in the 1990s and 2000s. The reasons leading to the Luanhe River's health degradation have been analyzed. Among them, water conservation projects' building and operations are the major influence factors. Waste water emissions, the expansion of urban built-up areas, over exploitation of groundwater, and other unreasonable human activities also intensified the river ecosystem degradation. Finally, countermeasures for the ecological restoration and protection of the river were put forward.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	3					1353	1361		10.15244/pjoes/67369								WOS:000403567900042

However, very limited studies have been done to explore its potential in decreasing phytoplankton in subtropical shallow lakes. We hypothesize that macrophyte restoration can also decrease phytoplankton and shift community structures in subtropical shallow lakes. In order to test our hypothesis, we consistently investigated submerged macrophytes, nutrients, and phytoplankton for three years in a shallow subtropical lake. Multiple analytical methods were employed to assess the effect of macrophyte restoration on the phytoplankton community. The results showed that the density and biomass of total phytoplankton after restoration were less compared to those before the restoration. During the restoration, species diversity significantly increased every year, but the change in species richness was not significant. Moreover, phytoplankton community structure also transformed greatly. Especially cyanobacteria density gradually decreased until almost disappeared; Chlorophyta density also significantly decreased from 4.6 x 10(6) cell/L to 1.9 x 10(6) cell/L. Although changes in the densities of other groups were not significant, their ratios in total phytoplankton significantly increased. The changes in four dominant species were also significant during the restoration, with Microcystis aeruginosa, M. incerta, and Chlamydomonas sp. significantly decreasing, but Chlorella pyrenoidosa significantly increasing. Correlation analysis between phytoplankton and environmental factors (macrophyte and water quality) showed that macrophytes were negatively correlated with total phytoplankton, TN, and COD, but total phytoplankton was positively correlated with TN and COD. These relations indicated that macrophyte restoration might not only directly inhibit phytoplankton growth, but also indirectly decrease phytoplankton by both bottom-up and top-down controls of phytoplankton. Therefore, these results basically proved our hypothesis, and more attention should be focused on this method in future lake management.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	3					1363	1373		10.15244/pjoes/68228								WOS:000403567900043

For that purpose, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was developed able to forecast one month ahead the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) levels and by that way to act as a warning tool when a HAB event might follow. Sampling data from eleven monitoring stations were collected from Lake Pamvotis (Greece), a shallow hypereutrophic lake, affected by HABs. The created ANN managed with high accuracy to simulate the next month's Chl-a concentration, establishing it as a reliable predictor that represents well the non-linear relationships between the Chl-a and the environmental parameters. The significance of each environmental parameter associated with eutrophication was also examined. Focusing on the contribution of the environmental parameters three different methods that give the ANN model sensitivity are applied: (i) the 'Perturb' method; (ii) the 'Weights' method; (iii) the `PaD' ('Partial Derivatives') method. A combined parameter importance index was introduced, in order to overcome the computational differences resulted from the three methods. The combined interpretation of the results produced led to useful conclusions regarding the effect of each parameter on the eutrophication process.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	5					3200	3208										WOS:000403134800013

Anthropogenic activities greatly alter the water quality of the Danube, physico-chemicaly and biologically. Water quality monitoring is therefore a priority activity, in order to assess arising environmental risks and act accordingly. Floating catering facilities (i.e. raft restaurants) on the Danube in Serbia may compromise physical, chemical and biological conditions of the river water. Those use septic tanks, emptied directly into the river, without treatment of any kind. The composition of this waste corresponds to the category of municipal waste, and as such is rich in organic matter at various stages of decomposition, as well as foecal bacteria, many of which are opportunistic pathogens. In order to examine the impact of such facilities on river water, micro-hydrolo-cation of raft restaurant "Noah's Ark" in Novi Sad was used, as a representative of the type, with the permission of the Management Board. The water was sampled in the vicinity, upstream and downstream, during normal operation, and during the discharge of its septic tank. Physical, chemical and bacteriological water quality parameters were evaluated. The results of the study show the possibility of the occurrence of ecological shock moments, related to the discharge of wastewater into the Danube, which are detectable in a range of changes in the oxygen regime to restructuring entire bacteriobiocoenotic communities in the surrounding water.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	5					3358	3364										WOS:000403134800031						
J	Jiang, HM; Si, WT; Li, X				Jiang, Haiming; Si, Wantong; Li, Xia			A NOVEL BIOSENSOR BASED ON MICROBIAL ELECTROLYSIS CELL FOR RAPID ANALYSIS OF BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												BOD measurement is often required for evaluation of water quality. Most used 5-day BOD measurement method is time consuming and requires skills. Although MFC based biosensors can measure BOD rapidly, they suffer oxygen leakage problem, damping the wide spread application. In this study, a novel biosensor for rapid determination of BOD was developed based on microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) technique, and its performance was evaluated. The biosensor utilized maximum current and coulomb yield as indicators of BOD level. For the best performance, system parameters were optimized as external applied voltage to be 0.7-0.9 volts, artificial BOD to be 10 to 100 mg/L when maximum current was measured and 10 to 400 mg/L when coulomb yield was measured. At the optimal conditions, the sensor responded to BOD linearly and was able to complete each measure in 10 min and 80-400 min respectively using maximum current and coulomb yield as BOD indicator. The repeatability of the system was high as indicated by relative standard deviation less than +/- 13% for 6 measurements. For stability test, the system was stable over a period of 12 days as evaluated by relative standard deviation less than +/- 10.3%. These results demonstrated that MEC can be employed as a biosensor for on-line or off-line monitoring of BOD.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	5					3455	3464										WOS:000403134800044

In this paper, water chemistry and isotopes (H-2, O-18, H-3) were used to study hydrogeochemical evolution and fluoride accumulation. The results show that from river water to groundwater in the upper and lower part of the piedmont alluvial-proluvial plain, the main ions and fluoride shows systematic increase. The saturation index of fluorite seems to control the maximum fluoride content. Fluoride-minerals in the aquifers will continue to dissolve when fluorite is under saturated. Stable isotopes show that evaporation is not obvious during groundwater recharge and fluoride accumulation by evaporation concentration is limited. The high fluoride in groundwater is primarily caused by the protogenic geochemical processes in the basin.

Analysis of habitat characteristics of the scalloped spiny lobster Panulirus homarus (Linnaeus, 1758) in their home range along the southern coast of Sri Lanka	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												The present study was aimed to investigate the quality of home range habitat characteristics of the scalloped spiny lobster Panulirus homarus (Linnaeus, 1758) in southern coastal region of Sri Lanka. Four sites were selected from south-east (Patanagalle, Godawaya) and south-west (Weligama, Hikkaduwa) regions of the southern coast of Sri Lanka (SCSL). The bottom water quality data and benthic substrate types of their home range habitats were monitored and noted in a 25 x 25 m area covering 16 subsampling points with locality information. With the use of geographical information system (GIS) tools, the spatial distribution maps of environmental parameters were created and submerged bottom substrate types of the four sites were graphed. Salinity, temperature and dissolved oxygen correlated well with depth. Hikkaduwa site was found rich in corals with less number of scalloped spiny lobsters. Sites of south-east region of the SCSL (Patanagalle, Godawaya) were found less polluted having rocks and sandy bottom with high occurrence of scalloped spiny lobsters. Results of the study showed that Patanagalle site (south-east of SCSL) could be suggested as the most suitable site for culturing scalloped spiny lobsters.																	0970-6011						2017	64	1					1	8		10.21077/ijf.2017.64.1.47483-01								WOS:000403141200001

Digestibility and digestive enzyme activity in Labeo fimbriatus (Bloch, 1795) fed periphyton grown on sugarcane bagasse	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												An experiment of 60 days duration was carried out to compare dry matter and protein digestibility of periphyton grown on sugarcane bagasse bundles and a pelleted feed in Labeo fimbriatus (Bloch, 1795). Advanced fingerlings maintained in glass aquaria were allowed to feed on fresh periphyton or pelleted feed (20% crude protein) daily morning, the fecal matter collected following standard procedure and analysed for proximate composition. Acid insoluble ash was used as the reference marker for digestibility estimation. Activity of total protease, trypsin, chymotrypsin, carboxypeptidase -A and B, amylase, lipase and cellulase in the gut of fish was estimated at the end of the feeding trial. Periphyton and pelleted feed showed similar (p>0.05) protein digestibility (92.29 and 89.21% respectively), while total dry matter digestibility was higher (p<0.05) with peiphyton (85.44 and 75.16% respectively). Among the proteases estimated, activity of total protease and carboxypeptidase B was higher (p<0.05) in fish fed periphyton, whereas activity of others showed no difference between those receiving periphyton and pelleted feed (p>0.05). Activity of carbohydrases and lipase was higher in fish fed pelleted feed. Results of the study cleary indicated that L. fimbriatus can efficiently utilise periphyton.																	0970-6011						2017	64	1					37	43		10.21077/ijf.2017.64.1.47136-06								WOS:000403141200006

This paper presents a qualitative analysis approach to detect the water contamination events with unknown pollutants. Fluorescence spectra were used as water quality monitoring tools, and the detection method of unknown contaminants in water based on alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) is proposed to analyze the excitation and emission spectra of the samples. The Delaunay triangulation interpolation method was used to make the pretreatment of three-dimensional fluorescence spectra data, in order to estimate the effect of Rayleigh and Raman scattering; ATLD model was applied to establish the model of normal water sample, and the residual matrix was obtained by subtracting the measured matrix from the model matrix; the residual sum of squares obtained from the residual matrix and threshold was used to make qualitative discrimination of test samples and distinguish drinking water samples and organic pollutant samples. The results of the study indicate that ATLD modeling with three-dimensional fluorescence spectra can provide a tool for detecting unknown organic pollutants in water qualitatively. The method based on fluorescence spectra can be complementary to the method based on conventional index and UV-vision.																	2314-4920	2314-4939					2017									1485048	10.1155/2017/1485048								WOS:000403372700001

Recent advances derived largely from monitoring lakes treated with aluminum or lanthanum over an extended time have shed light on important factors in dose determination, binding efficiency, application processes, benefits of treatment, and duration of benefits. Advances are embodied in 10 articles in this issue of Lake and Reservoir Management that, along with important literature from the last 2 decades cited in those papers, documents improvement in our knowledge and application of P inactivation as a tool in lake management.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		103	107		10.1080/10402381.2017.1316064								WOS:000403102200001

Effectiveness of alum in a hypereutrophic lake with substantial external loading	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Brattebo SK, Welch EB, Gibbons HL, Burghdoff MK, Williams GN, Oden JL. 2017. Effectiveness of alum in a hypereutrophic lake with substantial external loading. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:108-118.Water quality conditions in hypereutrophic Lake Ketchum improved to mesotrophic conditions after alum treatments in 2014 and 2015. From 2013 pre-treatment conditions, summer mean epilimnetic total phosphorus (TP) declined from 289 to 34 mu g/L in 2014 and then to 15 mu g/L in 2015 (a total reduction of 95%). Hypolimnetic TP declined 99% overall, and chlorophyll a dropped 70% while there was 135% improvement in transparency over the 2years. Toxic cyanobacteria blooms, a chronic problem in the lake, disappeared in 2015. Maintenance treatment in 2016 continued water quality improvements. The primary driver of water quality changes was a decrease in internal P loading from a mean rate of 25mg/m(2) per day to zero (negative rate) after the alum treatments. The improvements occurred despite application problems with the 2014 treatment, which had to be halted with only 66% of the planned dose (aluminum: 28mg/L or 83.7g/m(2)) applied. The remaining 34% of the original alum dose plus an annual maintenance water column dose and an additional 15% was applied in March 2015. The water quality improvements were achieved even with continuation of a highly enriched (TP: >450 mu g/L) external input from a legacy agricultural source. The changes were consistent with or exceeded predictions of a 2-layer, seasonal mass balance TP model used to evaluate restoration alternatives. These results show that alum treatments can eliminate high internal loading and, when coupled with annual maintenance treatments, provide sustained water quality improvements despite continued external loading.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		108	118		10.1080/10402381.2017.1311390								WOS:000403102200002

Nine years of phosphorus management with lanthanum modified bentonite (Phoslock) in a eutrophic, shallow swimming lake in Germany. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:119-129.Eutrophication is threatening shallow lakes, their functioning and ecosystem services. In recent years, lanthanum modified bentonite (LMB) has been increasingly applied to eutrophic lakes to enforce recovery processes by increasing sediment phosphorus (P)-sorption capacity and reducing P in the water column. In this long-term study, we examined the water quality characteristics of a polymictic, eutrophic swimming lake in central Germany, Lake Barensee, an artificial, excavated lake suffering from frequent cyanobacterial blooms caused by nutrient enrichment, mostly from swimmers, runoff, and P release from the sediments. Barensee was first treated with LMB in 2007. This restoration method is based on the strong ionic bond formed between lanthanum (La) and phosphate (PO4), which results in the formation of rhabdophane (LaPO(4)nH(2)O) in the sediment. Smaller reapplications of LMB were conducted in 2010 and 2013 when P concentrations exceeded a defined level as a result of frequent nutrient inputs, primarily by swimmers. The intensity of mineralization processes decreased, preventing large algal and cyanobacterial blooms. Post-treatment chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, and ammonium concentrations indicate that the productivity of the lake has been limited by recurrent small treatments with LMB. Because of this P management, the lake could be used continuously for swimming and recreation.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		119	129		10.1080/10402381.2016.1263693								WOS:000403102200003						
J	Huser, BJ				Huser, Brian J.			Aluminum application to restore water quality in eutrophic lakes: maximizing binding efficiency between aluminum and phosphorus	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Huser BJ. 2017. Aluminum application to restore water quality in eutrophic lakes: maximizing binding efficiency between aluminum and phosphorus. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:143-151.Aluminum (Al), typically added to lakes to reduce internal cycling of legacy phosphorus (P) in sediment, was added to the littoral zone of Lake Harriet (Minnesota) to inhibit the uptake of sediment P by buoyancy regulating species of plankton. Analytical results from sediment collected over an 11-year period showed that the added Al (32 g/m(2)) started to move outside the treatment zone almost immediately after treatment, with <5% remaining within the treatment area after 6 months. Although the original treatment design failed, the application method was, unexpectedly, a success with respect to binding efficiency between Al and P in the sediment. As the Al drifted to deeper areas of the lake, internal P release in non-treated, deeper areas of the lake declined and the binding ratio between Al and Al-bound P decreased, reaching 2.1 (molar) in profundal sediments 10years after treatment. The increased contact with available (mobile) sediment P increased binding efficiency, resulting in a 163-581% increase of P bound per unit Al compared to previous whole-lake aluminum treatments. The binding efficiency exceeded expectations showing that, in addition to the amount of Al added, treatment location and subsequent translocation of the Al floc can substantially affect binding efficiency and treatment effectiveness.

A newly developed injection method for aluminum treatment in eutrophic lakes: Effects on water quality and phosphorus binding efficiency	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Schutz J, Rydin E, Huser BJ. 2017. A newly developed injection method for aluminum treatment in eutrophic lakes: Effects on water quality and phosphorus binding efficiency. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:152-162.Application of aluminum (Al) salts has been used to reduce phosphorus (P) concentrations in lakes since the 1960s. Al is typically applied to the water column where Al-hydroxides form, settle to the sediment surface, and bind P in sediment. Al can be transported to other, non-target areas of the lake, however, potentially limiting treatment effectiveness. To alleviate this problem, a new method has been developed in which the Al salt is injected directly into the sediment as a liquid. In this study, the binding efficiency and application costs were calculated for 2 lakes in Sweden that received injection applications of polyaluminum chloride (PAC). Binding efficiency was similar to previous water column applications, implying there is little difference between the 2 application methods. Other factors, however, such as dissolved organic matter and type of Al salt used (PAC vs. Al sulfate), can also affect binding efficiency. Thus, Al injection may have improved the amount of P bound per unit Al in the study lakes given the in-lake conditions and Al salt used. Treatment cost (cost per kilogram of P bound to Al) for the injection method compared to previous water column treatments was somewhat higher due to increased costs for buffered PAC and time needed for application. Both mobile sediment P and internal loading remained reduced compared to pre-treatment conditions, showing that the Al injection treatments continued to control sediment P release. More study is needed, however, to determine the relative effectiveness of this method in different types of lakes.

J	Nurnberg, GK				Nurnberg, Gertrud K.			Attempted management of cyanobacteria by Phoslock (lanthanum-modified clay) in Canadian lakes: water quality results and predictions	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Nurnberg GK. 2017. Attempted management of cyanobacteria by Phoslock (lanthanum-modified clay) in Canadian lakes: water quality results and predictions. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:163-170.When internal phosphorus (P) loading from the bottom sediments outweighs external P inputs to lakes, lake water quality and cyanobacteria blooms will not respond to external measures alone and therefore require an in-lake restoration treatment. Lake characteristics and governmental regulations do not permit a random choice of such methods. A treatment developed by an Australian research institute (CSIRO) more than 15years ago has recently been introduced to Canada and is licensed in Ontario. The lake water treatment consists of the application of a phosphate adsorbing and sediment capping agent called Phoslock in North America, a clay (bentonite) that has been systematically amended by the phosphate adsorbing element lanthanum. When applied, Phoslock sinks to the lake bottom where it intercepts the upward flux of internal load from sediment P release. Although the number of monitored Canadian applications is still small, suggestions to optimize restoration effects can be made, including the avoidance of high flushing during application, system isolation, and timing to coincide with high levels of inorganic P in the lake water. Initial results in at least 2 cases (Swan Lake, City of Markham, Greater Toronto Area; and Henderson Lake, Lethbridge, Alberta) were promising despite the unexpected external P input from waterfowl and possibly other external sources. Other applications are planned in a Quebec lake and are being discussed in several other provinces.

Aluminum treatments to control internal phosphorus loading in lakes on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Lake Reserv Manage. 33:171-186.Ten lakes on Cape Cod, Massachusetts have been treated with aluminum since 1995, with 2 of those lakes receiving a second treatment. Elimination of cyanobacterial blooms was the goal in each case. Cape Cod lakes are mostly kettleholes with long detention times. Precipitation and groundwater dominated hydrologic inputs, but internal load contributed a major portion of the total phosphorus (TP) load to treated lakes. Aluminum sulfate and sodium aluminate were used in treatments with the intent to maintain a near-neutral pH in low alkalinity waters. Aluminum doses ranged from 10 to 100 g/m(2), depending on mobile P concentrations in the upper 10cm of sediment. Results varied, although all treatments lowered TP, provided relief from blooms, increased water clarity, and reduced oxygen demand for multiple years. Important lessons learned over 2 decades include how to apply aluminum to prevent fish mortality, options for dose calculation, and expectations for duration of benefits. To control internal loading and minimize cyanobacterial blooms at the lowest cost, treatment of Cape Cod lakes should apply aluminum at a concentration at least 10times the mobile P concentration in the upper 10cm of sediment exposed to anoxia and at concentrations that leave no more than 100 mg/kg of iron-bound P in laboratory inactivation assays. Cost of treatment in 2016 dollars averaged $150/g/m(2) of applied aluminum per ha treated. Aluminum treatment has been demonstrated as a valued lake management tool to improve water quality and reduce nuisance algal blooms in Cape Cod lakes.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		171	186		10.1080/10402381.2017.1308449								WOS:000403102200008

Distribution of aluminum and phosphorus fractions following alum treatments in a large shallow lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Welch EB, Gibbons HL, Brattebo SK, Corson-Rikert HA. 2017. Distribution of aluminum and phosphorus fractions following alum treatments in a large shallow lake. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:198-204.Alum was added to the middle 40% of 5200ha Grand Lake St. Marys (mean depth 1.6m) in western Ohio during 2 successive years. About <8% to 2% of the added aluminum (Al) remained in the water column immediately after treatment, and aluminum-phosphorus (Al-P) was effectively formed in the targeted treated sediment. Sediment Al and Al-P were significantly higher inside than outside the treated area with an Al-added to Al-P-formed ratio of 51, double the initial effectiveness expected (102) from the 2year Al dose of 95g/m(2). Sediment total P was also higher inside than outside the treatment area. The source of P that formed Al-P was more likely undetermined soluble reactive P diffused from deeper sediment and to a lesser extent external P loading. Mobile iron-P (Fe-P), usually the principal mobile fraction, was relatively low with no noticeable depletion (inside-outside), and loosely sorbed P was undetectable. Biogenic P (living algae and detritus) was also relatively low and showed no noticeable depletion. Some of the greater variability in sediment Al outside than inside the treated area may have been caused by resuspension and redistribution of the alum floc. Two of the 3 outside sites on the lee side of the treated area had higher sediment Al, whereas 2 of 3 outside sites on the windward side had lower Al. Nevertheless, the alum floc remained largely in the treated area for at least 3months to >1year, forming sediment Al-P.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	2			SI		198	204		10.1080/10402381.2016.1276653								WOS:000403102200010

Acute toxicity of copper, lead, zinc and their mixtures on the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Coastal pollution is complex, often consisting of multiple contaminants, and it is increasingly recognised that exposure to combinations of pollutants can produce different outcomes than each does separately. This study investigates the toxicity of three major pollutants in coastal environments (copper, lead and zinc) individually and in binary mixtures on larvae of Evechinus chloroticus, a sea urchin endemic to New Zealand. Larval development assays were conducted for 72 h. Median effective concentrations (EC50) for normal larval development for individual metals were 5.4 mu g/L Cu, 52.2 mu g/L Pb and 27.7 mu g/L Zn. Evechinus chloroticus was more sensitive to copper and zinc than most echinoid species tested to date. Effects of metal mixtures were analysed using a toxic unit (TU) approach. Cu + Zn and Cu + Pb had a less-than-additive effect on E. chloroticus larval development. By contrast, Zn + Pb was strictly additive. None of the interactions were strong, with sums of TU ranging from 1.00 to 1.85. These results support the use of criteria based on strictly-additive models to determine whether these three metals exceed water quality thresholds when occurring in a simple mixture.

Macrophyte species composition and structure along littoral region in relation to limnological variables of a tropical wetland ecosystem	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												The composition and structure of macrophyte communities of the littoral region of Bhinda was wetland (India) was investigated. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) if limnological variables such as water chemistry and soil parameters are important determinants of species composition and abundance and (2) what is the variance in species richness and composition within the wetland. Twenty-eight macrophyte species belonging to 17 different families were identified with relatively low species diversity and richness (H' = 2.09; Margalef index = 1.12). Eichhornia crassipes, attained the highest relative frequency (22.69%), followed by Salvinia natans, Paspalum paspaloides, Phragmites karka, Cynodon dactylon and Cyperus alopecuroides. The first and second axis of CCA ordination explained 38.4% and 28.5% of the total variance of species-limnological variables relationship, respectively. Water-related variables (dissolved oxygen, pH and nitrate concentration) and soil nutrient factors (soil carbon and phosphorus levels) were significantly correlated to macrophyte distribution. Sampling sites formed two distinct groups based on cluster analysis, indicating varying ecological conditions. Generally, composition and abundance of macrophytes evince highly productive nature of the lake, while dominance of invasive species like E. crassipes and S. natans indicates high influence of increased nutrient levels and anthropogenic activities in the catchment on lake macrophyte composition.

The results showed that Cu was more severely toxic to Chinese sturgeon than Zn. The Cu LC50 after 24-, 48-, 72- and 96-h exposures to Chinese sturgeon were 0.0606, 0.0414, 0.0289 and 0.0217 mg.L-1, respectively, whereas these values were 3.590, 2.514, 1.759 and 1.200 mg.L-1 for Zn, respectively. Estimated safe concentrations of Cu and Zn were 0.00217 and 0.1200 mg.L-1, respectively. However, the Cu and Zn standards for fisheries water quality in China are 0.01 and 0.10 mg.L-1, respectively. The liver was the major accumulation site for Cu. Cu content in the liver of juveniles in the control group (no Cu) was the highest, followed by the gills, whereas the lowest content was detected in cartilage. The fastest accumulator of Cu was the liver, followed by the stomach, and cartilage and skin had the lowest contents. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in the liver tissues of juveniles were relatively low for the first 24 h, but the activities recovered gradually from 24 to 48 h and decreased after 48 h to levels lower than the control group. These changes in SOD and CAT activities indicate that juvenile Chinese sturgeon were severely affected by Cu. These data show that Chinese sturgeon juveniles face the threat of Cu contamination and this alerts officials to the dangerous situation.

Fish Passage Through Three Types of Structures in Diked Coastal Lake Erie Wetlands	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Over 40% of Great Lakes fishes are wetland dependent, and more than 70% benefit from wetlands periodically. As such, restoration and rehabilitation of Great Lakes coastal wetlands have increased dramatically. This necessitates a balance among varied management objectives, including fish passage. The presence of water control structures commonly found on diked wetlands can limit fish passage if not open all the time. We sampled three diked Lake Erie coastal wetlands to assess how different structures affected fish passage. Water control structures included a pool-and-weir fish ladder, swing gates, and an open culvert. Fyke nets were set five to seven times at each site between April and October 2015. One net was set outside of the wetland, a short distance away from the passage structure, and the other was set inside the wetland, with the net wings enclosing the opening of the structure. Catches were compared for catch rate, three measures of community similarity, and the wetland fish index (WFI). Fish communities on either side of the fish ladder site had low community similarities that were lower than those of the culvert site and similar to those of the swing gate site, suggesting that the fish ladder did not provide fish passage as hoped. Of the three wetlands, catches from inside the wetland with the culvert had a WFI that was most similar to those of wetlands connected to Lake Erie hydrology. Overall, the culvert provided the most opportunity for fish movement into the wetland. However, unlike the other structures, it did not provide a means for precisely managing wetland water levels.

Impacts of Water and Severage Legislation in Preparation on Incomes of the Poorest Households in the South Bohemian Region	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CURRENT TRENDS IN PUBLIC SECTOR RESEARCH	Current Trends in Public Sector Research				21st International Conference ON Current Trends in Public Sector Research	JAN 19-20, 2017	Slapanice, CZECH REPUBLIC	Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Publ Econ				Growing demand for water quality improvement has led to stricter legislation at the European Union level. The Czech legislation is beginning to significantly reflect the effort to meet the commitments. Environmental impacts along with guarantee of sustainability and reliability of drinking water supplies are the key point of regulation in the water and sewerage sector. The amendment to the Waters Act in preparation, along with other amendments, will lead to increased prices of water and sewerage charges, thereby being reflected in household expenditures. The effect of the changes in preparation is examined in the article among the lowest-income households in the South Bohemian Region. Based on micro models, it turns out that the lowest decile of households in the South Bohemian Region would expend an additional 0.5-1% of its incomes on water after all the changes are adopted. The impacts on different cities in this region differ the most due to existing infrastructure and wastewater treatment technologies. The presented results thus bring a more accurate estimate of the impacts than those presented by the study of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, based on average data for the entire country. They clearly indicate the necessity to analyse socially sensitive issues at the local level with respect to considerable regional differences across the Czech Republic, which may cause significant distortions.

Thus, given the importance of this research to study the spatial and temporal changes in parameters of calcium, magnesium, pH, chloride, sodium sulfate and water in Jiroft discussed. The data from 40 wells in the region of Kerman province in 2002 - 2012 water harvesting and qualitative analysis had been done on it was used. In this regard, after normalizing the data to evaluate the accuracy of different geostatistical methods including the kriging and inverse distance weighted, and then map the spatial zoning in the software quality parameters ArcGIS9.3 was prepared using the best method of interpolation. The results showed that the amount of calcium, pH and chlorine in the water and magnesium, and sodium sulfate also has declined. But the quality of groundwater resources Jiroft in general in 2012 compared to 2002, decreased and the process of change if they do go to the South and West Water quality is reduced.																	2239-5938	2239-6101					2017	6	2					200	208		10.14207/ejsd.2017.v6n2p201								WOS:000402441600017

Comparison of the effectiveness of kick and sweep hand net and Surber net sampling techniques used for collecting aquatic macroinvertebrate samples	ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												The objective of this work is to analyze the effectiveness of two widely used methods for collecting aquatic macroinvertebrate samples: the semiquantitative kick and sweep (K&S) and quantitative Surber net (SN) techniques. Based on our data, the methods were fully comparable as regards analysis of the macroinvertebrate metrics most often used in ecological status assessment (sensitivity/tolerance parameters), while K&S was found to be more successful in the evaluation of biodiversity. Thus, both methods could be used for routine monitoring of the status of water bodies, according to the recommendation of the EU Water Framework Directive, while for research, K&S is more advanced. K&S is also more effective timewise for material collecting. SN sampling is a quantitative method and could thus be used in studies of aquatic ecosystem productivity.

This paper presents a new analysis-system with semantic computing for environments in water-quality areas by integrating the fundamental important parameters of water-quality for creating the new meaning to society. The multi-water-parameter-analysis in a multi-dimensional space is important for current research issues in some water-quality research fields, which are based on the values and meanings of each parameter for obtaining the meaningful words in the category of agriculture, aquatic life, fish, drinking, industrial and irrigation. The multi-dimensional semantic space is significantly utilized for various interpretations related to the water-quality.																	0922-6389		978-1-61499-720-7; 978-1-61499-719-1				2017	292						43	62		10.3233/978-1-61499-720-7-43								WOS:000402391600005

Observer-based state tracking control of uncertain stochastic systems via repetitive controller	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE												This paper develops the repetitive control scheme for state tracking control of uncertain stochastic time-varying delay systems via equivalent-input-disturbance approach. The main purpose of this work is to design a repetitive controller to guarantee the tracking performance under the effects of unknown disturbances with bounded frequency and parameter variations. Specifically, a new set of linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based conditions is derived based on the suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional theory for designing a repetitive controller which guarantees stability and desired tracking performance. More precisely, an equivalent-input-disturbance estimator is incorporated into the control design to reduce the effect of the external disturbances. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the desired control system stability and their tracking performance. A practical stream water quality preserving system is also provided to show the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed approach.																	0020-7721	1464-5319					2017	48	11					2272	2281		10.1080/00207721.2017.1316881								WOS:000402642400004						
J	Boys, CA; Pease, B				Boys, Craig A.; Pease, Bruce			Opening the floodgates to the recovery of nektonic assemblages in a temperate coastal wetland	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Tidally active wetlands are important nurseries for fish and crustaceans; however, urban development involving structural flood mitigation has fragmented and destroyed much of this habitat, often leading to losses in fisheries productivity. The present study demonstrated that some of these impacts may be reversible if rehabilitation projects are implemented over a sufficiently long time. The incremental opening of eight floodgates at a temperate coastal wetland in Australia afforded the opportunity to monitor water quality and nekton assemblages in a tidal creek over 11 years, encompassing pre-floodgate opening, opening of one gate, three gates and finally all eight gates. Floodgate opening enhanced both water quality and nektonic assemblages relative to a control creek whose barrier remained in place. A doubling in species richness occurred and many commercially important species increased in abundance, including Metapenaeus macleayi (15 times more), Acanthopagrus australis (62 times more), Liza argentea (10 times more) and Gerres subfasciatus (19 times more). Recovery to a condition similar to unrestricted reference creeks was achieved once all eight gates were opened. The study illustrated that reinstating tidal flushing can recover nursery habitats and enhance populations of economically valuable species.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	6					1023	1035		10.1071/MF15445								WOS:000402414700003

Periphytic diatom communities in tributaries around Lake Ichkeul, northern Tunisia: a preliminary assessment	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												An initial inventory of diatom biodiversity at 12 sites draining into Lake Ichkeul, northern Tunisia, was performed in summer 2014, together with the characterisation of metal pollution status by analysing trace metal concentrations to determine Water Quality Indices. The maximum values of Fe, Mn, Sb, Zn, Cu and Pb were all below the national and international standard, except for Fe in Hammam Ben Abbes thermal spring and Sb in Wadi Tinja, indicating that the surface water of the Ichkeul basin was largely acceptable. Diatom community composition and specific descriptors, including quantification of morphological alterations and mortality, were used to diagnose environmental stress. High abundances of Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kutzing) Czarnecki were observed at the Fe-rich site, which could reflect a response to metal contamination. Diatoms were stressed mostly by the influence of temperature and salinity, which drove species composition and increased mortality. Further research is required on the ecology of diatoms in Ichkeul thermal springs. The use of diatoms as indicators of ecosystem health in the Ichkeul area requires additional knowledge of diatom diversity in the ecoregion.

Effect of land use on water quality and phytoplankton community in the tropical Khami River in semi-arid southwest Zimbabwe	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The water quality and phytoplankton community assemblage of the Khami River, a tropical river sub catchment in semi-arid southwest Zimbabwe impacted by agriculture and urban land use, were examined in March 2015. Conductivity, sulphates, total dissolved solids and salinity were higher at urban sampling points than at agricultural sampling points. In contrast, agricultural sampling points were more turbid, and had a greater content of nitrates than urban sampling points. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Cyanobacteria, mainly Microcystis aeruginosa, with densities of up to 20 times higher at urban than at agricultural sampling points. There was an increasing dominance of Cyanobacteria (M. aerugionosa and Merismopedia glauca) and Chlorophyta (Eudorina elegans, Spirogyra sp. and Pediastrum duplex) and a decreasing importance of Bacillariophyta along the agriculture-to-urban gradient. Given the increasing scarcity of water in southern Africa, not only do our findings confirm the importance of land use types as drivers of water quality and phytoplankton community composition and structure. However, they also show that Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta can be indicators of changes in water quality, factors that will prove pertinent to management for effective water quality management using phytoplankton composition as bioindicators.

For this purpose, macrozoobenthic invertebrates and water samples were taken from each of the selected seven stations seasonally. The Belgian Biotic Index, BMWP and ASPT indices, and species diversity indices were applied for determining the water quality by using the ASTERICS software program. With the identification of the collected organisms, a total of 126 taxa including 4 taxa from Gastropoda, 5 taxa from Oligochaeta, 1 taxon from Malacostraca, 84 taxa from Insecta, and 32 taxa from Arachnida were detected. Stations were clustered by using UPGMA, based on organisms. Station 7 in the estuarine zone was the most different one for the macrozoobenthic invertebrates. The lowest species diversity values were also found at this station. The water quality of Kargi Stream was unpolluted/slightly polluted. Considering the physical and chemical parameters, biotic indices revealed changes in the pollution load of the study area with some deviations. It is thought that the reason for these deviations was not taking into account the geomorphological and ecological characteristics of Turkey in the biotic indices used in the current study.																	1300-0179	1303-6114					2017	41	3					476	486		10.3906/zoo-1602-10								WOS:000402034800011

Water quality, plankton, and biofloc formation were monitored every five days. Results showed that biofloc formation was enhanced by adding glucose to the pond water. The addition of glucose together with Bacillus subtilis shortened the formation time of mature bioflocs by about five days than the supplementation with glucose only. In ponds supplemented with glucose and those supplemented with glucose + bacillus, the ammonia nitrogen, and nitrite nitrogen content in the water column decreased, and the number of cyanobacteria and green algae were significantly inhibited, while the number of zooplankton such as Rotatoria increased during the experimental period.																	0792-156X						2017	69								1386									WOS:000402278900001

Can Sanitary Inspection Surveys Predict Risk of Microbiological Contamination of Groundwater Sources? Evidence from Shallow Tubewells in Rural Bangladesh	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												Accurately assessing the microbiological safety of water sources is essential to reduce waterborne fecal exposures and track progress toward global targets of safe water access. Sanitary inspections are a recommended tool to assess water safety. We collected 1,684 water samples from 902 shallow tubewells in rural Bangladesh and conducted sanitary surveys to assess whether sanitary risk scores could predict water quality, as measured by Escherichia coli. We detected E. coli in 41% of tubewells, mostly at low concentrations. Based on sanitary scores, 31% of wells were low risk, 45% medium risk, and 25% high or very high risk. Older wells had higher risk scores. Escherichia coli levels were higher in wells where the platform was cracked or broken (Delta log(10) = 0.09, 0.00-0.18) or undercut by erosion (Delta log(10) = 0.13, 0.01-0.24). However, the positive predictive value of these risk factors for E. coli presence was low (< 50%). Latrine presence within 10 m was not associated with water quality during the wet season but was associated with less frequent E. coli detection during the dry season (relative risk = 0.72, 0.59-0.88). Sanitary scores were not associated with E. coli presence or concentration. These findings indicate that observed characteristics of a tubewell, as measured by sanitary inspections in their current form, do not sufficiently characterize microbiological water quality, as measured by E. coli. Assessments of local groundwater and geological conditions and improved water quality indicators may reveal more clear relationships. Our findings also suggest that the dominant contamination route for shallow groundwater sources is short-circuiting at the wellhead rather than subsurface transport.

Evaluation of Bamboo, Coconut Shell Substrates and Supplemental Feeding on the Growth of Pearlspot, Etroplus suratensis (Bloch) Fry in Low Volume Cages	FISHERY TECHNOLOGY												The 90 days experiment aimed at understanding the scope of utilising periphyton substrates for cage culture of pearlspot fry. The experiment evaluated coconut shells relative to bamboo as periphyton substrates for pearlspot culture. The experiment constituted six floating cages (1x0.75x1 m(3)) each partitioned into two to get 12 experimental units into which 360 pearlspot fry (avg. wt. 3.55 +/- 0.17 g) were equally distributed. The experiment constituted of four treatment; T-B : substrate (bamboo-strip mats), T-C : substrate (coconut shells), TB+F : substrate (bamboo-strip mats) + supplementary feed, T-F : supplementary feed, in triplicates. The substrates provided a surface area of similar to 1.9m(2) unit(-1). Feeding in TB+F and T-F was done using commercial carp feed (crude protein-32%; crude lipid-5%) twice daily approximately at 10% of the body weight initially upto 30 days and subsequently the feeding rate was reduced to 9 and 8% of body weight after 30 and 60 days respectively. Sampling was conducted every 15 days to assess fish growth and survival. Relatively higher specific growth rate (SGR) recorded in TB+F over T-F during the initial phase of the experiment indicated the ability of pearlspot to utilise periphyton efficiently in the early stages. Final SGR of 1.2 and 1.5% day(-1) in T-C and T-B respectively indicates that periphyton can support the growth of pearlspot. Higher SGR and percentage weight gain in T-B (1.50 +/- 0.07% day(-1); 288.10 +/- 26.69%) relative to T-C 1.26 +/- 0.12% day(-1); 215.90 +/- 36.37%) shows that bamboo is superior periphyton substrate for pearlspot culture. Lower yet statistically similar growth rates of pearlspot in T-C relative to T-B together with low cost and easy availability of coconut shell substrates indicates that these could be used as alternative periphyton substrates for fish culture.																	0015-3001						2017	54	1					1	7										WOS:000401854200001

Identification of ditches and furrows using remote sensing: application to sediment modelling in the Tana watershed, Kenya	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Ridge-tillage is an agricultural practice where crops are planted on elevated ridges, with furrows in-between. Ridge-tillage has been shown to significantly reduce erosion from croplands, but data on the presence of ridge-tillage is sparse and challenging to collect at the landscape scale. Thus, water quality models often do not account for ridge-tillage in a spatially-explicit manner, potentially overlooking the important impacts of this practice. We have developed a novel method that exploits the spectral, radiometric and linearity shape characteristics to identify both drainage ditches and ridge-tillage furrows using remote sensing of 0.5 m satellite data. We applied the method to the Sasumua watershed in Kenya, where we had false positives in only 3% of randomly selected polygons, and we detected the majority of ditches in 59% of randomly selected polygons. We then assessed the potential value of including these data in sediment modelling, showing that representing these practices could reduce sediment export in the study area by roughly 80%. Being able to readily identify the presence of ditches and furrows could enable the development of more accurate water quality models, and help identify priority areas for intervention to improve water quality (and possibly crop yields) through changing agricultural practices or policies.

Verification of a numerical growth model of Pistia stratiotes L. using field data from tropical and subtropical sites	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The growth model of Pistia stratiotes L.

The Pistia-model simulates the growth dynamics and biomass production of well-established, monospecific stands of P. stratiotes based on fixed carbon gain and loss using first-order differential equations. General trends for shoots biomass, such as the slow initial growth rate followed by a high growth rate, the peak biomass, and the decline of biomass due to senescence, were successfully reproduced by the Pistia-model. Many characteristics typical for the roots biomass, such as the increase in the roots biomass during the early growing season because of the translocation of materials from shoots, and the reduction of roots biomass during the later period of the season, were also reproduced. The level of agreement between the simulated values and actual field data indicated that the Pistia-model can simulate the biomass of P. stratiotes over a wide range of latitudes.

Identifying and quantifying environmental thresholds for ecological shifts in a large semi-regulated river	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Ecological shifts, between a clear macrophyte-dominated state and a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton and high inorganic suspended solids, have been well described in shallow lake ecosystems. While few documented examples exist in rivers, models predict regime shifts, especially in regulated rivers with high water retention time. Here I quantified ecological shifts in a large, semi-regulated floodplain river during a transition from a turbid-to a clear-water state using water quality, aquatic vegetation and fisheries data from a rigorous, standardized long-term data set. My findings indicate that significant changes occurred in total suspended solids concentration, aquatic macrophyte abundance, native and non-native fish biomass, fish functional feeding guild patterns, fish habitat guild assemblages and fish spawning guild assemblage patterns over a nearly 20-year period in Navigation Pool 8 of the Upper Mississippi River. Transitions in physical and biological indicators were examined to identify mechanisms underlying the ecological shifts. Environmental variables driving fish assemblage changes were identified (total suspended solids and aquatic vegetation) and management-relevant thresholds are presented. Awareness of management thresholds is critical for resource managers to implement measures to prevent the river from moving to a degraded state characterized by high non-native fish abundance and low predatory fish species abundance.																	0270-5060	2156-6941					2017	32	1					433	453		10.1080/02705060.2017.1319431								WOS:000401719600004

Representative sampling indicated that municipal water supplies represent < 1% of the water sources. Residents rely on privately constructed and maintained boreholes that are supplemented by commercially packaged bottled and sachet drinking water. Contamination by thermotolerant coliforms increased from 21% of drinking water sources in the dry season to 42% of drinking water sources in the rainy season (N = 356 and N = 397). The most significant increase was in sachet water, which showed the lowest frequencies of contamination in the dry season compared with other sources (15%, N = 186) but the highest frequencies during the rainy season (59%, N = 76). Only half as many respondents reported drinking sachet water in the rainy season as in the dry season. Respondents primarily used flush or pour-flush toilets connected to septic tanks (85%, N = 399). The remainder relied on pit latrines and hanging (pier) latrines that drained into surface waters. We found significant associations between fecal contamination in boreholes and the nearby presence of hanging latrines. Sanitary surveys of boreholes showed that more than half were well-constructed, and we did not identify associations between structural or site deficiencies and microbial water quality. The deterioration of drinking water quality during the rainy season is a serious public health risk for both untreated groundwater and commercially packaged water, highlighting a need to address gaps in monitoring and quality control.																		1476-1645					2017	96	2					437	445		10.4269/ajtmh.16-0175								WOS:000401767400032	27821689

Household Microbial Water Quality Testing in a Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey: Evaluation of the Compartment Bag Test for Escherichia coli	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												The Joint Monitoring Program relies on household surveys to classify access to improved water sources instead of measuring microbiological quality. The aim of this research was to pilot a novel test for Escherichia coli quantification of household drinking water in the 2011 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Peru. In the Compartment Bag Test (CBT), a 100-mL water sample is supplemented with chromogenic medium to support the growth of E. coli, poured into a bag with compartments, and incubated. A color change indicates E. coli growth, and the concentration of E. coli/100 mL is estimated as a most probable number. Triplicate water samples from 704 households were collected; one sample was analyzed in the field using the CBT, another replicate sample using the CBT was analyzed by reference laboratories, and one sample using membrane filtration (MF) was analyzed by reference laboratories. There were no statistically significant differences in E. coli concentrations between the field and laboratory CBT results, or when compared with MF results. These results suggest that the CBT for E. coli is an effective method to quantify fecal bacteria in household drinking water. The CBT can be incorporated into DHS and other national household surveys as a direct measure of drinking water safety based on microbial quality to better document access to safe drinking water.																		1476-1645					2017	96	4					970	975		10.4269/ajtmh.15-0717								WOS:000401763000036	28500818

We conducted sanitary inspections and tested for thermotolerant coliforms (TTCs), a fecal indicator bacteria, among 7,317 unique water sources in West Bengal, India. Our results indicate that the sanitary inspection score has poor ability to identify TTC-contaminated sources. Among deep and shallow hand pumps, the area under curve (AUC) for prediction of TTC > 0 was 0.58 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53-0.61) and 0.58 (95% CI = 0.54-0.62), respectively, indicating that the sanitary inspection score was only marginally better than chance in discriminating between contaminated and uncontaminated sources of this type. A slightly higher AUC value of 0.64 (95% CI = 0.57-0.71) was observed when the sanitary inspection score was used for prediction of TTC > 0 among the gravity-fed piped sources. Among unprotected springs (AUC = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.38-0.55) and unprotected dug wells (AUC = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.20-0.66), the sanitary inspection score performed more poorly than chance in discriminating between sites with TTC < 1 and TTC > 0. Aggregating over all source types, the sensitivity (true positive rate) of a high/very high sanitary inspection score for TTC contamination (TTC > 1 CFU/100 mL) was 29.4% and the specificity (true negative rate) was 77.9%, resulting in substantial misclassification of the sites when using the established risk categories. These findings suggest that sanitary surveys are inappropriate screening tools for identifying TTC contamination at water points.

In this study, we used comprehensive physiochemical indicators to assess the quality of groundwater used for drinking and irrigation in addition to the potential risks to local residents in a riverbank filtration site. Human health risks through drinking water intake and dermal contact were also estimated. Moreover, we analyzed the spatial distribution regularities of health risk values in a riverbank filtration site. The assessment results revealed that NH4-N, NO2-N, F-, Mn, and As are main contaminants affecting groundwater quality and that 62% of the total samples is suitable for a variety of purposes. All groundwater in the study area is suitable for irrigation based on the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), Na percentage (%Na), and U.S. Salinity Laboratory (USSL) and Wilcox diagrams. The health risk assessment suggests that residents in the study area are at high health risk, and women and children face higher risk than men in both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks. The spatial distribution regularities of health risk values suggest that the human health risk value of each groundwater sample is different in the study area and has certain regularity. Therefore, effective measurements must be taken to address the groundwater contamination and to reduce the human health risks.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	4					705	726		10.1080/10807039.2016.1277413								WOS:000401752300004

However, there were some reports on the poor water quality status of water sources in the past. In the present study, by applying fuzzy synthetic evaluation, the water quality was studied from a total of 24 water samples from a reservoir-type water source in the northeastern region of China. Health risks of eight trace elements in source water were assessed using health risk assessment model and Monte Carlo simulation, and source apportionment of eight trace elements in source water were also analyzed. The results indicated that the water quality of the source water was acceptable for category I surface water, while the concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and manganese (Mn) were higher than the permissible level. The noncarcinogenic risks due to eight trace elements exposure were As > Mn > Pb > Cd approximate to Cr > Se > Zn > Cu and carcinogenic risk of Arsenic (As) was 3E-05 with a maximum probability. Furthermore, statistical analyses, such as correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) showed that the trace metals in the water source have a certain degree of anthropogenic contributions, especially Mn. Overall, both the contents of TP and Mn and the health risk of As require some attention of the relevant department, and further protected measures should be taken in the source water.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	4					751	766		10.1080/10807039.2016.1278518								WOS:000401752300007

Groundwater samples (n = 100) were collected from ten different towns of Lahore District (Pakistan). Arsenic concentration ranged from 2 to 111 mu g L-1 in groundwater samples of the study area, which was significantly greater than the safe limit of As (10 mu g L-1) in drinking water set by the World Health Organization. Health risk assessment of As showed that HQ (0.1-11) for oral exposure and HI (0.1-11) values also exceeded the typical toxic risk index value of 1. 9.75 x E-05-4.59 x E-03 and 5.89 x E-07-2.77 x E-05 for oral and dermal As exposure, respectively. Both CR and cancer index (CIs) values were higher than United States Environmental Protection Agency limit (10(-6)), suggesting that people are at high risk of As-induced carcinogenicity from oral and dermal exposure to As in drinking water. It was concluded that As contamination of groundwater causes carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health effects to the people; therefore, urgent management and remedial actions are required to protect people from As poisoning.

The residents try to construct the sandbag dike to protect their village. If the residents have encountered flood for long period, the water pollutant must be increase. The villagers want to drain the water to another areas. The residents of another village are not agree to receive the drained-polluted water from them. The simulation of water-quality is required to compromise these problem. The simulation process of water-quality model is require the input as the water flow velocities after the villagers dike has been destroyed but there is lack of field data on the flooding period. In this research, the dam-break model is used to describe unsteady dike failure flow. A couple of mathematical models is used to simulate water-quality in the problem. The first model is the dam-break model that provides the velocity fields and elevation of water. The second model is the dispersion model that provides the pollutant concentration fields. A modified Lax-diffusive method for solving a dam-break model is proposed. At each step, the flow velocity fields calculated from the first model are the input into the second model as the field data. The explicit and implicit methods are subsequently employed in the dispersion model. This paper proposes a simply remarkable alteration to the Lax-diffusive method, the implicit methods and the explicit methods so as to make it more accurate without any significant loss of computational efficiency. The numerical techniques indicate that this model can be applied for simulation of water-quality in long-term flooding cases are proposed.																	0972-0502	2169-012X					2017	20	2					461	495		10.1080/09720502.2016.1277089								WOS:000401632800008

Multiple Stressors and the Functioning of Coral Reefs	ANNUAL REVIEW OF MARINE SCIENCE, VOL 9	Annual Review of Marine Science											Coral reefs provide critical services to coastal communities, and these services rely on ecosystem functions threatened by stressors. By summarizing the threats to the functioning of reefs from fishing, climate change, and decreasing water quality, we highlight that these stressors have multiple, conflicting effects on functionally similar groups of species and their interactions, and that the overall effects are often uncertain because of a lack of data or variability among taxa. The direct effects of stressors on links among functional groups, such as predator-prey interactions, are particularly uncertain. Using qualitative modeling, we demonstrate that this uncertainty of stressor impacts on functional groups (whether they are positive, negative, or neutral) can have significant effects on models of ecosystem stability, and reducing uncertainty is vital for understanding changes to reef functioning. This review also provides guidance for future models of reef functioning, which should include interactions among functional groups and the cumulative effect of stressors.

J	Lizotte, RE; Moore, MT				Lizotte, Richard E.; Moore, Matthew T.			Effectiveness of emergent and submergent aquatic plants in mitigating a nitrogen-permethrin mixture	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Hydraulically connected wetland microcosms (approximate to 50L) in series were used to test the effectiveness of varying combinations of two common aquatic vascular plants, parrot feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum) and cattail (Typha latifolia), for mitigating contamination from a mixture of nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) and permethrin. The upstream series included Myriophyllum only (M) and Typha only (T) while the combination upstream effluent into downstream series included Myriophyllum into Myriophyllum (M+M) and Typha into Myriophyllum (T+M). During flow, M into M+M more efficiently mitigated nitrogen than T into T+M. Post-flow, nitrogen removal efficiency was greater for T versus M and M+M versus T+M. Mean aqueous dissipation half-lives (t(1/2)) of NH4-N and NO3-N were more rapid in T than M treatments. Ammonium and nitrate t(1/2) was highly correlated with aquatic plant above-ground shoot biomass. Permethrin mitigation efficiencies and t(1/2) were not significantly affected by plant species either singly or in combination. Trans-permethrin t(1/2) was moderately correlated with plant biomass, but not cis-permethrin t(1/2). Results of this study indicate differences in aquatic plant species and flow path influence nitrogen removal but not permethrin. However, plant species appears less important than overall plant biomass in ascertaining aquatic plant effectiveness in mitigating a nitrogen-permethrin mixture.																	0275-7540	1029-0370					2017	33	5					420	433		10.1080/02757540.2017.1310849								WOS:000401448600004

Despite increased government investment in water resource protection and management, there is still an absence of academic studies that are able to document what path the investment has taken and whether it has had any tangible impact. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of drinking water investment on drinking water in China. Design/methodology/approach - The authors make use of nationally representative data from 2005 and 2012 to measure the impact of drinking water investment among 2,028 rural households in 101 villages across five provinces. Both ordinary least squares regression and probit regression are used to analyze the correlates and the impact of drinking water investment. Findings - The authors demonstrate that water quality was likely a significant problem in 2004 but that China's investment into drinking water appears to have resulted in initial improvements during the study period. The authors show that the most significant change came about in terms of hardware: villages that received more drinking water investment now have more piped tap water and more access to water treatment infrastructure (disinfecting and filtering facilities). High rates of rural resident satisfaction with drinking water suggest the effects of drinking water investment are being felt at the village level. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first empirical study on drinking water investment over time in rural China using nationally representative data.																	1756-137X	1756-1388					2017	9	2					255	269		10.1108/CAER-05-2015-0062								WOS:000401004900007

Heavy metal concentrations in water were compared to Thailand's standard limits, and chromosomal aberrations in O. niloticus from contaminated water were compared with O. niloticus from an unaffected area. The samples were collected from a domestic wastewater canal, water quality parameters were assessed, and heavy metal concentrations (Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in the water, sediment and fish were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The water quality parameters did not exceed standard values. The concentrations of heavy metals in the water and sediment did not exceed Thailand's standards, but the Ni concentration in the water was higher than the standard limits. Similarly, heavy metal concentrations in O. niloticus were also below the standard limits. Only the Cr concentration in O. niloticus tissues exceeded the standard limits. The diploid chromosome number of O. niloticus from both areas was 2n=44 and the chromosomal damage of O. niloticus in the affected area was higher than that in the unaffected area. There were six types of chromosomal aberrations: single chromatid break, single chromatid gap, centromeric gap, fragmentation, deletion and dicentric chromosomes. The most common chromosomal abnormality in the fish samples from the affected area was single chromatid gap, and the difference in chromosomal breakages in O. niloticus between the areas was significant (p<0.05).																	0011-4545						2017	82	1			SI		41	50		10.1508/cytologia.82.41								WOS:000401490300007

The effects of DO concentration and pyridine loading on the system removal efficiency were investigated. Results showed that the optimal DO concentration and pyridine loading were 3.5 mg/L and 0.5 kg COD/(m(3).d), respectively. Under operating conditions, pyridine removal rate by biodegradation could reach 80.89%. GC-MS analyser was used to determine the water quality of effluent, and the main intermediate products of biodegradation were 2-pentanone, 3-pentanone, methylbutyrate and dimethylformamide. As revealed by the DGGE results, the degradation of pyridine in the SBBR system was a synergistic effect of different kinds of microorganisms, including various dominant bacteria existing in a system. The main dominant microorganisms were Shinella zoogloeoides and Acidovorax caeni, as suggested by the results of DNA sequencing of the V3 region.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2504	2510										WOS:000400806100003

Thus, a comprehensive assessment of groundwater quality is critical for local residents. The hydrochemical characteristics of both shallow aquifer (14) and deep aquifer (11) were determined. The concentrations of the cations in the shallow groundwater decrease in the order of Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, while in the deep groundwater in the order of Ca2+ > Na+ > Mg2+ > Kt classifying both groundwater as Ca2+-Na+ type. The contents of anions in both shallow and deep groundwater follow a similar pattern as HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3-, with HCO3- as the dominant species. The mean values of pH, electrical conductivity and total dissolved solid of shallow groundwater were higher than those in deep groundwater. Three groups of water were generated from hierarchical cluster analysis to test water quality data of their hydrochemical parameters. The factor analysis on different water quality parameters indicated that most of their variations can be explained by natural dissolved salts and anthropogenic activities. The assessment of water quality shows that deep groundwater is generally suitable for drinking and agricultural irrigation. In contrast, great caution should be taken when using shallow groundwater for irrigation or drinking. Appropriate technologies are thus required for shallow groundwater to reduce the salinity and sodium compounds before irrigation and to reduce F, Mn and total dissolved solid before drinking																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2541	2549										WOS:000400806100008

In this study, the Ipomoea aquatic floating beds were introduced into 2 intensive aquaculture ponds to investigate its effect on ammonia dynamics, and 2 similar ponds set as controls. Throughout the experiment, control ponds were higher than the corresponding floating bed ponds in ammonia concentration by 6.2 similar to 75.7 %, and 12.4 similar to 43.2 %, respectively. The unionized ammonia concentrations of the two control ponds were 2.58 similar to 8.86-fold higher than that of the corresponding experimental ponds. In the Ipomoea aquatica fibrous roots, the amoA copy numbers of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) ranged from (1.16 +/- 0.01) x 10(5) to (2.33 +/- 0.24) x 10(6) copy g(-1), and those of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) ranged from (5.41 +/- 0.25) x 10(3) to (3.82 +/- 0.37) x 10(4) copy g(-1). The Ipomoea aquatica floating bed can efficiently remove ammonia in intensive aquaculture pond, especially can decrease the unionized ammonia level and the unionized ammonia toxicity to fish. It was assumed that the decrease of the unionized ammonia level was resulted from the pH decrease, which was contributed by the floating bed through algal photosynthesis inhibition. High richness of AOB and AOA in the Ipomoea aquatica rhizosphere indicated that the rhizospheric ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms played a vital role in ammonia removal.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2699	2705										WOS:000400806100028

The results show that for influent turbidity in the range of 0.14 to 0.32 NTU, the effluent turbidity can be reduced to below 0.1 NTU within 30 min through the optimization of the backwash procedure with a low flow rate. Moreover, with the further dosage of an additional 0.2 mg/L poly aluminum ferric chloride (PAFC) immediately after backwashing for approximately 12 min, the effluent turbidity can be reduced to 0.1 NTU and maintained below 0.1 NTU until approximately 48 h of filtering without using additional coagulant. The new technique not only can shorten the filter ripening period and enhance the water quality but also can decrease the consumption of coagulant and lower the operating costs.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2771	2777										WOS:000400806100037

Thus the water quality properties were assessed, the pollution problems were revealed, the suitability levels in terms of aquatic life and drinking water were determined and the quality of water in accordance with the Surface Water Quality Management Regulation (SWQMR) criteria was classified. In total, 21 physicochemical parameters and 7 heavy metals were investigated for water quality assessment of the studied pond between March 2015 and February 2016. This study was carried out through monthly sampling during 1 year, in 3 stations at Sakiz Pond. Temperature, pH, salinity and electrical conductivity parameters were obtained from the field using a multiparameter. The analyses of nitrite, nitrate, ammoniac, ammonium nitrogen (NH4+), chloride, phosphate, sulfate, sulfite, potassium, calcium, sodium and magnesium were conducted by using EACH LANGE brand DR 6000 laboratory type spectrophotometer and the analyses of the heavy metals were conducted by using a gas chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The water quality in study area was found to be Class I according to the Surface Water Quality Management Regulation, and also this water was found as suitable in terms of drinking water quality. The results of this study will provide a data baseline for future studies on subsequent evaluations of possible future environmental contamination, and also this study will be the baseline data for future ecological studies and conservation and management of the water resources of Kastamonu-Turkey.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	4					2806	2815										WOS:000400806100042

This is particularly the case for central developers (Ministry, Municipality, Special Administration and so on) in the development of land use decisions. As a matter of fact, one of the duties placed in front of our country Turkey during the EU membership process is the preparation of the main spatial data infrastructures on the basis of each basin to manage river basins. In this process, first of all the following procedures should be done to determine watershed based land use within administrative borders. Protected areas, wetlands, forests, rangeland and plateau areas, agricultural protected areas, water collection lines, creek deposits, geologically objectionable areas, built-up areas, landslide susceptible areas should be digitally created in the ITRF system together with property information and ownership data. The use of this data will greatly facilitate the determination of decision-makers, appropriate land management and practices. It is known that basin based spatial data infrastructures have not yet been established in Turkey at this point. It has been found that environmental planning has been established without these data and based on these plans, so incorrect land use decisions have been developed. With this study, spatial data structures for river basins, which are obliged to prepare especially in EU membership process, have been created with the help of GIS technologies. In this process, proposals have been developed for resolving the problems faced by technical, institutional and legal aspects.

Violent fluctuations in water levels may lead to worsening water quality effects and destruction of plant growth. Ecological floating beds provide an effective way to overcome the problems, yet limited information regarding Sphagnum purification has been obtained in the open water environment. The ability of Sphagnum survival and its correlation to nutrients enrichment in violently fluctuating riverside wetland water as applied to the ecological floating bed are investigated in this study. Ecological floating beds, with Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum squarossum, were chosen for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment. The results indicated that changes of water quality (high N low P, low N high P) resulting from water level fluctuations in test areas were beneficial for the survival of Sphagnum species, especially in flood periods that high carbon content of water could effectively stimulate the growth of Sphagnum species. Following four months of field tests, the amounts of N and P enrichment in Sphagnum squarossum were 2.29 and 0.82 mg/g dry weight, respectively, while in Sphagnum fallax were 1.98 and 0.64 mg/g dry weight. N enrichment was superior to P for both Sphagnum moss types. The release of nutrients, especially P, can be controlled effectively by harvesting Sphagnum species in early winter. This study could be useful for improved understanding of water restoration in violent fluctuating degraded riverine wetland by eutrophic Sphagnum mosses.

Increase in Anthropogenic Impervious Surfaces (AIS) for a region is a true representation of urban expansion. Monitoring of AIS in an urban region is helpful for better urban planning and resource management. Cost effective and efficient maps of AIS can be obtained for larger areas using remote sensing techniques. In the present study, extraction of AIS has been carried out using Double window Flexible Pace Search (DFPS) from a new index named as Normalized Difference Impervious Surface Index (NDAISI). NDAISI is developed by enhancing Biophysical Composition Index (BCI) in two stages using a new Modified Normalized Difference Soil Index (MNDSI). MNDSI has been developed from Band 7 and Band 8 (PAN) of Landsat 8 data. In comparison to existing impervious surface extraction methods, the new NDAISI approach is able to improve Spectral Discrimination Index (SDI) for bare soil and AIS significantly. Overall accuracy of mapping of AIS, using NDAISI approach has been found to be increased by nearly 23% when compared with existing impervious surface extraction methods.																	1548-1603	1943-7226					2017	54	4					471	494		10.1080/15481603.2017.1282414								WOS:000401522100002

In the present study, the individual and combined toxicities of dissolved cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) on early life stages of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas have been investigated. Embryotoxicity, larvae mortality and genotoxicity were measured under single and combined exposure of the two tested metals. For embryotoxicity, the median effective concentration (EC50) values for individual Cd, Pb and their mixture were of 272.2 mu g/L, 660.3 mu g/L and 373.1 mu g/L, respectively. The median lethal concentrations (LC50) for 96 h larval mortality were determined to be 353.3 mu g/L, 699.5 mu g/L and 205.5 mu g/L for individual Cd, Pb and their mixture, respectively. Moreover, the Marking-Dawson additive toxicity indices were 0.10 for embryogenesis and 1.40 for larval mortality indicating, respectively, an additive effect and a trend to synergism for the Cd and Pb combination. Furthermore, DNA strand breaks were observed in oyster embryos after individual Cd, Pb and their mixture exposure, and a significant positive correlation was demonstrated between embryotoxicity and genotoxicty. The current study suggests the toxicity of Cd is higher than that of Pb, and the Cd-Pb mixture is slightly more toxic than individual Cd or Pb to the Pacific oyster. These data will be helpful to predict the toxicity of metal mixtures, and provide biological criteria for the implementation of marine water quality standards to protect these marine organisms.																	1824-307X						2017	14						210	220										WOS:000401030600014

Ken			Visitors' Preferences for Freshwater Amenity Characteristics: Implications from the US Household Survey	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS												We employed spectral analysis of completely ranked U.S. household survey data on freshwater recreation to understand visitors' preferences for freshwater amenity characteristics-closeness, water quality, wildlife, and size- and used rank-ordered and multinomial logit models to identify factors affecting their ranking choices. Spectral analysis of amenity characteristics reveals that closeness is the most preferred amenity characteristic and that the combination of closeness and size is the most preferred combination of amenity characteristics in freshwater recreation. Results from the rank-ordered and multinomial logit models suggest that amenity characteristics choices vary significantly among visitors based on their activity choices and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics.																	1068-5502	2327-8285				JAN	2017	42	1					90	113										WOS:000401236400006

PRESENCE OF HEAVY METALS IN WATER AND SEDIMENT OF RIVERS TREPCA AND SITNICA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Urban environmental pollution with heavy metals in region of Mitrovica, since 1970/1990 years until nowadays has been an dis a serious concern and permanent not only for the population of Mitrovica with the sorroundings, but also for a host of environmental researchers, of various categories and scientific profiles. Such pollution of the environment exists because in this region, for a long time, with all the complexityof ore processing industry acted the mine 'Trepca'. The mine of Pb-Zn in Stan Tergis is located on one side of valley of the river Trepca. The main entrance of the mine is located about 2 km in north east of flotation on first tunnel. The object of flotation is located in upper part of the slope of narrow valley of Trepca river, which flows from the flotation of Trepca mine towards Mitrovica with length of about 5 km, to the point of joining with river Sitnica. In this part, close to coupling of these two rivers, is located the landfill of Shupkovc (PIM Trepca). Our research consists in the study of water quality and based on the obtained results from analysis to verify and reflect the real situation of the presence of heavy metals in water and sediment of rivers Trepca and Sitnica.																	1311-5065						2017	18	1					10	21										WOS:000401304800002

INVESTIGATION OF STURGEON MIGRATION ROUTES USING THE MOST ADEQUATE MONITORING TECHNIQUES IN DIFFICULT HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE DANUBE RIVER	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The Danube River is one of the most studied rivers in Europe. Its characteristics regarding biodiversity, hydrological conditions and water quality represent very interesting research domains. Since 2011, INCDPM (National Institute of Research and Development in Environmental Protection) runs a research project to monitor the impact of the hydrotechnical works on the aquatic ecosystems. In the present the project is in the post-construction phase, the hydrotechnical works were finished in 2016. They were realised for improving the navigation in the Lower Danube, Calarasi Braila sector (km 375 - km 175) and mean the construction of a bottom sill on Bala, one of the Danube branches. During the construction period, from 2011 to 2015, 315 sturgeon specimens of the 4 species that reproduce in the Lower Danube sector were captured, marked and released in order to identify the migration routes of them and the impact of the hydrotechnical works on their conservation status. There were analyzed the morphological modifications of river section in the bottom sill area and what kind of hydrological modifications has implied the construction. Also there was analysed the behaviour of the sturgeon specimens which have crossed the bottom sill upon different values of water flows and water velocities and the potential of those specimens to swim against too high water currents.

PERFORMANT TECHNOLOGY TO REMOVE ORGANIC AND INORGANIC POLLUTANTS FROM WASTEWATERS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Nationally, discharge of treated insufficient or untreated wastewater is one of the main causes of pollution and degradation of soil, groundwater and surface water. Therefore, the main practical measures to protect water quality and soil are the wastewater treatment, which involves collecting them through sewage systems, cleaning in treatment plants followed by discharge either into the emissary, either in sewer according with the standards in force. The National Institute for Research and Development in Environment Protection had as a partner, ongoing a financing contract which was part of the Sectoral Operational Programme 'Increase of Economic Competitiveness', the direct beneficiary of the contract being the Society Echipa Horse and the main contracting authority was the National Authority for Scientific Research of Romania of Romania. Within this project was acquired the Juggler mobile technology. The practical relevance of the paper consist from the fact that the technology can be used in areas where there is no cleaning station (70% of the nation-wide), and in the activities from which results treated waters loaded with various hazardous pollutants, the technology being mobile, moving where necessary. The paper presents the results of tests conducted by a team of researchers from INCDPM and the results of the tests with the automated treatment technology on the wastewaters, their interpretation being done in accordance with the laws in force.																	1311-5065						2017	18	1					304	312										WOS:000401304800031

The aims of this study were to assess the effects of water quality, depths, and distances of lateral installation on soil chemical properties during turfgrass cultivation. A field experiment was conducted using a Split-Split-Plot design based on the randomized complete block (RCB) design with two treatments (well water and wastewater) and eight sub-treatments (45 and 60 cm distance of the laterals and 15, 20, 25, and 30 cm depths of laterals) in three replicates on a sandy loam soil, in Shahrekord, Iran. Soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 and 30 to 60 cm depth for measuring nitrate (NO3-), electrical conductivity (EC), and pH at the end of the experiment. During the experiment, fecal coliform was also measured at the soil surface. Results indicated that by increasing lateral distance, NO3- level increased in both layers. With installing laterals in deeper levels, NO3- concentration decreased at the beginning, then increased in the first layer, whereas in the second layer, NO3- concentration decreased. In addition, installing laterals in deeper depth caused an increase in soil EC in the top layer, but a decrease in the lower layer. However, the results showed that there was no significant effect of the treatments (well water and wastewater) and the sub-treatments (distance and depths of laterals) on soil pH. The results also show that with increasing laterals depth, fecal coliform level decreased at the soil surface.

Although conventional pathogen detection methods used in water analysis laboratories offer high sensitivity and specificity, they are time consuming, and need experts to operate bulky equipment and analyze the samples. Here we present a field-portable and cost-effective smartphone-based waterborne pathogen detection platform that can automatically classify Giardia cysts using machine learning. Our platform enables the detection and quantification of Giardia cysts in one hour, including sample collection, labeling, filtration, and automated counting steps. We evaluated the performance of three prototypes using Giardia-spiked water samples from different sources (e.g., reagent-grade, tap, non-potable, and pond water samples). We populated a training database with >30,000 cysts and estimated our detection sensitivity and specificity using 20 different classifier models, including decision trees, nearest neighbor classifiers, support vector machines (SVMs), and ensemble classifiers, and compared their speed of training and classification, as well as predicted accuracies. Among them, cubic SVM, medium Gaussian SVM, and bagged-trees were the most promising classifier types with accuracies of similar to 94.1%, 94.2%, and 95%, respectively; we selected the latter as our preferred classifier for the detection and enumeration of Giardia cysts that are imaged using our mobile-phone fluorescence microscope. Without the need for any experts or microbiologists, this field-portable pathogen detection platform can present a useful tool for water quality monitoring in resource-limited-settings.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors place an emphasis on green envelope components that influence building value and which are derived based on their integration into a building envelope structure that is applicable under hot and humid climates. This is performed through identification of green benefits of each green envelope component based on literature reviews and in relation to green criteria listed by the Malaysia Green Building Index (GBI). Consequently, a quantitative analysis has been conducted to determine the effect of these green envelope components on building value by means of a questionnaire distribution among 550 property valuation practitioners in Malaysia. However, in order to certify respondents' credibility, the authors analyzed questionnaires answered by property valuation practitioners with experience in green valuation. Findings - The findings show that there are ten green envelope components currently certified under GBI Malaysia and applicable for hot and humid climates. There are three green envelope components that can increase property values, specifically: solar photovoltaic, green living wall and green roof. However, eight of the green envelope components have no effect on building value. Research limitations/implications - Due to the relative immaturity of the green building market in Malaysia, the authors were unable to analyze the actual percentage of increment on building value as conveyed by each green envelope component. Originality/value - This paper aims to provide understanding of the effect of individual green envelope components on building value rather than merely the value of green buildings in general. It proves that green building envelope components do in fact contribute to an increase in green building values. As the green building market in Malaysia is still in its infancy, this study is significant in that it prepares the Malaysian green building market to attain a new level by providing valuation practitioners with awareness of green building values and new knowledge concerning the effect of individual green components on building values. Hence, it is anticipated that this study can assist property valuation practitioners in conducting valuations of green buildings in the future.

Spatial and seasonal variations of the microbiological condition of water sources in a dry tropical hydrographic system were determined, and the domestic water management was characterized to assess threats to family health. Twenty-two sources in eighteen localities, in dry and rainy seasons, were analyzed during two years. The microbiological condition of the sources was deficient by the presence of 35 species of thermotolerant coliforms, ten of them with high pathogenic importance (HPI). The pollution was most severe during rainy season due to the significant increase in the richness of HPI species and the number of sites affected at different altitudes and order flow within the watersheds. The use of water disinfection techniques was registered in 49 % of the surveyed families, who pointed out also have received information about the topic. The 45 % of interviewed declared suffering from diseases transmitted by water (diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and vomiting) annually, although 72 % of the cases exposed to medical services had not been diagnosed. The highest contamination by HPI in rainfall season responds to the transportation and leaching of fecal material accumulated along dry season in riparian areas coming from livestock, wildlife and human population without sanitation services. The difficult control of diffuse pollution highlights the importance of increasing the information and monitoring of the household water management by rural vulnerable population as part of strategies for water security in seasonal rural watersheds.																	0188-4999						2017	33	2					199	213		10.20937/RICA.2017.33.02.02								WOS:000401070900002

It is a word that is usually applied to the process of qualitative urban and land planning, as opposed just to quantitative planning. Since the Conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, the urban and planning (but also architectural) disciplines have been accompanied by terminologies that could somehow represent a better way of "carrying out" transformations, passing from an "ecological city" to a "sustainable city" and finally to a "smart city". Each adjective represents a vision of the transformations: for example, an ecological city is a town with more public green areas, the sustainable city pays more attention to the preservation of physical and chemical parameters (air and water quality, etc.), and the smart city is more focused on the realization of efficient technologies. Actually, the above interpretations of transformation do not have a real meaning, as it is absolutely evident that the city and the territory, in compliance with the disciplinary statute, must be transformed by taking into consideration the human, biotic, and abiotic elements, i.e., they must have an environmental approach. The adjective environmental has been defined in the long-standing scientific research (Odum, Leopold, McHarg, Stainer, Nebbia, etc.) which, since the 1930s, has been developing the ability to utilize dynamically and synchronically the three levers that define sustainable development: the economic, the social, and the ecological (biotic and abiotic) levers. Following the historical periods and the geographical contexts, the use of the three levers may progressed at different speeds, while yet focusing attention on the feedback among the same levers. In the case study (Belluno province), the environmental (ecological, sustainable, smart) development depends on the infrastructural lever for inverting a phenomenon of social and economic decadence of a territory, also due to pervasive and aggressive competitive policies of the neighboring territories. In fact, in the province of Belluno, environmental development is conditioned by the priority use of the social and economic (primarily infrastructural) levers in the medium and long term. It is evident that this priority in the use of levers is accompanied by the ability to take the opportunities given by the high-quality ecological and landscape conditions existing in the Belluno province.																	1865-3529		978-3-319-44899-2; 978-3-319-44898-5				2017							299	315		10.1007/978-3-319-44899-2_18								WOS:000400864100018

A systematic evaluation of chemicals in hydraulic-fracturing fluids and wastewater for reproductive and developmental toxicity	JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY												Hydraulic-fracturing fluids and wastewater from unconventional oil and natural gas development contain hundreds of substances with the potential to contaminate drinking water. Challenges to conducting well-designed human exposure and health studies include limited information about likely etiologic agents. We systematically evaluated 1021 chemicals identified in hydraulic fracturing fluids (n = 925), wastewater (n = 132), or both (n = 36) for potential reproductive and developmental toxicity to triage those with potential for human health impact. We searched the REPROTOX database using Chemical Abstract Service registry numbers for chemicals with available data and evaluated the evidence for adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Next, we determined which chemicals linked to reproductive or developmental toxicity had water quality standards or guidelines. Toxicity information was lacking for 781 (76%) chemicals. Of the remaining 240 substances, evidence suggested reproductive toxicity for 103 (43%), developmental toxicity for 95 (40%), and both for 41 (17%). Of these 157 chemicals, 67 had or were proposed for a federal water quality standard or guideline. Our systematic screening approach identified a list of 67 hydraulic fracturing related candidate analytes based on known or suspected toxicity. Incorporation of data on potency, physicochemical properties, and environmental concentrations could further prioritize these substances for future drinking water exposure assessments or reproductive and developmental health studies.

Employing indicators for prioritization of fish assemblage with a view to manage freshwater fish diversity and ecosystem health in the tributaries of Ganges basin, India	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The major tributaries of the river Ganges basin are currently threatened by various anthropogenic activities which are hampering the ecosystem stability and fish biodiversity of the basin. Multiple indicators were used to prioritize the fish assemblages in the tributaries and to develop an index that is responsive to human-induced environmental changes. A high percentage of invasive species was described with the orgin index at the most disturbed sites of rivers Gomti and Betwa which also represented a substantial amount of biological disturbance. The Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index based on ecological integrity of different segments of the rivers was used to prioritize different sampling sites of the tributaries. Some of the sampling sites in Gomti and Betwa rivers are reflecting disturbed fish assemblages, a very low Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index score, few threatened species, and a high proportion of invasive species. Principal components analysis of the sampling sites, along with fish assemblage, reflected the influence of the habitat parameters on structuring the assemblage pattern. This study identified depth, flow, water quality and land uses in shaping fish assemblages. The combination of various indices in this study should provide more accurate measures in identifying sites of high conservation value.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		21	29		10.1080/14634988.2017.1270146								WOS:000400410800004

Studies on ecology, fish diversity and fisheries of Ken-Betwa rivers (India): Proposed for inter-linking	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Ken and Betwa rivers traversing through Central India are the major tributaries of the river Yamuna. Both rivers originate above 550m above sea level in the Vindhya region. An interlinking project proposed for the rivers envisages diversion of water from Ken basin to the Betwa. The river sediment is alkaline and dominated by sand (78-89%) in both rivers. Oxygen-rich alkaline water and moderate values of chemical parameters show the pollution free and productive nature of both the rivers. There was no statistically significant difference in water quality between the Ken and Betwa rivers, except for total alkalinity. The biotic parameters were observed in similar ranges and moderate condition. A total of 61 planktonic forms were recorded from the rivers out of which 55 were phytoplankton. For the first time, 89 fish species belonging to 10 orders, 26 families, and 62 genera have been recorded in the river Ken, while 81 species classified under 10 orders, 24 families, and 55 genera were found in the Betwa. Exotic fish species were also observed in the downstream stretches of both rivers. Out of the total fish species, 77 were common to both rivers, 12 were found only in the Ken River, and 4 species were restricted to the Betwa. Analysis of relative abundance showed dominance of Labeo boggut in the Ken and Osteobrama cotio in the Betwa River. On comparison of the Shannon-Wiener Diversity and Evenness Indices of fish diversity, these indicated slightly higher values in the Ken (3.76 and 0.842) than the Betwa (3.66 and 0.835). A total of nine near-threatened fish species was recorded in the rivers. Both rivers have already been obstructed by many developmental projects; the proposed interlinking would further negatively impact the ecology and fisheries.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		71	85		10.1080/14634988.2017.1261576								WOS:000400410800008

AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers are the first and second largest running waters of Jharkhand, having variable river bed morphology with naturally hard substrates. The riverine biodiversity is outstanding, as it includes endemic taxa on species and subspecies levels. Aquatic habitats are mostly colonized by native species. Macrozoobenthic animals are important bioindicators of the habitat quality of the river and are used for rapid assessment of river quality globally. In order to have preliminary information on the biodiversity of macrobenthos, the first survey was undertaken to find the impact of domestic pollution, mining, and thermal power plants on the aquatic life of the Damodar in May 2004. On the basis of our observations and species records, systematic field sampling for macro-benthic invertebrates in the Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers was conducted from 2007 to 2012 during different hydrological conditions to cover the seasonal variation. Synoptic sampling was done to allow comparison between the two rivers. Aquatic invertebrate fauna has been inventoried with 124 identified taxa. The highest proportion of functional feeding groups recorded were detritivores, followed by carnivores and herbivores, respectively. This present study demonstrates the seasonal disappearance of macrozoobenthic invertebrates caused by urban and industrial pollution and that the fauna of the two main rivers of Jharkhand are similar in species inventory. This reflects the ecological conditions of the shared ecoregion known as Chota Nagpur Dry Forests. The results of the present research provide an essential database to evaluate the future environmental impact of restoration and changes in water quality.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		116	129		10.1080/14634988.2017.1300041								WOS:000400410800011

Effect of river connectivity on hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity and biotic communities of wetlands	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Wetlands associated with floodplains of the Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems cover an estimated 0.2million ha and play a vital role in the fisheries, rural economy and environment. In recent years, most wetlands in the states of Bihar, Assam and West Bengal in India have lost connectivity with their parent rivers due to natural and anthropogenic changes. These changes are causing rapid shrinkage of valuable wetlands and threatening their biodiversity and ecological function. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of river connectivity on the hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity, and biotic communities of these wetlands. One wetland area having link channels (open) connecting the main river, and another without link channels (closed), were selected from each of the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins for the study. Comparative analysis of open and closed, ecologically distinct wetlands of the Ganges basin revealed greater seasonal reduction in water depth and higher water conductivity (p < 0.04), nutrients (Ca+2, Mg+2, SiO3-Si), sediment microbial activity (p < 0.004), phosphorous cycling enzymes (p < 0.001), carbon cycling enzymes (p < 0.01), organic matter, conductivity, and plankton and macrozoobenthos (p < 0.01) density in the closed wetland. However, the open wetland showed higher diversity of plankton and macrozoobenthos. A profound impact of connectivity on wetland fisheries was observed in the Brahmaputra basin in Assam, where a higher percentage of catch comprised of indigenous fish species with lower fish yield was noted in the open wetland.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		140	150		10.1080/14634988.2017.1301095								WOS:000400410800013

A case study of the Narmada River system in India with particular reference to the impact of dams on its ecology and fisheries	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Narmada, the oldest river system in India, originates from Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh, flows east-west, and joins with the Gulf of Cambay on the Arabian Sea. The river drains 45.64km(3) of annual run-off and a series of dams was proposed to hold some of its water resources for multipurpose use. Currently, three dams have been built in Madhya Pradesh and one is under construction in Gujarat. A comparison of pre- and post-impoundment eco-environment and fisheries revealed changes in water quality, productivity, and aquatic flora and fauna of the river system. Among the fish, species like Tor tor, Labeo fimbriatus and Labeo dyocheilus suffered most. The percentage contributions to total yield of Carp, Catfish, and miscellaneous groups have significantly changed, indicating falls of 17%, 36% and an increase of 410%, respectively. Percentage contributions to catches of Macrobrachium rosenbergii and Tenualosa ilisha have also declined by 46% and about 75% in the estuarine stretch of the river system. Suitable conservation measures for sustenance and development of fishery have been suggested.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		151	159		10.1080/14634988.2017.1288529								WOS:000400410800014

Status of the River Krishna: Water quality and riverine environment in relation to fisheries	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The River Krishna, the second largest peninsular river of India, was investigated during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons to improve the understanding of its ecology through analysis of physical and chemical parameters of water and sediment. Important tributaries of the river were also studied simultaneously to understand their influence on the main stream of the River Krishna. In addition to 25 sampling sites along the main stream of the River Krishna, sampling was also done in 13 important tributaries at sites upstream of the confluence point. Dams, barrages and anicuts have visible impacts on all of the observed physical and chemical properties of water and soil. Statistical analysis revealed that water parameters have a strong association with sediment parameters. However, the study was unable to find any relation between primary production and water quality parameters. Fish species distribution was strongly influenced by temperature and water depth, as well as specific conductivity, as observed through Canonical Correspondence Analysis.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		160	174		10.1080/14634988.2017.1296312								WOS:000400410800015						
J	Larcombe, P; Morrison-Saunders, A				Larcombe, Piers; Morrison-Saunders, Angus			Managing marine environments and decision-making requires better application of the physical sedimentary sciences	AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Effective management of marine environments requires a sound understanding of the relevant physical sedimentary sciences. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a key management and decision-making tool employed in Australia for coastal and marine developments. This article examines the veracity of the application of the marine physical sciences within the EIA process, using turbidity measurement and sediment transport pathways as examples. A review of EIA guidance reveals deficiencies in regulation. Turbidity measurement is poorly understood and performed in current practice, while a focus on protecting marine habitats largely ignores those physical sedimentary processes, such as long-term bed-sediment transport pathways, that create and maintain these habitats. Thus evaluations of impacts of offshore activities such as channel dredging and spoil emplacement at sea are fundamentally flawed. An extensive body of scientific knowledge is already available on marine physical processes, and equivalent information for assessments of terrestrial development is routinely taken into consideration. Perhaps practice for the marine environment lags behind that for terrestrial settings or is it a case of out of sight - out of mind'? We call on environmental management professionals to increase engagement with the physical processes that determine the quality of marine environments.																	1448-6563	2159-5356					2017	24	2					200	221		10.1080/14486563.2017.1309694								WOS:000400793500008

A combined physicochemical-biological and filtration process was used in the study for removing pollutants in the wastewater. The removal efficiency of the pollutant in physicochemical and biological process was evaluated, respectively. Furthermore, advanced technology was used to analyse the water quality before and after the process treatment. Experimental results showed that the removal efficiency of suspend solids (SS) of the system was above 99%, while the physicochemical treatment in the forepart of the system had achieved about 97%. The removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour had the similar trend after physicochemical treatment and were corresponding to the proportion of suspended and the near-colloidal organic matter in the wastewater. After biological treatment, the removal efficiency of COD and colour achieved were about 97% and 90%, respectively. Furthermore, molecular weight (MW) distribution analysis showed that after treatment low MW molecules (<5kDa) increased. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix fluorescence analysis showed that most humic-like substances were effectively removed during the treatment. The analyses of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry showed that the composition of organic matter in the wastewater was not complicated. Methylsiloxanes were the typical organic components in the raw wastewater and most of them were removed after treatment.																	0959-3330	1479-487X					2017	38	11					1443	1451		10.1080/09593330.2016.1231227								WOS:000400464400013	27585225

Through the cytotoxicity bioassay with Allium cepa, using micronucleus test, and comet assay, using Astyanax altiparanae fish, the results indicated that biological samples were genetically altered. Micronuclei were observed in erythrocytes of A. altiparanae after exposure to water from locations close to industrial waste discharge. The highest DNA damage observed with the comet assay in fish occurred with the exposure to water from locations where the presence of metals (Cu, Pb, Cd, Ni) was high, indicating the possibility of genotoxic effects of these compounds. Thus, these results reinforce the importance of conducting genotoxicity tests for developing management plans to improve water quality, and indicate the need for waste management before domestic and industrial effluents are released into the rivers and streams.																	1415-4757	1678-4685				JAN-MAR	2017	40	1					123	133		10.1590/1678-4685-GMB-2015-0223								WOS:000400626900014	27801481

The Status of the Aquatic Ecosystem of the Selenga River Delta Under Long-Duration Low-Water Conditions	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												We examine the ecological aspects concerning the status of the surface waters in the delta of the Selenga river for the low-water conditions which have been observed since 1996. The ongoing changes in the most important indicators of the status of the waters in the river delta are assessed on the basis of results of hydrological, hydrochemical and hydrobiological investigations made by these authors in 2013-2015 and with consideration for earlier research efforts. It is established that the low-water conditions resulted in a decrease of the role of the main delta branches, Kharauz and Levoberezhnaya, in streamflow. An increase in the contribution of groundwater in the alimentation of the river led to an increase in concentrations of main ions: for the current low-water period their total content has varied from 119 to 780 mg/L, with a maximum in small delta branches in the wintertime. Changes in concentrations of biogenic elements were recorded: total phosphorus from 10 to 190 mu g P/L, mineral phosphorus from 0 to 35 mu g P/L, and nitrate nitrogen from 0.01 to 0.81 mu g N/L. A minimum of mineral phosphorus compounds and nitrogen was observed at the time of mass development of algae. It is established that the dynamics of organic matter content is determined by changes in hydraulicity, and by the intensity of phytoplankton development. Within the long-term context, a deterioration of water regime and vegetation infill and swamping of shallow delta branches were recorded. The development level of the phytoplankton and changes in its structure point to a progressive eutrophication of the Selenga waters. According to the value of the saprobic index, the quality of the Selenga waters corresponds largely to the category of "moderately polluted" waters (class II and III), and it decreases at low-water periods, especially in shallow delta branches with a high population of cryptophytic algae, to the category of "polluted" waters.

Andrew			The geographic distribution of small dams in Oregon using ecoregion and landform classification	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Small dams fragment river landscapes, disrupting channel connectivity and impacting water quality and quantity. Although they impound volumetrically less total water than large dams, the ubiquity of small dams suggests their cumulative impacts could be significant. Documenting the distribution and characteristics of small dams is necessary to understanding and mitigating their impacts. In this study, we compare datasets of small dams in Oregon, compile a new comprehensive dataset, and document geographic variations in small dam distributions between different ecoregions. We used Oregon Water Resources Department dam and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife fish passage barrier datasets to compare dam heights and contributing drainage areas between different ecoregions. Over 61% of Oregon's land area is above one or more small dam. We highlight the location of Oregon's small dams at valley margins, transition zones between flat plains and mountains, and areas of high population density. Given the hidden nature of small dams, evaluation of small dam impacts using public imagery is not effective. However, knowledge of small dam distributions given their association with landforms can aid in finding unrecorded dams, assessing approaches for evaluating their geomorphic impacts, and informing their management.																	0272-3646	1930-0557					2017	38	3					286	301		10.1080/02723646.2017.1286224								WOS:000400371000005

This study was conducted in seven agricultural watersheds in Ibiruba, RS, Brazil, with the following objectives: identify relationships between concentrations of soluble phosphorus (Psol) and nitrate (NO3-) in surface water and agricultural use of soil and current vegetation in riparian zones, and assess the risk of eutrophication. Water samples from the main watercourses in each watershed were collected monthly from 10/2013 to 6/2014. Current land use was established by field surveys in the watersheds. The riparian zones of the watercourses were evaluated in terms of the condition of permanent preservation area (PPA) and access of the animals to the watercourses. The concentration of Psol and NO3- were correlated with land use indicators obtained from geoprocessing tools. Agricultural use of PPA increases the risk of surface water degradation, which increases through application of manure on crops and free access of livestock to PPAs and to these watercourses for drinking water. Surface water samples obtained showed water Psol concentrations that generate risk of eutrophication, whereas concentrations of NO3- were generally below critical levels.																	0100-0683						2017	41								e0160248	10.1590/18069657rbcs20160286								WOS:000400564200006

The aim of the present study is to inventory, classify and qualify the drinking-water sources managed by Instituto Costarricense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados (AyA), which are registered in the database of the National Water Laboratory for the year 2015. This information was broken down into drinking-water source types and quality percentages. Data were gathered using the Water Quality Control Programme of the National Water Laboratory. Groundwater and spring water sources qualification was based on the physical-chemical and microbiological criteria established on the study called Actualizacion de los criterios de calidad de aguas de pozos y nacientes para potabilizacion en Costa Rica 2012; the criteria for qualifying surface water sources was taken from the Reglamento para la Evaluacion y Clasificacion de la Calidad de Cuerpos de Agua Superficiales Decreto No 33903-MINAE-S. There were 492 drinking-water sources managed by AyA; 47 were surface water (10 %), 287 groundwater (58 %) and 158 spring water (32 %). Groundwater and spring water sources predominated at a national level; Region Area Metropolitana (RAM) showed the highest percentage of surface water sources (25 %). Excellent and good quality was greater than 50 % in the three types of sources. The former study recommends to develop a programme, ran by the AyA, in order to protect the drinking-water sources, and guarantee water quality.																	0379-3982	2215-3241				JAN-MAR	2017	30	1					101	112		10.18845/tm.v30i1.3089								WOS:000400514500010

TESTING THE RIPARIAN ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT MODEL (REMM) ON A RIPARIAN BUFFER WITH DILUTION FROM DEEP GROUNDWATER	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model (REMM), developed to quantify water quality benefits of riparian buffers, was field-tested using five years (2005-2009) of measured hydrologic and water quality data on a site in the upper coastal plain of North Carolina. This buffer site received nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) loading from a pasture fertilized with poultry litter. Field results showed reductions in groundwater NO3-N concentrations moving through the buffer to the stream for the five-year period; however, further analysis of the groundwater data indicated that dilution was a one of the contributing factors to those observations. Previous testing of REMM was carried out at riparian sites having minimal groundwater dilution. This modeling study is the first attempt to calibrate and validate REMM on a riparian buffer site showing reductions in NO3-N concentrations due to groundwater dilution. REMM was calibrated using daily measured water table depths (WTDs) and monthly groundwater NO3-N concentrations. Results of model testing showed simulated WTDs and NO3-N concentrations in good agreement with measured values. The mean absolute error (MAE) and Willmott's index of agreement (d) between simulated and measured WTDs ranged from 18 to 41 cm and from 0.59 to 0.95, respectively. The root mean square error (RSME) and Willmott's index of agreement (d) between simulated and measured NO3-N concentrations ranged from 1.20 to 8.41 mg L-1 and from 0.11 to 0.73, respectively, for the five-year simulation period. REMM predictions of annual plant nitrogen (N) uptake and denitrification were within the ranges reported in other riparian buffer field studies. A 33-year simulation was carried out using the calibrated and validated model to assess the long-term NO3-N removal performance of the buffer. Results showed that the buffer on average reduced groundwater NO3-N concentrations from 13 mg L-1 at the field edge to 1 mg L-1 at the stream edge. In terms of loadings, the NO3-N and total N reductions from the field edge to the stream were 81% and 89%, respectively. Results of this modeling study showed that REMM reasonably simulated short-term (five years) and long-term (30+ years) groundwater hydrology and NO3-N dynamics for a riparian ecosystem, despite the absence of a groundwater dilution component in the model.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	2					377	392		10.13031/trans.11832								WOS:000400680100014

COMPARING SEDIMENT TRAP DATA WITH EROSION MODELS FOR EVALUATION OF FOREST HAUL ROAD STREAM CROSSING APPROACHES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Soil erosion and sediment delivery models have been developed to estimate the inherent complexities of soil erosion, but most models are not specifically modified for forest operation applications. Three erosion models, the Universal Soil Loss Equation for forestry (USLE-Forest), Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation Version 2 (RUSLE2), and Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), were compared to one year of trapped sediment data for 37 forest haul road stream crossings. We assessed model performance from five variations of the three erosion models: USLE-Roadway, USLE-Soil Survey, RUSLE2, WEPP-Default, and WEPP-Modified. Each road approach was categorized into one of four levels of erosion (very low, low, moderate, and high) based on trapped erosion rate data and erosion rates reported in recent peer-reviewed literature. Model performance metrics included: (1) summary statistics and nonparametric analysis, (2) linear relationships, (3) percent agreement within erosion categories and tolerable error ranges, and (4) contingency table metrics. Sediment trap data varied from negligible (<0.1) to hundreds of Mg ha(-1) year(-1). The soil erosion models evaluated could estimate erosion within 5 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) for most approaches having erosion rates less than 11.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), while models estimates varied widely for approaches that eroded at rates above 11.2 Mg ha(-1) year(-1). Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analyses revealed that only WEPP-Modified estimates were not significantly different from trapped sediment data (p >= 0.107). While WEPP-Modified ranked best for most model performance metrics, the time, effort, modeling expertise, and uncertainty associated with model results may discourage the use of WEPP as a forest management tool. WEPP is better suited for researchers and government agencies that have the capability to measure extensive parameter data. Additional sensitivity analysis is needed to expand default parameters for forest roads within the WEPP and USLE models.

EFFECTS OF BIOCHAR TREATMENT OF MUNICIPAL BIOSOLIDS AND HORSE MANURE ON QUALITY OF RUNOFF FROM FESCUE PLOTS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Land-applied horse manure and municipal biosolids can increase nutrient and bacteria concentrations in runoff. Biochar has been demonstrated to have beneficial impacts on nutrient retention and runoff quality when used to treat other land-applied organic soil amendments (e.g., poultry manure). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of biochar addition to horse manure and municipal biosolids on runoff concentrations of nutrients and fecal coliforms. Biochar was added at 5% to 8% (wet basis) to horse manure and biosolids that were applied to 2.4 m x 6.1 m fescue plots followed by application of simulated rainfall (102 mm h(-1)). Analysis of runoff samples indicated that soil hydraulic characteristics, as reflected in the runoff curve number (CN), were a significant covariate for some analytical parameters. Analysis of covariance indicated that biochar addition decreased runoff concentrations of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) when added to municipal biosolids, with all effects more prominent at higher CN values. When added to horse manure, biochar decreased runoff concentrations of NH3-N, total suspended solids, and fecal coliforms. Although runoff concentrations of total P and TKN increased with CN, there was no significant biochar effect on these parameters when added to horse manure. The findings indicate potential for biochar addition to improve runoff quality when added to these organic amendments, but the effects may be dependent on the receiving soil's runoff production characteristics.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	2					409	417		10.13031/trans.11891								WOS:000400680100017

DEVELOPMENT OF FIELD-SCALE LYSIMETERS TO ASSESS MANAGEMENT IMPACTS ON RUNOFF	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Most empirical studies of field management effects on runoff water quality rely on edge-of-field monitoring, which is generally unreplicated and prone to high variances, or small plots, which constrain the use of conventional farm equipment and can hinder insight into landscape processes that drive hydrology. We sought to develop field-scale lysimeters that were sufficiently large to support assessment of landscape processes but also replicated to allow quantitative comparisons of hydrologic processes. A hillslope underlain by limestone bedrock with a recent history of hydrologic observation was selected in central Pennsylvania. Twelve 15 m x 27 m plots were established and defined by earthen berms on all sides to isolate and collect overland flow, along with tile drains to collect shallow lateral flow. Over three years, considerable variability in site hydrology was observed between lysimeters, highlighting differences in the extent of hydrologic isolation of some lysimeters as well as in flows that potentially bypassed our collection infrastructure. Even so, clear patterns were observed in surface and subsurface flow that enabled grouping of plots based on hydrologic similarities. Results illustrate the experimental opportunities and limitations of developing field-scale lysimeters for agronomic inference.

EFFECTS OF MANURE STORAGE ADDITIVES ON MANURE COMPOSITION AND GREENHOUSE GAS AND AMMONIA EMISSIONS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Storage of dairy manure slurry allows flexibility in the timing of land application of manure to reduce environmental impacts related to water quality. However, manure storage can increase greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia (NH3) emissions and cause operational issues due to the buildup of slurry solids. To combat these negative consequences, stored manure was treated with manure additives, i.e., More than Manure (MTM), Pro-Act Biotech (Pro-Act), and biochar, to quantify their effects on manure solids, nitrogen losses, and GHG emissions in two separate trails. Gaseous emissions were studied over a 48-day manure storage period with treatments of MTM, Pro-Act, aeration and Pro-Act, aeration alone, and biochar. Manure characteristics were further examined in a 28-day manure storage study with treatments of MTM at the supplier-recommended rate, MTM at 25x the recommended rate, aeration and Pro-Act at the supplier-recommended rate, aeration and Pro-Act at 10. the recommended rate, aeration alone, and two additional Pro-Act treatments without aeration, one at the recommended rate and one at 10x that rate. Biochar was the only manure treatment to impact manure characteristics, with significantly more ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) on day 14 than the control (p < 0.012) in the manure composition study. Biochar did not reduce NH3 emissions from the control, likely due to the 10 cm natural crust on the control. MTM increased CO2 emissions, with significantly higher emissions on days 7 and 14 during the gaseous emissions study. Overall, no treatments were able to reduce manure solids or nitrogen emissions for these manure storage conditions.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	2					449	456		10.13031/trans.12066								WOS:000400680100020

Removal of Suspended Solids in Anaerobically Digested Slurries of Livestock and Poultry Manure by Coagulation Using Different Dosages of Polyaluminum Chloride	2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (CEESD 2016)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				International Conference on Environmental Engineering and Sustainable Development (CEESD)	DEC 09-11, 2016	Sanya, PEOPLES R CHINA					In this study, anaerobically digested slurries of livestock and poultry manure were pretreated by coagulation-sedimentation using an inorganic polymer coagulant, polyaluminum chloride (PAC). The effect of different PAC dosages on suspended solids (SS) removal and pH in the biogas slurries was assessed to provide reference values for reducing the organic load of biogas slurry in the coagulation-sedimentation process and explore the feasibility of reducing the difficulty in subsequent utilization or processing of biogas slurry. The results showed that for the pig slurry containing approximately 5000 mg/L SS, the removal rate of SS reached up to 81.6% with the coagulant dosage of 0.28 g/L PAC. For the chicken slurry containing approximately 2600 mg/L SS, the removal rate of SS was 30.2% with the coagulant dosage of 0.33 g/L PAC. The removal rate of SS in both slurries of livestock and poultry manure exhibited a downward trend with high PAC dosage. Therefore, there is a need to control the PAC dosage in practical use. The pH changed little in the two types of biogas slurries after treatment with different PAC dosages and both were in line with the standard values specified in the "Standards for Irrigation Water Quality".																	1755-1307						2017	51								UNSP 012008	10.1088/1755-1315/51/1/012008								WOS:000399175800008

In order to solve the problem of water resources restricted by varieties of factors, this paper establishes a water resources evaluation index model (WREI), which adopts the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) algorithm. After considering influencing factors of water resources, we ignore secondary factors and then hierarchical approach the main factors according to the class, set up a three-layer structure. The top floor is for WREI. Using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine weight first, and then use fuzzy judgment to judge target, so the comprehensive use of the two algorithms reduce the subjective influence of AHP and overcome the disadvantages of multi-level evaluation. To prove the model, we choose India as a target region. On the basis of water resources evaluation index model, we use Matlab and combine grey prediction with linear prediction to discuss the ability to provide clean water in India and the trend of India's water resources changing in the next 15 years. The model with theoretical support and practical significance will be of great help to provide reliable data support and reference for us to get plans to improve water quality.																	1755-1307						2017	51								UNSP 012017	10.1088/1755-1315/51/1/012017								WOS:000399175800017

The water area in cites decreased sharply, and some rivers were cut off because of estate development, which brings the problems of urban flooding, flow stagnation and water deterioration. The approach aims to enhance flood control capability and improve the urban river water quality by planning gate-pump stations surrounding the cities and optimizing the locations and functions of the pumps, sluice gates, weirs in the urban river network. These gate-pump stations together with the sluice gates and weirs guarantee the ability to control the water level in the rivers and creating hydraulic gradient artificially according to mathematical model. Therefore the flow velocity increases, which increases the rate of water exchange, the DO concentration and water body self-purification ability. By site survey and prototype measurement, the river problems are evaluated and basic data are collected. The hydrodynamic model of the river network is established and calibrated to simulate the scenarios. The schemes of water quality improvement, including optimizing layout of the water distribution projects, improvement of the flow discharge in the river network and planning the drainage capacity are decided by comprehensive Analysis. Finally the paper introduces the case study of the approach in Changshu City, where the approach is successfully implemented.																	1755-1307						2017	51								UNSP 012029	10.1088/1755-1315/51/1/012029								WOS:000399175800029

One of the reason is the high mortality of the catfish infected by Aeromonas hydrophila and Saprolegnia sp. Motile Aeromonas septicemia (MAS) is a common bacterial disease, caused by Aeromonas hydrophila, which affects freshwater fish. In Southeast Asia, the outbreak of this disease was firstly reported from West Java in 1980, when a total of 82.5 tons a month of catfish were lost, while in Central Java in 1984, the total loss was 1.6 tons. Saprolegniosis can cause economic loss due to high mortality from its case reaching 10% to 50%. This research aimed to identify and determine the percentage of A. hydrophila and Saprolegnia sp. the catfish farmed in bozem Moro Krembangan, Surabaya, East Java. Meanwhile, a supporting parameter in this research is the value of water quality parameter including pH, temperature, ammonia and dissolved oxygen that were measured during sampling. The results showed that of the 20 samples taken from the two cages, 19 fish were positively infected by A. drophila. percentage of infections of A. hydrophila that infect umbo catfish in Moro Krembangan, was 95%, while the percentage Saprolegnia sp. was 90%.																	1755-1307						2017	55								UNSP 012038									WOS:000400161100038

This research aims to measure the efficacy of ozon and chitosan usage in prawn larvae rearing, and to measure the survial rate of prawn larvae during the rearing stage. The study was carried out using experimental method in laboratory, with factorial research design using 3 treatment combinations and 1 control groups. The chitosan dose administered in this research was 25 ml in 25 L of sea water, euating to 10 ppm. The dissolved ozon in this research was measured at the concentration of 8.245 - 13.748 ppm. Weekly measurement of water quality in terms of temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen and dissolved ozon were carried out throughout the course of the research. Total microbial population in the water was measured by means of Total Plate Count ( TPC) methiod in the Institute for Natural Medicines of Diponegoro University. Statistics figure from "ANOVA" test suggested that the application of ozon and the introduction of chitosan in prawn larvae rearing media gave impact to the microbial population in the media. Results of BNT test showed that there was a significant difference between the measurement results of the 3 treatment combination groups and that of the control group. The highest prawn larvae survival rate was found in the media with combined ozon and chitosan treatment, which was recorded at 100%. The second highest survival rate was recorded in the treatement combination group of ozon and chitosan with 80%, and the lowest survival rate was attributed to the control group with 20% prawn larvae survival rate. It is concluded that treatment combination of 10 ppm chitosan and 8.245 - 13.748 ppm of ozon showed significantly positive results in its application in giant tiger prawn farming media.																	1755-1307						2017	55								UNSP 012070	10.1088/1755-1315/55/1/012070								WOS:000400161100070

To reduce the time to get an acceptably clean water using the common water filtration, this paper will discuss on a solution to increase the filtration effectiveness of the filter elements by irradiating gossypium (or commonly known as cotton), and silica oxide which is the main composition material for sand and gravel from various scale based on the Wentworth scale. There were few studies regarding gamma and neutron irradiation of silica based materials that proves that gamma and neutron irradiation introduce defects, hence, we expect that it may lead to the formation of micropores and alter the water filtration effectiveness. It was established that higher amount of irradiation results in higher concentration of defects. This paper will firstly review literatures on the effect of gamma and neutron irradiation effect on filter elements such as sands and papers, and then develops a water quality index (WQI) that reflects the water appearance quality of the filtrated water. The WQI focuses on the physical appearance such as smells and color of the filtered water.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1467-9				2017	1799								UNSP 040010	10.1063/1.4972934								WOS:000399200500035

The data on water quality were obtained from Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) for two cities of Pakistanone representing industrial environment (Sialkot) and the other one representing non-industrial environment (Narowal). To classify data on water quality, three statistical tools were employedthe Decision Tree methodology using Gini Index, LR, and LDAusing R software library. The results obtained by the said three techniques were compared using misclassification rates (a model with minimum value of misclassification rate is better). It was witnessed that LR performed well than the other two techniques while the Decision trees and LDA performed equally well. But for illustration purposes decision trees technique is comparatively easy to draw and interpret.				khan, khushnoor/I-1591-2012; Aslam, Muhammad/E-6354-2015	Aslam, Muhammad/0000-0003-0644-1950												0361-0918	1532-4141					2017	46	4					2924	2934		10.1080/03610918.2015.1066807								WOS:000400186200027

The effects of DO concentration and pyridine loading on the system removal efficiency were investigated. Results showed that the optimal DO concentration and pyridine loading were 3.5 mg/L and 0.5 kg COD/(m(3).d), respectively. Under operating conditions, pyridine removal rate by biodegradation could reach 80.89%. GC-MS analyser was used to determine the water quality of effluent, and the main intermediate products of biodegradation were 2-pentanone, 3-pentanone, methylbutyrate and dimethylformamide. As revealed by the DGGE results, the degradation of pyridine in the SBBR system was a synergistic effect of different kinds of microorganisms, including various dominant bacteria existing in a system. The main dominant microorganisms were Shinella zoogloeoides and Acidovorax caeni, as suggested by the results of DNA sequencing of the V3 region.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	3					1858	1864										WOS:000399966600002

As important indicator species, diatoms are widely used to explain past environment changes. The aims of this study were to describe the succession of the sediment diatom community in the large arid Bosten Lake and to discuss the responses of the diatoms to human activities and climate change over recent history. Sediment diatom analysis was applied to short core sediment samples extracted from the river mouth and the deep centre of Bosten Lake. The diatom assemblages were dominated by Cyclotella praetermissa, Fragilaria crotonensis and small fragilarioid and periphytic taxa. These diatom taxa are interpreted as being sensitive to changes in the water level and trophic status in the water column, which are probably related to the climate and human activities. The high percentage of Cyclotella praetermissa suggests that the water level was higher prior to the 1860s. From the 1860s to the 1950s, Aulacoseira alpigena appeared in the profundal zone, which indicates that spring winds may have been stronger. The high percentage of Navicula oblonga in the river mouth zone revealed that the lake might have been slightly brackish. From the 1950s to the early 1980s, the percentage of planktonic diatoms decreased, and F. crotonensis appeared, which indicates that the water level was lower and that human activity had increased. From the 1980s to the end of the 20th century, the population, land cultivation, and fish production all increased, resulting in changes in salinity and a rapid decline in water levels. During this period, the diatoms at the river mouth of the Kaidu River were dominated by benthic species, and the deepest site of the lake was dominated by F. crotonensis. Since the 20th century, F. crotonensis has been dominant as the water level has increased and the trophic status has changed in the lake. Environmental changes in the Bosten Lake catchment affected the diatom assemblage in the profundal zone much earlier than in the river mouth zone. The patchiness of the diatom distribution within the lake macroenvironment indicates the influence of microenvironments on diatom community structure. Over the last several decades, human activities may have caused the ecosystem of Bosten Lake to exceed a threshold and collapse into a new state.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	3					2104	2113										WOS:000399966600032

Koi fish have a diversity of types differentiated based on the body colour groups, such as one colour pattern, two colour patterns, three colours patterns and even more. Each colour characteristic of the koi have different handling, particularly in the handling of water quality, this is because the colour pigments in the body was affected by the composition of water quality include temperature, pH, TDS, do and salinity. The data of koi fish used were sanke, sowa, kohaku, shiro, yamabuki, ogon and chagoi. The aim of this study is to make an application to inform the condition of the pool water quality that can help breeders to know the water quality that will improve the handling strategies through water media. Tsukamoto Fuzzy method used to produce the three outputs namely water quality, water grade, and water conditions. The output of water quality consists of four categories, namely optimal, moderate, poor, and very poor. The output of water grade consists of grade A to D, while the output of water conditions consist of an excellent, good, bad, and very bad. Input to the application consists of five parameters, namely water temperature, pH, TDS, do and salinity.																	1757-8981						2017	166								UNSP 012018	10.1088/1757-899X/166/1/012018								WOS:000399754000018

In this study, 20 large (similar to 3.2m(3)), replicated enclosures were used to investigate the effects of piscivorous Australian bass (Macquaria novemaculeata), planktivorous gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki (Girard)), benthivorous carp (Cyprinus carpio), and macrophyte removal on water quality, as well as trophic interactions within the enclosures. Fish effects on reservoir water quality were carp > gambusia > bass. Cryptomonads spp. (54,083 cells/mL) and Anabaena spp. (47,983 cells/mL) increased significantly (63 and 23 fold, respectively) in carp enclosures, possibly because of physiological adaptation to low light, high turbidity, total phosphorus concentrations (TP) and low TN: TP ratios (N-limitation); a consequence of carp benthic grazing. Carp and gambusia caused an unconventional shift from smaller to medium sized zooplankton (e.g. Boeckella sp., Bosmina meridionalis), possibly a result of copepod nauplius grazing. In the subtropical system studied, fish-induced" nutrient recycling appears more important to the outcome of bio-manipulation than grazing impacts. Macrophyte harvesting unexpectedly decreased phytoplankton biomass linked to declines in Euglenophyta and diatoms (Asterionella spp.). Cyanophyta (Oscillatoriales spp./Anabaena spp.) increased in response to macrophyte harvesting and was consistent with findings on European lakes that Cyanophyta abundance tends to be higher in the absence of macrophytes. Results indicate exotic fish removal, nutrient loading control and macrophyte conservation is important in these aquatic systems to maintain high water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

The purpose of this study was to identify and characterise the main environmental gradients and trophic state that prevail in the soda pans (n = 84) of the Carpathian Basin in Central Europe. Underwater light conditions, dissolved organic matter, phosphorus and chlorophyll a were investigated in 84 pans during 2009-2010. Besides, water temperature was measured hourly with an automatic sensor throughout one year in a selected pan. The pans were very shallow (median depth: 15 cm), and their extremely high turbidity (Secchi depth median: 3 cm, min: 0.5 cm) was caused by high concentrations of inorganic suspended solids (median: 0.4 g L-1, max: 16 g L-1), which was the dominant (>50%) contributing factor to the vertical attenuation coefficient in 67 pans (80%). All pans were polyhumic (median DOC: 47 mg L-1), and total phosphorus concentration was also extremely high (median: 2 mg L-1, max: 32 mg L-1). The daily water temperature maximum (44 degrees C) and fluctuation maximum (28 degrees C) were extremely high during summertime. The combination of environmental boundaries: shallowness, daily water temperature fluctuation, intermittent hydroperiod, high turbidity, polyhumic organic carbon concentration, high alkalinity and hypertrophy represent a unique extreme aquatic ecosystem.

They provide information regarding organic matter processing, habitat condition and trophic dynamics. In tropical rivers with pronounced wet and dry seasons, macroinvertebrate based ecological monitoring tools are explicitly focused on metrics and indices, while ignoring interactions of FFG5. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the functional feeding type metrics, diversity indices and feeding interactions among FFG5 of macroinvertebrates along the water pollution gradient in Gilgel Gibe watershed, Ethiopia. Water quality parameters and macroinvertebrate community attributes were assessed for samples collected from upstream sites (15 sites), urban-impacted stretches (12 sites) and wetland-affected river zones (7 sites) of the watershed during the rainy (July) and dry (February) seasons. To understand the effect of pollution on the feeding interactions, stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were analyzed. Macroinvertebrate-based diversity indices and functional feeding type metric showed deterioration of ecological integrity at the urban-impacted sites and substantial recovery in the wetland-affected downstream sites. Omnivorous feeding behavior of macroinvertebrates was noted for the upstream sites, whereas clear trophic guilds of FFG5 were suggested for the wetland-affected river zones by the stable isotope results. The results of pollution gradient analysis and feeding interactions among FFGs revealed that the urban-impacted sites showed weaker interactions when compared to upstream and wetland influenced sites. This affirms the potential importance of feeding interactions among FFGs of macroinvertebrates in water quality monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

The lake faces multiple pressures from the unplanned urbanization, high population growth, nutrient load from intensive agriculture and tourism. The data showed that the lake has shrunk from 31 km(2) in 1859-24 km(2) in 2013. Significant changes were observed in the land use and land cover (LULC) within the lake (1859-2013) and in the vicinity of the lake (1962-2013). Analysis of the"demographic data indicates that the human population within the lake has shown more than double the national growth rate. Additionally, 7 important water quality parameters from 82 well distributed sites across the lake were analyzed and compared with the past data to determine the historical changes in the water quality from 1971 to 2014. The changes in the LULC and demography have adversely affected the pollution status of this pristine lake. Ortho-phosphate phosphorous concentration has increased from 16.75 mu g L-1 in 1977-45.78. g L-1 in 2014 and that of the nitrate-nitrogen from 36511g L-1 to 557 pg L-1, indicating nutrient enrichment of the lake over the years. Built-up area within the lake has increased 40 times since 1859, which, together with the changes in the population and settlements, have led to the high discharge of untreated nutrient-rich sewage into the lake. Similarly the expansion of floating gardens within the lake and agriculture lands in the catchment has contributed to the increased nutrient load into the lake due to the increasing use of fertilizers. The information about the existing land cover, demography and water quality was integrated and analyzed in GIS environment to identify the trophic status of the lake. The analysis indicated that 32% of the lake falls under sever degradation, 48% under medium degradation while as 20% of the lake waters are relatively clean. It is believed that the results provide improved knowledge and insights about the lake health and causal factors of its degradation necessary for effectively restoring its ecological and hydrological functionality.

Estuarine characteristics, water quality and heavy metal contamination as determinants of fish species composition in intermittently open estuaries	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Estuaries are critical aquatic environments that are used by many fish during their life cycle. However, estuaries often suffer from poor water quality as a result of anthropogenic activities. Fish diversity studies in estuaries are common, although few have examined whether correlations exist between water quality, metal contamination and fish assemblages. In the present study we investigated the effect of abiotic conditions, heavy metals and estuary characteristics on the abundance, diversity and composition of fish in four intermittently open estuaries along the Illawarra coast of south-eastern Australia. The heterogeneity of environmental conditions was reflected in the fish assemblages in each estuary. Environmental variables predicted fish species composition, and estuaries in particularly poor condition contained few species (estuarine residents) in high abundance, indicating their ability to acclimatise and survive in conditions that are hostile to other species. Overall, these findings demonstrate that estuarine fish assemblages may be useful indicators of estuary condition and reveal the importance of managing anthropogenic activities in the surrounding catchment to improve water quality so that biodiversity of fish can be restored in these estuarine environments.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	5					941	953		10.1071/MF15409								WOS:000400184800014

Different dynamics were found among phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zoobenthos in terms of density, biomass, and biodiversity. On an annual time scale and with deterioration of water quality, density and biomass of plankton and zoobenthos showed different variations, while phytoplankton (density, biomass, and biodiversity) changed significantly when water quality improved. On a seasonal time scale, density and biomass of phytoplankton showed significant differences between spring and summer. Results of Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that phytoplankton, zooplankton, and zoobenthos were significantly affected by different environmental factors. Our study demonstrated that phytoplankton was more sensitive to water quality changes than zooplankton and zoobenthos. These results suggest that density and biomass of phytoplankton could rapidly reflect water quality, whereas biodiversity of phytoplankton could indicate long-term status of water quality combined with the physico-chemical parameters of water. The results could contribute to predicting the dynamics of plankton and zoobenthos in freshwater lakei and to selecting effective bio-indicators for ecosystem health assessment of freshwater lakes.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	2					755	764		10.15244/pjoes/66713								WOS:000399967900029

Despite a generally high level of drinking water safety, contamination events do occur. We address the question whether demographic change may cause a spatial mismatch between installed capacities at the supply side and actual demand by water users, thereby increasing risks of microbiological contamination. Our investigation is based on a quantitative analysis using the largest publically available data-set on drinking water quality in Germany. We found that the number of reported contamination events in areas affected by population decrease was about twice as high as in areas with a stable or growing population. The relative frequency of microbiological contamination was found to be significantly correlated with rapidly depopulating areas. We conclude that in regions with negative population development, a statistically higher risk of microbiological drinking water contamination may coincide with a greater risk of recontamination during a longer passage in the distribution network.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	6					621	629		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1240809								WOS:000399647000007

Electronic databases were used to establish an order of prevalence by establishing quartiles (Q-citation frequency) for the PF identified. The results show that the eleven PF can most likely be classified into three categories: climatic-anthropogenic-morphometric. The studies most frequently referenced land use (Q1), rainfall (Q2), particle size (Q2) and vehicles (Q3) as key PF. There is a similar behaviour between the concentrations of Zn-Pb-Cu associated with the RDS in dry weather and the dissolved fraction washed from the surface in road runoff. The size fraction <250 mu m is representative of RDS to characterize the metals. The review expands knowledge about the influences of the PF in the processes of deposition-suspension-interception-removal of the metals load in road environments.

These difficulties are exacerbated by confounding the crafting of policy instruments to change resource use (a behavioral matter related to resource management) with the consequential issue of who bears the cost of changing resource use (an equity matter). The confounding of behavioral and equity issues is not surprising because equity is commonly suggested as a criterion in the literature on policy instrument choice, and inequity in access to resources may also be one of the initial drivers of policy intervention. Here, we restate the microeconomic analysis of "open access" resources and highlight the fundamental difference between efficiency (including allocative inefficiency) and equity that emerges from that analysis. We then discuss the implications of this difference for the choice of policy instruments to resolve problems in natural resource management, at least for instruments that entail changing the behavior of primary producers. This discussion is centered on three key decisions for formulating policy: (1) choosing the preferred portfolio of uses for a natural resource, (2) choosing a policy instrument to change that portfolio, and (3) choosing a mechanism to distribute the costs of change fairly. To illustrate how these decisions may play out in a real-world example, we apply the decisions to a freshwater policy process in New Zealand. By articulating the distinction, microeconomics draws distinctions between efficiency and equity as policy objectives. Linking that distinction with the Tinbergen's principle regarding the matching of instruments to objectives, we aim to reduce the conflation of the decision-making criteria employed in policy formulation decisions. In doing so, we hope to assist policy makers to avoid policy failure by reducing the potential for the influence of self-interested parties, or concern about their welfare, to introduce process failures into the policy formulation and decision-making stages of the policy cycle.																	1708-3087						2017	22	1							50	10.5751/ES-09133-220150								WOS:000399397700049

Biofuels production costs can vary widely by feedstock, conversion process, scale of production, and region. Microalgae will become the most important biofuel source in the near future. Microalgae are unique photosynthetic organisms given that they accumulate storage lipids in substantial quantities and thrive in high-salinity water. Photosynthetic growth requires light, carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and inorganic salts. Temperature must remain generally within 20-30 degrees C. During photosynthesis, algae use solar energy to fix CO2 into algal biomass, so the water used to cultivate algae must be enriched with CO2. Microalgae can potentially be employed for the production of biofuels in an economically effective and environmentally sustainable manner.																	1556-7249	1556-7257					2017	12	5					395	401		10.1080/15567249.2015.1057655								WOS:000399601200001

Evaluation of water quality with application of Bayes' rule and entropy weight method	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CIVIL ENGINEERING												The quality of water of the river has a significant impact on human population and livestock in basin area. Six water quality indicators are monitored from the gauging stations of Brahmani River to assess the changing trends in the quality of water. The conventional Aggregative Index Evaluation method is applied to know the overall water quality index for its intended use. Further, in this study, Bayes' rule is applied for comprehensive assessment. The likelihood estimates are obtained from the normal distribution and is pre-owned for posterior probability calculation through Bayes' rule. Finally, the indicator weights are estimated by Shannon's entropy weight method. The consequences of analysis specified that the indicator, CODMn, is affecting the quality of water more in Panposh downstream. Biological oxygen demand, TA as CaCO3, NH4-N and Nitrate-N are closely related to domestic pollution and agricultural non-point source pollution. The overall quality of water is improved during dry seasons than during wet seasons due to the dilution of pollutants. Comprehensive evaluation indicates that the water is acceptable for second grade surface source protection zones for centralised drinking water.

Based on a three-level framework of stakeholder analysis - identification, investigation and communication, the study aims to develop an understanding of stakeholders' characteristics, examine social network functions, and make recommendations for Chinese FDI in Pakistan for reducing environmental and social challenges and for seizing the opportunities noted by stakeholders in particular. Results suggest that stakeholders have a positive attitude towards Chinese FDI in Pakistan. Air quality and water consumption were identified as the top two challenges on Chinese FDI. Generally speaking, opportunities of investment were seen to be more important than challenges, such as increasing energy reserves, water quality improvement and social-economic development. Based on the results, it is suggested that SEA can help to generate a win-win strategy for both countries.

Actually, the relevant technology is backward with limited research and investment. Though the device companies have achieved some results in the study on the water quality monitoring, pipeline monitoring and sewage disposal, this technological progress on the whole is still much slow, and the mature product has not been formed. As a result, the market urges a demand of a new type of device which is more suitable for environmental protection on the basis of robot successfully applied in other fields. This paper designs and realizes a tracked mobile robot of air quality monitoring, which can be used to monitor air quality for the pollution accident in industrial parks and regular management.																	1755-1307						2017	52								UNSP 012089	10.1088/1755-1315/52/1/012089								WOS:000399396500089

Water samples were collected and analysed for important physico-chemical quality parameters following standard procedures. The result showed that Lake Basaka water is highly saline and alkaline and experiencing a general reducing trends in ionic concentrations of quality parameters due to the dilution effect. About 10-fold reduction of total ionic concentration occurred in the Lake over the period of 2 decades (1960-1980). There was a sharp and fast decline in EC, Cl, SO4, Na, and K ions from early 1960s up to the late 1980s, and then became relatively stable. Some ions (eg. Na, Ca, Mg, Cl, SO4) are showing increment in recent years. This characteristics of the lake water is terrible in relation to its potential to inundate the nearby areas in the near future. The expansion of such quality water has negative effects on the water resources of the region, especially soil quality, drainage and groundwater, in terms of salinity, sodicity and specific ion toxicity. The regimes of soil moisture, solute and groundwater could be affected, concurrently affecting the productivity and sustainability of the sugar estate. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify the potential sources of water and chemicals to the lake and devise an appropriate mitigation and/or remedial measures.																	1755-1307						2017	52								UNSP 012057	10.1088/1755-1315/52/1/012057								WOS:000399396500057

To analyze and predict the water environment, the hydrodynamics behaviors and water pollution situations of the water body must be analyzed first based on hydrodynamics and water quality models. The objective of this work is to introduce how to establish river water dynamics and water quality model through the environment in the basin pollutant migration transformation rule, to simulate the rules and dynamics of river water pollution situation, to introduce the water quality model with geographic information system (GIS), and to apply the combination of environment numerical simulation to basin pollutant migration problem.																	1755-1307						2017	52								UNSP 012068	10.1088/1755-1315/52/1/012068								WOS:000399396500068

The unstructured triangular grid is adopted to locally refine the mesh around sewage outlet or in high-gradient regions of terrain change for the coupling model. The finite volume method is applied to ensure the conservation of mass for each element. This hydrodynamic model applies the Roe solver approximate Riemann solution with second-order accuracy to compute the water momentum flux on the grid interface. Taking Dalian Bay as the research object, the numerical model established is used to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics and pollutant transport process. The computed results of the tide level, flow current and flow direction agree well with the measured data in Dalian Bay. The spatial and temporal distribution of pollutant in water are analyzed and discussed in this study. Simulated results show that the two-dimensional hydrodynamic and pollutant transport model can accurately simulate the mass transport in coastal waters, and it can provide a scientific basis on coastal water environment protection for the research water.																	1755-1307						2017	52								UNSP 012094	10.1088/1755-1315/52/1/012094								WOS:000399396500094

Due to their associated ecological risk, the presence in water environment has attracted broad attention to public. Here 4 most common metals including copper (Cu), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) were determined in surface water along the Qinhuangdao coastal areas, China. And their ecological risk was assessed using species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method. Total 12 stations were designed near the main estuary in the study area. The results showed that the concentrations of Cu, Pb, Cd and Zn of surface water were in the range of 847.81-1602.81 mu g/L, 0.42-1.59 mu g/L, 1.82-7.99 mu g/L and 26.9 -59.36 mu g/L, respectively. According to the National Seawater Quality Standard of China (GB3097-1997), Cu concentration in each station was much higher than the standard value of. level (50 mu g/L), thus Cu could not even met the lowest level of water quality. In contrast, Pb met the. or. level of water quality, Cd and Zn met the. or. level. The HC5 (hazardous concentration for 5% of species) of each metal was obtained from their corresponding SSD curve. In case of Cu and Zn, the concentration at all sites exceeded their HC5 values, suggesting both of them had adverse effect on the aquatic organism, especially Cu. While Pb concentration at all sites was much lower than its HC5 value, thus Pb had no negative effect on aquatic life. In case of Cd, the concentration at 5 sites was higher than its HC5 value, and the other 7 sites was lower than its HC5 value, suggesting that adverse effect only occur at partial region in the study area. The RQ (risk quotient) value of Cu varied between 1355.41 and 2621.28, far larger than 1, indicating that 100% of sites had a much higher risk. The RQ of Zn varied between 6.06 and 13.88 (>1) indicating that Zn had a high risk in the study area. In case of Cd, the RQ ranged from 0.94 to 4.41 and about 92% of sites were larger than 1, suggesting that Cd had a high risk in these regions, while 8% of sites (0.1<RQ<1) had a medium risk. In case of Pb, the RQ ranged from 0.04 to 0.13 and about 92% of sites (<0.1) had a low risk in these regions and about 8% of sites (0.1<RQ< 1) had a medium risk. The results indicated that the ecological risk was in the following: Cu>Zn>Cd>Pb. The Cu pollution level extremely high during this investigation, and a much higher ecological risk could already occur, thus Cu should be paid more attentions. Meanwhile, both Zn and Cd also were important contaminations in the study area.																	1755-1307						2017	52								UNSP 012084	10.1088/1755-1315/52/1/012084								WOS:000399396500084

However, whether or not such kind of water pollution is mainly caused by foreign trade is questionable. And, how the trade mode will be changed by pollution and corresponding regulation is also uncertain. In this paper, a fully endogenous model, which integrate economic growth, energy use and pollution, is designed to interpret the interrelation among these key variables in South China. Through this model, a new possibility of water environment Kuznets curve change has been investigated. Attribute to mixed two stage feasible general least square estimation method, we conclude that foreign trade has strong influence on environment change rate and the turning point. It can make the virtuous circle of between economic growth and environment improvement come early or later in different circumstances. Export and import play different role in such process and have counter effects on environment.																	1755-1307						2017	52								UNSP 012074	10.1088/1755-1315/52/1/012074								WOS:000399396500074

In 2012-2013, EM was applied in Muchawka Reservoir situated in the town of Siedlce (eastern Poland). Analyses of water parameters and bottom sediments were carried out, in 2011, before the EM technology was implemented and again in 2013-2015 after the EM application was completed. In spring 2011, the average total nitrogen (TN) content at the surface was 3.1 mg dm(-3) while the total mineral nitrogen content equalled 0.893 mg dm(-3). After the EM application was completed, in the summer of 2013, the TN content was on average 2.5 mg dm(-3). The content of nitrates and nitrites in the summer of 2013 reached 1.20 mg dm(-3) at the most. Lower levels of such forms of nitrogen were observed in 2013 and also in subsequent years at the bathing beach (site 1) and the hostel (site 3) than at the inflow (site 4). Likewise, the highest content of phosphates was recorded at the inflow site (4), being four-fold lower at the other sites (1, 3). The average content of TP before the EM technology was applied cc as 0.205 mg dm(-3), whereas after the application of effective microorganisms it fell down to 0.189 mg dm(-3) (2013-2015). Only slight changes of TSITP indicated that waters in Muchawka Reservoir were eutrophic. After EM was applied twice, no streaks, cyanobacterial scums or pollution at the bathing sites were visible. The bacteriological evaluation of the water samples was carried out by the County Branch of the State Sanitary Inspectorate in Siedlce. The bacteriological water quality was described as "excellent". These findings suggest that the method developed by SITNREK, combined with probiotic preparations, could be a useful tool in the restoration of water bodies, but the conclusion requires further detailed verification.

Our objective was to investigate the relationships between the measures of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and nutrient concentrations to assess water quality. The rivers' benthic macroinvertebrates were collected during different seasons in 2012. The biological and chemical parameters used in the current study identified them as quick indicators of water quality assessment. The total number of macroinvertebrate individuals (n = 15,006) (Osumi river: n = 5,546 organisms; Devolli river: n = 3,469 organisms; and Shkumbini river: n = 5,991 organisms), together with the EPT group (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera), showed that the water quality at the river stations during the above-mentioned period belonged to Classes II and III (fair water quality and good water quality, respectively). The classification of the water quality was also based on the nitrogen and total phosphorus contents. The pollution tolerance levels of macroinvertebrate taxa varied from the non-tolerating forms encountered in environments with low pollution levels to the tolerating forms that are typical of environments with considerable pollution levels.

Live Transport of Yellow Perch and Nile Tilapia in AQUI-S 20E (10% Eugenol) at High Loading Densities	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Fish transport costs are a substantial portion of the operational expenses for aquaculture facilities in the USA. Safely transporting higher loading densities of fish would benefit haulers by increasing efficiency and reducing costs, but research evaluating transport for individual species is generally lacking. In this study, Yellow Perch Perca flavescens and Nile Tilapia Oreochromis niloticus were transported for 6 h immersed in water containing AQUI-S 20E (10% eugenol) at fish loading densities of 240 g/L (2 lb/gal) for perch and 480 g/L (4 lb/gal) for tilapia. Survival was quantified for fish transported in AQUI-S 20E concentrations of (1) control or 0 mg/L of water, (2) 100 mg/L, or (3) 200 mg/L. Yellow Perch had 98-100% survival, and Nile Tilapia had 100% survival up to through 14 d after transport across all AQUI-S 20E levels, including the control. Eugenol concentrations decreased rapidly in transport tank water, and fish showed no signs of sedation by the end of transport. We conclude that live transport of Yellow Perch and Nile Tilapia at higher loading densities resulted in high survival regardless of the AQUI-S 20E concentrations we tested.

LAW IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA	NOTRE DAME LAW REVIEW												Thousands die each day from infections related to water, as evidenced in the ongoing crises of cholera in Haiti, Zika in the Western Hemisphere, and Legionnaires' Disease in Flint, Michigan. Yet water law focuses primarily on two agendas. First, the "Blue Agenda" aims to provide an equitable allocation of water to individuals and communities while encouraging sustainable water management. Second, the "Green Agenda" aims to efficiently protect water in the natural environment from pollution. These two agendas often ignore, and can be inconsistent with, the "Red Agenda." The Red Agenda addresses prevention of waterborne infections, like cholera, and the habitat of water-related disease vectors, like mosquitoes transmitting malaria. Additionally, the Red Agenda focuses on access to water for sanitation and hygiene, with implications for epidemics like Ebola. In simplified terms, the Blue Agenda is about water quantity, the Green Agenda about water quality, and the Red Agenda about water diseases. Laws made in pursuit of the Blue Agenda, like building a dam or irrigation system, can interfere with the Red Agenda by bringing mosquito habitat closer to human communities. And laws made in the pursuit of the Green Agenda, like prohibiting discharges of pesticides into a river, can interfere with the Red Agenda by preventing a response to a malaria outbreak. This Article is the first to introduce the Blue, Green, and Red framework for water law, and explains why these agendas often conflict with each other and how to more effectively integrate these agendas into water law.																	0745-3515					JAN	2017	92	3					1271	1321										WOS:000399512700006

The effect of acetolysis on desmids	PALYNOLOGY												Acetolysis, an oxidising technique common in palynological preparation, is beneficial for pollen analysts who employ it to remove unwanted' organic matter from peat and lake samples. Since this technique was introduced by G. Erdtman in 1934, however, several researches have noted concerns, such as the destruction of thin-walled pollen grains in addition to non-sporopollenin pollen components, and selective destruction of protoperidinioid dinoflagellate cysts. Desmids are conjugate green algae with a wide range of environmental preferences whose half-cells are known from sediments dating back to at least the Neogene (possibly as far back as the Devonian), and they have proven useful in modern and palaeolimnological studies (e.g. as indicators of nutrient loading, anthropogenic impact and drought). Desmids are rarely mentioned in palynological studies, however, except to illustrate fluvial transport to nearshore marine settings. A diverse desmid flora was found in samples processed without acetolysis from Smith's Bay in Lake Simcoe, and desmid and thecamoebian (testate amoeba) assemblage changes record eutrophication up-core. Very low concentrations of both desmids and Pediastrum, another group of algal non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP), record siltation and inhibition of photosynthesis attributed to two phases of land-clearing and agriculture (Wendat/Huron and Euro-Canadian). After acetolysis, the desmid abundance in the same residues drops significantly (between 36 and 100%, mean = 87%) and the assemblage is skewed towards the most robust Cosmarium spp. However, other low-relief NPP, like Pediastrum, may be easier to observe after acetolysis as they are not obscured by amorphous organic matter. Because of the observed detrimental impact acetolysis has on the desmid assemblage, recommendations include: (i) not acetolysing, as pollen and Pediastrum can be observed either way, or (ii) using a two-pronged approach where susceptible microfossils are observed pre-acetolysis and resistant ones observed post-acetolysis.																	0191-6122	1558-9188					2017	41	2					171	179		10.1080/01916122.2015.1113208								WOS:000399569900004

The results indicated that uptake was fast and kinetic uptake could be well fitted by a pseudo-second-order model. The uptake was strongly dependent on pH and independent of ionic strength. Namely, inner-sphere surface complexation was the main uptake mechanism. The presence of humic acid or fulvic acid enhanced the uptake at low pH values, while reduced at high pH. The Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Redushkevich (D-R) isotherm models were used to simulate the uptake. Thermodynamics indicated that the uptake was endothermic and spontaneous.																	0149-6395	1520-5754					2017	52	6					987	996		10.1080/01496395.2017.1281302								WOS:000399643200003

The geochemistry of hydraulic fracturing fluids	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					The inorganic geochemistry of hydraulic fracturing fluids is reviewed with new insights on the role of entrapped formation waters in unconventional shale gas and tight sand formations on the quality of flowback and produced waters that are extracted with hydrocarbons. The rapid increase of the salinity of flowback fluids during production, combined with geochemical and isotopic changes, indicate mixing of the highly saline formation water with the injected water. The salinity increase suggests that the volume of the injected water that is returned to the surface with the flowback water is much smaller than previous estimates, and thus the majority of the injected water is retained within the shale formations. The high salinity of the flowback and produced water is associated with high concentrations of halides, ammonium, metals, metalloids, and radium nuclides that pose environmental and human health risks upon the release of the hydraulic fracturing fluids to the environment.

The target shales of the Elko Formation are unique fresh-water hydrocarbon reservoirs with relatively dilute source water (8.5 g/L total dissolved solids [TDS]). Additionally, the Elko Formation is underlain by a freshwater carbonate aquifer (0.2-0.3 g/L TDS) that outcrops downgradient of the exploration area. The water quality and isotopic data were used to evaluate pre-hydraulic fracturing conditions in this undeveloped area. The same data were also collected for groundwater and surface-water sites about two months and one year after exploration hydraulic fracturing. No systematic differences in water chemistry were observed between pre- and post-hydraulic fracturing samples. Based on water chemistry of shallow groundwater, surface water, and from the production zone, the most useful constituents identified for monitoring for potential future incursion of reservoir-associated fluids into the near-surface environment are TDS (or electrical conductivity), chloride, propane, methanol, ethanol, and 2-butoxyethanol. Groundwater flow and transport models were developed to evaluate the potential movement of hydrocarbons and hydraulic fracturing fluids from the targeted zones, which are about 1800 to 3600 m beneath the land surface, to shallow groundwater (< 300 m below land surface). Model simulations indicate that hydraulic fracturing fluid remains contained within the target shales for at least 1,000 years for most development scenarios. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published B.V.

Bioassays took place with water samples before and after the treatment system and in the river, once treated water is discharged. Due to the high toxicity of the water collected at the mouth of the mine (before the treatment plant), the bioassay was designed and developed with respect to the exposed organism and the characteristics of the water. The results obtained in the screening experiment show the high efficiency of the treatment plant in terms of ecotoxicity, using Artemia sp. toxicity test. (C) 2017 The Authors.

In this context, a set of soil-column experiments were conducted aiming to replicate the conditions of infiltration basins using soil as a depuration media for wastewater quality increment previous to managed aquifer recharge. The results showed a decrease in a set of contaminants analysed, when comparing to the inflow concentrations, showing that retention and degradation are occurring inside the experimented soil. Ultimately a set of conclusions were achieved that allowed to define the composition of a reactive layer to be installed in real scale infiltration basins that will act as a complementary wastewater treatment method.

Impacts of climate change, climate variability and management on soil and water quality in wetlands of South Australia	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					Wetland systems worldwide have been influenced by anthropic change, such that finding a natural baseline is rare. The consequences for ecosystem biodiversity and resilience at landscape scale have been enormous. The compounding effects of climate change and variability, knowledge gaps in landscape connectivity and feedbacks make the task of managing wetlands as part of a larger landscape difficult. This paper presents a summary of the impacts of natural and anthropic factors on contaminant mobilisation in sulfidic wetland systems of Australia. It highlights the role of water-soil/sediment interactions, acid-neutralizing and buffering mechanisms, and the irreversibility of some changes during the drying and wetting of sub-aqueous wetland soils.

It is characterized by the scarcity of water resources including groundwater, which can be threatened by pollution. Therefore, degradation of water quality is growing because the human activity is increasing. The agricultural, urban and industrial activities have contributed in recent decades to increase the potential contamination of water resources. The aim of this project is to assess the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution in the PreSaharan zones (case of Tafilalet plain), so it will be an important tool for making decision in the water management sector. The method applied in this work is the DRASTIC method based on the integration of several hydrogeological parameters in a multicriteria analysis. The results of this study show that the moderate class of vulnerability is the most dominant; it represents 56% of the aquifer area, followed by low vulnerability class with 40%, and the high vulnerability don't exceed 4%, while the very low and very high vulnerability classes are not encountered in the area study.

Water quality and chemistry of the groundwater have been investigated by a systematic screening operation of tube wells in a locality in West Bengal (India). Groundwater is predominantly of Ca-HCO3-type and is occasionally enriched with Na and Cl- in shallow wells (15-20 m) which may be an indicator of local pollution source. The groundwater As distribution and their relationship with land-use characteristics suggest that As release is also influenced by local land use conditions (e.g., sanitation, surface water bodies and agricultural practices). The interconnectivity of these land use conditions with the aquifer underneath often facilitates As release creating heterogeneity in their distribution. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The environmental concerns related to hydraulic fracturing has been greatly attracted. One of most important environmental concerns is regional water quality which may be contaminated by produced waters through induced and natural fractures and wastewater discharge. At present, the baseline water quality must be firstly obtained to identify potential pollution of the activity and monitoring indicators should be studied for better environmental monitoring. We sampled shallow groundwater, produced waters, shale rock and soil in the Jiaoshiba shale-gas region, SW China and measurements have included water chemistry and isotopes. Preliminary results show that the present shallow karst groundwater quality is pretty good with the total dissolved solids (TDS) ranging from 129 to 343 mg/L and with water chemistry type of HCO3-Ca, However, some groundwaters have been polluted by agricultural activities. Produced waters have relatively high salinity with TDS ranging from 2 to 14 g/L. Laboratory experiment of fracturing liquid and shale rock interaction at simulated reservoir conditions shows that TDS in the flowback fluid increases 10 times and Ca2+, Na+, Cl- and SO42- make dominant contributions. The main geochemical reactions are inferred to be pyrite oxidation and the dissolution of calcite, dolomite and plagioclase, resulting in increases of major ions in the flowback fluid. The inorganic geochemical monitoring indicators for shale gas exploration of the Silurian Longmaxi formation has been determined. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. The Authors.

These mineral waters discharge with a temperature between 17 and 20 degrees C, show a very alkaline pH (up to 11.8), and have: Na-Cl/Ca-OH facies; dry residuum approximate to 200 mg/L; C-total < 3.0 mg/L; and extremely low Mg2+ and silica concentrations (< 0.3 and 6.5 mg/L, respectively). CH4 isotopic composition (-24.4 parts per thousand < delta C-13-CH4 < -14.0 parts per thousand and 285 parts per thousand < delta H-2-CH4 < -218 parts per thousand) falls in the range of typical abiotic gas. In the case of Cabeco de Vide mineral waters, the understanding of the resource will help to preserve the mineral water quality, creating public interest. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Health and environmental concerns cross society as well as research; water-quality questions are important issues, and those related to selenium are increasingly so. Many discussions focus on the permissible quantities and value of the standard for drinking water of 10 mu g.L-1, because the safety margin between nutritional requirements and toxic effects is complex to establish. Transdisciplinary approaches integrating current scientific issues to provide consistent answers to the multiple questions arising on Se origins, mechanisms and toxicity are needed. New approaches involve multi-scales studies of Se dynamics and transfer processes from host rock to groundwater and, through the soil and drinking water, to the human population and an evaluation of its effects from deficiency to excess. Finally, the measures required to achieve water standards or recover quality in water bodies should also be assessed to evaluate the solutions from the indirect human health, economic and environmental aspects.

The presence of calcite in fractures of local rocks maintains an alkaline pH in all the mass water. Oxygenation condition inside reservoir is almost constant. According to the bathymetry, the mass balance displays a variation of properties which are seasonally controlled by hydrological events. High loads of elements were detected in solution during dry season (November 2015): sulfates present a load of 11,378.65 tons, confirming that main inlets in the reservoir are mine drainages. The Arsenic has a similar behavior: a greater load in solution during dry season, with 9.85 tons compared with other periods (less or equal to 0.5 tons). The greatest loads of iron and manganese are present in rainy season (20.43 and 9.15 tons respectively). This suggests the existence of a mobilization of precipitated minerals on the channel that feeds the mass water and reach the bottom of the reservoir where reducing conditions are dominant, favoring their release to the aqueous phase. Oxygen concentration decreases by half between the seasons due to organic matter oxidation. This trend continued in November, because quantities in solution were very high. (C) 2017 The Authors.

This system is localized at south of Chiapas state, SE Mexico. It is considered one of most beauties landscapes of the country. Main importance is due to climatic and hydrological regulation of this region. However anthropic activities as deforestation and waste water spills begin to produce risky conditions to water quality. This work presents spatial and temporal variability of water quality considering the study of ten lagoons through three sampling periods. Two of these periods of field work, (april and september 2013) consider sampling of only one point at surface in each lagoon. A very extensive sampling was developed in august 2014 in ten lagoons. Results show that this karstic system can be divided in two groups of water quality. First group of lakes contains calcic-magnesic-bicarbonated-sulfated waters and second group contains calcic-magnesic-bicarbonated waters. At first group, is possible to identify impacts related to inlet of waters high in sulfates and chlorides, these solutes dilutes along two first lagoons. An independent flow system rich in sulfates, probably of groundwater that circulates deeply was identified. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Formation of waste-rock drainage water on massive sulfide deposits of the Urals (Russia)	15TH WATER-ROCK INTERACTION INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM, WRI-15	Procedia Earth and Planetary Science				15th Water-Rock Interaction International Symposium (WRI)	OCT 16-21, 2016	Evora, PORTUGAL					The waste-rock stockpiles of copper pyrite mines are enriched by sulphide minerals; therefore their dissolution is the reason for the acidic waters formation. Hydrochemical processes responsible for the water quality of the formed waste-rock stockpiles are studied using several sites of the Urals as the examples. Sulphide mineralization causes the sulfate composition of water, iron, aluminum and magnesium to prevail among the cations. The comparison of mine and waste-rock drainage composition shows that waste-rock waters are more mineralized: TDC is 3-5 times higher and the aluminum, iron, copper and zinc concentrations are 4-8 times higher. The composition of rocks forming mine drainage and waste rock drainage is similar, thus it can be hypothesized that the hydrogeochemical processes of mine drainage and of the waste-rock piles waters do not have significant differences. However, the degree of rock disintegration and a temperature gradient in dumps is higher, while the rate of water interchange is lower. The set of hydrodynamic, geomechanical and temperature factors promote the formation of more acidic mineralized waters of the dump body. Computer simulation (Visual MINTEQ ver. 3.0/3.1) has shown that with the rate of sulphides oxidation of 3.6.10(3) mol/hour, the sulphides mass in the dumps would produce acidic leach-water in several hundred years.

However, an emergente bacteria, Francisella noatunensis orientalis, extremely virulent, has been responsible for tilapia deaths in brazilian farms. The molecular diagnosis like real time PCR (qPCR) has contributed to Francisella's species identification involved in granulomatous disease in these fishs. Prevention measures should be applied in order to reduce the Francisella contamination risk in fish farms, thus ensuring the squad health, avoiding losses to producers. This study aims to inform about the situation of francisellosis in tilapias in brazilian aquaculture.																	1981-2965					JAN-MAR	2017	11	1					119	130										WOS:000398921000013

A good farmer pays attention to the weather	CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT												A key message of the 2014 US 3rd National Climate Assessment report is that climate change poses threats to agriculture and will require adaptation and mitigation by farmers. In the upper Midwest, the increase in total precipitation and a 37% increase in very heavy precipitation over the past 40 years are expected to continue and affect the productivity of corn-based cropping systems. The current situation and weather projections suggest that in the future, significant degradation of soil and water resources can be expected. While a number of adaptive management strategies have potential to address soil erosion, poor water quality, and production losses, farmer responses to a changing climate are not well understood. The research presented here examines how farmers' self-identity as "a good farmer" can translate into specific incremental and transformative adaptations of farming strategies. Analysis of a 2012 survey of 4778 upper Midwest farmers finds that three nodes in the identity control model, the biophysical situation, reflected appraisals comprised of a set of beliefs which are sources of information input, and a farmer's identities, influence variations in selected adaptive management practices. The biophysical situation (flooding, drought, saturated soils, and/or having a river run through the farm) are significant explanatory variables in seven of the eight models and farmer's identities, conservationist and/or productivist,are significant in all models. This is evidence that farmers are paying attention to the biophysical situation as well as being guided by their own understandings of themselves as good farmers in making decisions about their farm operation. More research is needed to better understand what activates identities, core values and beliefs and how some values are privileged over others in adaptive decisions. This work suggests that educators and policymakers should focus on interventions, incentives and policies that activate the farmer's conservationist identity to increase adaptations that protect the agroecosystem in the longer term.

This is initially transforming data from their raw format to a datamart ready to be interrogated by the statistical techniques that will be shown in the paper in order to specify the characteristics of the Sebou area. Iterative Principal Components Analysis (PCA) were then applied to resolve the problem of missing data. Then continue with the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) polynomial classifier. To be able to apply the (GA PSO) algorithm we need an objective function that serves as a criterion to determine the best solution to our problem, that's why we opted for regression analysis(RA). The result achieved at the end of our study is represent by a classifier of water station according to a scale of 1 to 5 the most good quality to the worst. The novel water quality classifier is this helpful as supporting decision making for both the surface water and underground water.																	0973-1377	0973-7545					2017	56	5					141	158										WOS:000399810600014

The area around the lake was impacted by a large wildland fire in 2013 that occurred during a protracted drought. As the mortality event was still unfolding, we collected data in 2014 on water quality, demographic structure, and short-term survivorship of the population. Water quality was poor with low levels of dissolved oxygen and high salinity of up to 45.90 ppt. Many turtles were severely emaciated and coated with a pale mineralized layer on their shells and skin. Estimated survival rate was low leading to a projected 90% decline in 134 days and a high probability of extirpation within a year. The lake was dry in September 2015 with no evidence of live turtles. Necropsies and low volumetric body condition indices suggested death by starvation. Although this semi-aquatic species has the ability to aestivate in upland habitats during periods of low water or move to other nearby water bodies, it is unlikely that many were able to do so because of their extremely poor condition and the severity of the drought conditions throughout the area.																	1961-9502						2017		418							18	10.1051/kmae/2017008								WOS:000399051100018

Additionally, influence of the selected environmental characteristics on functioning of these insignificant water ecosystems was evaluated. Ten ponds varying in terms of catchment usage structure, hydrologic type and size of surface area were selected for the studies. Impact of the catchment management on water quality was evaluated. In addition, it was verified if periodic changes in the reservoir hydrological function (incorporation into the surface runoff system) significantly affected the water quality. The results confirmed that the usage structure of small reservoir catchment had a decisive influence on the quality of the water. The principal cause of the increasing concentrations of the analyzed ions (Li+, Na+, NH4+, Mg-2(+), K+, Ca-2(+), F-, Cl-, NO2-, Br-, NO3, PO43-, SO42-) was the neighborhood of farms. Seasonal changes in the nutrient (total nitrogen, total phosphorus) water concentrations were not observed. Significant changes in water quality by intermittently forming hydrographic network that interconnected the individual depressions were reported for total nitrogen only. Interestingly, the landlocked ponds, in theory continuously accumulating contaminants from the catchment area, were characterized by good hydro-chemical conditions.																	1230-6169						2017	39	1					11	22										WOS:000398763600002

In addition, an analysis of operating costs of such system was conducted. The study was based on a real facility, i.e. the swimming pool of AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. In the facility, water disinfection with calcium hypo chlorite was carried out, assisted by UV irradiation. Switching the UV lamps temporarily off allowed for comparative studies on the quality of pool water disinfected by pure chlorination and by the UV and chlorination sequence. For these two variants of the swimming pool water disinfection several physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed, including the disinfection by-products. Cost analysis included the consumption of chemical agents and the UV lamp operation. It was established that the UV technology did not contribute to the expected improvement in the pool water quality in terms of the combined chlorine removal, however it did cause an increase in the concentration of selected organic chlorination by-products. Moreover, application of the UV lamp to the pool water treatment system increased the chlorine demand and, consequently, the consumption of calcium hypochlorite. Combined with the need to exchange lamp filaments, it raised the operating costs of the pool water treatment technology.

The construction of these residual lakes, their filling with water from nearby rivers and their water quality management are real challenges in terms of regional water management. These lakes pose challenges, but also offer opportunities for humans as well as for nature. They are to be one of several nuclei in the development of a post-mine region. It is the task of all water management actors to make this become a reality. Another water-related challenge is the management of mine drainage water. As groundwater rises and seeps into the overburden dumps, the results of the oxidation of geogenic pyrites will influence the chemical water composition, leading to higher concentrations of sulphates and iron as well as to a limited reduction of the pH value. Different countermeasures are already being taken, so that outside the mines it is in general the sulphate concentrations that are of relevance. To ensure that this does not affect natural habitats such as rivers or the public water supply, additional countermeasures will have to be taken in future. The tasks that have been caused by lignite mining activities are performed by the mining company. The associated costs can be reliably assessed and covered thanks to appropriate mining provisions.																	0043-0978						2017	107	4					20	29		10.1007/s35147-017-0026-3								WOS:000398756000003

Ranking of Sites for Installation of Hydropower Plant Using MLP Neural Network Trained with GA: A MADM Approach	COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE												Every energy system which we consider is an entity by itself, defined by parameters which are interrelated according to some physical laws. In recent year tremendous importance is given in research on site selection in an imprecise environment. In this context, decision making for the suitable location of power plant installation site is an issue of relevance. Environmental impact assessment is often used as a legislative requirement in site selection for decades. The purpose of this current work is to develop a model for decision makers to rank or classify various power plant projects according to multiple criteria attributes such as air quality, water quality, cost of energy delivery, ecological impact, natural hazard, and project duration. The case study in the paper relates to the application of multilayer perceptron trained by genetic algorithm for ranking various power plant locations in India.																	1687-5265	1687-5273					2017									4152140	10.1155/2017/4152140								WOS:000398560100001

Modeling and predicting the concentration of volatile organic chlorination by-products in Krakow drinking water	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING V					5th National Congress of Environmental Engineering	MAY 29-JUN 01, 2016	Lublin, POLAND					The goal of this article is to develop the models predicting the occurrence of volatile organic chlorination by-products in two Krakow (Poland) water distribution systems. The research results were used to develop the models predicting the concentration of five groups of chlorination by-products (trihalomethanes, haloacetonitriles, haloketones, chloral hydrate and chloropicrin), on the basis of several parameters of water quality, chlorination and distribution (organic carbon and nitrogen, bromide ions, UV254, temperature, pH, retention time). The multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop the base models, in which all analyzed parameters were included. The backward stepwise regression method was used to optimize these models. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the ability of the models to predict the by-products concentration in the analyzed water distribution systems. The sensitivity analysis was also performed to identify the influence of individual parameters on the formation of each by-products group.

Operation of detention pond in urban area-example of Wyscigi Pond in Warsaw	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING V					5th National Congress of Environmental Engineering	MAY 29-JUN 01, 2016	Lublin, POLAND					Small detention ponds should perform two major functions, i.e., reduce flood flows and improve water quality by trapping sediment. Such reservoirs, by providing additional benefits, e.g., for sport and recreation, become an increasingly frequent element of city and suburban landscape. However, by practice, while the impact on flood reduction is considered at the design stage of such reservoirs, the aspect of water quality improvement is often undervalued. In this paper results of fields and analytical investigations on the impact of Wyscigi Pond (a detention pond located in the catchment of Sluzew Creek in Warsaw) on flood flows and on the suspended sediment load reduction are presented. Our investigation shows that Wyscigi Pond impacts flood reduction only to a limited degree, but has a meaningful influence on the sediment load reduction.

Mermaid health - identifying health issues related to mermaiding	INTERNATIONAL MARITIME HEALTH												Background: Mermaiding - swimming with a leg-covering monofin mimicking the tail of a mermaid - is an emerging aquatic activity, which has gained a marked popularity over the last few years. However, no study so far has documented the potential health issues or risks of injuries related to this practice. Materials and methods: This study surveyed professional mermaids cumulating an estimated total of 19,147 h of in-water mermaiding, regarding their health issues and injuries. While mermaiding bears some risks, the occurrence of problematic conditions appears limited. Interestingly, the profile of health issues experienced by professional mermaids is unique and specific, and clearly different from both professional swimmers and surfers. Results: Self-reported health issues related to mermaiding could be divided into issues specifically related to mermaiding activities (ear issues, reported by 87.5% of the respondents; sea life encounters, 50%; cold-related issues, 37.5%; compromised access to air, 25%), issues related to the tail and fins (back pain, 50%; lower limbs issues, 37.5%), and issues related to water quality (eye issues, 25%; waterborne diseases, 12.5%). Clear differences appear between professional and recreational mermaiding activities. Conclusions: The results presented here will help to build safer conditions for mermaiding activities and to develop adapted responses from health specialists to help this unique yet growing population of aquatic performers and athletes.																	1641-9251	2081-3252					2017	68	1					12	18		10.5603/IMH.2017.0003								WOS:000398927500003	28357831					
J	Hua, AK				Hua, Ang Kean			Land Use Land Cover Changes in Detection of Water Quality: A Study Based on Remote Sensing and Multivariate Statistics	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Malacca River water quality is affected due to rapid urbanization development. The present study applied LULC changes towards water quality detection in Malacca River. The method uses LULC, PCA, CCA, HCA, NHCA, and ANOVA. PCA confirmed DS, EC, salinity, turbidity, TSS, DO, BOD, COD, As, Hg, Zn, Fe, E. coli, and total coliform. CCA confirmed 14 variables into two variates; first variate involves residential and industrial activities; and second variate involves agriculture, sewage treatment plant, and animal husbandry. HCA and NHCA emphasize that cluster 1 occurs in urban area with Hg, Fe, total coliform, and DO pollution; cluster 3 occurs in suburban area with salinity, EC, and DS; and cluster 2 occurs in rural area with salinity and EC. ANOVA between LULC and water quality data indicates that built-up area significantly polluted the water quality through E. coli, total coliform, EC, BOD, COD, TSS, Hg, Zn, and Fe, while agriculture activities cause EC, TSS, salinity, E. coli, total coliform, arsenic, and iron pollution; and open space causes contamination of turbidity, salinity, EC, and TSS. Research finding provided useful information in identifying pollution sources and understanding LULC with river water quality as references to policy maker for proper management of Land Use area.																	1687-9805	1687-9813					2017									7515130	10.1155/2017/7515130								WOS:000398145000001	28377790

The imperative need for nationally coordinated bioassessment of rivers and streams	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Declining water quality and ecological condition is a typical trend for rivers and streams worldwide as human demands for water resources increase. Managing these natural resources sustainably is a key responsibility of governments. Effective water management policies require information derived from long-term monitoring and evaluation. Biological monitoring and assessment are critical for management because bioassessment integrates the biological, physical and chemical features of a waterbody. Investment in nationally coordinated riverine bioassessment in Australia has almost ceased and the foci of management questions are on more localised assessments. However, rivers often span political and administrative boundaries, and their condition may be best protected and managed under national policies, supported by a coordinated national bioassessment framework. We argue that a nationally coordinated program for the bioassessment of riverine health is an essential element of sustainable management of a nation's water resources. We outline new techniques and research needed to streamline current arrangements to meet present-day and emerging challenges for coordinating and integrating local, regional and national bioassessment activities. This paper draws on international experience in riverine bioassessment to identify attributes of successful broad-scale bioassessment programs and strategies needed to modernise freshwater bioassessment in Australia and re-establish national broad-scale focus.

Mitigating the effects of barriers to freshwater fish migrations: the Australian experience	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Declining fish communities characterise global freshwater environments, including those in Australia. Lost river connectivity through water resource development is a key cause of decline, disrupting fish migrations and threatening species productivity, viability and fisheries. Millions of dams, weirs and lesser barriers arising from water resources projects, road and rail transport and hydro-electricity schemes obstruct fish passage in rivers worldwide. Fishways are in place at few sites in Australia and globally relative to the numbers of barriers, and few mitigate the effects of barriers adequately. Most constrain the passage of fish communities and few have performed effectively when assessed against appropriate biological standards. Herein we focus on Australian experience within the global context of obstructed fish migrations, declining fish biodiversity and inadequate fishway performance. We review the migratory characteristics of Australian freshwater fish, identify the effects of different in-stream barriers and other habitat changes on the four classes of migratory behaviour and note how Australia's highly variable hydrology presents particular challenges in mitigating fish passage barriers. Mitigation options include: basin-scale approaches; improved management of barriers, environmental flows and water quality; barrier removal; and development of improved fishway designs. Mitigation of fish-passage problems can aid in adapting to climate change effects, reversing fisheries declines and rehabilitating fish communities.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	4					614	628		10.1071/MF15284								WOS:000398531000002

It formed a dense bloom (from 16x10(6) to 81x10(6) trichomes L-1), causing a brown colouration of the lake water. When A. favaloroi formed 100% of the total phytoplankton biomass (44 mg L-1), saxitoxins (saxitoxin and neo-saxitoxin) were detected in the lake seston (42 and 17 mu g g(-1) phytoplankton dry weight respectively), which was screened for saxitoxins, cylindrospermopsin, anatoxin-a, microcystins and nodularin. A massive fish kill coincided with the A. favaloroi bloom. This new saxitoxin-producing species of cyanobacteria, with traits for successful dispersal, may pose a health risk to animals and humans and cause adverse effects on water quality and water services because of its expansion potential.

Effects of strategic tillage on short-term erosion, nutrient loss in runoff and greenhouse gas emissions	SOIL RESEARCH												Occasional strategic tillage (ST) of long-term no-tillage (NT) soil to help control weeds may increase the risk of water, erosion and nutrient losses in runoff and of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared with NT soil. The present study examined the short-term effect of ST on runoff and GHG emissions in NT soils under controlled-traffic farming regimes. A rainfall simulator was used to generate runoff from heavy rainfall (70mmh(-1)) on small plots of NT and ST on a Vertosol, Dermosol and Sodosol. Nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes from the Vertosol and Sodosol were measured before and after the rain using passive chambers. On the Sodosol and Dermosol there was 30% and 70% more runoff, respectively, from ST plots than from NT plots, however, volumes were similar between tillage treatments on the Vertosol. Erosion was highest after ST on the Sodosol (8.3tha(-1) suspended sediment) and there were no treatment differences on the other soils. Total nitrogen (N) loads in runoff followed a similar pattern, with 10.2kgha(-1) in runoff from the ST treatment on the Sodosol. Total phosphorus loads were higher after ST than NT on both the Sodosol (3.1 and 0.9kgha(-1), respectively) and the Dermosol (1.0 and 0.3kgha(-1), respectively). Dissolved nutrient forms comprised less than 13% of total losses. Nitrous oxide emissions were low from both NT and ST in these low-input systems. However, ST decreased CH4 absorption from both soils and almost doubled CO2 emissions from the Sodosol. Strategic tillage may increase the susceptibility of Sodosols and Dermosols to water, sediment and nutrient losses in runoff after heavy rainfall. The trade-offs between weed control, erosion and GHG emissions should be considered as part of any tillage strategy.

Larval Anuran Stable Isotope Signatures and Stoichiometry Across Multiple Geographically Isolated Wetlands in the Southeastern United States	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Animals live in complex environments that vary spatially and temporally. This heterogeneity strongly influences the availability and quality of food resources and has strong impacts on growth and survival of consumers. Geographically isolated wetlands provide an interesting system to study trophic relationships because they vary spatially and temporally in hydrology and vegetation. Larval anurans play an important role in these wetland systems because they are often the most abundant consumers. Yet, little is known about larval anuran diet. Here we assessed the diet of 3 larval anurans (Acris gryllus [Southern Cricket Frog], Hyla gratiosa [Barking Treefrog], and Lithobates sphenocephalus [Southern Leopard Frog]), across 2 isolated wetland types (marsh and cypress savanna) using a stable isotope mixing model, stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR). Furthermore, we assessed variation in basal resource and anuran tissue stoichiometry (C: N). Our analyses suggested that larvae of these 3 species primarily function as herbivores and detritivores. All fed on a mix of algal resources, detrital particulate organic matter, and litter originating from the wetland canopy. Barking Treefrog had a lower C: N than the other two species, suggesting their dietary N requirements may be greater.

A Survey of Freshwater Mussels (Unionidae) in Little River, Blount County, Tennessee	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Following the collection of a putative undescribed species in the genus Pleurobema in 2012, we surveyed the freshwater mussel fauna of Little River, Blount County, TN, to determine species diversity and relative abundances. At 18 main- stem sites, we sampled 3053 live specimens representing 12 mussel species and 1 fresh- dead individual representing another. An additional species represented by a relic shell was collected, bringing the total to 14 mussel species sampled during this survey. Villosa species comprised 77% of total live mussels sampled. Among the extant mussels were two federally endangered species: Fusconaia cuneolus ( Finerayed Pigtoe) was confirmed to persist in the river, while Pleuronaia dolabelloides (Slabside Pearlymussel) represents a new drainage record. Several other mussels collected are considered imperiled globally, including Alasmidonta viridis (Slippershell Mussel), Lampsilis ovata (Pocketbook), Medionidus conradicus (Cumberland Moccasinshell), Pleurobema oviforme (Tennessee Clubshell), Pleuronaia barnesiana (Tennessee Pigtoe), and Villosa vanuxemensis (Mountain Creekshell). A total of 319 individuals of the putative new species Pleurobema sp. cf. oviforme were sampled at 9 sites, 215 at 1 site. A total of 857 individuals of a putative undescribed species in the genus Villosa were sampled at 9 sites. These 2 putative species (Pleurobema sp. cf. oviforme and Villosa sp. cf. iris) are likely endemic to Little River, TN, and may be in need of state and federal protection. Mussel densities declined downstream from the mouth of Ellejoy Creek, indicating that water- quality issues may be occurring in this reach of the river.																	1528-7092	1938-5412					2017	16	1					105	116		10.1656/058.016.0108								WOS:000398177300009

It was analyzed 16,625 data collected between 2002 and 2011 by the water quality monitoring program carried out by the Instituto Mineiro de Gestao das Aguas (Institute of Water Management of Minas Gerais - IGAM). Statistical tests, multivariate and non-parametric tests were used to assess 11 physical, chemical and microbiological variables of 29 monitoring stations. The results of Mann-Kendall/Sazonal MannKendall trend tests indicated that most of the watercourses in the region showed stable values of the parameters over the study period, with changes associated with thermotolerant coliforms, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate and water quality index (IQA) mainly near large urban centers. The Cluster analysis identified three major groups of monitoring stations, grouped according to the quality of its waters, corresponding to high levels of pollution, moderate pollution and low pollution. However, throughout all the sub-basin, it was observed the degradation of the water quality, mainly related to the release of wastewater. An important finding was the worsening of water quality in the low stretch of Velhas River, appointed by the downward trend in the IQA at stations located in this region, which deserves attention of government agencies for management actions.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JAN-FEB	2017	22	1					13	24		10.1590/S1413-41522016131457								WOS:000396344100004						
J	de Abreu, CHM; Cunha, AC				Medeiros de Abreu, Carlos Henrique; Cunha, Alan Cavalcanti			Water quality and trophic index in tropical riverine ecosystem under environmental impact	ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL												The objective of this investigation was to quantify the spatial-temporal variability of 20 physical, chemical and microbiological water quality parameters (including the trophic state index - TSI) in the Lower Jari River, Amapa, Brazil, typical of floodplain ecosystems. Water samples were collected quarterly in a stretch of 80 km of the river, from September 2013 to June 2014. After analysis, these parameters were compared with values established by the CONAMA Resolution 357/2005 (Class 2). Multivariate analysis (correlation, Kruskal-Wallis and cluster hierarchical) showed that the only parameter that varied spatially was the dissolved oxygen (DO) (p<0.05), due to the strong influence of the stretch reaeration. On the other hand, the other parameters - color, turbidity, electrical conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), NH3, P, pH, SO4, Mg, Cl-, thermotolerant coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli and chlorophyll-a - showed only significant temporal variation (p<0.05). We conclude that variation of the TSI ranged from oligotrophic, mesotrophic until ultraoligotrophic. Color, TC and E. coli parameters presented non-compliance with legislation, suggesting relative, but significant, influence, both of hydrological and environmental impacts (urban, industries and hydroelectric plant of Santo Antonio do Jari). Both factors explain not only the seasonal variation of TC, E. coli and color during the rainy season (p< 0.05), but also the correlation among color, turbidity, temperature, DO, Cl-, NH3, Mg, DBO, SO4, pH, E. coli, TC and chlorophyll-a, along the hydrological cycle and its seasonal dynamics (p<0.05), indirectly influencing the behavior of the TSI (p<0.05).																	1413-4152	1809-4457				JAN-FEB	2017	22	1					45	56		10.1590/S1413-41522016144803								WOS:000396344100006

Characterisation of water quality in effluents of land-based abalone farms in the Western Cape, South Africa	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												Effluent water quality was measured at 9 abalone (Haliotis midae) farms in 2 regional nodes (west and south) along the South African coastline. For most farms, effluent total suspended solids (TSS) exceeded the background reference level (80th percentile), and 3 did not comply with the 5 mg l(-1) standard. Total ammonia nitrogen (NH4+) concentrations were mostly greater than reference levels but well below the 43 mu mol N l(-1) standard. Inflow-corrected concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and phosphate were low compared to NH4 (+) and would not pose a significant eutrophication risk. Similarly, the biochemical oxygen demand measured at 3 of the farms was low (median 1.31 mg l(-1)). Abalone production-specific annual loads of TSS (334 kg per metric tonne [mt]), total N (20.3-38.1 kg N mt(-1)) and total P (3.2-7.5 kg P mt(-1)) agree with what has been found for different land-based aquaculture operations. These figures translate to N-based human population equivalents of 5.4-10.6 persons mt(-1) for both regions. At the broader ecosystem level, the annual TSS loads calculated from 2013 production data of 43 mt yr(-1) (west) and 369 mt yr(-1) (south) are, respectively, 0.35 and 2.8% of that estimated for kelp erosion. Similarly, the dissolved inorganic N loads of 1.9 mt N yr(-1) (west) and 9.4 mt yr(-1) (south) are trivial by comparison with nitrate advected during upwelling. Local abalone farms have a relatively high specific C footprint-conservatively similar to 44 kg CO2 kg(-1) production. Our findings support a relatively low potential impact of farm effluents in this coastal upwelling environment.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2017	9						87	102		10.3354/aei00217								WOS:000397953200001						
J	Wang, Z; Xu, GJ; Xu, HL				Wang, Zheng; Xu, Guangjian; Xu, Henglong			Determining beta-diversity of protozoa for bioassessment in coastal ecosystems using community-based dispersions	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The beta-diversity of protozoan communities is a useful bioindicator of environmental heterogeneity and water quality status in global change research. As a broad (beta-diversity measure, multivariate dispersions are subject to influence from the relative weight placed on changes in composition versus abundance. To identify a feasible numeral resolution for determining beta-diversity of protozoa using community based dispersions, a dataset of the protozoan communities was studied. Results showed that although species composition was the primary contributor to the multivariate dispersions, the community-based dispersions showed a significant linear relationship to the Whittaker's (beta-diversity index. However, the data transformations on species-abundance data represented clear influences on outputs of community based dispersion measures: heavy (e.g., fourth root or log) transforms were more feasible than slight ones. Based on the results, we suggest that the community-based multivariate dispersions with heavy data transforms may be used to summarize the (beta-diversity of protozoan communities for bioassessment in coastal ecosystems.

Arboleda			Lentic water quality characterization using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators: An adapted BMWP index	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Water quality in lowland lentic system was evaluated through the use of aquatic macroinvertebrates as bioindicators, and their relationship with basic physicochemical factors was considered; thus, two biotopes were established for identifying both groups of macroinvertebrates, one being the population associated with macrophytes (AM) and the other being benthic (B). As a result, 46 families of macroinvertebrates were collected, with Hydrobiidae, Chironomidae, Thiaridae and Polymitarcyidae being the most abundant in the system. In addition, families with high tolerance to extreme conditions, such as Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae and Syrphidae, were found, as well as some families with low tolerance to these conditions, such as Caenidae and Leptoceridae. The first biotope presented 7.189 individuals (50.42%) and the second 7.056 (49.5%), for a total of 14.259 individuals. Biotope AM presented 100% of the richness, while biotope B was significantly less rich, with 15 families, which represent 32,06%. In order to evaluate the families found in the lowland lentic system, their distribution in the ranges of variation of the physicochemical factors and tolerance levels was taken into account. As a consequence, a new score table was established, where this system obtained a total score of 207 with an average of 166 per sampling station, suggesting signs of contamination. Finally, these results allow an adaptation of the BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) index to be proposed, including the lowland lentic systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Only a few decision support methodologies and integrative methods for evaluating the ecological status of rivers are used in river restoration projects, thereby limiting informed management decisions in restoration planning as well as success control. Moreover, studies quantifying river restoration effects are often based on the assessment of a single organism group, and the effects on terrestrial communities are often neglected. In addition, potential effects of water quality or hydrological degradation are often not considered for the evaluation of restoration projects. We used multi-attribute value theory to re-formulate an existing river assessment protocol and extend it to a more comprehensive, integrated ecological assessment program. We considered habitat conditions, water quality regarding nutrients, micropollutants and heavy metals, and five instream and terrestrial organism groups (fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic vegetation, ground beetles and riparian vegetation). The physical, chemical and biological states of the rivers were assessed separately and combined to value the overall ecological state. The assessment procedure was then applied to restored and unrestored sites at two Swiss rivers to test its feasibility in quantifying the effect of river restoration. Uncertainty in observations was taken into account and propagated through the assessment framework to evaluate the significance of differences between the ecological states of restored and unrestored reaches. In the restored sites, we measured a higher width variability of the river, as well as a higher width of the riparian zone and a higher richness of organism groups. According to the ecological assessment, the river morphology and the biological states were significantly better at the restored sites, with the largest differences detected for ground beetles and fish communities, followed by benthic invertebrates and riparian vegetation. The state of the aquatic vegetation was slightly lower at the restored sites. According to our assessment, the presence of invasive plant species counteracted the potential ecological gain. Water quality could be a causal factor contributing to the absence of larger improvements. Overall, we found significantly better biological and physical states, and integrated ecological states at the restored sites. Even in the absence of comprehensive before-after data, based on the similarity of the reaches before restoration and mechanistic biological knowledge, this can be safely interpreted as a causal consequence of restoration. An integrative perspective across aquatic and riparian organism groups was important to assess the biological effects, because organism groups responded differently to restoration. In addition, the potential deteriorating effect of water quality demonstrates the importance of integrated planning for the reduction of morphological, water quality and hydrological degradation.

J	Wu, M; Che, Y; Lv, YP; Yang, K				Wu, Meng; Che, Yue; Lv, Yongpeng; Yang, Kai			Neighbourhood-scale urban riparian ecosystem classification	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Urban riparian ecosystems are now recognized as essential components in determining the vulnerability of nature and human systems to climate change, but still remains uncertainty concerning how to stratify and classify urban riparian landscapes into units of ecological significance at spatial scales appropriate for management. Ecosystem classification presents a tool that allows for quantifying the social and ecological processes of ecosystems so as to shape them into relatively homogeneous management objectives, and provides the potential of offering decision support to urban planners based on urban ecological principles. The purpose of this study is to explore and develop a framework for urban riparian ecosystem classification. The classification framework integrates 9 ecosystem components and 29 spatially-explicit variables that characterized by the biophysical landscape, built environment and human population. Then this framework is applied at the neighbourhood scale in Huangpu River basin, Shanghai city, China, employing hierarchical cluster analysis. The results of the ecosystem classification show that the riparian ecosystems in the Huangpu River could be grouped into three principal categories and these ecosystems are aligned along a gradient of increasing urbanization. We highlight the conservation and payment for riparian ecosystem services delivered in the upstream of Huangpu River, and revegetation and enhancement of riparian ecosystems in the more urbanized downstream area. We also find that riparian vegetation connectivity and coverage were negatively related to land use mix, built environment density, and economic wealth. In terms of riparian vegetation ecology, neighbourhood scale land use mix and built environment density are more influential than socioeconomic background (such as average family income and immigrant status).

Partitioning taxonomic diversity of aquatic insect assemblages and functional feeding groups in neotropical savanna headwater streams	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Biological diversity can be divided into: alpha (alpha local), beta (beta, difference in assemblage composition among locals), and gamma (gamma, total diversity). We assessed the partitioning of taxonomic diversity of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) and of functional feeding groups (FFG) in neotropical savanna (southeastern Brazilian cerrado) streams. To do so, we considered three diversity components: stream site (alpha), among stream sites (beta(1)), and among hydrologic units (beta(2)). We also evaluated the association of EPT genera composition with heterogeneity in land use, instream physical habitat structure, and instream water quality variables. The percentage of EPT taxonomic alpha diversity (20.7%) was smaller than the beta(1) and beta(2) diversity percentages (53.1% and 26.2%, respectively). The percentage of EPT FFG collector-gatherer a diversity (26.5%) was smaller than that of 131 diversity (55.8%) and higher than the beta(2) (17.7%) diversity. The collector-gatherer FFG was predominant and had the greatest beta diversity percentage among stream sites (beta(1), 55.8%). Our findings support the need for implementing regional scale conservation strategies in the cerrado biome, which has been degraded by anthropogenic activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the pollution in Ganga River in relation to appearance of toxic cyanobacterial strains. Jajmau area of Kanpur city is the industrial hub of Uttar Pradesh and is the main source of adding unwanted discharge into Ganga River. Water samples were randomly collected from the most polluted stretch of Ganga River (Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India). Samples were also collected from other major water of Uttar Pradesh to compare their water chemistry with Ganga River. Physico-chemical parameters of water bodies were estimated periodically for three years 2013-2015. Pearson product mean correlation showed strong correlation between water parameters of sampling sites. Regression analysis showed seasonal variation in water parameters of Ganga River. Cyanobacteria prevalence in Ganga River was highest in May while lowest in August month. Fourteen cultivable cyanobacteria were isolated from Ganga River. Two new isolates, Oscillatoria sp. RBDO1 and Leptolyngbya sp. RBDO5 were found to be toxic and showed the presence of algal toxin (microcystin). Phylogenetic relatedness of toxic cyanobacterial isolates with their close homologues was established using 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Microcystin content in water samples (extracellular release) and in cyanobacterial isolates (intracellular content) was estimated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Ganga River was found to be positive for microcystin with concentration >= 2 ppb which is above the permissible limit of WHO. Toxic cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp. RBDO1 and Leptolyngbya sp. RBDO5 showed the presence of 23 and 17 ppb of microcystin in cells. Growth of the toxic cyanobacteria Oscillatoria sp. RBDO1 showed very strong correlation with phosphate (0.834) and nitrate (0.761) content of water. Toxic Oscillatoria sp. RBDO1 growing in moderate combination of nitrate (16x) and phosphate (4x) showed optimum growth and protein content. Periodic assessment of water quality and monitoring of toxic cyanobacteria would be helpful in identification and regulation of toxins which are responsible for destroying its sanctity and making it unsafe for human consumption.

Many of these streams are not considered in current national monitoring programs due to their small catchment area. However, assessing their status and monitoring their trends is well needed to ensure their proper management and conservation. In this study, we evaluated the use of a range of indicators related to different ecosystem structural and functional components in 2 streams affected by sewage outflows and compared with an unpolluted stream in the Picos de Europa National Park (Spain). We surveyed benthic periphyton, macroinvertebrate communities and fish assemblages and also estimated periphyton growth rates, wood decomposition rates and river metabolism. Additionally, we compared the performance of the selected indicators in different hydraulic conditions. Results revealed an effect of the organic pollution on most of the functional and structural indicators for the most polluted stream. Only the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera taxa, the Iberian Biomonitoring Working Party index, the invertebrate multimetric index used by the regional water agency, the fish abundance and biomass were sensitive enough to detect low leyels of pollution and followed the expected response to the pollution degree. Moreover, most of the indicators behaved similarly under different hydraulic conditions, without major differences between pools and runs. However, the combination of both pool and run replicates at the reach scale resulted in a higher detection capacity of the effects of organic pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Clement, F; Ruiz, J; Rodriguez, MA; Blais, D; Campeau, S				Clement, Francis; Ruiz, Julie; Rodriguez, Marco A.; Blais, Daniel; Campeau, Stephane			Landscape diversity and forest edge density regulate stream water quality in agricultural catchments	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												It is well known that the composition of land cover within a watershed plays a large role in regulating stream water quality. However, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the effect of spatial configuration of different types of land cover on water quality. Using periphytic algae (diatoms) as indicators of stream trophic state, we investigated the relationship between landscape configuration and water quality in a large number of watersheds (590) at varying catchment scales in Eastern Canada. Variation partitioning analysis showed that landscape configuration explained 48% of the variation in water quality. However, since the physiographic setting constrains most agricultural activities, most of the variation was attributed to the shared influence of surficial deposits, land cover and landscape configuration (34%). The results from regression models showed that the geomorphological setting of watersheds (surficial deposits and slopes) and the proportion of different land cover types (mainly forests, wetlands, crops and urban areas) have a major impact on stream water quality. Nevertheless, a few configuration metrics emerged as important factors. Landscape diversity appeared to have a negative impact on water quality, whereas forest and wetland edge densities had a positive impact. Moreover, the influence of these lanscape metrics seems to occur at certain thresholds. In areas of intensive farming, streams with a forest area that covers at least 47% of the watershed have a better water quality. Below this threshold, eutrophic and meso-eutrophic conditions are more frequent in streams and rivers. The shape and location of forested patches were also found to be relevant. Woodlands and wetlands with an edge density higher than 36 m/ha and located along streams and gullies have a positive impact on water quality. For the same proportion of forest, complex patches will be more efficient filters than large regular patches. Forest edge density seems to control the extent of the interface with the agricultural sources and thus promotes the "sink" effect of forests on nutrients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Origin here, impact there The need of integrated management for river basins and coastal areas	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												This study highlights the effect that estuarine polluted waters may have on adjacent coastal waters and the need of an integrated management of the coastal area. Pollution of land-to-sea water plumes varies spatially and temporally, being difficult, costly and time consuming to determine. However, the reduction in water quality of both estuarine and coastal environments and the consequent degradation of its biological communities is at issue. Chlorophyll-a analysis from water and stable nitrogen isotopic analysis (delta N-15) from opportunistic macroalgae Ulva species were respectively used as proxies to detect phyto-plankton proliferation and nitrogen related nutrient fluxes in the water. These analytical techniques were combined with the use of three-dimensional hydrodynamic models, and revealed to constitute reliable early warning instruments, able to identify coastal areas at risk, and supporting an integrated management of coastal and river basin areas. The approach detected synchronized delta N-15 signal variations along time between estuarine sites (Mondego estuary, Portugal) and nearby adjacent coastal shore sites (NE Atlantic coast). The higher values recorded by macroalgal tissues' delta N-15 signals, which occurred simultaneously to higher chlorophyll-a values, were linked to the anthropogenic contamination of the water, probably related with the Mondego valley land use patterns throughout the year (reflecting the opening of sluices that drain agriculture fields). Modeling scenarios point to a Mondego's influence that is able to reach its adjacent coastal shores in about 7 km from its river mouth. The methodology used here is replicable elsewhere and allowed to track nutrients from the source, inside the estuary, until the final area of impact, where primary producers may use those for growth, and to define vulnerable areas on adjacent coastal zones.

During 70 days, fish were subjected to three stocking densities: LD, low density of 88 fish per cubic meter; ID, intermediary density of 176 fish per cubic meter; and HD, high density of 353 fish per cubic meter. These densities were combined with static water (non-exercised group) or moderate-speed water (exercised group). Chronic stress was observed in HD, and plasma cortisol and glucose increased with the stocking densities. In HD, levels of plasma cortisol were significantly lower in exercised fish (135 ng mL(-1)) than in non-exercised ones (153 ng mL(-1)). The greatest hepatic glycogen bulks occurred in fish kept in ID and sustained swimming. Hepatic free amino acids (FAA) increased with the stocking density, particularly in non-exercised fish. The contents of FAA in the liver and of free fatty acids (FFA) in the liver and muscle were mobilized to meet the metabolic demands imposed by exercise and stocking density. The hematological parameters remained stable. The results show that Brycon amazonicus is more resistant to stress when subjected to sustained swimming and high stocking density than to static water.																	0100-204X	1678-3921				JAN	2017	52	1					1	9		10.1590/S0100-204X2017000100001								WOS:000398588100001						
J	Vera, FL; Lopez-Camacho, B				Lopez Vera, Fernando; Lopez-Camacho, Bernardo			Historical water supply to The Monastery of El Paular: a "qanat" in the Guadarrama mountain range (Madrid, Spain)	BOLETIN GEOLOGICO Y MINERO												The "qanat" is an ingenious system of collecting and conducting groundwater to a supply point. Its origin dates back to 3 000 years ago in the area known today as Armenia, and it had spread widely throughout Persia by 600 BC. The expansion of Islam spread this technique from China to the Iberian Peninsula, where it has received various local names. In Madrid, the technique was widely used for water supply from the ninth century until the mid-twentieth century, and in recent centuries received the name "Viajes de agua". However, the geological and socio-economic environment of the Sierra de Guadarrama in Madrid is not, and has never been, appropriate for the implementation of this type of water catchment. This is why the qanat supply of the former Charterhouse of Santa Maria de El Paular (Rascafria), which shows a very similar typology to the "Viajes de agua", modified or constructed in Madrid between the 17th and 19th centuries, is so original. Three "capirotes" (hoods) and a "distribution ark" have been located "in situ" in the vicinity of the Monastery and another "capirote" is used as an ornamental element in the courtyard of the old Hotel El Paular. In this paper we present the results obtained in the field study and files on this "Viaje de agua", its context within the old Monastery supply, its water quality and various hydrological and hydraulic considerations. Its builders must have been "plumbers" from Madrid in the seventeenth century and it underwent several modifications during the eighteenth century.																	0366-0176	2253-6167				JAN-MAR	2017	128	1					193	206		10.21701/bolgeomin.128.1.011								WOS:000398257500011

Application of OEPA-Produced Biotic Indices and Physical Stream Measurements to Assess Freshwater Mussel (Unionidae) Habitat in the Upper Mahoning River, Ohio	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Freshwater mussels continue to experience declines in population numbers in response to changing environments. Identifying aspects of the environment associated with the presence and abundance of mussels in small streams is challenging where past records are minimal. Thus, we sought to produce models of habitat favoring mussel species richness and abundance in the upper Mahoning River using data collected in 2 ways: (1) surveying sites deemed as suitable habitat via observation and (2) surveying existing Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) sites used to evaluate water quality and aquatic life through biotic indices. Detailed physical measurements were added at each survey site. Surveys identified 963 freshwater mussels of 11 species. The more-forested Eagle Creek contained an abundant mussel assemblage compared to the rest of the Upper Mahoning River, yet this stream was still dominated by just 1 common species, Lampsilis siliquoidea (Fatmucket). Drainage area alone correlated with mussel richness and abundance, but a complex model of multiple characteristics provided equivalent predictive power to assess how variation in environmental components may enhance the likelihood of mussel presence. The OEPA composite qualitative habitat evaluation index, which encompasses substrate, instream cover, channel morphology, riparian zone, pool quality, and map gradient, also was indicative of greater mussel diversity.																	1092-6194	1938-5307					2017	24	1					1	14										WOS:000398171800003

The watershed sustainability index (WSI) was developed by considering two important parameters such as potential flood damages (PFD) and potential water quality deterioration (PWQD) parameters. Preference Ranking Organization Method (PROMETHEE), a multicriteria decision making (MCDM) method, was used and WSI scores for 25 Skudai River sub-watersheds were produced. Based on the WSI score, a ranking of sub-watersheds was developed to locate the more problematic areas in the Skudai River watershed. The middle and lower parts of the Skudai River watershed were found to have considerably low sustainability score which suggested the degradation of sub-watersheds from water quality and flood damage parameters. The ranking of sub-watersheds in this study will assist planners and decision makers to identify the problematic areas within the watershed so that priority interventions can be built before the problem gets worse and affects other areas of the Skudai River watershed.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				JAN	2017	12	29					124	131		10.21660/2017.29.24734								WOS:000398053600017						
J	Duncan, R				Duncan, Ronlyn			Rescaling Knowledge and Governance and Enrolling the Future in New Zealand: A Co-Production Analysis of Canterbury's Water Management Reforms to Regulate Diffuse Pollution	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES												Addressing diffuse agricultural pollution to improve water quality is a socioeconomic, political, and policy challenge worldwide. In New Zealand, catchment load limits are being introduced to regulate nutrient losses from agricultural land. Focused on the South Island region of Canterbury, this article presents an interpretive co-production policy analysis to examine the role of science through modeling in rescaling the knowledge and governance of diffuse pollution. The article assembles a discourse of limits, scientific representations of catchment-scale diffuse pollution, a "fast-track" institutional pathway, and identities of scientists and government as knowledge broker and the community as decision maker. The analysis identifies the paradoxical scripting of "predictable nature" and "uncertain nature" and the enrollment of the future as a governance space essential for resolving water resource conflict. The article illustrates a role for modeling well beyond informing and facilitating environmental decision making to constituting the identities, objects, and spaces of governance.																	0894-1920	1521-0723					2017	30	4					436	452		10.1080/08941920.2016.1265187								WOS:000398073900004

This article evaluates whether valid welfare estimates can emerge from this practice. We begin with a theoretical model demonstrating conditions under which stated preference scenarios that include intermediate outcomes will elicit welfare estimates identical to those from parallel scenarios that include associated final outcomes (i.e., convergent validity will hold). The model demonstrates that a necessary condition for convergent validity is the ability of respondents to correctly predict biophysical production functions linking intermediate to final outcomes. Hypotheses from the theoretical model are then evaluated empirically using an application of choice experiments to migratory fish restoration in the U.S. state of Rhode Island. Empirical results are mixed but generally reject convergent validity; welfare estimates are not robust to the use of an intermediate outcome in lieu of a related final outcome in stated preference scenarios, as predicted by theory. Results of the analysis suggest that greater attention should be given to the reliability of welfare estimation when final outcomes cannot be quantified.																	0002-9092	1467-8276				JAN	2017	99	1					163	185		10.1093/ajae/aaw073								WOS:000397070000009						
J	Stillo, F; Gibson, JM				Stillo, Frank; Gibson, Jacqueline MacDonald			Exposure to Contaminated Drinking Water and Health Disparities in North Carolina	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH												Objectives. To examine drinking water quality in majority Black periurban neighborhoods in Wake County, North Carolina, that are excluded from nearby municipal water service and to estimate the health benefits of extending water service. Methods. We tested 3 samples collected July through December 2014 in 57 private wells for microbial contaminants. We compared contaminant prevalences to those in adjacent community water systems (35 280 samples from routine monitoring). Using a population intervention model, we assessed the number of annual emergency department visits for acute gastrointestinal illness that is preventable by extending water services to the 3799 residents of these periurban communities. Results. Overall, 29.2% of 171 private well samples tested positive for total coliform bacteria and 6.43% for Escherichia coli, compared with 0.556% and 0.00850% of municipal system samples. An estimated 22% of 114 annual emergency department visits for acute gastrointestinal illness could be prevented by extending community water service. Conclusions. Predominantly Black periurban neighborhoods excluded from municipal water service have poorer quality drinking water than do adjacent neighborhoods with municipal services. These disparities increase the risk of emergency department visits for acute gastrointestinal illness.																	0090-0036	1541-0048				JAN	2017	107	1					180	185		10.2105/AJPH.2016.303482								WOS:000396524500060	27854523

In the present study, microbial succession of a biofilm growing on artificial substrata in a subtropical freshwater pond was investigated by high-throughput sequencing. Providing artificial substrata effectively reduced the concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the pond. Relatively stable microbiota were formed after approximately 1 week. The dominant phyla in the mature biofilm were Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. The relative abundances of denitrifiers and phosphorus-removing bacteria, such as those in Comamonadaceae and Neisseriaceae, were significantly increased. The use of avermectin B1 changed the community structure of the microbiota; the microbiota were more similar to those at Week 0 than to those at Week 3. However, the microbial community structure recovered after approximately 1 week. Our results indicate that using artificial substrata can create a habitat for denitrifiers and phosphorus-removing bacteria, and thereby improve pond water quality. This study provided insight into how the use of artificial substrata could improve water quality and elucidated the environment-biofilm relationship in a subtropical freshwater pond.																	0378-1097	1574-6968					2017	364	4							fnx017	10.1093/femsle/fnx017								WOS:000397303600002						
J	Burg, A; Gavrieli, I; Guttman, J				Burg, Avihu; Gavrieli, Ittai; Guttman, Joseph			Concurrent Salinization and Development ofAnoxic Conditions in a Confined Aquifer, Southern Israel	GROUNDWATER												An ancient, brackish, anoxic, and relatively hot water body exists within the Yarqon-Tanninim Aquifer in southern Israel. A hydrogeological-geochemical conceptual model is presented, whereby the low water quality is the outcome of three conditions that are met simultaneously: (1) Presence of an organic-rich unit with low permeability that overlies and confines the aquifer; the confining unit contains perched horizons with relatively saline water. (2) Local phreatic/roofed conditions within the aquifer that enable seepage of the organic-rich brackish water from above. The oxidation of the dissolved organic matter in the seeping water consumes the dissolved oxygen and continues through bacterial sulfate reduction, with H2S as a product. These exothermic reactions result in some heating. (3) The seeping water comprises a relatively large portion of the water volume. In the presented case study, the latter condition first developed in the Late Pleistocene following climate change, which led to a dramatic decline in recharge. Consequently, water flow in the local basin has nearly ceased, as evident by old water ages, specific isotopic composition, and nearly equipotential water levels. The continuous seepage from above into the almost stagnant water body has resulted in degraded water quality. Seepages of organic-rich brackish water exist at other sites throughout the aquifer but have limited impact on the salinity and redox conditions due to the dynamic water flow, which flushes the seeping water, that is, the third condition is not met. The coexistence of the above three conditions may explain the development of anoxic and saline groundwater in other aquifers worldwide.																	0017-467X	1745-6584					2017	55	2					183	198		10.1111/gwat.12474								WOS:000395640200007	27727479

Permeable Asphalt: A New Tool to Reduce Road Salt Contamination of Groundwater in Urban Areas	GROUNDWATER												Chloride contamination of groundwater in urban areas due to deicing is a well- documented phenomenon in northern climates. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of permeable pavement on degraded urban groundwater. Although low impact development practices have been shown to improve stormwater quality, no infiltration practice has been found to prevent road salt chlorides from entering groundwater. The few studies that have investigated chlorides in permeable asphalt have involved sampling directly beneath the asphalt; no research has looked more broadly at surrounding groundwater conditions. Monitoring wells were installed upgradient and downgradient of an 860m(2) permeable asphalt parking lot at the University of Connecticut (Storrs, Connecticut). Water level and specific conductance were measured continuously, and biweekly samples were analyzed for chloride. Samples were also analyzed for sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). Analysis of variance analysis indicated a significantly (p< 0.001) lower geometric mean Cl concentration downgradient (303.7 mg/L) as compared to upgradient (1280 mg/L). Concentrations of all alkali metals increased upgradient and downgradient during the winter months as compared to nonwinter months, indicating that cation exchange likely occurred. Despite the frequent high peaks of chloride in the winter months as well as the increases in alkali metals observed, monitoring revealed lower Cl concentrations downgradient than upgradient for the majority of the year. These results suggest that the use of permeable asphalt in impacted urban environments with high ambient chloride concentrations can be beneficial to shallow groundwater quality, although these results may not be generalizable to areas with low ambient chloride concentrations.																	0017-467X	1745-6584					2017	55	2					237	243		10.1111/gwat.12454								WOS:000395640200012	27576128

Application of Multivariate Statistical Methods to Optimize Water Quality Monitoring Network with Emphasis on the Pollution Caused by Fish Farms	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH												Background: One of the key issues in determining the quality of water in rivers is to create a water quality control network with a suitable performance. The measured qualitative variables at stations should be representative of all the changes in water quality in water systems. Since the increase in water quality monitoring stations increases annual monitoring costs, recognition of the stations with higher importance as well as main parameters can be effective in future decisions to improve the existing monitoring network. Methods: Sampling was carried out on 12 physical and chemical parameters measured at 15 stations during 2013-2014 in Haraz River, northern Iran. Results: The results of the measurements were analyzed using multivariate statistical analysis methods including cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), and discriminant analysis (DA). According to the CA, PCA, and FA, the stations were divided into three groups of high pollution, medium pollution, and low pollution. Conclusion: The research findings confirm applicability of multivariate statistical techniques in the interpretation of large data sets, water quality assessment, and source apportionment of different pollution sources.																	2251-6085	2251-6093					2017	46	1					83	92										WOS:000395562800012	28451533

Processes such as grid chamber, coagulation, sedimentation, clarification, filtration, and disinfection are typically used in water purification plants. Among these methods, unit filtration which employs polymers is one of the new technologies. There have been many studies about the use of semiconductive TiO2 with graphene oxide (GO) on the base of different polymeric membranes for the removal of azo dyes, especially methylene blue (MB). Polymeric GO-TiO2 membranes have high photocatalytic, antifouling property and permeate the flux removal of organic pollutants. The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of different polymericmembranes such as anionic perfluorinated polymer (Nafion), cellulose acetate, polycarbonate (PC), polysulfone fluoride (PSF), and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).

The chemical structures of 51 phenols and thiophenols have been characterized by electronic and physic-chemical descriptors. The present study was performed using principal components analysis (PCA), multiple regression analysis (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN). The quantitative model was accordingly proposed and the toxicity of the compounds was interpreted based on the multivariate statistical analysis. This study shows that the results obtained by MLR were suitable and have served to predict toxicity, but compared to the results of the ANN model, we conclude that the prediction achieved by the latter is more effective and better than MLR model. The statistical results of the predictive performance indicate that the ANN model is statistically significant than the previous reported model based on CART-LS-SVR. Following to the obtained results, our proposed model may be useful to predict of toxicity and risk assessment of chemicals. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, such divisions must be based on appropriated technical criteria. Considering the importance of deeply understanding the relationship between DMA creation and these criteria, this work proposes a performance analysis of DMA generation that takes into account such indicators as resilience index, demand similarity, pressure uniformity, water age (and thus water quality), solution implantation costs, and electrical consumption. To cope with the complexity of the problem, suitable mathematical techniques are proposed in this paper. We use a social community detection technique to define the sectors, and then a multilevel particle swarm optimization approach is applied to find the optimal placement and operating point of the necessary devices.

The region has been exposed to several extreme climatic phenomena, mostly droughts, which has created several problems related to water quality and quantity. The authors defined climate change scenarios using two regional climate models. Water resources under climate change were estimated by a regional numerical groundwater model covering a deep aquifer. The water demand components were estimated for households, industries, services, and livestock, based on specific socio-economic assumptions. A nonprobabilistic risk assessment, using simplified fuzzy sets mathematics, was used to estimate water supply, water demand, and the consequences of water shortages. The results of the study revealed significant vulnerability in the water supply, a limited territorial expansion of sewerage networks, an expected increase in households' demand, an expected increase in industrial and services water demand, a relatively stable demand for water for livestock farming, and an important water shortage in the study area. The authors conclude by highlighting a set of actions to mitigate the risk of the potential crisis.

We examine the nature and size of water pollution externalities as rivers flow across jurisdictions. Panel data on water pollution in Brazilian rivers coupled with county splits that change the locations of borders allow us to identify the spatial patterns of pollution as rivers approach and cross borders, controlling for fixed effects and trends specific to each location. The theory of externalities predicts that pollution should increase at an increasing rate as the river approaches the downstream exit border, that there should be a structural break in the slope of the pollution function at the border, and that a larger number of managing jurisdictions should exacerbate pollution externalities. We find support for all four predictions in the data. Satellite data on growth in night-time lights along rivers show that local authorities allow more settlements to develop close to rivers in the downstream portions of counties, which is the likely underlying mechanism. The border effects on pollution are not as pronounced when the cost of inter-jurisdictional coordination is lower.																	0034-6527	1467-937X				JAN	2017	84	1					464	502		10.1093/restud/rdw023								WOS:000397127400014

The paper did an analysis on the number of aquatic plant communities, the form of water spaces, and water quality condition by investigating 135 quadrats (90 at amphibious boundary and the land, 45 in the water) in 45 transects of 15 urban and suburban parks. We found that water spaces had monotonous forms with low biodiversity and poor water quality. In addition, urban water landscapes hardly provided ecological functions given excessive construction. Accordingly, a proposition to connect tradition with modernism in the improvement and innovation of urban water landscape planning was put forward, and further, the way to achieve it was explored.

J	Humphries, MS; McCarthy, TS; Pillay, L				Humphries, Marc S.; McCarthy, Terrence S.; Pillay, Letitia			Attenuation of pollution arising from acid mine drainage by a natural wetland on the Witwatersrand	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Wetlands are well known to be efficient at sequestering pollutants from contaminated water. We investigated metal accumulation in the peats of the Klip River, a natural wetland that has received contaminated water from gold mining operations in Johannesburg for over 130 years. Previous work conducted in the downstream portion identified the wetland as an important system for sequestering metals. We focused on the upstream section of the wetland, more proximal to the source of acid mine drainage, to provide a better understanding of the pollutant sources and the role of the wetland in pollutant attenuation. Geochemical and mineralogical analyses of peat cores revealed considerable metal enrichments in the peat ash, particularly in Co, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cu and U. Metal concentrations are typically between 4 to 8 times higher than those previously reported for the downstream, more distal portion of the wetland. The distribution of metal accumulation within the peat profiles suggests that contamination arises from a combination of sources and processes. Elevated concentrations in the shallow peat are attributed to the input of contaminated surface water via tributaries that drain the Central Rand Goldfield, whereas enrichments in the deeper peat suggest significant sub-surface inflow of contaminated water through the underlying dolomitic rocks. Metal immobilisation occurs through a combination of mechanisms, which include the precipitation of gypsum, metal sulfides,Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides and phosphates. Our study highlights the environmental and economic importance of natural wetland systems which have the ability to accumulate large quantities of metals and thus remediate polluted waters. Significance: Considerable levels of metal accumulation are observed within the Klip River wetland peats. The wetland is effective in remediating highly polluted water emanating from the Witwatersrand Basin. The Klip River system is important for the region's future water supply.																	0038-2353	1996-7489				JAN-FEB	2017	113	1-2					63	71		10.17159/sajs.2017/20160237								WOS:000396525500011

RUNOFF WATER QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS FOLLOWING SWINE SLURRY APPLICATION UNDER BROADCAST AND INJECTED CONDITIONS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												This study was conducted to measure the effects of swine slurry application method, time following slurry application, and runoff rate on selected water quality characteristics. Slurry from a commercial swine operation was broadcast or injected on field plots at a rate required to meet annual nitrogen requirements for corn. Rainfall simulation tests were conducted at five varying periods following slurry application. During each study period, three simulated rainfall events, separated by 24 h intervals, were applied for 30 min duration at an intensity of approximately 70 mm h(-1). Following the third rainfall simulation event, inflow was applied at the top of the plots in four successive increments to simulate greater plot lengths. Runoff samples were collected for analyses of dissolved P (DP), particulate P, total P (TP), NO3-N, NH4-N, total N, electrical conductivity, pH, and soil loss. The DP and TP loads of 0.35 and 0.46 kg ha(-1) measured for the broadcast treatment were significantly greater than the 0.13 and 0.19 kg ha(-1) obtained for the injection treatment. As time following slurry application increased from 1 to 3 days to 43 to 45 days, DP, TP, and NH4-N loads decreased from 0.35 to 0.14, from 0.52 to 0.18, and from 2.17 to 0.14 kg ha(-1), respectively. Runoff rate significantly affected each of the measured water quality parameters. Runoff loads of DP, TP, and NH4-N increased from 10.1 to 29.8, from 12.9 to 35.5, and from 13.9 to 25.1 g ha(-1) min(-1), respectively, as overland flow rate increased from 2.3 to 12.6 L min(-1). Application method, time following slurry application, and runoff rate are important variables influencing water quality characteristics of runoff.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	1					53	66		10.13031/trans.11370								WOS:000396040500005

APPLICATION OF DSSAT MODEL TO SIMULATE CORN YIELD UNDER LONG-TERM TILLAGE AND RESIDUE PRACTICES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Long-term (1991-2013) field experiments were conducted to study the effects of different tillage and residue management practices on grain corn production in eastern Canada. Three different tillage practices, namely conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT), and no tillage (NT), along with two residue management practices, namely with residue (R) and without residue (NR), were considered. Field measurements of grain yield, biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil moisture, and mineral nitrogen were used to evaluate the performance of the DSSAT model and to understand the impacts of long-term tillage and residue management practices. The observed corn yield, biomass, LAI, and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) were not found to be significantly different under the various tillage and residue practices. The observed soil moisture showed a significant difference in the upper 10 cm soil layer. The SOC pool at 0-20 cm depth was reduced by 9.5% for CT and increased by 17.3% and 7.6% for RT and NT treatments, respectively. The DSSAT model was able to simulate corn and biomass yield, LAI, soil moisture, and SOC with RMSE ranging from 2% to 31%, indicating reasonable model performance. The model did not provide accurate results for NO3-N and soil moisture simulations, with RMSE ranging from 34% to 78%. Further improvements in the model are needed to better simulate soil moisture and N dynamics under different tillage and residue practices.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	1					67	83		10.13031/trans.11545								WOS:000396040500006

EVALUATING THE APEX MODEL FOR SIMULATING STREAMFLOW AND WATER QUALITY ON TEN AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS IN THE US	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												To better understand the Agricultural Policy Environmental Extender (APEX) model's strengths and limitations in simulating streamflow and water quality, we evaluated its performance under a diverse range of climatic, topographic, soil, cover, and land management conditions using three parameter settings: best professional judgment (BPJ), partially calibrated, and fully calibrated. A total of 18 calibration parameters governing streamflow, crop yield, and sediment, N, and P were adjusted. Hydrologic and water quality responses were simulated on ten USDA-ARS watersheds with heterogeneous forested, pasture/range, and/or corn-soybean cropping systems. Based on percent bias and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency test statistics, 0%, 0%, 15%, and 9% of the data sets were considered satisfactory or better in simulating monthly streamflow, sediment, N, and P, respectively, in the BPJ mode. However, when used with the fully calibrated settings, 73%, 43%, 38%, and 27% of the data sets were satisfactory or better. Findings indicate that when fully calibrated, APEX estimates streamflow very well, sediment and nitrogen moderately well, and phosphorus marginally well at a monthly time scale. However, when using the BPJ approach, APEX does not estimate watershed-level streamflow, sediment, or nutrients accurately at a monthly time step. Additionally, APEX lacks an element of robustness in simulating streamflow and water quality constituents when applied to the same watershed with a different period of record or to a nearby watershed with a similar period of record. Based on these findings, it is recommended that users exercise caution when employing APEX with the BPJ approach or in validation mode at watershed scales.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	1					123	146		10.13031/trans.11903								WOS:000396040500010						
J	Mark, O; Ilesanmi-Jimoh, M				Mark, Ole; Ilesanmi-Jimoh, Modupe			An analytical model for solute mixing in surcharged manholes	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												A mathematical model has been developed to describe solute mixing in surcharged manholes using the submerged jet theory. The model has been applied for straight-through flow manholes and for manholes with a difference in the level of the inlet and outlet pipes. The model is applicable to dissolved substances, i.e. the model has not been validated for high sediment concentrations (above 1 g/l) and care should be taken in such cases. Simulation results from the new model are compared with laboratory measurements and are further compared to conventional modelling techniques currently available in commercial software specially developed for modelling the water quality in sewers. The results prove that the new model produces considerably better results compared to the traditional assumption of full mixing in a manhole. The new model compares well to the laboratory measurements and hence improves the accuracy of modelling soluble pollutant transport in sewers. The applicability of the new modelling approach is discussed and further studies are recommended.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	5					443	451		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1179335								WOS:000396045200001

However, the connection between roof harvested rainwater and health is not well documented especially in developing countries. Understanding the application of locally available treatment methods provides insight into this problem. This paper reports on experimental investigations where rainwater collected from a typical domestic roof in Mekelle, Ethiopia was treated using Moringa stenopetala seed, sand filter and boiling. The quality of the raw and treated roof harvested rainwater were compared against the Ethiopian and World Health Organization drinking water standards to investigate its suitability as a supplement for potable water supply. The pollutants analysed were total coliforms and turbidity. A significant improvement of turbidity and total coliforms was observed. This implies that application of plant coagulant followed by filtration can sufficiently treat rainwater and can be used as a low-cost treatment option in water scarce areas.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	5					460	466		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1176225								WOS:000396045200003

Estimating flow data in urban drainage using partial least squares regression	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Flow monitoring in wastewater systems is used for system operation or for billing purposes, among others. Given the difficult measurement conditions, gaps in measurement series occur frequently and stakeholders need an appropriate method to estimate missing data. In data scarcity situations, mathematical modelling of the underlying physical processes may not be feasible and other methods are required. Partial least squares (PLS) regression is a multivariate statistical method suited to correlated data and has been frequently used for water quality estimates. PLS suitability for hourly and daily flow estimations was tested, based on previous flow and precipitation data, which urban water utilities currently monitor. Results were evaluated using proposed performance criteria and classes. The estimation errors were comparable to the ones obtained in physical process modelling. The application of the proposed method for flow estimation in sewers, in two common scenarios of wet and dry weather flows, is presented and discussed.

LANDSCAPE-ECOLOGICAL OPTIMIZATION OF HYDRIC POTENTIAL IN FOOTHILLS REGION WITH DISPERSED SETTLEMENTS. A CASE STUDY OF NOVA BOSACA, SLOVAKIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The article shows how to implement scientific results from a methodology of landscape ecological planning (LANDEP) into integrated river basin management. This methodology creates a framework of integrating research of land use structure with modelling hydric potential by using runoff curve number into the assessment and subsequent optimization of hydric potential in a foothills region of the Biele Karpaty Mts. Analysis and hydric evaluation of the study area shows that foothills region has a relatively high hydric potential. The research question is: could landscape ecological optimization reduce runoff significantly and improve hydric regime in the landscape. The proposed measures are linked to existing land use structure, where they increase the quality of existing hydric elements. They have character of non-technical solutions with maximum exploitation of the potential of ecosystem services, therefore they are economically undemanding. On the basis of our results, the proposed changes in land use will lead to the capture of water in landscape and an overall better use of water in landscape.

DETERMINATION OF LEAD AND CADMIUM IN THE WATER OF THE DAMAVAND RIVER, IRAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Heavy metals contamination of surface waters has become an important issue in the last decades. The present study aimed to investigate the levels of lead and cadmium in the water of the Damavand River, Iran. Sampling was carried out in 10 stations during summer and autumn 2015. Metal analysis was performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Surface water at each sampling point was measured for selected physicochemical parameters with a multiparameter meter. Statistical analysis was carried out by SPSS and Excel software. The results showed that the mean concentrations (mg/L) of lead in the samples were higher than cadmium over the studied months. The highest levels of lead (2.13 +/- 0.80) and cadmium (1.03 +/- 0.50) were found in station 9 while the lowest levels of lead (0.09 +/- 0.00) and cadmium (0.03 +/- 0.00) were in station 1 (before entering the city of Damavand). Significant differences (P< 0.05) were observed between the stations, however, there were no significant variations between the levels of metals in the months. Significant differences were found between the levels of physicochemical parameters among different months at 95% confidence level. Present values revealed that the concentrations of metals in the stations were higher than the maximum permitted levels for drinking water set by different organizations.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	1					439	444		10.15666/aeer/1501_439444								WOS:000397162200030

PCA indicated six components in HPS and MPS with total variance of 84.9% and 84.4%, while LPS result five components had a total variance of 77.1%. Generally, major sources of pollution are agricultural, residential and wastewater treatment plants, domestic and commercial waste, industry, as well as animal husbandry. The present study provides useful information for local authorities to identify sources of pollution of the examined area and effectively in proper management for land use area. Additionally, the study also helps in understanding river water quality within the basin and provides a database for future reference in developing water policies.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	1					485	499		10.15666/aeer/1501_485499								WOS:000397162200034

LOCAL AND SCIENTIFIC ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE POTENTIAL AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION IN A PERIURBAN RIVER, MEXICO CITY, MEXICO	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Rivers in large cities face management problems that could be addressed through the integration of scientific and local ecological knowledge. The objective of this article is to emphasize the importance of different sources of knowledge in management alternatives for periurban watersheds. Specifically, this is done through (a) use of oral sources and archives to document the historic relationship between local residents and their natural resources, and (b) technical evaluation of the quantity and quality of water in the sub-basin through the time. We analyzed, through the 19 unstructured interviews, local residents' knowledge related to water quantity and quality. Additionally, we analyzed historical river flow data and water quality reports. The results show that the relationship between the local inhabitants and the river has been governed by public policies of both exploitation and conservation. For the last century, the river was used as the main source of electric power for local industry, the collapse of which, led to the decline of the importance of the river in the perception of the locals. Analysis of historical river flow data reveals a slight decrease in flow despite a trend of somewhat lower precipitation. This discrepancy may be due to hydraulic infrastructure construction and uncontrolled extraction. We conclude that the integration of two kinds of knowledge present a great opportunity to test a monitoring system that incorporates the environmental features that were more accurately described by the local residents: water quantity and forest land use.

These findings are from a one-year investigation on the occurrence and distribution of the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium in Yunlong Lake, Xuzhou, China. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. From January to November of 2015, 180 samples (120 water samples and 60 sediment samples) were collected and analyzed. Among them, 42 (35%) water samples and 28 (47%) sediment samples tested positive for Cryptosporidium. The concentration of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the water samples was 0-8/10 L and 0-260/g in sediment samples. Results revealed that July was the highest risk period for both swimming and diving with an estimated probability of infection from swimming of greater than 18 per 10,000 swim sessions. It was concluded that swimming or diving in Yunlong Lake has a higher risk of Cryptosporidium infection than the acceptable risk level set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Thus, regular monitoring of water quality in recreation water bodies is strongly recommended.																	1712-9532	1918-1493					2017									4819594	10.1155/2017/4819594								WOS:000396560500001	28386287

The river reach is characterized by complex geometry, including vegetated islands, alternating sand bars and an unpredictable thalweg. The models were setup and validated using available observed data in the region before using them to estimate the levels of cohesive sediment and a select set of chemical constituents, consisting of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals, within the river system. Different flow scenarios were considered, and the results show that a large proportion of the cohesive sediment that gets deposited within the study domain originates from the main stem upstream inflow boundary, although Ells River may also contribute substantially during peak flow events. The floodplain, back channels and islands in the river system are found to be the major areas of concern for deposition of sediment and associated chemical constituents. Adsorbed chemical constituents also tend to be greater in the main channel water column, which has higher levels of total suspended sediments, compared to in the flood plain. Moreover, the levels of chemical constituents leaving the river system are found to depend very much on the corresponding river bed concentration levels, resulting in higher outflows with increases in their concentration in the bed sediment.

Fish scales as a non-lethal tool of the toxicity of wastewater from the River Chenab	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Water pollution is gradually increasing in natural waters through anthropogenic activities. This study aimed to use fish scales as a bio-indicator of pollution, along with water quality parameters, and the assessment and detection of selected heavy metals in water samples collected from the River Chenab, including the Chakbandi drain that gathers domestic sewage waste and industrial effluents from Faisalabad and deposits it into this freshwater body. All water quality parameters (pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), salinity, conductivity, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), phenols and sulphates) and concentrations of selected heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb and Cr) were found to be considerably higher than permissible limits as defined by the WHO, and therefore capable of causing ill health effects in aquatic organisms. Specimens of fish scales from selected fish were described qualitatively and observed quantitatively. In Catla catla, Labeo rohita and Cirrhinus mrigala, the scales showed several deformities in shape and different scale structures such as circuli, radii and annuli. In each of the three types of fish, considerable variation in the morphology of their scales was observed in specimens collected from polluted sites.

A better understanding of the concentrations of heavy metals in the aquatic environment of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is crucial for national drinking water security and sustainable ecosystem development. To thoroughly investigate the impact of heavy metals on water quality after the impoundment to the maximum level of 175 m in the TGR, the concentrations of the dissolved heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As) were measured in April and August 2015, by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). (1) Except Zn and Pb, most of the heavy metal concentrations in the water of the TGR reached the level of the National Surface Water Environmental Quality Standards (GB3838-2002) I of China, revealing that the water quality of the TGR was good overall. (2) There were significant positive correlations among the concentrations of Cu, As, and Cd, revealing that they may exhibit similar geochemical behaviors. (3) The spatial distribution of the heavy metal concentrations was diverse and complex. The Zn concentration obviously increased in the rainy season from upstream to downstream in the Yangtze River, while the other heavy metals exhibited no significant changes in their concentrations. The distribution characteristics of the heavy metal concentrations on both sides and the middle of the river were different at different sites. (4) The health risk of the six elements was assessed through a human health risk assessment (HHRA), and the assessment results were lower than the maximum acceptable risk level designed by the US EPA and International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). The HHRA model in the aquatic environment revealed that the risk of non-carcinogenic heavy metals (Cu, Zn, and Pb) was at a negligible risk level of 10(-11) similar to 10(-9) a(-1). At all the study sites, the risk of carcinogenic heavy metals (Cr, Cd, and As) was higher than the risk of non-carcinogenic heavy metals. As was the most important risk factor, followed by Cr. The results of this study hold great significance for a timely understanding of the changing water quality for affected departments to ensure the health of the residents in the TGR area.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	3					2697	2710		10.1007/s11356-016-8046-6								WOS:000396138800049	27834048

Bayesian assurance and sample size determination in the process validation life-cycle	JOURNAL OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS												Validation of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes is a regulatory requirement and plays a key role in the assurance of drug quality, safety, and efficacy. The FDA guidance on process validation recommends a lifecycle approach which involves process design, qualification, and verification. The European Medicines Agency makes similar recommendations. The main purpose of process validation is to establish scientific evidence that a process is capable of consistently delivering a quality product. A major challenge faced by manufacturers is the determination of the number of batches to be used for the qualification stage. In this article, we present a Bayesian assurance and sample size determination approach where prior process knowledge and data are used to determine the number of batches. An example is presented in which potency uniformity data is evaluated using a process capability metric. By using the posterior predictive distribution, we simulate qualification data and make a decision on the number of batches required for a desired level of assurance.																	1054-3406	1520-5711					2017	27	1					159	174		10.1080/10543406.2016.1148717								WOS:000396555100013	26891342

The Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers, of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was used as a support procedure to develop an integrated assessment, considering biotic, habitat and water quality partial assessments. In order to assess the river condition, two reference sites, located in a forest land, and nine perturbed sites, representatives of agricultural, urban and industrial lands, were selected in a geographical information system, with the support of field trips. The river biotic condition was based on families of benthic macroinvertebrates, the river habitat condition was assessed by using the habitat parameters established by the EPA, and the river water quality condition by developing an index from the nine measured physical and chemical parameters. The current river health was considered as the mode of the category of the partial assessments. While the river health of the reference sites was optimum, it was poor for all the perturbed sites, the worst condition in the index scale.																	0188-4999						2017	33	1					7	19										WOS:000396528700001

The application of water in the orchards from agricultural wells with high salt content, promotes their accumulation in the soil, hindering their mobility to tree roots. In order to chemically analyze the composition of water irrigation in the pecan-producing region of southern Chihuahua and contrast it with the current Mexican standards, the following research was conducted. Sampling was carried out in June 25, 2014. Ten orchards in the south of the Chihuahua State were selected and a water sample from each well was taken. The analyzed parameters were pH, chlorides, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, As, B, Pb, Cd, Ni, Na, total dissolved solids, nitrates, hardness, alkalinity, sodium adsorption ratio and electric conductivity (EC). For human use and consumption was considered the Mexican official norm (NOM 127), and for agricultural irrigation the Federal Law of Rights - Provisions Applicable to Matters of National Waters. Values obtained in the south of the Chihuahua State were within the parameters established for both drinking and agricultural irrigation water, thus being this water of good quality. However, it is suggested to have a periodic monitoring of the concentrations of Pb, Ni, As, B and CE to avoid the future possibility of repercussions to the human population of the surrounding communities in the region and of negative impacts on farming activity.

Several techniques are currently used in the water industry to determine the best dosage of the coagulant, such as the jar-test method, zeta potential measurements, artificial intelligence methods, comprising neural networks, fuzzy and expert systems, and the combination of the above-mentioned techniques to help operators and engineers in the water treatment process. Current paper presents an artificial neural network approach to evaluate optimum coagulant dosage for various scenarios in raw water quality, using parameters such as raw water color, raw water turbidity, clarified and filtered water turbidity and a calculated Dose Rate to provide the best performance in the filtration process. Another feature in current approach is the use of a backpropagation neural network method to estimate the best coagulant dosage simultaneously at two points of the water treatment plant. Simulation results were compared to the current dosage rate and showed that the proposed system may reduce costs of raw material in water treatment plant.																	1806-2563	1807-8664				JAN-MAR	2017	39	1					33	38		10.4025/actascitechnol.v39i1.29353								WOS:000396696200005

In choosing a carbon source, one should consider convenience, cost and biodegradability. This study investigates the efficiency of poly-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB), a biologically degradable polymer, as a carbon source to produce bioflocs in suspended growth bioreactors (SGRs), PHBSGRs, compared with glucose (GLU-SGRs). The C:N ratio in PHB-SGRs could be maintained around 15:1. The volatile suspended solids (VSS) yield was 2.94 +/- 0.72 gVSS/g fish waste for PHB-SGRS and 4.90 +/- 0.23 gVSS/g fish waste for GLU-SGRs. The recycling rate of nitrogen in aquaculture solid waste was 56 +/- 2% and 87 +/- 7% for the PHB-SGRs and Glu-SGRs. No significant differences were found in the bioflocs produced and in the crude protein content of the produced bioflocs between PHB-SGRs and GLU-SGRs. PHB-SGRs and GLU-SGRs could remove dissolved inorganic nitrogen from aquaculture wastewater, with average values of 11.82 +/- 8.95 and 16.27 +/- 3.95 mg/g TSS/d. Because the calculation of the added amount of carbon and the multiple additions of carbon was avoided, PHB is considered to be a good choice as an organic carbon source for this process, even though not all parameters used for assessment were better than those of GLU-SGRs.

This study tested the potential of submerged leaf litter of Rhizophora mucronata and associated biofilm in providing a favorable environment for postlarval shrimp Penaeus monodon. Litter decomposition and assembly of microalgae and epifauna were assessed under exposure to sunlight or shade, and presence or absence of sediment. Litter incubated with sediment and exposed to sunlight was rapidly decomposed and supported the highest biomass and diversity of microalgae and epifauna. The litter also supported the highest abundance of diatoms, polychaetes and nematodes during the 4th week of decomposition. Cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis dominated litter incubated without sediment, in sunlight, after decom position for 5 wk. Under shaded conditions, diatoms of the genus Navicula and the Cyanobacteria Anabaena spp. and Oscillatoria spp. continued to grow at high total ammonium nitrogen, low dissolved oxygen, low temperature and low pH. Our study illustrates synergy between sediment and direct sunlight in promoting diversity of microalgae and polychaetes (of dietary benefit to shrimps), inhibiting growth of Cyanobacteria and maintaining water quality at levels favorable to culture of post- larval shrimp. Our findings support 4 practices for a healthy environment in fish ponds: (1) locating ecological shrimp culture in less forested areas, (2) promoting sediment conditions in artificial shrimp culture systems, (3) exposing litterderived bio film within ponds to sunlight and incubating with sediment to maintain favorable water quality and control Cyanobacteria blooms, and (4) minimizing the use of pond liners and related sludge removal.

N and 85 degrees 20'2.8". E at an altitude of 1340 m), Nepal. The status of trophic characteristics of the Nagdaha was calculated on the basis of normalized average phosphorus [P]. and chlorophyll [Chl]. through verified Vollenweider Model. The water quality parameters like pH; nitrate, total phosphate and alkalinity; temperature and dissolved oxygen were tested for the assessment purpose. The measurement of lake depth was done through depth sounding method where GPS co-ordinates were recorded, then analysed, managed and presented using GIS for bathymetric map. The area of lake as given by aerial photograph was determined to be 3.07 hectares; while various litreatures enlisted the area as 2.65-5 hectares. The bathymetric map area calculation entailed that the area was 2.51 hectares (decreased by 500 square metres). The depth of the lake varied from 0.30 metre to 4.70 metres. The residence time, in which mean depth of water body act as vital role in resulting various trophic level. The lake was hypereutrophic and eutrophic at average phosphorus loading up to first 2.5 metre and onward depth respectively. The normalized phosphorous and chlorophyll concentrations during winter were found greater than in summer seasons.																	0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	1					29	39		10.3233/AJW-170004								WOS:000394621100004

Indexing is a practical and concise way of representing the overall quality of water. Many such indexing methods are available with different goal and purpose. For indexing purpose importance of different Water Quality Parameters needs to be determined first. In the present study, importance of Water Quality Parameters were determined on the basis of important criteria like potential hazards, cost of mitigation, utilization scope and popularity among the researchers. The importance of criteria were determined by Response Surface Methodology (RSM), whereas the scoring of importance was performed by Analytic Network Process (ANP). For validation of the proposed index, a case study was performed by water quality data of different water bodies in Tripura, India. The proposed Water Quality Index of the sample water bodies were then compared with the Water Quality Indices of National Sanitation Foundation (NSF WQI). Results indicate that the proposed index is very close to NSF WQI. Thus the proposed index seems to be successful in expressing the overall quality of water.

To date, little is known about how biofilm forms in drippers of irrigation systems. In this study, the internal dripper geometry was recreated in 3-D printed microfluidic devices (MFDs). To mimic the temperature conditions in (semi-) arid areas, experiments were conducted in a temperature controlled box between 20 and 50 degrees C. MFDs were either fed with two different treated wastewater (TWW) or synthetic wastewater. Biofilm formation was monitored non-invasively and in situ by optical coherence tomography (OCT). 3-D OCT datasets reveal the major fouling position and illustrate that biofilm development was influenced by fluid dynamics. Biofilm volumetric coverage of the labyrinth up to 60% did not reduce the discharge rate, whereas a further increase to 80% reduced the discharge rate by 50%. Moreover, the biofilm formation rate was significantly inhibited in daily temperature cycle independent of the cultivation medium used.																	0892-7014	1029-2454					2017	33	3					211	221		10.1080/08927014.2017.1285017								WOS:000395648600001	28270050

Forty drainage ditches in the TGR from multiple land use types were extensively investigated for 10 parameters of water quality. The results showed that the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in the TGR drainage ditches were generally far higher than the internationally recognized eutrophication threshold. Based on this study, both ditch water and sediments from residential land and roadside land had the highest concentrations of nutrients. Possible sources of these nutrients include sewage water and septic tank overflow. Forestland had significantly lower concentrations of nutrients. Residential ditches had higher values of electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS) values and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. Forestland had lower values of EC and TDS values and higher DO concentrations. The results indicate that the nutrients that have accumulated in the sediments have significant impacts on the water quality in adjacent ditches. A long-term plan must be developed to more strictly control the external loading of nutrients from surrounding land. Action plans to promote the growth of wetland plants in drainage ditches are important for increasing agrochemical retention in the TGR drainage ditches. TGR drainage ditches from residential zones must be actively managed by cleaning and sediment removal to control the risk of nutrients being released into the reservoir.

J	Stephenson, K; Shabman, L				Stephenson, Kurt; Shabman, Leonard			Nutrient Assimilation Services for Water Quality Credit Trading Programs: A Comparative Analysis with Nonpoint Source Credits	COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Water quality trading programs allow regulated point sources to meet some nutrient control requirements by buying nutrient reduction credits from other pollutant sources. Reduction credits can be created when agricultural land managers implement best management practices and regulators predict that those practices will result in water quality conditions equivalent to controlling discharges at the regulated source. However, natural variability in runoff combines with model and data limitations to make predictions of water quality equivalence uncertain. Nutrient assimilation credits can be created by increasing the capacity of the ecosystem to assimilate nutrients through investments in aquatic plant biomass creation and harvest, shellfish aquaculture, stream restoration, and wetlands restoration and creation. Nutrient assimilation credits and agricultural nonpoint source reduction credits are evaluated based on a number of water quality criteria including service quantification certainty, temporal matching, additionality, and leakage. Nutrient assimilation credits can provide greater certainty than agricultural best management practices in producing equivalent water quality outcomes and should be an option in trading programs.																	0892-0753	1521-0421					2017	45	1					24	43		10.1080/08920753.2017.1237240								WOS:000394463800002

Winter Wheat Yield, Quality, and Nitrogen Removal Following Compost- or Manure-Fertilized Sugarbeet	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												To efficiently use nitrogen (N) while protecting water quality, one must know how a second-year crop, without further N fertilization, responds in years following a manure application. In an Idaho field study of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) following organically fertilized sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.), we determined the residual (second-year) effects of fall-applied solid dairy manure, either stockpiled or composted, on wheat yield, biomass N, protein, and grain N removal. Along with a no-N control and urea (202kg N ha(-1)), first-year treatments included compost (218 and 435kg estimated available N ha(-1)) and manure (140 and 280kg available N ha(-1)). All materials were incorporated into a Greenleaf silt loam (Xeric Calciargid) at Parma in fall 2002 and 2003 prior to planting first-year sugarbeet. Second-year wheat grain yield was similar among urea and organic N sources that applied optimal amounts of plant-available N to the preceding year's sugarbeet, thus revealing no measurable second-year advantage for organic over conventional N sources. Both organic amendments applied at high rates to the preceding year's sugarbeet produced greater wheat yields (compost in 2004 and manure in 2005) than urea applied at optimal N rates. On average, second-year wheat biomass took up 49% of the inorganic N remaining in organically fertilized soil after sugarbeet harvest. Applying compost or manure at greater than optimum rates for sugarbeet may increase second-year wheat yield but increase N losses as well.Abbreviations CNS, carbon-nitrogen-sulfur																	0010-3624	1532-2416					2017	48	1					124	138		10.1080/00103624.2016.1254233								WOS:000395167100013

The present study explores the use of Landsat data and GIS for assessing water pollution at Burullus Lake, Egypt. Multi- spectral Landsat- 8 OLI image dated 2015 provided the necessary information to this study. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections were applied to the image. Land use/cover map was obtained to identify natural resources and types of human activities in the area surrounding the Lake. Three previously developed water quality empirical models for BOD, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were applied on the calibrated image. Then, a GIS model was generated to identify areas recording high levels of BOD, TN and TP. Results confirmed that the Lake water is subjected to pollution from multiple sources; particularly domestic and agricultural drains. Shallow water (i. e. Lake Shores), where human activities are influencing, reported high levels of water studied pollutants. The model indicated that south western and north eastern parts of the Lake are the most polluted parts, recording relatively high levels of BOD, TN and TP; > 4.46 mg L-1, > 18.33 mg L-1 and > 15.59 mg L-1, respectively. Results were ascertained based on water quality investigations in relevant research studies on the Lake. It was concluded that Burullus Lake is extensively subjected to interrupting human activities which have a great negative impact on water quality. Also dataobservation techniques and water quality empirical models were successful in assessing and mapping water pollution. (C) 2016 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

Evaluation of Mariut Lake water quality using Hyperspectral Remote Sensing and laboratory works	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES												It would be an advantage if there were a measurement method, which would provide more detailed spatial information on water contaminations at low cost. Hyperspectral Remote Sensing has a possibility for gathering detailed: contamination information rapidly and inexpensively. This study includes the possibility of assessing heavy metal contamination of water in Mariut Lake and predicting models describe their concentration using spectrum data taken by portable FieldSpec_ 3 ASD Spectroradiometer. The main objectives of this research are assessing water contamination by heavy metal in Mariut Lake using laboratory analysis and developing a predictive model for water pollution based on the spectral characteristics and lab data obtained. It is resulted that Pb, Ni and Cr concentrations exceed permissible limit of USEPA. Also, the spectral reflectance of (6-13, 16, 19 and 20) at wavelength 582-653 nm is related to the spectral behavior of the high chlorophyll concentration. Also there are 7 samples (1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 19 and 21) showed high and low values of turbidity. As the suspended sediment concentration increased, reflectance also increased at all wavelengths between 400 and 850 nm. It is concluded that most of models predicting heavy metals concentration using reflectance spectroscopy have high significant correlation ranged from 0.27 to 0.97.

The reservoir was monitored for four years: initially (from 2004 to 2007) for cyanobacterial cells and physicochemical parameters and, subsequently (in 2007 and 2008), for Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts and Giardia spp. cysts in four sampling stations. The concentrations of Escherichia coli were also measured in 2007 and 2008, wich allowed the characterization of each sampling point according to the National Environment Council (CONAMA) no. 274/ 2000. Results indicated concentrations of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. (oo)cysts ranging from 0 to 0.8 (oo) cysts. L-1, and higher concentrations of cyanobacteria cells, from 0.0 to 4.5 x 10(5) cells. mL(-1), thus indicating potential risks to human health, if the water from the reservoir is not properly treated before consumption. The group of cyanobacteria was not found during the dry season, returning soon after destratification. The rainy season was characterized by a higher ocurrence of cyanobacteria and predominance of picoplanktonic species (Aphanocapsa spp.), over the Microcystis spp. previously found and presented the highest variations in dissolved oxygen, turbidity, total phosphorous, orthophosphate, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. The change observed within the group of cyanobacteria (Aphanocapsa spp. over Microcystis spp.) may be indicative of changing characteristics in the water source.

The occurrence and potential ecological risk assessment of bauxite mine-impacted water and sediments in Kuantan, Pahang,Malaysia	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Recent bauxite mining activities in the vicinity of Kuantan, Pahang, have been associated with apparent environmental quality degradation and have raised environmental concerns among the public. This study was carried out to evaluate the overall ecological impacts on water and sediment quality from the bauxite mining activities. Water and sediment samples were collected at seven sampling locations within the bauxite mining areas between June and December 2015. The water samples were analyzed for water quality index (WQI) and distribution of major and trace element geochemistry. Sediment samples were evaluated based on geochemical indices, i.e., the enrichment factor (EF) and geoaccumulation index (I (geo)). Potential ecological risk index was estimated to assess the degree to which sediments of the mine-impacted areas have been contaminated with heavy metals. The results showed that WQIs of some locations were classified as slightly polluted and contained metal contents exceeding the recommended guideline values. The EFs indicated minimal to moderate enrichment of metals (Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn, As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Co, and Sr) in the sediments. I (geo) showed slightly to partially polluted sediments with respect to As at some locations. The potential ecological risk index (RI) showed that As posed the highest potential ecological risk with RI of 52.35-60.92 at two locations, while other locations indicated low risk. The findings from this study have demonstrated the impact of recent bauxite mining activities, which might be of importance to the local communities and relevant authorities to initiate immediate rehabilitation phase of the impacted area.

J	Cui, LL; Wei, LF; Wang, J				Cui, Lili; Wei, Liangfu; Wang, Jun			Residues of organochlorine pesticides in surface water of a megacity in central China: seasonal-spatial distribution and fate in Wuhan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Surface water quality closely correlating with human health suffered increasing organochlorine pesticide (OCP) pollution due to the intensive anthropogenic activities in megacities. In the present study, 112 water samples collected from 14 lakes and 11 drinking water source sites in Wuhan were detected for the residues of OCPs in November 2013 and July 2014, respectively. The I OCPs pound ranged from 5.61 to 13.62 ng L-1 in summer with the maximum value in Yezhi Lake and 3.18 to 7.73 ng L-1 in winter with the highest concentration in Yandong Lake. Except dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), OCP concentrations in summer were significantly higher than those in winter mostly due to the non-point source pollution including land runoff in summer. Source apportionment of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and DDTs revealed the historical use of technical HCH and lindane and the new input of DDT, respectively. The spatial distribution of OCPs was not uniform in the surface water of Wuhan because of the significant influence of land development and fishery. The risk assessments showed the heptachlor, and heptachlor epoxide in most sampling sites exceeded the threshold set by the European Union, indicating the possible adverse effects for aquatic lives. Negligible non-carcinogenic risks for drinking and bathing as well as carcinogenic risks for bathing were found in the surface water. However, the total carcinogenic risks of all OCPs (aRs) caused by drinking in summer were higher than the safe level of 10(-7) in all sampling sites. It was implied that the surface water in Wuhan was not safe for directly drinking without effective purification.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	2					1975	1986		10.1007/s11356-016-7956-7								WOS:000394254000081	27798806
