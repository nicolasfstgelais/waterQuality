A colorimetric iron sensor based on the partition of phenanthroline complexes into polymeric hydrogels. Combinatorial synthesis and high throughput screening of the hydrogel matrix	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL												A combinatorial library of hydrogels is produced by radical polymerization and tested for retention of iron (II) complexes, using a simple colorimetric high throughput screening (HTS). Six acrylamide monomers are used to produce a library of 21 cross-linked hydrogel matrixes. The swelling of all hydrogels is determined and related with the structure of each monomer unit present. The HTS shows that some materials are able to retain the tris(phenanthroline)iron(II) (Fe(Phen)(3)(2+)) complex. The partition coefficient of Fe(H2O)(6)(2+) and Fe(Phen)(3)(2+) in all hydrogels is determined by UV-vis spectrophotometry and related with the presence of anionic (e.g. -SO3-, hydrophobic (e.g. isopropyl) and hydrophilic (e.g. -NH2 of acrylamide) groups. Hydrogels with sulfonic (-SO3-) groups show large values of partition coefficients of Fe2+ into the hydrogel (>500). Based on the data and HTS, poly(acrylamide-co-50%(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropansulfonic acid)) (PAAm-co-50%AMPS) is selected to build a colorimetric sensor. Since the phenanthroline could be released from the hydrogel, bathophenanthroline (BPhen) which is not released is used as ligand. The hydrogel is loaded with BPhen and exposed to Fe2+ in water. The visual detection of color gives a detection limit of 0.1 ppm. Little interference of different common ions is found. A special set-up is made which allows spectrophotometric measurement of the complex inside the gel. The detection limit is found to be of ca. 0.01 ppm by spectrophotometry. Using the sensor, the iron content in milk is measured directly demonstrating the use of the sensor to measure free iron in opaque liquids where solution spectrophotometry is not effective without complex sample pretreatments. The non-covalent retention of ligands and complexes inside polymeric hydrogels seems to be a suitable method for building specific ion sensors. (C) 2016 Elsevier BM.

Uncertainty and sensitivity in a bank stability model: implications for estimating phosphorus loading	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is one of the most pressing water quality concerns in the United States and around the world. Bank erosion has been largely overlooked as a source of nutrient loading, despite field studies demonstrating that this source can account for the majority of the total phosphorus load in a watershed. Substantial effort has been made to develop mechanistic models to predict bank erosion and instability in stream systems; however, these models do not account for inherent natural variability in input values. To quantify the impacts of this omission, uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were performed on the Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM), a mechanistic model developed by the US Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) that simulates both mass wasting and fluvial erosion of streambanks. Generally, bank height, soil cohesion, and plant species were found to be most influential in determining stability of clay (cohesive) banks. In addition to these three inputs, groundwater elevation, stream stage, and bank angle were also identified as important in sand (non-cohesive) banks. Slope and bank height are the dominant variables in fluvial erosion modeling, while erodibility and critical shear stress had low sensitivity indices; however, these indices do not reflect the importance of critical shear stress in determining the timing of erosion events. These results identify important variables that should be the focus of data collection efforts while also indicating which less influential variables may be set to assumed values. In addition, a probabilistic Monte-Carlo modeling approach was applied to data from a watershed-scale sediment and phosphorus loading study on the Missisquoi River, Vermont to quantify uncertainty associated with these published results. While our estimates aligned well with previous deterministic modeling results, the uncertainty associated with these predictions suggests that they should be considered order of magnitude estimates only.

Combined effects of temperature and the herbicide diuron on Photosystem II activity of the tropical seagrass Halophila ovalis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Tropical seagrasses are at their highest risk of exposure to photosystem II (PSII) herbicides when elevated rainfall and runoff from farms transports these toxicants into coastal habitats during summer, coinciding with periods of elevated temperature. PSII herbicides, such as diuron, can increase the sensitivity of corals to thermal stress, but little is known of the potential for herbicides to impact the thermal optima of tropical seagrass. Here we employed a well-plate approach to experimentally assess the effects of diuron on the photosynthetic performance of Halophila ovalis leaves across a 25 degrees C temperature range (36 combinations of these stressors across 15-40 degrees C). The thermal optimum for photosynthetic efficiency (Delta F/F '(m)) in H. ovalis was 31 degrees C while lower and higher temperatures reduced Delta F/F '(m) as did all elevated concentrations of diuron. There were significant interactions between the effects of temperature and diuron, with a majority of the combined stresses causing sub-additive (antagonistic) effects. However, both stressors caused negative responses and the sum of the responses was greater than that caused by temperature or diuron alone. These results indicate that improving water quality (reducing herbicide in runoff) is likely to maximise seagrass health during extreme temperature events that will become more common as the climate changes.

How does the media portray drinking water security in Indigenous communities in Canada? An analysis of Canadian newspaper coverage from 2000-2015	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH												Background: Drinking water insecurity and related health outcomes often disproportionately impact Indigenous communities internationally. Understanding media coverage of these water-related issues can provide insight into the ways in which public perceptions are shaped, with potential implications for decision-making and action. This study aimed to examine the extent, range, and nature of newspaper coverage of drinking water security in Canadian Indigenous communities. Methods: Using ProQuest database, we systematically searched for and screened newspaper articles published from 2000 to 2015 from Canadian newspapers: Windspeaker, Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, and National Post. We conducted descriptive quantitative analysis and thematic qualitative analysis on relevant articles to characterize framing and trends in coverage. Results: A total of 1382 articles were returned in the search, of which 256 articles were identified as relevant. There was limited coverage of water challenges for Canadian Indigenous communities, especially for Metis (5%) and Inuit (3%) communities. Most stories focused on government responses to water-related issues, and less often covered preventative measures such as source water protection. Overall, Indigenous peoples were quoted the most often. Double-standards of water quality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities, along with conflict and cooperation efforts between stakeholders were emphasized in many articles. Conclusion: Limited media coverage could undermine public and stakeholder interest in addressing water- related issues faced by many Canadian Indigenous communities.

River-water pollution is an important environmental problem because it is the main source of water for consumption by humans as well as aquatic species living in the river. Water quality index was determined using nine standard water quality parameters for River Beas and was found to be 60.93. The mean values of dissolved oxygen (DO) (8.82 mg/l), biological oxygen demand (BOD) (0.87 mg/l) and total coliform (1451.60 MPN/100 ml) were found for River Beas in Himachal Pradesh. The mean values of DO (7.29 mg/l), BOD (3.75 mg/l), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (48.89 mg/l) and total coliforms (562.88 MPN/100 ml) were also found for River Beas in Punjab. DO, COD, BOD and total coliforms ranges of the river were found above permissible limits of BIS for drinking water.

Predicting the impact of Lake Biomanipulation based on food-web modeling-Lake Kinneret as a case study	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Biomanipulation is a tool decision makers use to achieve desirable management goals. In lakes, one of the most common goals is the improvement of water quality, an objective that can be achieved mainly by reducing the amount of phytoplankton in the water. Although it is a very clear goal that is achievable by using actions that affect the phytoplankton biomass, experience shows that primary biomanipulation goals are rarely achieved. A biomanipulation program was conducted in Lake Kinneret over a 12-year period with the goal of improving water quality by reducing the population of the dominant fish species in the lake. However, the biomanipulation failed to achieve the goal and the program was stopped. We used Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) scenarios to examine the effect of biomanipulation on the ecosystem. The results of these scenarios show that biomanipulation actions, such as those used in the lake, indeed fail to improve water quality; furthermore, they will actually increase the amount of phytoplankton in the water and decrease water quality. The development of the method described in the present article provides managers with the means to evaluate the effect of biomanipulation on an ecosystem. This method enables researches to conduct a pre-action analysis of the planned measures and examine whether the goal can be achieved, saving money and time and preventing damage to the ecosystem.

A lab in the field: high-frequency analysis of water quality and stable isotopes in stream water and precipitation	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												High-frequency measurements of solutes and isotopes (O-18 and H-2) in rainfall and streamflow can shed important light on catchment flow pathways and travel times, but the workload and sample storage artifacts involved in collecting, transporting, and analyzing thousands of bottled samples severely constrain catchment studies in which conventional sampling methods are employed. However, recent developments towards more compact and robust analyzers have now made it possible to measure chemistry and water isotopes in the field at sub-hourly frequencies over extended periods. Here, we present laboratory and field tests of a membrane-vaporization continuous water sampler coupled to a cavity ring-down spectrometer for real-time measurements of delta O-18 and delta H-2 combined with a dual-channel ion chromatograph (IC) for the synchronous analysis of major cations and anions. The precision of the isotope analyzer was typically better than 0.03% for delta O-18 and 0.17% for delta H-2 in 10 min average readings taken at intervals of 30 min. Carryover effects were less than 1.2% between isotopically contrasting water samples for 30 min sampling intervals, and instrument drift could be corrected through periodic analysis of secondary reference standards. The precision of the ion chromatograph was typically similar to 0.1-1 ppm or better, with relative standard deviations of similar to 1% or better for most major ions in stream water, which is sufficient to detect subtle biogeochemical signals in catchment runoff. We installed the coupled isotope analyzer/IC system in an uninsulated hut next to a stream of a small catchment and analyzed stream water and precipitation samples every 30 min over 28 days. These high-frequency measurements facilitated a detailed comparison of event-water fractions via endmember mixing analysis with both chemical and isotope tracers. For two events with relatively dry antecedent moisture conditions, the event-water fractions were <21% based on isotope tracers but were significantly overestimated (40 to 82 %) by the chemical tracers. These observations, coupled with the storm-to-storm patterns in precipitation isotope inputs and the associated stream water isotope response, led to a conceptual hypothesis for runoff generation in the catchment. Under this hypothesis, the pre-event water that is mobilized by precipitation events may, depending on antecedent moisture conditions, be significantly shallower, younger, and less mineralized than the deeper, older water that feeds baseflow and thus defines the "pre-event" endmember used in hydrograph separation. This proof-of-concept study illustrates the potential advantages of capturing isotopic and hydrochemical behavior at a high frequency over extended periods that span multiple hydrologic events.

Variation in sensitivity of large benthic Foraminifera to the combined effects of ocean warming and local impacts	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Large benthic foraminifera (LBF) are crucial marine calcifiers in coral reefs, and sensitive to environmental changes. Yet, many species successfully colonise a wide range of habitats including highly fluctuating environments. We tested the combined effects of ocean warming, local impacts and different light levels on populations of the common LBF Amphistegina lobifera collected along a cross-shelf gradient of temperature and nutrients fluctuations. We analysed survivorship, bleaching frequency, chlorophyll a content and fecundity. Elevated temperature and nitrate significantly reduced survivorship and fecundity of A. lobifera across populations studied. This pattern was exacerbated when combined with below optimum light levels. Inshore populations showed a consistent resistance to increased temperature and nitrate levels, but all populations studied were significantly affected by light reduction. These findings demonstrated the capacity of some populations of LBF to acclimate to local conditions; nonetheless improvements in local water quality can ultimately ameliorate effects of climate change in local LBF populations.																	2045-2322					MAR 23	2017	7								45227	10.1038/srep45227								WOS:000397186100001	28332634

The toxicities that result from deteriorating water quality, such as that from ammonia stress, have lethal effects on juvenile shrimp and can increase their susceptibility to pathogens. The toxicity of ammonia plays an important role in the frequently high mortality during the early stage on shrimp farms. However, little information is available regarding the genetic parameters of the ammonia tolerance of juveniles in the early stage, but this information is necessary to understand the potential for the genetic improvement of this trait. Considering the euryhalinity of L. vannamei and the fact that low salinity can increase the toxicity of ammonia stress, we estimated the heritability of ammonia tolerance in juveniles in 30 parts per thousand (normal) and 5 parts per thousand (low) salinity in this study using the survival time (ST) at individual level and the survival status at the half-lethal time (SS50) at the family level. In the normal and low salinity conditions and for the merged data, the heritability estimates of the ST (0.784 +/- 0.070, 0.575 +/- 0.068, and 0.517 +/- 0.058, respectively) and SS50 (0.402 +/- 0.061, 0.216 +/- 0.050, and 0.264 +/- 0.050, respectively) were all significantly greater than zero, which indicates that the ammonia-tolerance of shrimp can be greatly improved. So it might provide an alternative method to reduce mortality, help to enhance resistance to pathogens and reduce the occurrence of infectious diseases. The significant positive genetic correlation between ST and body length suggested that ammonia is more toxic to shrimp in the early stage. The medium-strength genetic correlations of the ST and SS50 between the two environments (0.394 +/- 0.097 and 0.377 +/- 0.098, respectively) indicate a strong genotype-by-environment (GxE) interaction for ammonia tolerance between the different salinity levels. Therefore, salinity-specific breeding programs for ammonia tolerance in shrimp should be purposefully implemented.																	1932-6203					MAR 22	2017	12	3							e0173835	10.1371/journal.pone.0173835								WOS:000399094700031	28328986

Anthropogenic shift of planktonic food web structure in a coastal lagoon by freshwater flow regulation	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Anthropogenic modification of aquatic systems has diverse impacts on food web interactions and ecosystem states. To reverse the adverse effects of modified freshwater flow, adequate management of discharge is required, especially due to higher water requirements and abstractions for human use. Here, we look at the effects of anthropogenically controlled freshwater flow regimes on the planktonic food web of a Ramsar listed coastal lagoon that is under recovery from degradation. Our results show shifts in water quality and plankton community interactions associated to changes in water flow. These shifts in food web interactions represent modifications in habitat complexity and water quality. At high flow, phytoplanktonzooplankton interactions dominate the food web. Conversely, at low flow, bacteria, viruses and nano/picoplankton interactions are more dominant, with a substantial switch of the food web towards heterotrophy. This switch can be associated with excess organic matter loading, decomposition of dead organisms, and synergistic and antagonistic interactions. We suggest that a lower variability in flow amplitude could be beneficial for the long-term sustaining of water quality and food web interactions, while improving the ecosystem health of systems facing similar stresses as the Coorong.

Contribution of Leaf Litter to Nutrient Export during Winter Months in an Urban Residential Watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Identification of nonpoint sources of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in urban systems is imperative to improving water quality and better managing eutrophication. Winter contributions and sources of annual N and P loads from urban watersheds are poorly characterized in northern cities because monitoring is often limited to warm-weather periods. To determine the winter export of N and P, we monitored stormwater outflow in a residential watershed in Saint Paul, Minnesota during 2012-2014. Our data demonstrate that winter melt events contribute a high percentage of annual N and P export (50%). We hypothesized that overwintering leaf litter that is not removed by fall street sweeping could be an important source to winter'oads of N and P. We estimated contributions of this source by studying decomposition in lawns, street gutters, and catch basins, during two winters. Rates of mass and N loss were negligible during both winters. However, P was quickly solubilized from decomposing leaves. Using mass balances and estimates of P leaching losses, we estimated that leaf litter could contribute 80% of winter total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) loading in this watershed (similar to 40% of annual TDP loading). Our work indicates that urban trees adjacent to streets likely represent a major source of P pollution in northern cities. Management that targets important winter sources such as tree leaves could be highly effective for reducing P loading and may mitigate eutrophication in urban lakes and streams in developed cities.

In this study, the structure and composition of EPS (extracellular polymeric substances) were investigated to elucidate the factors for the anammox aggregation property. Anammox sludge taken from 18 lab-scale and pilot scale reactors treating different types of wastewater was analyzed using EEM-PARAFAC (excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and real-time PCR combined with multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that slime and TB-EPS (tightly bound EPS) were closely related with water quality and sludge morphology, and could be used as the indicators for anammox microbial survival ability and microbial aggregate morphology. Furthermore, slime secreted from anammox bacterial cells may be exhibited higher viscosity to the sludge surface and easily formed the gel network to aggregate. Large amounts of hydrophobic groups of protein in TB-EPS promoted the microbial aggregation. The mechanisms of anammox aggregation explored in this study enhanced the understanding of anammox stability in wastewater treatment processes.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 21	2017	51	6					3260	3268		10.1021/acs.est.6b05761								WOS:000397477900017	28240536

Influence of the Mixing Energy Consumption Affecting Coagulation and Floc Aggregation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The operational significance of energy-intensive rapid mixing processes remains unaddressed in coagulation and flocculation of insollible precipitates (flocs), which play an important role in the removal of impurities from drinking water supplies. In this study, the influence of rapid mixing and associated mixing energy on floc aggregation was examined for a surface water source characterized by a high fraction of aquatic humic matter. Infrared spectral analyses showed that the colloidal complexes resulting from ligand exchange between iron and dissolved natural organic matter (DOM) were not substantially influenced by the mixing energy input. This signified that DOM removal by coagulation can be achieved at lower mixing intensity, thereby reducing energy consumption. In contrast, macroscopic investigations showed the coagulation mixing energy affected floc size distributions during the slow mixing stage in flocculation and, to some extent, their settling characteristics. The results from analysis of floc properties clearly showed that more mixing energy was expended than necessary in coagulation, which is typically designed at a high mixing intensity range of 600-1000 s(-1) in treatment plants. The key findings from this study have practical implications to water utilities to strategically meet water quality goals while reducing energy demands.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 21	2017	51	6					3480	3489		10.1021/acs.est.6b06281								WOS:000397477900041	28206742

By drastically reducing their cost of manufacture, MFCs can become an important tool for water quality monitoring, accessible also in the poorest and most remote areas of the world. To enable this, this study investigates for the first time the use of two low cost membrane materials: a natural polymer (eggshell membrane), and a synthetic polymer (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS). The energy generation and sensing capability of the resulting devices were compared with a membrane-less device, while the well-known Nafion((R)) membrane was used as a control. For each device, the effect of electrode spacing on performance was also investigated. The use of PDMS led to a power density similar to the case of the much more expensive Nafion((R)) membrane. The electrode spacing affected the output power, but it had a negligible effect on the BOD sensing capability of the devices. In particular, for the case of the eggshell membrane and the membrane-less devices, the higher the electrode spacing the better the power performance. The opposite trend was observed when a synthetic membrane was used. Finally, although more unstable than the other devices, the eggshell membrane devices were associated with the lowest internal resistances and the highest sensitivity. In conclusion, this study not only demonstrates the use of inexpensive membranes in MFCs, but it also provides guidelines on design, in terms of electrode spacing and crosssectional area, according to the material used.

Subtle effects of environmental stress observed in the early life stages of the Common frog, Rana temporaria	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Worldwide amphibian populations are declining due to habitat loss, disease and pollution. Vulnerability to environmental contaminants such as pesticides will be dependent on the species, the sensitivity of the ontogenic life stage and hence the timing of exposure and the exposure pathway. Herein we investigated the biochemical tissue 'fingerprint' in spawn and early-stage tadpoles of the Common frog, Rana temporaria, using attenuated total reflection-Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy with the objective of observing differences in the biochemical constituents of the respective amphibian tissues due to varying water quality in urban and agricultural ponds. Our results demonstrate that levels of stress (marked by biochemical constituents such as glycogen that are involved in compensatory metabolic mechanisms) can be observed in tadpoles present in the pond most impacted by pollution (nutrients and pesticides), but large annual variability masked any inter-site differences in the frog spawn. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is capable of detecting differences in tadpoles that are present in selected ponds with different levels of environmental perturbation and thus serves as a rapid and cost effective tool in assessing stress-related effects of pollution in a vulnerable class of organism.

Water exchange rate in RAS and dietary inclusion of micro-minerals influence growth, body composition and mineral metabolism in common carp	AQUACULTURE												Recirculation aquaculture systems (RASs) operated at low water exchange rates are known to accumulate minerals in the water. This study examined the dietarymineral requirement and metabolism in common carp reared in RAS of contrasting water exchange rates. Two independent RAS (water exchange rates, 70 vs. 2000 L/kg feed) and five experimental diets with graded levels of micro-mineral premix inclusion (0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0 and 1.5%) were tested in a 2 x 5 factorial arrangement. Common carp fingerlings (8.5 g) were reared in either of the RAS and fed the experimental diets in triplicates for 8 weeks at 24 degrees C. Water quality, fish growth, body composition, tissue mineral concentrations, blood haemoglobin and haematocrit levels, biochemical andmolecular markers of oxidative stress, mineral uptake and metabolismwere studied. RAS operated at lowwater exchange rate showed significantly high conductivity, nitrate, nitrite and dissolved mineral concentrations in water. A tendency for higher growth, significantly higher whole body mineral levels except Cu and Zn were observed in fish reared in RAS with high accumulation ofminerals (H-RAS). Of the micro-minerals studied, effect of RAS on the minimal dietary inclusion level was significant only for Se; lower in fish reared in the H-RAS (0.28mg/kg) compared to LRAS (0.32 mg/kg). Increasing premix inclusion decreased growth and feed efficiency, increased the whole body concentration of Cu, Se and Zn, while Fe and Mn were unaffected. Plasma P, Ca, K and Mn were higher and haematocritwas lower inH-RAS reared fish; plasmamineral levels were also influenced by premix inclusion. Enzymes involved in micro-mineral uptake and metabolism (ferric reductase, cupric reductase and alkaline phosphatase) and oxidative stress markers (glutathione peroxidase, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase) were analysed in gill, intestine and liver. In fish reared in H-RAS, reduced glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and increased glutathione reductase (GR) activities were observed in liver and intestine, respectively. Activity of GPx in all the analysed tissues increased with premix supplementation. Differential regulation inmRNA expression of molecular markers related to micro-mineral uptake, metabolism and oxidative stress were observed in the tissues in response to RAS and premix inclusion. To conclude, fish reared in high accumulation RAS had higher mineral levels inwhole body and vertebrae, but did not result in a lower estimate of micro-minerals, except for Se. Difference in rearing systemhad multiple effects on the physiology andmetabolismof fish on the whole, apart from mineral balance alone. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Impacts of organic waste froma yellowtail cage farm on surface sediment and bottom water in Shido Bay (the Seto Inland Sea, Japan)	AQUACULTURE												The environmental impacts of a yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) culture on sediment and water qualities were investigated at an intensive cage farm located in a coastal ecosystem(Shido Bay, the Seto Inland Sea, Japan) during low and high feeding times. The experimental design involved the establishment of surrounding sites (10 m from the cages) and a transect extending away from the cage at 0, 10, 50, and 100 m. The organic matter depositions were measured using sediment traps. Surface sediments and bottom water characteristics were also described. The organic depositions of the yellowtail cage farm in Shido Bay on the sediment were quite significant compared to the control site (100 m from the cage) and extended to 10 m around the fish farms. Due to the high organic deposition under the cage, the surface sediment showed an elevated level of organic-enriched sediments, and led to an increase in the production of sulfides. Oxygen depletion of the bottom water was accompanied by organic-enriched sediments and production of high-acid volatile sulfide (AVS) contents in the surface sediments, and caused a significant increase in ammonium (NH4+) and phosphate (PO43-) concentrations in the bottom water. As a result, impacts of organic waste from a yellowtail cage on surface sediments and bottom water quality were clearly found in Shido Bay. Statement of relevance: Present study, the organic waste impacts of a yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) culture on sediment and water qualities were investigated at an intensive cage farm located in a coastal ecosystem (Shido Bay, the Seto Inland Sea, Japan) during low and high feeding times. The results indicated that dramatic impacts of organic waste from a yellowtail cage on surface sediments and bottom water differences in Shido Bay. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Mabaya, G; Unami, K; Fujihara, M				Mabaya, Goden; Unami, Koichi; Fujihara, Masayuki			Stochastic optimal control of agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Agriculture intensification through the use of chemical nitrogen fertilizers is contributing substantially to the tremendous increases in global food production. However, eutrophication of downstream waters associated with excess nitrate pollutant runoff has become a major environmental concern in agricultural areas. Reservoirs used for irrigation are well-positioned to intercept substantial fertilizer runoff from upslope agricultural fields. The authors hypothesized that such reservoirs can be used to influence the quality of downstream surface water. A Markov decision process was formulated to find optimal operating policies for controlling stochastic agrochemical pollutant loads in reservoirs for irrigation. The model was applied to an irrigation reservoir in Japan that is prone to nitrate pollution from upslope green tea plantations. The computational results reveal that, in all nitrate-nitrogen states in which the reservoir storage state is below 10%, the optimal policy is to introduce cleaner water supplements from the upstream reservoir. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate-nitrogen concentration is less than 3 mg/L, the optimal policy would be only to release the irrigation water. When the reservoir storage volume exceeds 35% of active capacity and when the nitrate nitrogen concentration exceeds 5 mg/L, the optimal operation decision is to first release irrigation water from the reservoir before introducing cleaner water supplements. Therefore, the operation of irrigation reservoirs can be optimized to control intercepted agro-fertilizer pollutants from intensive agricultural areas. The developed method for reservoir irrigation operation has the potential to support decision making processes to provide greater protection of the water environment from agrochemical pollution while sustaining the productivity in the intensive agricultural areas.

J	Liu, WF; Antonelli, M; Liu, XC; Yang, H				Liu, Wenfeng; Antonelli, Marta; Liu, Xingcai; Yang, Hong			Towards improvement of grey water footprint assessment: With an illustration for global maize cultivation	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The grey water footprint refers to the volume of water that is required to assimilate polluted water. It reflects the intensity of water pollution caused by water use for human activities. This study aims to address some major shortcomings associated with grey water footprint accounting in the literature and discuss several ways towards its improvement. Global maize production is used for illustration. The study specifically tackles three issues: the appropriate water quality standards for grey water footprint assessment; grey water footprint for multiple pollutants; and the influence of spatial resolution of the assessment on the level of grey water stress. A biophysical crop model is applied to quantify nitrogen and phosphorus losses to water in maize production on a global scale with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. The study shows that the grey water footprint calculation is highly Sensitive to the water standards applied. The results also suggest that the grey water footprint relating to nitrogen and phosphorus pollution caused by maize production alone has already exceeded their local water availability in many parts of the world. Grey water stress shows a more critical situation at the grid level than at the watershed level for maize cultivation because the former represents the local concentration whereas the latter gives the average situation of the whole watershed. This study highlights the need for standardizing the setting of water quality standards for a consistent grey water footprint assessment taking into consideration the diverse aquatic ecosystems and ambient water quality requirements across regions, as well as the presence of multiple pollutants in water bodies.

However, the detailed knowledge about the contribution of CWs to methane and nitrous oxide emissions in treating sewage treatment plant effluent are still limited in particular for a better understanding of the sustainability of CWs. The fluxes of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from free water surface (FWS) CWs in northern China were measured continuously using the static-stationary chamber technique from 2012 to 2013. The results showed that CWs were the significant source of CH4 and N2O emissions. Average emission rates of CH4 and N2O ranged from -30.2 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 450.9 mu g m(-2) h(-1), and -58.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1) to 1251.8 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Obvious annual and seasonal variations of CH4 and N2O emissions were observed over the 2-year period. In addition, temperatures and plant species had an impact on CH4 and N2O emissions. The obtained results showed that FINS CWs, improving water quality but emitting lower CH4 and N2O, could be the alternative method for sewage treatment plant effluent. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The design and evaluation of solutions for integrated surface water quality management requires an integrated modelling approach. Integrated models have to be comprehensive enough to cover the aspects relevant for management decisions, allowing for mapping of larger-scale processes such as climate change to the regional and local contexts. Besides this, models have to be sufficiently simple and fast to apply proper methods of uncertainty analysis, covering model structure deficits and error propagation through the chain of sub-models. Here, we present a new integrated catchment model satisfying both conditions. The conceptual "iWaQa" model was developed to support the integrated management of small streams. It can be used to predict traditional water quality parameters, such as nutrients and a wide set of organic micropollutants (plant and material protection products), by considering all major pollutant pathways in urban and agricultural environments. Due to its simplicity, the model allows for a full, propagative analysis of predictive uncertainty, including certain structural and input errors. The usefulness of the model is demonstrated by predicting future surface water quality in a small catchment with mixed land use in the Swiss Plateau. We consider climate change, population growth or decline, socio-economic development, and the implementation of management strategies to tackle urban and agricultural point and non-point sources of pollution. Our results indicate that input and model structure uncertainties are the most influential factors for certain water quality parameters. In these cases model uncertainty is already high for present conditions. Nevertheless, accounting for today's uncertainty makes management fairly robust to the foreseen range of potential changes in the next decades. The assessment of total predictive uncertainty allows for selecting management strategies that show small sensitivity to poorly known boundary conditions. The identification of important sources of uncertainty helps to guide future monitoring efforts and pinpoints key indicators, whose evolution should be closely followed to adapt management. The possible impact of climate change is clearly demonstrated by water quality substantially changing depending on single climate model chains. However, when all climate trajectories are combined, the human land use and management decisions have a larger influence on water quality against a time horizon of 2050 in the study.

Global warming and recurrent mass bleaching of corals	NATURE												During 2015-2016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching, the third global-scale event since mass bleaching was first documented in the 1980s. Here we examine how and why the severity of recurrent major bleaching events has varied at multiple scales, using aerial and underwater surveys of Australian reefs combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures. The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year. Water quality and fishing pressure had minimal effect on the unprecedented bleaching in 2016, suggesting that local protection of reefs affords little or no resistance to extreme heat. Similarly, past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is essential to secure a future for coral reefs.

J	Kong, P; Richardson, P; Hong, CX				Kong, Ping; Richardson, Patricia; Hong, Chuanxue			Diversity and community structure of cyanobacteria and other microbes in recycling irrigation reservoirs	PLOS ONE												Recycling irrigation reservoirs (RIRs) are emerging aquatic environments of global significance to crop production, water conservation and environmental sustainability. This study characterized the diversity and population structure of cyanobacteria and other detected microbes in water samples from eight RIRs and one adjacent runoff-free stream at three ornamental crop nurseries in eastern (VA1 and VA3) and central (VA2) Virginia after cloning and sequencing the 16S rRNA gene targeting cyanobacteria and chloroplast of eukaryotic phytoplankton. VA1 and VA2 utilize a multi-reservoir recycling irrigation system with runoff channeled to a sedimentation reservoir which then overflows into transition and retention reservoirs where water was pumped for irrigation. VA3 has a single sedimentation reservoir which was also used for irrigation. A total of 208 operational taxonomic units (OTU) were identified from clone libraries of the water samples. Among them, 53 OTUs (358 clones) were cyanobacteria comprising at least 12 genera dominated by Synechococcus species; 59 OTUs (387 clones) were eukaryotic phytoplankton including green algae and diatoms; and 96 were other bacteria (111 clones). Overall, cyanobacteria were dominant in sedimentation reservoirs, while eukaryotic phytoplankton and other bacteria were dominant in transition/ retention reservoirs and the stream, respectively. These results are direct evidence demonstrating the negative impact of nutrient-rich horticultural runoff, if not contained, on natural water resources. They also help in understanding the dynamics of water quality in RIRs and have practical implications. Although both single-and multi-reservoir recycling irrigation systems reduce the environmental footprint of horticultural production, the former is expected to have more cyanobacterial blooming, and consequently water quality issues, than the latter. Thus, a multi-reservoir recycling irrigation system should be preferred where feasible.																	1932-6203					MAR 16	2017	12	3							e0173903	10.1371/journal.pone.0173903								WOS:000396318300092	28301562

Use of fluorescence spectroscopy to control ozone dosage in recirculating aquaculture systems	WATER RESEARCH												The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of fluorescence spectroscopy to be used as an ozone dosage determination tool in recirculating aquaculture systems (RASs), by studying the relationship between fluorescence intensities and dissolved organic matter (DOM) degradation by ozone, in order to optimise ozonation treatment. Water samples from six different Danish facilities (two rearing units from a commercial trout RAS, a commercial eel RAS, a pilot RAS and two marine water aquariums) were treated with different O-3 dosages (1.0-20.0 mg/L ozone) in bench-scale experiments, following which fluorescence intensity degradation was eventually determined. Ozonation kinetic experiments showed that RAS water contains fluorescent organic matter, which is easily oxidised upon ozonation in relatively low concentrations (0-5 mg O-3/L). Fluorescence spectroscopy has a high level of sensitivity and selectivity in relation to associated fluorophores, and it is able to determine accurately the ozone demand of each system. The findings can potentially be used to design offline or online sensors based on the reduction by ozone of natural fluorescent-dissolved organic matter in RAS. The suggested indirect determination of ozone delivered into water can potentially contribute to a safer and more adequate ozone-based treatment to improve water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Exceptionally high organic nitrogen concentrations in a semi-arid South Texas estuary susceptible to brown tide blooms	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Studies of estuarine eutrophication have tended to focus on systems with continually flowing rivers, while little is known about estuaries from semi-arid/aridregions. Here we report results from an assessment of water quality conditions in Baffin Bay, Texas, a shallow (<2-3 m) subtropical estuary located in a semi-arid region that has agriculture as the dominant (44%) watershed land use. Chlorophyll a averaged 28-30 mu g/1 in Baffin Bay from 2003 to 2013 and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentrations were also very high (116-120 mu M), with concentrations of both variables exceeding those of most other Texas estuaries by 2-5 fold. More recent field sampling (2013-2015) showed that dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations in Baffin Bay (62 14 mu M) were >2 fold higher than in three other Texas estuaries. In contrast, inorganic nitrogen (ammonium, nitrate) and phosphate concentrations were relatively low. Statistically significant long-term annual increases in chlorophyll a and salinity were observed in Baffin Bay, while long-term seasonal increases were observed for water temperature and TKN. Overall, Baffin Bay is displaying multiple symptoms of eutrophication, namely very high organic carbon, organic nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations, as well as symptoms not quantified here such as fish kills and episodic hypoxia. Much of the increase in chlorophyll in Baffin Bay, at least since similar to 1990, have coincided with blooms of the mixotrophic phytoplankton species, Aureoumbra lagunensis, which is thought to be favored under high proportions of organic to inorganic nitrogen. Thus the high and possibly increasing organic nitrogen concentrations, coupled with a long-term annual increase in salinity and a long-term seasonal increase in water temperature are likely to promote additional brown tide blooms in this system in the future.

Satellite images and national agriculture censuses were used for a quantitative analysis of land use changes from 1974 to 2005, and a nutrient export coefficient approximation was used to determine long-term changes in annual loads. Several eutrophication indicators (water, sediment and autotrophic communities) were assessed seasonally in the lagoon basins during 2005 and 2006. The areal annual load of nutrients exported to the lagoons increased over time. Population and extensive livestock ranching were the most important nutrient sources, while agriculture is increasing in importance. 'Buffer effects of riparian forests on eutrophication indicators were observed in contrast to the wetlands surrounding the lagoons, which seem to be acting as a source of nutrients. Catchment size was inversely related to most eutrophication indicators. Afforestation and agriculture were found not to directly impact eutrophication indicators, however, catchments with larger agricultural areas showed higher concentrations of suspended solids, which may indicate the export of particulate nutrients. Salinity was inversely related to most eutrophication indicators, suggesting that the manipulation of the sand bar of the lagoons is a critical management issue. Sediment-related eutrophication indicators were more sensitive to changes in land uses and covers, in contrast with the more variable water column indicators, suggesting their potential use as enduring indicators. This research provides a rapid and integral assessment for qualitatively linking catchment changes with eutrophication indicators in coastal environments, which can easily be replicated to track pollutants in locations that lack standardized monitoring programs needed for more complex catchment modeling approaches.

Impact of roadside ditch dredging on bacterial communities and biological contamination of a tidal creek	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Tidal creek networks form the primary hydrologic link between estuaries and land-based activities on barrier islands. A possible impact from the excavation of drainage ditch systems on bacterial communities and biological contamination was studied in the water column and sediments of headwater, midstream, and mouth sites of the intertidal Oakdale Creek on Sapelo Island, GA. Community analysis was performed using the MiSeq Illumina platform and revealed that dredging was the cause of a significant rise in Proteobacteria, especially gamma-proteobacteria. Targeted biological contaminants included fecal indicator bacteria, Enterococcus spp. (Entero-1), pathogens, Shigella spp. (ipaH), and Salmonella spp (invA), virulence associated genes (VG's) of pathogenic E. coil (eaeA, hlyD, stx1, stx2, and set1B), integrons (intI1, intI2), and tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs). Incidence and gene concentrations of Shigella spp., eaeA and set1B, and of TRGs increased 3-20 folds after the onset of dredging, and followed the dredging schedule. Principal Component Analysis suggested possible common carriers for Shigella spp., some TRGt, and the pathogenic E. coli eaeA gene. At the site of dredging, all of the above contaminants were detected at high concentrations.

J	Huang, GX; Falconer, RA; Lin, BL				Huang, Guoxian; Falconer, Roger A.; Lin, Binliang			Integrated hydro-bacterial modelling for predicting bathing water quality	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												In recent years health risks associated with the non-compliance of bathing water quality have received increasing worldwide attention. However, it is particularly challenging to establish the source of any non-compliance, due to the complex nature of the source of faecal indicator organisms, and the fate and delivery processes and scarcity of field measured data in many catchments and estuaries. In the current study an integrated hydro-bacterial model, linking a catchment, 1-D model and 2-D model were integrated to simulate the adsorption-desorption processes of faecal bacteria to and from sediment particles in river, estuarine and coastal waters, respectively. The model was then validated using hydrodynamic, sediment and faecal bacteria concentration data, measured in 2012, in the Ribble river and estuary, and along the Fylde coast, UK. Particular emphasis has been placed on the mechanism of faecal bacteria transport and decay through the deposition and resuspension of suspended sediments. The results showed that by coupling the E.coli concentration with the sediment transport processes, the accuracy of the predicted E.coli levels was improved. A series of scenario runs were then carried out to investigate the impacts of different management scenarios on the E.coli concentration levels in the coastal bathing water sites around Liverpool Bay, UK. The model results show that the level of compliance with the new EU bathing water standards can be improved significantly by extending outfalls and/or reducing urban sources by typically 50%.

J	Xu, HL; Jiang, Y; Xu, GJ; Warren, A				Xu, Henglong; Jiang, Yong; Xu, Guangjian; Warren, Alan			Indication of spatial variations in annual cycles of functional groups of planktonic ciliates to environmental change in marine ecosystems	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The indication of spatial variations in annual cycles of functional groups of planktonic ciliates to environmental changes was studied in a bay, northern Yellow Sea. Samples were biweekly collected at five stations with different hydrographic conditions during a 1-year cycle. The second-stage-matrix-based multivariate approach was used to summarize the internal interactions of the ciliate functional groups among five stations during a 1-year period. The functional groups of the ciliates represented a clear spatial variation in annual cycle among five stations. Mantel analysis demonstrated that the spatial variation in annual cycles of the ciliate functional groups were significantly correlated with the changes nutrients (mainly soluble reactive phosphates and nitrates), alone or in combination with salinity among five stations. Based the results, it is suggested that the spatial variation in annual cycles of functional groups of planktonic ciliates may indicated the changes of hydrographic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased phytoplankton food resulting from eutrophication is suggested to enhance larval survival. We addressed the hypothesis that larval success is associated with particular chl-a levels in tightly controlled larval:algal conditions. We used chl-a conditions found on coral reefs (0.1-5.0 mu g chl-a L-1), including nominal threshold levels for disproportionate larval success (>= 1.0 mu g chl-a L-1). High success to the juvenile occurred across an order of magnitude of chl-a concentrations (0.5-5.0 mu g chl-a L-1), suggesting there may not be a narrow value for optimal success. Oligotrophic conditions (0.1 mu g chl-a L-1) appeared to be a critical limit. With a review of the evidence, we suggest that opportunistic COTS larvae may be more resilient to low food levels than previously appreciated. Initiation of outbreak populations need not require eutrophic conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, WB; Liu, WC				Chen, Wei-Bo; Liu, Wen-Cheng			Investigating the fate and transport of fecal coliform contamination in a tidal estuarine system using a three-dimensional model	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A three-dimensional fecal coliform transport model was developed and incorporated into a hydrodynamic and suspended sediment transport model to better understand the microbiological water quality in the tidal Tamsui River estuarine system of northern Taiwan, which includes three main tributaries: Dahan River, Xindian River, and Keelung River. The model was calibrated using the water level, salinity, suspended sediment concentration, and fecal coliform data measured in 2010. The predictive skill, a statistical approach, is used to evaluate the model performance. There was quantitatively good agreement between the simulation and measurement results. Further, the calibrated model underwent model sensitivity analysis by varying the model parameters which include the settling velocity, darkness decay rate, partition coefficient, and fecal coliform concentration in the sediment bed. The results indicated that the settling velocity played the most important role in affecting fecal coliform concentrations followed by partition coefficient, darkness decay rate, and fecal coliform concentration in the sediment bed. The model was also used to investigate the effects of salinity and suspended sediment on fecal coliform contamination. The salinity module was excluded in the simulations, resulting in an increase of fecal coliform concentration. However the effect of salinity on fecal coliform concentration is minor. If the suspended sediment transport was excluded in the simulations, the predicted results of fecal coliform concentration decrease to be underestimated the measured data. The modeling results revealed that the inclusion of the suspended sediment transport model in the simulations was of crucial importance because the fecal coliform concentrations were significantly influenced by the suspended sediment concentration in the estuarine system.

J	Karan, S; Sebok, E; Engesgaard, P				Karan, Sachin; Sebok, Eva; Engesgaard, Peter			Air/water/sediment temperature contrasts in small streams to identify groundwater seepage locations	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The need to identify groundwater seepage locations is of great importance for managing both stream water quality and groundwater sourced ecosystems due to their dependency on groundwater-borne nutrients and temperatures. Although several reconnaissance methods using temperature as tracer exist, these are subjected to limitations related to mainly the spatial and temporal resolution and/or mixing of groundwater and surface water leading to dilution of the temperature differences. Further, some methods, for example, thermal imagery and fiber optic distributed temperature sensing, although relative efficient in detecting temperature differences over larger distances, these are labor-intensive and costly. Therefore, there is a need for additional cost-effective methods identifying substantial groundwater seepage locations. We present a method expanding the linear regression of air and stream temperatures by measuring the temperatures in dual-depth; in the stream column and at the streambed-water interface (SWI). By doing so, we apply metrics from linear regression analysis of temperatures between air/stream and air/SWI (linear regression slope, intercept, and coefficient of determination), and the daily water temperature cycle (daily mean temperatures, temperature variance, and the mean diel temperature fluctuation). We show that using metrics from only single-depth stream temperature measurements are insufficient to identify substantial groundwater seepage locations in a head-water stream. Conversely, comparing the metrics from dual-depth temperatures show significant differences; at groundwater seepage locations, temperatures at the SWI merely explain 43-75% of the variation opposed to 91% at the corresponding stream column temperatures. In general, at these locations at the SWI, the slopes (<0.25) and intercepts (>6.5 degrees C) are substantially lower and higher, respectively, while the mean diel temperature fluctuations (<0.98 degrees C) are decreased compared to remaining locations. The dual-depth approach was applied in a post-glacial fluvial setting, where metrics analyses overall corroborated with field measurements of groundwater fluxes and stream flow accretions. Thus, we propose a method reliably identifying groundwater seepage locations along streambeds in such settings.

It is therefore important to assess any hydrologic trends in urban catchments for stormwater management and planning. This study addresses urban hydrological trend analysis by examining trends in variables that characterize hydrological processes. The original and modified Mann-Kendall methods are applied to trend detection in two French catchments, that is, Chassieu and La Lechere, based on approximately 1decade of data from local monitoring programs. In both catchments, no trend is found in the major hydrological process driver (i.e., rainfall variables), whereas increasing trends are detected in runoff flow rates. As a consequence, the runoff coefficients tend to increase during the study period, probably due to growing imperviousness with the local urbanization process. In addition, conceptual urban rainfall-runoff model parameters, which are identified via model calibration with an event based approach, are examined. Trend detection results indicate that there is no trend in the time of concentration in Chassieu, whereas a decreasing trend is present in La Lechere, which, however, needs to be validated with additional data. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the original Mann-Kendall method is not sensitive to a few noisy values in the data series.

J	Hurkamp, K; Tafelmeier, S; Tschiersch, J				Huerkamp, Kerstin; Tafelmeier, Stefanie; Tschiersch, Jochen			Influence of melt-freeze-cycles on the radionuclide transport in homogeneous laboratory snowpack	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Radionuclides released to the environment and deposited with or onto snow can be stored over long time periods if ambient temperature stays low, particularly in glaciated areas or high alpine sites. The radionuclides will be accumulated in the snowpack during the winter unless meltwater runoff at the snow base occurs. They will be released to surface waters within short time during snowmelt in spring. In two experiments under controlled melting conditions of snow in the laboratory, radionuclide migration and runoff during melt-freeze-cycles were examined. The distribution of Cs-134 and Sr-85 tracers in homogeneous snow columns and their fractionation and potential preferential elution in the first meltwater portions were determined. Transport was associated with the percolation of meltwater at ambient temperatures above 0 degrees C after the snowpack became ripe. Mean migration velocities in the pack were examined for both nuclides to about 0.5cmhr(-1) after one diurnal melt-freeze-cycle at ambient temperatures of -2to 4 degrees C. Meltwater fluxes were calculated with a median of 1.68cmhr(-1). Highly contaminated portions of meltwater with concentration factors between 5 and 10 against initial bulk concentrations in the snowpack were released as ionic pulse with the first meltwater. Neither for caesium nor strontium preferential elution was observed. After recurrent simulated day-night-cycles (-2 to 4 degrees C), 80% of both radionuclides was released with the first 20% of snowmelt within 4days. 50% of Cs-134 and Sr-85 were already set free after 24hr. Snowmelt contained highest specific activities when the melt rate was lowest during the freeze-cycles due to concentration processes in remaining liquids, enhanced by the melt-freeze-cycling. This implies for natural snowpack after significant radionuclide releases, that long-time accumulation of radionuclides in the snow during frost periods, followed by an onset of steady meltwater runoff at low melt rates, will cause the most pronounced removal of the contaminants from the snow cover. This scenario represents the worst case of impact on water quality and radiation exposure in aquatic environments.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				MAR 15	2017	31	6					1360	1370		10.1002/hyp.11110								WOS:000395628600012

Dissolved nitrous oxide (N2O) dynamics in agricultural field drains and headwater streams in an intensive arable catchment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions produced by nitrogen (N) leaching into surface water and groundwater bodies are poorly understood in comparison to direct N2O emissions from soils. In this study, dissolved N2O concentrations were measured weekly in both lowland headwater streams and subsurface agricultural field drain discharges over a 2-year period (2013-2015) in an intensive arable catchment, Norfolk, UK. All field drain and stream water samples were found to have dissolved N2O concentrations higher than the water-air equilibrium concentration, illustrating that all sites were acting as a net source of N2O emissions to the atmosphere. Soil texture was found to significantly influence field drain N2O dynamics, with mean concentrations from drains in clay loam soils (5.3gNL(-1)) being greater than drains in sandy loam soils (4.0gNL(-1)). Soil texture also impacted upon the relationships between field drain N2O concentrations and other water quality parameters (pH, flow rate, and nitrate (NO3) and nitrite (NO2) concentrations), highlighting possible differences in N2O production mechanisms in different soil types. Catchment antecedent moisture conditions influenced the storm event mobilisation of N2O in both field drains and streams, with the greatest concentration increases recorded during precipitation events preceded by prolonged wet conditions. N2O concentrations also varied seasonally, with the lowest mean concentrations typically occurring during the summer months (JJA). Nitrogen fertiliser application rates and different soil inversion regimes were found to have no effect on dissolved N2O concentrations, whereas higher N2O concentrations recorded in field drains under a winter cover crop compared to fallow fields revealed cover crops are an ineffective greenhouse gas emission mitigation strategy. Overall, this study highlights the complex interactions governing the dynamics of dissolved N2O concentrations in field drains and headwater streams in a lowland intensive agricultural catchment.

Hypothetical scenario exercises to improve planning and readiness for drinking water quality management during extreme weather events	WATER RESEARCH												Two hypothetical scenario exercises were designed and conducted to reflect the increasingly extreme weather-related challenges faced by water utilities as the global climate changes. The first event was based on an extreme flood scenario. The second scenario involved a combination of weather events, including a wild forest fire ('bushfire') followed by runoff due to significant rainfall. For each scenario, a panel of diverse personnel from water utilities and relevant agencies (e.g. health departments) formed a hypothetical water utility and associated regulatory body to manage water quality following the simulated extreme weather event. A larger audience participated by asking questions and contributing key insights. Participants were confronted with unanticipated developments as the simulated scenarios unfolded, introduced by a facilitator. Participants were presented with information that may have challenged their conventional experiences regarding operational procedures in order to identify limitations in current procedures, assumptions, and readily available information. The process worked toward the identification of a list of specific key lessons for each event. At the conclusion of each simulation a facilitated discussion was used to establish key lessons of value to water utilities in preparing them for similar future extreme events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the possibility of using pre-ozonation instead of post-ozonation for the removal of micropollutants was explored because of the lower risk of forming carcinogenic bromate. A 1.0 m(3)/h pilot system was utilized to compare the efficacy of pre- and post-ozonation in the removal of bulk organic pollutants as well as micropollutants, including typical odor-causing compounds, pharmaceuticals, and typical pesticides, from one source water (Huangpu River) characterized by the occurrence of various micropollutants. Both pre-ozonation and post-ozonation could achieve similar water purification performance under an ozone dose of 1.5 mg/L, in terms of bulk water quality parameters like CODMn, (66% in combination with biological activated carbon (BAC) treatment, compared to 62% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) or micropollutants including 27 pharmaceuticals (85% in combination with BAC compared to 87% with the pre-ozonation-BAC combination) and 25 pesticides (72% in combination with BAC compared to 61% with the preozonation-BAC combination). Pre-ozonation exhibited slightly better odorant removal performance (100% in combination with BAC compared to 92% with the post-ozonation-BAC combination); however, post-ozonation generated approximately 6.0 mu g/L bromate at an ozone dose of 2.0 mg/L, while pre-ozonation did not form bromate even at an ozone dose as high as 3.0 mg/L. So pre-ozonation in combination with BAC might be a solution for the removal of micropollutants from source water with high bromate formation risk. The results of this study will be helpful for the optimization of ozonation processes in the water supply industry. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Microbial source tracking in shellfish harvesting waters in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica	WATER RESEARCH												Current microbial water quality monitoring is generally limited to culture-based measurements of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). Given the many possible sources of fecal pollution within a watershed and extra intestinal FIB reservoirs, it is important to determine source(s) of fecal pollution as a means to improve water quality and protect public health. The principal objective of this investigation was to characterize the microbial water quality of shellfish harvesting areas in the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica during 2015. In order to achieve this objective, the specificity and sensitivity of 11 existing microbial source tracking (MST) PCR assays, associated with cows (BacCow), dogs (BacCan, DogBac), domestic wastewater (PMMoV), general avian (GFD), gulls (Gull2), horses (HorseBac, HoF), humans (HF183, HPyV), and pigs (PF), were evaluated using domestic wastewater and animal fecal samples collected from the region. The sensitivity of animal-associated assays ranged from 13 to 100%, while assay specificity ranged from 38 to 100%. The specificity of pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and human polyomavirus (HPyV) was 100% for domestic wastewater, as compared to 94% specificity of the HF183 Bacteroidales marker. PMMoV was identified as a useful domestic wastewater-associated marker, with concentrations as high as 1.1 x 10(5) copies/ml and 100% sensitivity and specificity. Monthly surface water samples collected from four shellfish harvesting areas were analyzed using culture-based methods for Escherichia coli as well as molecular methods for FIB and a suite of MST markers, which were selected for their specificity in the region. While culturable E. coli results suggested possible fecal pollution during the monitoring period, the absence of human/domestic wastewater-associated markers and low FIB concentrations determined using molecular methods indicated sufficient microbial water quality for shellfish harvesting. This is the first study to our knowledge to test the performance of MST markers in Costa Rica as well as in Central America. Given the lack of wastewater treatment and the presence of secondary sources of FIB, this study highlights the importance of an MST toolbox approach to characterize water quality in tropical regions. Furthermore, it confirms and extends the geographic range of PMMoV as an effective tool for monitoring domestic wastewater pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of the dry and wet weather recreational health risks in a semi-enclosed marine embayment in Southern California	WATER RESEARCH												For many coastal regions around the world, recreational beach water quality is assessed using fecal indicator bacteria (FIB). However, the utility of FIB as indicators of recreational water illness (RWI) risk has been questioned, particularly in coastal settings with no obvious sources of human sewage. In this study we employed a source-apportionment quantitative microbial risk assessment (SA-QMRA) to assess RWI risk at a popular semi-enclosed recreational beach in Southern California (Baby Beach, City of Dana Point) with no obvious point sources of human sewage. Our SA-QMRA results suggest that, during dry weather, the median RWI risk at this beach is below the U.S. EPA recreational water quality criteria (RWQC) of 36 illness cases per 1000 bathers. During wet weather, the median RWI risk predicted by SA-QMRA depends on the assumed level of human waste associated with stormwater; the RWI risk is below the EPA RWQC illness risk benchmark 100% of the time provided that <2% of the FIB in stormwater are of human origin. However, these QMRA outcomes contrast strongly with the EPA RWQC for 30-day geometric mean of enterococci bacteria. Our results suggest that SA-QMRA is a useful framework for estimating robust RWI risk that takes into account local information about possible human and non-human sources of FIB.

Spatio-temporal variability and the impact of Phailin on water quality of Chilika lagoon	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Chilika, Asia's largest brackish water lagoon was studied for 4 years (2011-2015) to understand the variability of water quality and the impact of a very severe cyclone storm "Phailin" (Category-5). During the study period environmental variables exhibited a significant variation among sectors, seasons, and years (p < 0.05, n=1440). Correlation matrix showed the major source of phosphate in Chilika were from in situ processes whereas, nitrate and silicate were from the riverine influx. Principal component analysis revealed that the biological factor and riverine flux mostly controlled the water quality. The overall 'water quality Index' indicated that the ecological health of the Chilika lagoon was "Good". The Phailin had a notable impact on water quality as substantiated by the trends of several parameters. The decrease in nitrate and phosphate after Phailin was attributed to dilution by low nutrient freshwater flux from major rivers whereas, the significant increase in reactive silicate was attributed to mixing of silicate enriched fresh water. Post Phailin increase in dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a was attributed to wind-induced mixing and resuspension of benthic chlorophyll respectively. A substantial change of nutrient stoichiometry and decrease in photic depth after Phailin resulted a pull down of primary productivity in the Chilika lagoon.																	0278-4343	1873-6955				MAR 15	2017	136						39	56		10.1016/j.csr.2017.01.019								WOS:000397692300004

Using Landsat to extend the historical record of lacustrine phytoplankton blooms: A Lake Erie case study	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Long-term records of phytoplankton blooms in freshwater lakes are necessary both for understanding basin scale changes to watersheds and for providing a key constraint for assessing processes driving blooms. However, due to the inherent constraints of in situ sampling and the short time period covered by modem space borne sensors, few long-term records exist. Historical data from sensors such as Landsat offer strong potential for creating new records of past blooms. Here, we use a novel evaluation procedure based on multiple metrics to assess algorithm suitability and robustness for generating long-term bloom records using Landsat 5 imagery. Evaluation metrics are based on bloom presence, spatial distribution, magnitude and timing, using both in situ Microcystis biovolume and remotely-sensed Cyanobacterial Index (CI) data from MERIS for 2002-2011. Applying this procedure for a test case focusing on Lake Erie's western basin, an algorithm based on a near infrared threshold with simple atmospheric correction through subtraction of the shortwave infrared band, combined with an additional "greenness" filter based on a hue threshold, performs best. Implementing this algorithm for 1984-2001 reveals the long-term trends in peak bloom magnitude prior to the start of the MERIS and MODIS record (2002-2015), and more than doubles the period of record that can be used to understand bloom occurrence and growth for this system. More broadly, we demonstrate that Landsat observations can be used to identify macro-scale features of blooms. For Lake Erie, the performance of the final Landsat algorithm is comparable to that of the MERIS CI algorithm, despite Landsat's broad spectral bands and long revisit time. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J	Li, SY; Cooke, RA; Wang, L; Ma, F; Bhattarai, R				Li, Shiyang; Cooke, Richard A.; Wang, Li; Ma, Fang; Bhattarai, Rabin			Characterization of fly ash ceramic pellet for phosphorus removal	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Phosphorus has been recognized as a leading pollutant for surface water quality deterioration. In the Midwestern USA, subsurface drainage not only provides a pathway for excess water to leave the field but it also drains out nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Fly ash has been identified as one of the viable materials for phosphorus removal from contaminated waters. In this study, a ceramic pellet was manufactured using fly ash for P absorption. Three types of pellet with varying lime and clay proportions by weight (type 1: 10% lime + 30% clay, type 2: 20% lime + 20% clay, and type 3: 30% lime + 10% clay) were characterized and evaluated for absorption efficiency. The result showed that type 3 pellet (60% fly ash with 30% lime and 10% clay) had the highest porosity (14%) and absorption efficiency and saturated absorption capacity (1.98 mg P/g pellet) compared to type 1 and 2 pellets. The heavy metal leaching was the least (30 mu g/L of chromium after 5 h) for type 3 pellet compared to other two. The microcosmic structure of pellet from scanning electron microscope showed the type 3 pellet had the better distribution of aluminum and iron oxide on the surface compared other two pellets. This result indicates that addition of lime and clay can improve P absorption capacity of fly ash while reducing the potential to reduce chromium leaching. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed framework selects building sites that can maximize the benefits of green roofs, based not only on the socio-economic and environmental benefits to urban residents, but also on the provision of urban foraging sites for honeybees. The framework comprises three steps. First, building 'candidates for green roofs are selected considering the building type. Second, the selected building candidates are ranked in terms of their expected socio-economic and environmental effects. The benefits of green roofs are improved energy efficiency and air quality, reduction of urban flood risk and infrastructure improvement costs, reuse of storm water, and creation of space for education and leisure. Furthermore, the estimated cost of installing green roofs is also considered. We employ spatial data to determine the expected effects of green roofs on each building unit, because the benefits and costs may vary depending on the location of the building. This is due to the heterogeneous spatial conditions. In the third step, the final building sites are proposed by solving the maximal covering location problem (MCLP) to determine the optimal locations for green roofs as urban honeybee foraging sites. As an illustrative example, we apply,the proposed framework in Seoul, Korea. This new framework is expected to contribute to sustainable urban ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A GIS policy approach for assessing the effect of fertilizers on the quality of drinking and irrigation water and wellhead protection zones (Crete, Greece)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Fertilizers have undoubtedly contributed to the significant increase in yields worldwide and therefore to the considerable improvement of quality of life of man and animals. Today, attention is focussed on the risks imposed by agricultural fertilizers. These effects include the dissolution and transport of excess quantities of fertilizer major- and trace-elements to the groundwater that deteriorate the quality of drinking and irrigation water. In this study, a map for the Fertilizer Water Pollution Index (FWPI) was generated for assessing the impact of agricultural fertilizers on drinking and irrigation water quality. The proposed methodology was applied to one of the most intensively cultivated with tree crops area in Crete (Greece) where potential pollutant loads are derived exclusively from agricultural activities and groundwater is the main water source. In this region of 215 km(2), groundwater sampling data from 235 wells were collected over a 15-year time period and analyzed for the presence of anionic (NO (-3), P0(-3)4) and cationic (K+1, Fe+2, mn(+2,) zn(+2), Cu+3, B+3) fertilizer trace elements. These chemicals are the components of the primary fertilizers used in local tree crop production. Eight factors/maps were considered in order to estimate the spatial distribution of groundwater contamination for each fertilizer element. The eight factors combined were used to generate the Fertilizer Water Pollution Index (FWPI) map indicating the areas with drinking/irrigation water pollution due to the high groundwater contamination caused by excessive fertilizer use. Moreover; by taking into consideration the groundwater flow direction and seepage velocity, the pathway through which groundwater supply become polluted can be predicted. The groundwater quality results show that a small part of the study area, about 8 km(2) (3.72%), is polluted or moderately polluted by the excessive use of fertilizers. Considering that in this area drinking water sources (wells) are located, this study highlights an analytic method for delineation wellhead protection zones. All these approaches were incorporated in a useful GIS decision support system that aids decision makers in the difficult task of protection groundwater resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Bivalve molluscs quality depends mainly on the water quality, and then by a series of factors such as water temperature and salinity, gametogenic cycle, food availability, and environmental conditions, that affect the Condition Index. In this work crude extracts obtained from the edible part of Chamelea gallina and Tapes philippinarum were analyzed by a proteomic approach based on a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, in order to detect biomarkers useful for identification of the two kinds of clams and to assess their nutritional characteristics. As a result, four differentially expressed spots were found and identified, namely enolase, cyclophilin-A, ribosomal protein L13 and actin-1. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has been challenging to simultaneously realize low-cost, portable, rapid and highly sensitive DBPs detection. Here, we report miniaturized electronic sensors for detecting trace amounts of analytes in water, which are fabricated with covalently modified double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). The sensors presented ultrahigh sensitivity to halogenated DBPs, and exhibited a detecting level for dibromoacetic acid (DBAA), a typical halogenated DBPs, of lower than 1 part per trillion (10(-12) w/v). The selectivity of the sensors can be tuned by adjusting the functional groups modified on the outer wall of the DWCNTs. The sensor based on amino group-modified DWCNTs showed a selective response to halogenated DBPs. Real-time detection has been further demonstrated by using the device integrated with a microfluidic channel, and the sensor showed a rapid and sensitive response to 10 parts per billion DBAA in aqueous elution. Therefore, this work not only achieved portable, rapid and simple water quality monitoring in daily life, but also, by taking advantage of unique chemical diversity and bilayer structure of functionalized DWCNTs, provided a promising sensor platform especially for trace amount of analytes in solutions.

A novel quantile method reveals spatiotemporal shifts in phytoplankton biomass descriptors between bloom and non-bloom conditions in a subtropical estuary	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Estuarine environments support dynamic phytoplankton blooms, especially in lowlatitude regions, where the effects of local drivers dominate. Identifying key bloom drivers from entangled ecological and anthropogenic influences is particularly challenging in stressed systems where several disturbances interact. Additionally, processes controlling bloom and non-bloom phytoplankton biomass dynamics can differ spatially, further confounding characterization of disturbance regimes that create bloom-favorable conditions. This study aims to explore the question of whether the shift from non-bloom to bloom conditions is matched by a shift in the relative importance of water quality drivers. Florida Bay (USA), a shallow subtropical inner shelf lagoon, was chosen as the study site due to its unique bloom dynamics and low-latitude location, as well as for the availability of long-term (16 yr) water quality data consisting of monthly measurements from 28 locations across the 2200 km(2) bay. At each of the locations, we applied a novel thresholdbased quantile regression analysis to chlorophyll a data to define bloom conditions, separate data from non-bloom conditions, and evaluate phytoplankton biomass dynamics of each of the 2 states. The final suite of explanatory covariates revealed spatial trends and differences in the relative importance of water quality descriptors of phytoplankton between the 2 conditions. The effects of turbidity and salinity on phytoplankton biomass became pronounced during blooms, whereas non-bloom conditions were primarily explained by autoregressive phytoplankton biomass trends and nutrient dynamics. The proposed analytical approach is not limited to any particular aquatic system type, and can be used to produce practical spatiotemporal information to guide management, restoration, and conservation efforts.

Methods: A total number of 48 seawater and sediment samples were taken from 8 stations (each site 6 times with an interval time of 2 weeks) between June and September 2014. Seawater and sediment samples were collected from 30 cm under the surface samples and different sediment depths (0, 4, 7, 10, 15, and 20 cm) respectively, along the Persian Gulf in Bushehr coastal areas. Results: Based on the results, the average numbers of bacterial indicators including total coliform, fecal coliform, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as well as HPC in seawater samples were 1238.13, 150.87, 8.22 MPN/100 ml and 1742.91 CFU/ ml, respectively, and in sediment samples at different depths (from 0-20 cm) varied between 25 x 10(3) to 51.67 x 10(3), 5.63 x 10(3) to 12.46 x 10(3), 17.33 to 65 MPN/100 ml, 36 x 10(3) to 147.5 x 10(3) CFU/ml, respectively. There were no statistically significant relationships between the indicator organism concentration levels with temperature as well as pH value of seawater. A reverse correlation was found between the level of indicator bacteria and salinity of seawater samples. Also results revealed that the sediment texture influenced abundance of indicators bacteria in sediments. As the concentration levels of indicators bacteria were higher in muddy sediments compare with sandy ones. Conclusion: Result conducted Bushehr coastal sediments constitute a reservoir of indicator bacteria, therefore, whole of the indicators determined were distinguished to be present in higher levels in sediments than in the overlying seawater. It was concluded that the concentration levels of microbial indicators decreased with depth in sediments. Except total coliform, the numbers of other bacteria including fecal coliform, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and HPC bacteria significantly declined in the depth between 10 and 15 cm.

Cumulative effects of suspended sediments, organic nutrients and temperature stress on early life history stages of the coral Acropora tenuis	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Coral reproduction is vulnerable to both declining water quality and warming temperatures, with simultaneous exposures likely compounding the negative impact of each stressor. We investigated how early life processes of the coral Acropora tenuis respond to increasing levels of suspended sediments in combination with temperature or organic nutrients. Fertilization success and embryo development were more sensitive to suspended sediments than to high temperatures or nutrient enrichment, while larval development (after acquisition of cilia) and settlement success were predominantly affected by thermal stress. Fertilization success was reduced 80% by suspended sediments, and up to 24% by temperature, while the addition of nutrients to suspended sediments had no further impact. Larval survivorship was unaffected by any of these treatments. However, settlement success of larvae developing from treatment-exposed embryos was negatively affected by all three stressors (e.g. up to 55% by suspended sediments), while exposure only during later larval stages predominantly responded to temperature stress. Environmentally relevant levels of suspended sediments and temperature had the greatest impacts, affecting more processes than the combined impacts of sediments and nutrients. These results suggest that management strategies to maintain suspended sediments at low concentrations during coral spawning events will benefit coral recruitment, especially with warming climate.

In this research, a simple but comprehensive process-based model was developed for simulating the water flow and nitrogen dynamics. Processes considered in this model included all the important processes involved in nitrogen transformations, as well as nitrogen transport. Nitrogen transformation processes comprised fertilizer dissolution, nitrification, denitrification, ammonium volatilization, mineralization and immobilization. The nitrogen transport processes included nitrogen uptake by the plant, soil adsorption, upward flux, surface runoff losses and drain losses in the fields with the drainage network. For model evaluation, the measured data obtained from Imam agro-industrial Company, in Khuzestan, Iran, were used. Computed RMSE of the simulated water table, the drainage discharge rate, nitrate and ammonium concentration in drainage water were determined to be 14.58 cm,1.82 mm/day,1.73 mg/L and 0.48 mg/L, respectively. The results indicated a good agreement between the observed and simulated data. This model could be, therefore, used for fertilizer management, thereby reducing the concentration of nitrate and ammonium in the drainage water and helping to prevent the environmental pollution.

To perform some of these analyses outside of well-resourced laboratories, it is necessary to create robust and cost-effective alternatives to existing high-end laboratory-bound imaging and sensing equipment. Towards this aim, we have designed a holographic on-chip microscope operating at an ultraviolet illumination wavelength (UV) of 266 nm. The increased forward scattering from nanoscale objects at this short wavelength has enabled us to detect individual sub-30 nm nanoparticles over a large field-of- view of > 16 mm(2) using an on-chip imaging platform, where the sample is placed at <= 0.5 mm away from the active area of an opto-electronic sensor-array, without any lenses in between. The strong absorption of this UV wavelength by biomolecules including nucleic acids and proteins has further enabled high-contrast imaging of nanoscopic aggregates of biomolecules, e.g., of enzyme Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, abnormal aggregation of which is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-a fatal neurodegenerative disease. This UV-based wide-field computational imaging platform could be valuable for numerous applications in biomedical sciences and environmental monitoring, including disease diagnostics, viral load measurements as well as air-and water-quality assessment.

Using only filter-feeding fish for algal suppression and water quality control was more effective in the short-term, but use of both filter-feeding fish and piscivorous fish was better in the long-term. Obvious suppression of phytoplankton biomass (PB) only occurred during the first 14 days regardless of the fish stocked. Adding fish to the enclosure clearly alters phytoplankton community structure and introducing piscivorous fish to an enclosure stocked with filter-feeding fish changed the relative densities of dominant algae species. While stocking filter-feeding fish decreased total nitrogen concentration by removing phytoplankton, it did not effectively decrease total phosphorus and Chlorophyll a concentrations. Introducing piscivorous fish to the enclosure weakened the relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton. Results indicate that stocking only filter-feeding fish to improve water quality and suppress phytoplankton in an impoundment area is insufficient and other technologies and means should be applied simultaneously.																	1932-6203					MAR 8	2017	12	3							e0171953	10.1371/journal.pone.0171953								WOS:000396073700064	28273091

Here, we have developed a novel label array method for the counting and differentiation of bacterial species. This method is based on the nonspecific interactions of multiple unstable lanthanide chelates and selected chemicals within the sample leading to a luminescence signal profile that is unique to the bacterial species. It is simple, cost-effective, and/or userfriendly compared to many existing methods, such as plate counts on selective media, automatic (hemocytometer-based) cell counters, flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods for identification. The performance of the method was demonstrated with nine single strains of bacteria in pure culture. The limit of detection for counting was below 1000 bacteria per mL, with an average coefficient of variation of 10% achieved with the developed label array. A predictive model was trained with the measured luminescence signals and its ability to differentiate all tested bacterial species from each other, including members of the same genus Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus subtilis, was confirmed via leave-one-out cross-validation. The suitability of the method for analysis of mixtures of bacterial species was shown with ternary mixtures of Bacillus licheniformis, Escherichia coli JM109, and Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC PTA 4659. The potential future application of the method could be monitoring for contamination in pure cultures; analysis of mixed bacterial cultures, where examining one species in the presence of another could inform industrial microbial processes; and the analysis of bacterial biofilms, where nonspecific methods based on physical and chemical characteristics are required instead of methods specific to individual bacterial species.																	0003-2700	1520-6882				MAR 7	2017	89	5					3208	3216		10.1021/acs.analchem.6b05142								WOS:000395964400074	28194955

Yet understanding the influence of water quality on zooplankton under field-conditions is hindered by traditional labor-intensive approaches that are prone to incomplete or uncertain taxonomic determinations. Here, for the first time, an eco-genomic approach, based on genetic diversity in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) region of DNA of zooplankton was used to develop a site-specific, water quality criterion (WQC) for ammonia (NH3). Ammonia has been recognized as a primary stressor in the catchment of the large, eutrophic Tai Lake, China. Nutrients, especially NH3 and nitrite (NO3-) had more significant effects on structure of the zooplankton community than did other environmental factors. Abundances of rotifers increased along a gradient of increasing concentrations of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), while abundances of copepods and cladocera decreased. A novel, rapid, species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach based on operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was established to develop a WQC for NH3. The WQC based on OTUs was consistent with the WQC based on the traditional morphology taxonomy approach. This genetics-based SSD approach could be a useful tool for monitoring for status and trends in species composition and deriving ecological criteria and an efficient biomonitoring tool to protect local aquatic ecosystems in virtually any aquatic ecosystem.

The study lasted for almost two years and was aimed at assessing the impact of the SSB on the fauna of the Argen River, which is a tributary of Lake Constance. Two sampling sites were examined up- and downstream of the SSB effluent. A combination of different diagnostic methods (fish embryo test with the zebrafish, histopathology, micronucleus test) was applied to investigate health impairment and genotoxic effects in indigenous fish as well as embryotoxic potentials in surface water and sediment samples of the Argen River, respectively, in samples of the SSB effluent. In addition, sediment samples from the Argen River and tissues of indigenous fish were used for chemical analyses of 33 frequently occurring pollutants by means of gas chromatography. Furthermore, the integrity of the macrozoobenthos community and the fish population were examined at both investigated sampling sites. Results: The chemical analyses revealed a toxic burden with trace substances (originating from traffic and waste water) in fish and sediments from both sampling sites. Fish embryo tests with native sediment and surface water samples resulted in various embryotoxic effects in exposed zebrafish embryos (Fig. 1). In addition, the health condition of the investigated fish species (e.g., severe alterations in the liver and kidney) provided clear evidence of water contamination at both Argen River sites (Fig. 2). At distinct points in time, some parameters (fish development, kidney and liver histopathology) indicated stronger effects at the sampling site downstream of the SSB effluent than at the upstream site. Conclusions: Our results clearly showed that the SSB cannot be assigned as the main source of pollutants that are released into the investigated Argen River section. Moreover, we showed that there is moderate background pollution with substances originating from waste waters and traffic which still should be taken seriously, particularly with regard to the impairment of fish health at both investigated field sites. Since the Argen is a tributary of Lake Constance, our results call for a management plan to ensure and improve the river's ecological stability.																	2190-4715					MAR 6	2017	29								10	10.1186/s12302-017-0108-y								WOS:000397614400002	28316899

The model was evaluated using instantaneous virtual dye in the inlets. Residual flows were determined at seven horizontal and vertical transects using model hydrodynamic output from 2006 to 2007 period. Flushing times based on virtual dye release for South Puget Sound was compared with that based on traditional method using residual flows and volumes. Longer flushing times in the inlets provide evidence of why low dissolved oxygen were observed in these areas from a previous study. Residual flows were comparable at several locations with literature values while at others they were lower. Possible reasons are summarized. Results provide important physical context for different regions of South Puget Sound. Flushing time for South Puget Sound (south of Tacoma Narrows) was estimated at 65 days based on virtual dye simulation. The flushing time was much shorter (34 days) when using the classical hydrodynamic formulation of volume divided by the residual flow and was close to values in existing literature.

J	Lu, CQ; Tian, HQ				Lu, Chaoqun; Tian, Hanqin			Global nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer use for agriculture production in the past half century: shifted hot spots and nutrient imbalance	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												In addition to enhancing agricultural productivity, synthetic nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) fertilizer application in croplands dramatically alters global nutrient budget, water quality, greenhouse gas balance, and their feedback to the climate system. However, due to the lack of geospatial fertilizer input data, current Earth system and land surface modeling studies have to ignore or use oversimplified data (e. g., static, spatially uniform fertilizer use) to characterize agricultural N and P input over decadal or century-long periods. In this study, we therefore develop global time series gridded data of annual synthetic N and P fertilizer use rate in agricultural lands, matched with HYDE 3.2 historical land use maps, at a resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees latitude-longitude during 1961-2013. Our data indicate N and P fertilizer use rates on per unit cropland area increased by approximately 8 times and 3 times, respectively, since the year 1961 when IFA (International Fertilizer Industry Association) and FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization) surveys of country-level fertilizer input became available. Considering cropland expansion, the increase in total fertilizer consumption is even larger. Hotspots of agricultural N fertilizer application shifted from the US and western Europe in the 1960s to eastern Asia in the early 21st century. P fertilizer input shows a similar pattern with an additional current hotspot in Brazil. We found a global increase in fertilizer N / P ratio by 0.8 gNg(-1) P per decade (p < 0.05) during 1961-2013, which may have an important global implication for human impacts on agroecosystem functions in the long run. Our data can serve as one of critical input drivers for regional and global models to assess the impacts of nutrient enrichment on climate system, water resources, food security, etc.				Lu, Chaoqun/A-6497-2012; Lu, Chaoqun/D-6694-2018; Tian, Hanqin/A-6484-2012	Lu, Chaoqun/0000-0002-1526-0513; Tian, Hanqin/0000-0002-1806-4091												1866-3508	1866-3516				MAR 3	2017	9	1					181	192		10.5194/essd-9-181-2017								WOS:000395412000001						
J	Jayakumar, R; Lee, E				Jayakumar, Ramasamy; Lee, Eunhee			Climate change and groundwater conditions in the Mekong Region-A review	JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												Changes in the climatic system introduce uncertainties in the supply and management of water resources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts an increase of 2 to 4 degrees C over the next 100 years. Temperature increases will impact the hydrologic cycle by directly increasing the evaporation of surface water sources. Consequently, changes in precipitation will indirectly impact the flux and storage of water in surface and subsurface reservoirs (i.e., lakes, soil moisture, groundwater, etc.). In addition, increases in temperature contribute to increases in the sea level, which may lead to sea water intrusions, water quality deterioration, potable water shortages, etc. Climate change has direct impacts on the surface water and the control of storage in rivers, lakes and reservoirs, which indirectly controls the groundwater recharge process. The main and direct impact of climate change on groundwater is changes in the volume and distribution of groundwater recharge. The impact of climate change on groundwater resources requires reliable forecasting of changes in the major climatic variables and accurate estimations of groundwater recharge. A number of Global Climate Models (GCMs) are available for understanding climate and projecting climate change. These GCMs can be downscaled to a basin scale, and when they are coupled with relevant hydrological models, the output of these coupled models can be used to quantify the groundwater recharge, which will facilitate the adoption of appropriate adaptation strategies under the impact of climate change.																	2305-7068					MAR 2	2017	5	1					14	30										WOS:000395830300002

Zach			Recent advances on iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles as sorbents of organic pollutants in water and wastewater treatment	REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												The constant growth in population worldwide over the past decades continues to put forward the need to provide access to safe, clean water to meet human needs. There is a need for cost-effective technologies for water and wastewater treatment that can meet the global demands and the rigorous water quality standards and at the same maximizing pollutant efficiency removal. Current remediation technologies have failed in keeping up with these factors without becoming cost-prohibitive. Most recently, nanotechnology has been sought as the best alternative to increase access to water supplies by remediating those already contaminated and offering ways to access unconventional sources. The use of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles as nanoadsorbents has led way to a new class of magnetic separation strategies for water treatment. This review focuses on highlighting some of the most recent advances in core-shell iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles and nanocomposites containing iron oxide nanoparticles currently being developed for water and wastewater treatment of organic pollutants. We discuss the novelty of these novel materials and the insight gained from their advances that can help develop cost-effective reusable technologies for scale-up and commercial use.																	0048-7554	2191-0308				MAR	2017	32	1-2			SI		111	117		10.1515/reveh-2016-0063								WOS:000396033300015	28231068

However, improving the quality of water should include spreading awareness to the public regarding the importance of cleaning their household water tanks. The aim of this study was to investigate the microbial quality of water of household water tanks in Dubai. The water samples from household water tanks were collected from forty houses, and a questionnaire was given to the residents to determine the history of the water tanks. The membrane filtration technique was used to quantify heterotrophic and total coliform bacteria on plate count agar and the violet red bile agar respectively. The overall results of this study have shown that 18 out of total 40 household water tanks contained different types of bacteria concentration level beyond local and widely accepted international standards. The overall results of this study indicated that there is a lack of awareness among residents regarding the importance of maintaining proper sanitation and hygiene of the household water tanks.

The study covered the premises of a Logistics Centre with an approximate area of 34 hectares, located in the catchment of the Wedonka stream and in the region of water intake for Krakow at the Rudawa river. In the future, the Centre will comprise nine large warehouses. Road traffic associated with the project will cause potential risks for groundwater and surface water of this protected area. Therefore, the Centre's investor decided to evaporate rainwater from the premises. To establish advisability of this plan, the study team designed and built a unique experimental station consisting of experimental roof, a tank for collecting water for the sprinkler system, system for delivering, distributing and discharging water from the roof, measuring tilt tray, automatic meteorological station, and electronic devices for recording measurement data. The research on the experimental station was carried out from April to October in 2011 and 2012 and included continuous measurements of the volume of water supplied to and discharged from the roof. Moreover, the temperature of the roof and water in the tank and the number of important meteorological parameters were measured. The difference between supplied and discharged water, divided by the wetted surface of the roof, helped to determine thickness of the evaporation layer in millimeters. The study confirmed the possibility of removing potentially contaminated rainwater by evaporating it from roof surfaces of the Logistics Centre located near Krakow at an average rate of 5.9 dm(3).m(-2).d(-1). However, due to high seasonal variability of rainfall and air temperature, it is necessary to temporarily collect water in an expansion tank of suitable capacity.

During a five-year project, from 2008 to 2012, selected chemical parameters in 11 water supply networks of the Siedlce County were studied. Throughout that period drinking water was of satisfactory quality, with only iron and manganese ions exceeding the limits (21 times and 12 times, respectively). In accordance with the results of cluster analysis, all water networks were put into three groups of different water quality. A high concentration of chlorides, sulphates, and manganese and a low concentration of copper and sodium was found in the water of Group 1 supply networks. The water in Group 2 had a high concentration of copper and sodium, and a low concentration of iron and sulphates. The water from Group 3 had a low concentration of chlorides and manganese, but a high concentration of fluorides. Using principal component analysis and cluster analysis, multivariate correlation between the studied parameters was determined, helping to put water supply networks into groups according to similar water quality.

Simulation of groundwater quality parameters using ANN and ANN+ PSO models (Case study: Ramhormoz Plain)	POLLUTION												One of the main aims of water resource planners and managers is to estimate and predict the parameters of groundwater quality so that they can make managerial decisions. In this regard, there have many models developed, proposing better management in order to maintain water quality. Most of these models require input parameters that are either hardly available or time-consuming and expensive to measure. Among them, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Models, inspired from human brain, are a better choice. The present study has simulated the groundwater quality parameters of Ramhormoz Plain, including Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), Electrical Conductivity (EC), and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), via ANN and ANN+ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Models and at the end has compared their results with the measured data. The input data for TDS quality parameter is consisted of EC, SAR, pH, SO4, Ca, Mg, and Na, while for SAR, it includes TDS, pH, Na, and Hco(3), and as for EC, it involves So(4), Ca, Mg, SAR, and pH; all of them, gathered from 2009 to 2015. Results indicate that the highest prediction accuracy for SAR, EC, and TDS is related to the ANN + PSO model with the tangent sigmoid activation function so that both MAE and RMSE statistics have the minimum and R-2 the maximum value for the model. Also the highest prediction accuracy is respectively related to EC, TDS, and SAR parameters. Considering the high efficiency of artificial neural network model, by training the PSO algorithm, it can be used in order to make managerial decisions and ensure monitoring and cost reduction results.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SPR	2017	3	2					191	200		10.7508/pj.2017.02.003								WOS:000414861900003

Assessment of surface water pollution in urban and industrial areas of Savar Upazila, Bangladesh	POLLUTION												The present study has been conducted to determine the surface water quality of urban area in Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh by determining some water quality parameters (Transparency, Temperature, pH, EC, Eh, DO, TSS, TDS, TS, BOD5(,) COD, TOC, Cl-, Br-, SO4-2, NO3-, NO2-, PO4-3, TP, HCO3- and Total alkalinity) as well as the status of phytoplankton's community in the water from two lakes (Tiger Lake and AERE Lake) and one canal (Karnapara Canal). The water quality of the AERE Lake is better than the Tiger Lake and the Karnapara Canal. Organic Pollution Index (OPI) demonstrates that water bodies are severely polluted by organic matters in the study area. R mode Cluster Analysis (CA) reveals that the water bodies are polluted and the common sources of pollutants are anthropogenic (industrial, agricultural, municipal sewerage). The Principle Component Analysis/ Factor Analysis (PCA/FA) identifies two dominant factors, responsible for data structure, explaining 100% of total variance in the data set. The PCA agrees with CA, suggesting that multiple anthropogenic sources are responsible for the surface water quality deterioration in this area. The present study reflects the actual scenario of surface water quality of Savar urban area, thus will be helpful for the policy planers and makers to take proper management and abatement strategies for the sustainable management of water resources in urban areas of Bangladesh.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SPR	2017	3	2					243	259		10.7508/pj.2017.02.007								WOS:000414861900007

Physico-chemical and bacteriological characterization of surface water in Djendjen River (North Eastern Algeria)	POLLUTION												Djendjen River is one of the largest rivers in the region of Jijel (Algeria). Human activities such as urban discharges, industrial, agricultural, and livestock have significant effects on the quality of water. The present study attempts to evaluate the quality of water along the banks of the Djendjen River at different sampling sites, using physico-chemical and bacteriological methods. The collected samples are analyzed per standard method parameters and measured in situ. The mean values of the physicochemical parameters of the river water samples are consistently lower than the levels, certified by the Algerian standard (exept for pH and PO43-). The total and fecal coliform surpasses the Algerian standard limits (0 cfu/100 ml) at all sites, signifying that without treatment the water is unsuitable for human consumption. Results reveal that water quality of the Djendjen River is generally affected by the anthropogenic activities, taking place along its banks. The moderate organic pollution (OPI=2-2.6) and high faecal contamination (MQI=3-3.25) of water in the study area has adverse impacts on the environment and public health, which requires a combined treatment (biological and physicochemical).																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SPR	2017	3	2					261	272		10.7508/pj.2017.02.008								WOS:000414861900008						
J	Pham, TL				Pham, T. L.			Comparison between Water Quality Index (WQI) and biological indices, based on planktonic diatom for water quality assessment in the Dong Nai River, Vietnam	POLLUTION												The present study aims to have a comparative study of the results, from biological monitoring as well as conventional method, based on physico-chemical variables. Water quality index (WQI) and planktonic diatom metrics have been used to determine water quality and ecological conditions of the Dong Nai River (DNR) and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) to find out the main environmental variables that regulate the phytoplankton community. A total of 51 planktonic diatom species, belonging to 23 genera, have been identified during the study period. Fragillaria was the most dominant diatom in the upper course site, while the Aulacoseira was the most dominant species in the middle and lower ones. One-way ANOVA showed that the mean of turbidity, ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate were significantly different (P<0.05) among upper, middle, and lower course sites in both dry and wet seasons. The WQI showed that water quality in the Dong Nai River was classified in medium level at all sites, while water quality varied from good, moderate, to low level, based on the Biological Diatom Index (BDI) values. CCA indicated that nutrients (PO43-, NO3-, NH4+) and turbidity were the most important factors, regulating the variation in structure of the planktonic community. In this study, the BDI has been applied for the first time to biomonitor water quality in Vietnam. The sensitivity of the BDI to environmental stressors, supported the use of this index to bio-monitor surface water in tropical regions.																	2383-451X	2383-4501				SPR	2017	3	2					311	323		10.7508/pj.2017.02.012								WOS:000414861900012						
J	Chin, DA				Chin, David A.			Designing Bioretention Areas for Stormwater Management	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Governing equations for designing bioretention areas for both flood control and water-quality control are developed, and a design protocol for applying these equations is also presented. Factors taken into account include the flood-control return period, the local intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) function, the catchment volumetric runoff coefficient, and the depth and infiltration capacity of the bioretention-area bowl. It is shown that the IDF functions nested within the conventional Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) rainfall distributions can be described by a common functional form, with different parameters for each of the four rainfall types. These extracted IDF functions are used to show that designing bioretention areas for flood control is more feasible in the western part of the United States that have Type I rainfall, compared to other parts of the county that have Types IA, II, and III rainfall. It is demonstrated that practical bioretention areas that are sized for water-quality control can also meet flood-control regulations in some areas. A design example is provided to demonstrate the typical sizing of bioretention areas for both flood control and water-quality control.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				MAR	2017	4	1					1	13		10.1007/s40710-016-0200-0								WOS:000414367200001

Assessment and Prediction of Saline Sea Water Transport in Groundwater Using 3-D Numerical Modelling	ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												This paper presents the application of a three-dimensional numerical model to the Al-Raudhatain and Umm A-Aish fresh water aquifers located in north Kuwait. The two aquifers have been polluted by saline sea water imported to extinguish the oil well fires during the Gulf war. A time variant salinity transport model was calibrated simultaneously with the transient groundwater flow system to assess the impact of saline sea water. Variably saturated flow and transport were modelled. The results of the salinity transport model suggest that although the fresh water-saline water interface, as defined by the 1500 mg/L contour, has moved towards the centre of the lens, in some areas up-gradient of the fresh water recharge, the extent of the fresh water lens has actually increased slightly in the down-gradient areas. After 23 years (simulation period 1990-2013), the areal extent of the total dissolved solids plume is estimated at 27 and 29% of the Al-Raudhatain and Umm A-Aish fresh water bodies, respectively. Under the scenarios assumed, there are large masses of salts stored in the soil profile that will leach over time to the water table. The total dissolved solids concentrations are predicted by the model to decrease to 4500 mg/L from 7800 mg/L, after 73 years (simulation period 1990-2063) from the moment the saline sea water was added. The predicted total dissolved solids concentration simulation provides a worst-case scenario of the likely extent of contaminant movement in groundwater in the two fresh water fields. Solute transport modelling has become increasingly important tool for interpreting groundwater quality data and processes relevant to natural and contaminant aquifer systems to a wide range of real-world groundwater quality problems. Further data, from drilling sampling and other testing and experimentations should help clarify the assumptions made and assist in updating the solute transport modelling effort which helps to provide insights into the past and present behavior, and allows to predict water quality management scenarios.																	2198-7491	2198-7505				MAR	2017	4	1					49	73		10.1007/s40710-016-0198-3								WOS:000414367200004						
J	Ha, M; Wu, M				Ha, Miae; Wu, May			Land management strategies for improving water quality in biomass production under changing climate	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The Corn Belt states are the largest corn-production areas in the United States because of their fertile land and ideal climate. This attribute is particularly important as the region also plays a key role in the production of bioenergy feedstock. This study focuses on potential change in streamflow, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus due to climate change and land management practices in the South Fork Iowa River (SFIR) watershed, Iowa. The watershed is covered primarily with annual crops (corn and soybeans). With cropland conversion to switchgrass, stover harvest, and implementation of best management practices (BMPs) (such as establishing riparian buffers and applying cover crops), significant reductions in nutrients were observed in the SFIR watershed under historical climate and future climate scenarios. Under a historical climate scenario, suspended sediment (SS), total nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at the outlet point of the SFIR watershed could decrease by up to 56.7%, 32.0%, and 16.5%, respectively, compared with current land use when a portion of the cropland is converted to switchgrass and a cover crop is in place. Climate change could cause increases of 9.7% in SS, 4.1% in N, and 7.2% in P compared to current land use. Under future climate scenarios, nutrients including SS, N, and P were reduced through land management and practices and BMPs by up to 54.0% (SS), 30.4% (N), and 7.1% (P). Water footprint analysis further revealed changes in green water that are highly dependent on land management scenarios. The study highlights the versatile approaches in landscape management that are available to address climate change adaptation and acknowledged the complex nature of different perspectives in water sustainability. Further study involving implementing landscape design and management by using long-term monitoring data from field to watershed is necessary to verify the findings and move toward watershed-specific regional programs for climate adaptation.																	1748-9326					MAR	2017	12	3							034015	10.1088/1748-9326/aa5f32								WOS:000413801700001

The new Caribbean Nitrogen Index to assess nitrogen dynamics in vegetable production systems in southwestern Puerto Rico	INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH												Nutrient loss from agricultural fields is one of the main factors influencing surface-and ground-water quality. Typical fertilizer nitrogen (N) consumption rates in vegetable production systems and horticultural crops in Puerto Rico fluctuate between 112 and 253 kg N/ha. The nitrogen use efficiency of vegetable crops is low, increasing the potential for nitrogen losses and high residual soil nitrate content. Quantification of residual soil N and N losses to the environment can be a difficult task. Simulation models such as the USDA-ARS N Index can be used to identify the relative magnitude of varying N-loss pathways and to identify best management practices. Field studies were conducted to quantify residual soil N and crop N removal, and to validate the Nitrogen Index in onion, tropical pumpkin and tomato production systems in the Lajas Valley in southwestern Puerto Rico. Relationships between observed and simulated values were determined to examine the capability of the model for evaluating N losses. There was good correlation between observed and predicted values for residual soil N (r = 0.88) and crop N removal (r = 0.99) (p < 0.05). In the production systems evaluated, the N volatilization losses ranged from 1 to 4 kg N/ha, the denitrification losses ranged from 18 to 46 kg N/ha, the leaching losses ranged from 155 to 779 kg N/ha, and the residual soil nitrate ranged from 64 to 401 kg N/ha. The N use efficiency ranged from 15% to 39%. The results obtained showed that the Nitrogen Index tool can be a useful tool for evaluating N transformations in vegetable production systems of Puerto Rico's semi-arid zone.																	2095-6339					MAR	2017	5	1					69	75		10.1016/j.iswcr.2017.01.001								WOS:000413330100009

Radon is present in areas with a high uranium and radium content, and it is the main contributor of the annual effective dose received by humans. The objective of this study was to evaluate concentrations of Rn-222 and the water quality of spring waters. Water was classified as calcium sulfated and sodium sulfated. Most of the water samples with high radon concentrations presented higher concentrations of sulfates, fluorides, and total dissolved solids. Rn-222 concentrations may be attributed to possible enhancement of Ra-226 due to temperature and salinity of water, as well as evaporation rate. In 100% of the sampled spring waters the Rn-222 levels exceeded the maximum acceptable limit which is proposed by international institutions. Aridity increases radiological risk related to Rn-222 dose because spring waters are the main supply source for local populations. The implementation of environmental education, strategies, and technologies to remove the contaminants from the water are essential in order to reduce the health risk for local inhabitants.																	2076-3263					MAR	2017	7	1							UNSP 12	10.3390/geosciences7010012								WOS:000410163000011

Lightly burned-dolomite kiln dust (LB-DKD) was evaluated as an alternative coagulant because it contains high levels of the healthful minerals calcium and magnesium. An organic pore forming agent (OPFA) was incorporated to prepare porous granules after OPFA removal through a thermal decomposition process. A spray drying method was used to produce uniform and reproducible spherical granules with low density, since fine dolomite particles have irregular agglomeration behavior in the hydration reaction. The use of fine dolomite powder and different porosity granules led to a visible color change in raw algae (RA) containing water, from dark green to transparent colorlessness. Also, dolomite powders and granules exhibited a mean removal efficiency of 48.3% in total nitrogen (T-N), a gradual increase in the removal efficiency of total phosphorus (T-P) as granule porosity increased.

Olive Mill Waste Water Risk Assessment Based on GIS Techniques in Crete, Greece	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												Water resources are subjected to different pollution sources. Point source water pollution of surface water is an important issue when considering the limited surface water availability as well as the potential knock-on effects of this pollution on human health as well as habitat and land degradation. One of the main point sources of water pollution is Olive Mill Waste Water (OMWW). OMWW is the liquid by-product generated during olive oil production. However, there is no standardized method to assess the risk of water pollution by OMWW for any given river basin. This research addressed the above issue by designing a detailed quantitative risk assessment methodology, which utilizes Geographic Information System (GIS) modeling to classify within a watershed individual sub-catchment risk of water pollution occurring from olive mill waste discharges. The research presents the proposed criteria and calculations required to estimate sub-catchment risk significance and comments on the potential of the method for wider application. This research combines elements from risk assessment frameworks, Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA), and GIS. MCA helped in aggregating different aspects and elements associated with this environmental problem, while GIS modeling tools helped in obtaining many criterion values and providing insight into how different objects interact in nature and how these interactions influence risk at the watershed level. The proposed method was tested in the Keritis watershed in Crete, Greece, where OMWW is one of the main stressors influencing water quality, and the results indicated that this method has the potential to be a useful guide to prioritize risk management actions and mitigation measures to be incorporated in River Basin Management Plans.

Seasonal variation in ground water quality and its suitability for drinking and agriculture -a case study in Kancheepuram region, Tamil Nadu, India	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												In the present study an attempt has been made to assess the seasonal ground water quality variations at Kancheepuram region, Tamil Nadu, India. In order to evaluate the seasonal ground water quality for drinking and irrigation purposes, 68 groundwater well data were collected and analyzed for various physico-chemical parameters such as electrical conductivity (EC), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3- and F-. Nine parameters viz., pH, TDS, TH, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3- and F- were used to calculate the Water Quality Index (WQI) using weighted arithmetic index for drinking purpose. EC and Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) were the two important indicators used to assess the irrigation water quality. Mapping was done to examine the spatial distribution of water quality parameters using Geographical Information System (GIS). From the analysis, more than half of the samples record good water quality whereas only 1% falls under unsuitable category for drinking purpose. Approximately 33% of samples falls under poor quality for drinking. In terms of irrigation, the salinity hazard occurs in 23 to 42% of sampling locations depicting the uncertainty towards agricultural production in the study region. From the study, it is observed that the water quality is highly degraded where Industrialization and urbanization took place when compared to areas where agriculture is being practiced. Hence, suitable measures to ameliorate the pollution effect of urbanization and industrializations are suggested.																	1790-7632					MAR	2017	19	1					131	139										WOS:000409253800010

In this study, two commercially available kits were compared to assess their performance, the MO BIO PowerViral Environmental DNA/RNA Isolation kit and the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. A performance assessment of extraction kits for detecting and quantifying six human enteric viruses as the commonest waterborne pathogens and one plant virus as an alternative fecal indicator has been carried out using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Water samples were collected from seven sites in Singapore during March and April 2015. In general, a strong association was observed between two different viral DNA/RNA extraction kits and detection frequency of targets (P = 0.017). The Qiagen kit showed higher extraction efficiency than the MoBio kit. However, in terms of quantification, a significant difference was only observed in the occurrences of NoV GI and PMMoV between two different kits (P < 0.05), although the kits showed similar efficiency removing qPCR inhibitors. The Qiagen kit was preferred for routine water quality monitoring.

A study on prediction method for ozone dosage and residual ozone concentration in advanced ozone water treatment	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												Ozone dosage in most water treatment plants is operated by determining the ozone concentration with the experience of the operation. In this case, it is not economical. This study selected the factors affecting residual ozone concentration and attempted to estimate the optimum amount of hydrogen peroxide dosage for the control of the residual ozone concentration by developing a model for the prediction of the residual ozone concentration. The prediction formulas developed in this study can quickly respond to the environment of water quality and surrounding environmental factors, which change in real time, so it is judged that they could be used for the operation of the optimum ozone process, and the control of ozone dosage could be used as a new method in controlling the concentration of ozone dosage and the concentration of residual ozone.																	1751-231X					MAR	2017	12	1					87	96		10.2166/wpt.2017.014								WOS:000407606400009

Treatment of industrial mineral oil wastewater - effects of coagulant type and dosage	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												The use of coagulants is essential in the diverse disciplines of conventional water and wastewater treatment. This work aimed to select an economic and effective coagulant, to minimize the cost of treatment and the oil droplet content of the water, thus enhancing the efficiency of a local South African oil refinery effluent plant recovering water and oil for reuse by treating the industrial mineral oil wastewater. A standard dissolved air flotation jar test preceded evaluation of four coagulants, viz. aluminum sulfate (Alum), aluminum chloride, ferric sulfate and ferric chloride. Chemical oxygen demand, soap oil and grease, total suspended solids and turbidity were determined as water quality parameters to check coagulant efficiency. Removal of over 70% was achieved for each parameter. The results obtained at pH 5 and coagulant dose of 50 mg/L showed that alum was the best pretreatment coagulant for destabilizing and minimizing oil droplets in water, due to its trivalent cationic nature. It was also economically viable.					Kweinor Tetteh, Emmanuel/0000-0003-1400-7847												1751-231X					MAR	2017	12	1					139	145		10.2166/wpt.2017.021								WOS:000407606400014						
J	Daigger, GT				Daigger, Glen T.			Flexibility and adaptability: essential elements of the WRRF of the future	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												All Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs) must comply with evolving treatment objectives and product water quality requirements, using technologies which also evolve over time. The useful life of the physical structures, especially hydraulic conveyance (pipes and channels) and water holding structures, is significantly longer than that of the specific technologies used. Thus, the WRRF of the future must, first and foremost, be designed with the flexibility to adapt to a wide variety of requirements over its life using a wide variety of technologies, some of which are currently known while others will be invented and/or further developed over time. This might be seen as the true essence of the WRRF of the future, rather than the specific technology implemented at a particular time. While incorporating flexibility and adaptability into facilities may seem daunting, especially since future requirements and technologies are largely unknown, experience indicates that much can be done to prepare for such changes. Proven engineering approaches are presented and discussed in the paper, including the 'building block approach' to plant layout and design, and the choice of process tank configurations which can accommodate numerous technologies.																	1751-231X					MAR	2017	12	1					156	165		10.2166/wpt.2017.019								WOS:000407606400016

Modelling of nitrates in River Nzoia using MIKE 11	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												Eutrophication is a serious problem in Lake Victoria as a result of enrichment by nutrients transported by the rivers draining into it. River Nzoia is one of the main rivers draining into the lake. The main aim of this study was to simulate the level of nitrates using MIKE 11 and to establish relationship between nitrogen and phosphorus. The model was calibrated using water quality data for 2009 and validated with March 2013 data and then it was used to simulate nitrate concentration for the wet month of April 2013. The model performance was good with R-2 values of between 0.87 and 0.98 and EF values of between 0.73 and 0.96. From the simulations, the effluent discharge from municipal and industrial wastewater ponds elevated the concentration of the nitrates in the river. Analysis of the concentrations of nitrates for wet and dry periods showed significant variations indicating significant contributions from the catchment through run-off. The relationship between total nitrogen and total phosphorus was analysed and found to have a strong positive correlation (r = 0.714, p < 0.05) indicating that both originate from similar sources or are influenced by the same factors such as agriculture.																	1751-231X					MAR	2017	12	1					217	223		10.2166/wpt.2017.026								WOS:000407606400022

Numerous studies have been undertaken in the Krakowsko-Wielunska and Miechowska Uplands for over 40 years. As many as 246 springs were mapped in the 1970's and investigations have continued to the present. These have considered the type of spring, discharges, chemical composition of water, and spring surroundings including the species composition of habitats. The long period of observations has revealed changes of spring properties due to natural and anthropogenic factors. Only 38% of investigated springs maintained their natural character The majority were completely devastated and overwhelmed. Waste was found in more than 20 springs. Also a decrease in spring discharge of about 10-30% compared to the 1970's and 1990's was noticed. But there was no clear common tendency of improvement or degradation of water quality in the whole area. However the problem of spring water pollution still persists mostly due to agriculture activity and long distance air pollution transport. Interdisciplinary research and collaboration of scientists with local authorities seems to be the only way to solve the problem of spring water quality and adequate management of their surroundings. Results of the studies have provided knowledge and a basis for concrete management application.																	0705-3797					MAR	2017	40	1					38	46		10.18814/epiiugs/2017/v40i1/017006								WOS:000408520600005

The drainage basin of the Gediz delta is predominantly agricultural and industrial in character. Dissolved Se exceeded the water-quality standard of 5 mu gL(-1) during high flow and varied from 9.4 mu gL(-1) to 0.02 mu gL(-1) through the salinity gradient during the study period. Particulate Se ranged from 5.2 mu g L-1 to 0.02 mu g L-1. Sediment in the river mouth was highly affected by Se contamination and reached a level greater than four times (7.6 mu g g(-1) dry wt) the background level. The results indicated that Se supplied by the river was removed rapidly from the water column before the salinity reached an average value of about 20 and accumulated within the delta.

As the dose of chlorine increases, disinfection by-products (Chlorate) also increase simultaneously and exceed water quality standards. In this study, the electrolytic cell of a sodium hypochlorite generator (12% chlorine) was adjusted to control the production of the disinfection by-products. As a result, it was possible to reduce Chlorate concentrations by more than 95% by adjusting the pH of the electrolytic cell from 1.53 to 4.2 (normal pH of the electrolytic cell). As a low current is required to obtain these results, a 15% improvement in the efficiency of the positive electrode is also observed. For the development of High Sodium Hypochlorite Generation can be used in a safe sodium hypochlorite solution, which is expected to contribute to improvement in the safety of the disinfection process.																	1226-4881					MAR	2017	41	3					183	189		10.3795/KSME-B.2017.41.3.183								WOS:000408436900004

In the study focused on soil and water conservation in the Jihlava river basin upstream of the Dalesice reservoir, we identified areas at potential risk of soil erosion, elevated infiltration and nutrient leaching, tile-drained areas and vulnerable riparian zones of water bodies. We then designed a system of complex protective measures for this river basin in more variants, and their effectiveness was estimated using simple empirical model calculations and research findings. Application of the measures defined by optimal variant 3 in the studied watershed could lead to reduction of the soil erosion effects on the surface water quality by 26.5%, with simultaneous reduction of the amount of washed out total nitrogen by 22.8%.

Specifically, we review policy instruments that protect water for recreational use, their impacts and the challenges they pose for rural development against current requirements to increase public awareness and participation. In Ireland, there is limited experience in public participation in water quality protection and restoration and we highlight how this can be addressed by focussing on the specific contribution of water quality in rural areas in relation to the provision of recreational ecosystem services. These services provide the infrastructure for much of Ireland's rural tourism sector. In this context, emerging participatory approaches to policy implementation are also assessed as national and local government prioritise community engagement for the second cycle under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD).																	1803-8417					MAR	2017	9	1			SI		99	115		10.1515/euco-2017-0006								WOS:000408214400006

The purpose of this study was to establish hotspot candidate sites in New York State where the L. monocytogenes pathogen could be found. Several suitability criteria which include proximity to water, pasture, forests, and urban development and slope among others in New York State were considered in this analysis. This study assessed which spatial habitat factors influence habitat suitability of the L. monocytogenes pathogen in the forested areas of New York State. Multicriteria evaluation was used to integrate the different habitat factors using their different weights expressed using probability distributions. Spatially explicit uncertainty and sensitivity analysis (UA and SA) was carried out to examine the robustness of habitat suitability analysis. Suitability maps were generated and summarized using an average suitability map, a standard deviation uncertainty map, and sensitivity maps. Results showed that the shallowest depth to a wet soil layer (measured annually) and proximity to water are the habitat factors which contribute the most and individually to the distribution and survival of this pathogen. The slope gradient is singly insignificant but influential when associated with other factors like temperature, soil organic matter content, volume of water soil can store, proximity to forest, urban development, and pasture among others. It was established that water is the key habitat factor that favors the survival of this pathogen. Also, the ability to spatially model zoonotic pathogen hotspots is important in zoonoses control, informing and influencing policy. From these results, it is important to maintain the water quality of the water sources (lakes, rivers, ponds) and ensure that there is limited runoff from slopes.

In this study, surface water quality data for 15 physico-chemical parameters collected from 7 monitoring stations in a river during the years from 2014 to 2016 were analyzed. The principal component analysis technique was employed to evaluate the seasonal correlations of water quality parameters, while the principal factor analysis technique was used to extract the parameters that are most important in assessing seasonal variations of river water quality. Analysis shows that a parameter that is most important in contributing to water quality variation for one season may not be important for another season except alkalinity, which is always the most important parameters in contributing to water quality variations for all three seasons.																	2234-1722	2234-1730				MAR	2017	6	1					53	65		10.12989/aer.2017.6.1.053								WOS:000406901400005

The quality of bottled drinking water of 14 different brands as sold in Bangladesh market are evaluated in the current work in terms of the physical and aggregate properties, non-metal inorganic constituents, metal concentrations and microbial contents. The experimental values are compared with the information printed on the labels and regulatory recommendations from the national and international authorities. The experimental values for physical and aggregate properties and non-metal inorganic constituents are either lower or within the range of regulatory limits (p < 0.05). The heterotrophic plate count and total coliform count confirms that the bottled waters are microbiologically safe. A total of 24 elements are checked and the content of Al, which is an aesthetic hazard, is found higher than the permissible range, while the concentration of Pb, which is a potentially toxic element, is not significantly different (p < 0.05) from the guideline values. The data printed on the bottle labels are inconsistent and not informative enough and does not correspond to the real scenario of constituents in the packaged water. A comparison to the tap water quality confirms that the bottled waters possess better quality regarding aesthetic considerations, microbial hazards, and Pb contaminations. The experimental data of the bottled waters are further compared with the mineral water classification system. The characteristics are matched with the very low or low mineral content category with a hint of saline character and very soft water-hardness in most, followed by a suitability for low-sodium diets.

Alongside plowing, arguably the greatest tool in combating snow and ice is salt. The most commonly used salt for winter maintenance is Sodium Chloride (NaCl), the same salt used in food and water softeners, is applied to roads, sidewalks, and parking lots as it is an effective deicer when temperatures are between 0 degrees C and -12 degrees C. Studies have shown that deicing with salt reduces accidents by 88% and injuries by 85% (Salt Institute 2017). The effectiveness of road salt, as well as its relative affordability, means that as much as four million tonnes may be applied annually in Canada for deicing (Environment Canada 2012). However, while salt is relatively inexpensive to purchase, there are a number of external costs that are becoming increasingly apparent. These include corrosion of vehicles and infrastructure like concrete, bridges, and water mains; damage and staining to the interior and exterior of buildings; impacts to roadside vegetation and soils; and the contamination of fresh water. In fact, the environmental impacts are such that it prompted Environment Canada to propose that winter salt be considered a toxic substance primarily due to the quantity that is applied annually (Environment Canada 2001). The Lake Simcoe watershed, approximately 3,400km(2) in size, is situated just 20km north of Toronto, Ontario, with the southern portion of the watershed being considered part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. As part of the GTA, the Lake Simcoe watershed has experienced and continues to experience considerable growth, and with this growth comes an increase in the amount of impervious surfaces requiring winter salting. Indeed, chloride has been showing a strong increasing trend in the urban creeks and in Lake Simcoe itself over the last 30 years. Even rural creeks are showing an increasing trend, albeit not as severe, nor are the concentrations of chloride reaching the same levels (LSRCA 2015). The highest chloride level recorded in a Lake Simcoe tributary was 6,120mg/l in the winter of 2013. Chloride guidelines for the protection of aquatic ecosystems utilize a guideline of 120mg/L for chronic exposure and 640mg/L for acute exposure (CCME 2011). While the high value recorded in the Lake Simcoe tributary greatly exceeds these guidelines, it is still drastically lower than values being recorded in larger, intensively urbanized catchments such as Cooksville Creek in Mississauga, Ontario, which sees concentrations in excess of 20,000 mg/L, the concentration of sea water, nearly every winter (Credit Valley Conservation personal comm). Similarly, in July of 2011 a small population of Atlantic blue crabs, a marine species, was found surviving in Mimico Creek in Toronto (Toronto Star: May 26, 2012). That a marine species was able to survive in this fresh water creek in summer demonstrates that the impacts of winter salt are not just limited to winter but are impacting shallow groundwater and thus summer baseflow, maintaining high chloride concentrations year round. The same is being seen in some urban creeks in the Lake Simcoe watershed, with summer baseflow concentrations exceeding the chronic guideline and trending upwards (LSRCA unpublished). While not yet as extreme as rivers in the more densely urbanized parts of the GTA, these examples foreshadow what is in store for Lake Simcoe rivers if current winter salt practices continue along with the projected urban growth. During the winter of 2012 an estimated 99,300 tonnes of salt was applied in the Lake Simcoe watershed, an amount that equals nearly 250kg of salt per capita, or similar to 3 times the average person's body weight in salt. This estimate was generated through a survey of local road agencies along with the total area of commercial/institutional parking lots within the watershed. The exercise served to highlight a knowledge gap around application practices and rates in commercial/institutional parking lots. The majority of road agencies were found to record annual volumes, application dates and rates whereas literature values range from 10-40% of the salt applied in a catchment come from commercial/institutional parking lots (Perera et al, 2009; Trowbridge et al, 2010; Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority, 2015), and a survey of winter maintenance contractors cite an average value of approximately 58g/m(2)/application (Fu et al, 2013) (Figure 1). [GRAPHICS] While these values were used in the estimation as they were the best available, observational data suggested these may be on the conservative side (Figure 2). Therefore, monitoring of a 14 ha commercial lot was undertaken for the winters of 2014/15, 2015/16, and 2016/17 to better quantify the amount of salt coming from this type of land use. The winters of 2014/15 and 2016/17 saw similar applications of 1,067 and 1,010 tonnes applied respectively, while the mild winter of 2015/16 saw 556 tonnes applied. While the amounts varied somewhat each winter, the impacts downstream were consistent. Maximum concentrations recorded in the melt water reached 3.5 to 4 times the salt concentration of sea water every winter, equating to chloride concentrations of 70,000mg/L to 85,000mg/L; two orders of magnitude above the water quality guideline. [GRAPHICS] As with most parking lots constructed in the last two decades, the runoff from this parking lot is captured in a stormwater pond prior to entering the receiving watercourse. Interestingly, the winter salt also caused persistent chemical stratification in the permanent pool of the pond. The pond was monitored with continuous monitors for the ice free period of 2015 and 2016 (April to December) during which the bottom water chloride concentration remained distinct from the surface chloride concentration, indicating stratification (Figure 3). This has two significant implications; first of which is that this pond, and therefore many other ponds like it, may not be functioning as designed which is leading to diminished performance (McEnroe 2012, Marsalek 2003). Second is that ponds are acting as salt reservoirs, slowly releasing salt year round and contributing to river chloride concentrations that continually exceed the chronic exposure guideline and thereby exposing aquatic life to harmful concentrations during sensitive life cycle stages. To determine the extent to which the catchment land use type impacts stormwater ponds, chemical profiles were measured on three ponds in February 2017. The catchments included the 24.6 ha commercial catchment with 14 ha of salt application surface, an institutional catchment (14.3 ha) with 6 ha of salt application area that includes parking lots and roads, and a 16.4 ha residential catchment with 3 ha of salt application area comprised of tertiary municipal roads. Interestingly, all three ponds showed chemical stratification, with the severity of the stratification and highest chloride concentrations relating to the amount of salt application area in the catchment. The residential pond yielded a maximum chloride concentration of 3,115mg/L in the bottom waters, the institutional yielded 16,144mg/L, and the commercial yielded 25,530 mg/L with chloride concentrations in the bottom 0.5m of the pond exceeding that of sea water. The maximum chloride concentration recorded in the receiving watercourse downstream of the commercial lot was measured at 5,406 mg/L, well in excess of the acute guideline of 640 mg/L. These results highlight that commercial parking lots are not only receiving a significant volume of salt but are also having the most dramatic impacts on receiving stormwater infrastructure and watercourses.																	1552-6100	1943-4618				SPR	2017	12	2					1	12										WOS:000406009400001						
J	Koepke, J				Koepke, Jonathan			URBAN STREAM RESTORATION AND APPLIED PRACTICES IN NORTHEAST ILLINOIS	JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING												In-stream and watershed dynamics in urban and urbanizing areas have significant impacts on local property and infrastructure, as well as the quality of the stream itself including: water quality, habitat, physical characteristics, and biodiversity. As land development occurs, natural vegetation and exposed soils are converted to buildings, pavement and other impervious surfaces. This leads to increased runoff during storm events as well as decreasing the time that it takes that stormwater to reach streams, wetlands, and other stormwater storage and conveyance systems. These hydrologic changes in a watershed often occur at a rapid pace which results in rapid destabilization and degradation of streams and rivers. Rivers and streams are naturally dynamic systems. They naturally erode and reshape themselves based on changes to the watershed or the stream itself. Erosion and deposition are natural processes that have always been important components of stream systems and in and of themselves are not undesirable. When natural stream dynamics are rapidly accelerated, however, an entire series of negative impacts to the stream and the biological systems that are depended on the stream occur. Rapid destabilization of streams often leads to significant bank and bed erosion that negatively impact stream health and frequently leads to negative impact to property, buildings and structures, as well as public infrastructure. Past approaches to stream bank and bed stabilization often involved channelization, armoring, and other gray infrastructure techniques to protect public and private property in the effected reaches of streams and rivers without taking into account the overall stream system dynamics. Early stabilization efforts frequently led to other unintended consequences by accelerating the rate of bank and bed erosion in untreated reaches, inadvertent flooding, and other infrastructure impacts. The complex nature of stream dynamics and fluvial geomorphology when applied to urban stream systems and significantly modified watersheds require the need for detailed analysis of the morphology of the stream. Consideration of the complex factors and processes that make up fluvial morphology are critical when selecting practices or methods of stream restoration. Many agencies and cooperative partners work to accumulate and analyze case studies and detailed research in order to develop a method of evaluating and prescribing different stream restoration techniques based on the morphologic conditions in the stream reach (Lyn D.A., and Newton J.F., 2015). An accumulation of case studies, research, and scholarly work on stream restoration techniques and practices helps shape and inform designers across multiple agencies in order to effectively select and design restoration practices. Ultimately, in urban streams, the designer is working to establish a condition of dynamic equilibrium in the treated stream reach. Dynamic equilibrium is defined as a stream reach that is in balance with sediment transport, aggradation, degradation, and bank and bed erosion. When those characteristics are in balance based on the inputs of sediment within the watershed, the bed load and sediments the stream transports, and discharge rate and volume, then the stream is considered to be in a relatively stable state (FISRWG, 1998). The selection then of stream restoration and stabilization practices in urban areas is dependent on not only the reach being treated, but also on the overall watershed dynamics. In addition to the physics of the actual practices implemented, including resistance to shear stresses and velocity of the water flow within the stream channel being treated, the practices must also take into account the larger picture of stream dynamics including sediment delivery and transport, within the watershed and not just within the treated reach. Successful urban stream restoration and stabilization techniques mimic the structures found in more undisturbed systems through the utilization of similar materials in an engineered configuration. In many streams the use of a combination of hard and soft armorment and stabilization solutions including stone, woody debris materials, modern geosynthetic reinforcement devices and native vegetation to stabilize and naturalize stream channels, thereby provided enhanced habitat, better water quality, and protecting property and infrastructure.																	1552-6100	1943-4618				SPR	2017	12	2					13	27		10.3992/1943-4618.12.2.13								WOS:000406009400002

Such changes align with the predictions of classical sociologists like Weber and Simmel that the phenomenon of rationalization would extend to all spheres of society, including everyday life. Based on qualitative research data on drinking water consumption in Moscow, this study assesses how such trends are manifested in contemporary Russian society. The study demonstrates an increasing emphasis on managing thirst. In certain social contexts (including sports, weight loss, and pregnancy), the habitualization of socially constructed norms of water consumption has transformed these into an internal need. The mechanisms of control and calculative behavior are manifested in both the conscious attempts and unconscious measuring tactics developed by Muscovites to increase the volume of water being drunk. Ordinary people who are anxious about the safety of drinking water seek institutional support from the state, advertisements for bottled water, and expert knowledge of various kinds. Because the quality of drinking water is perceived to be an existential issue, the lack of certainty around this issue sometimes gives rise to irrational beliefs. The researchers were especially surprised to find references to "life-giving" or "dead" water in the narratives of respondents with a university education, including some with medical degrees.																	1726-3247					MAR	2017	18	2					108	111										WOS:000404802000007

Aims: To objective is to determine characteristics of thermal mineral waters of Ranong region and describe its classification and therapeutic indications. Material and Methods: Mineral waters were collected from Rahsawarin and Porn-Rang hot springs. All analyses were conducted according to American Public Health Association. Temperature was measured in the field at the time of sample collection. Analyses of fecal coliforms and total bacterial count were performed. Physical-chemical analyses were used to evaluate pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and conductivity. Total hardness was measured in the laboratory by titration. Metals (Al, Si, Fe, Mn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu) were measured by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS); major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, CI, F, HCO3-, SO4, S'-) and nutrients (NH4, PO4-, N0.3) were measured by ion chromatography technique. Results and Discussion: The mean of pH, TDS, and conductivity values observed for hot springs were met to reference value of Thai tap water standard by WHO guideline. Neither hot spring contained fecal coliform bacteria. Chemical parameters were also within standard excepted aluminum concentration. Potassium levels from mineral waters were also high. Ranong mineral spring water can be thermal waters and define to hot waters. Ranong mineral spring water can be define to fresh and low sodium water. Conclusions: Our suggestions regarding this mineral water indication were properly for external use and may concern in case of drinking.																	1755-6783	0974-6005				MAR-APR	2017	10	2					366	370		10.4103/1755-6783.196588								WOS:000404592600021

Fossil fuel reserves are diminishing and increasing fossil fuels combustion has also resulted severe climatic and environmental issues. In the meanwhile, the enormous amount of solar energy 5-5.5 kWh/m(2) in most parts of the Pakistan offers an excellent opportunity to use it effectively for desalination processes. This study has been carried out for the development and evaluation of solar desalination system using evaporation condensation and heat recovery method. The effect of key parameters on fresh water production have been studied and it was found that the fresh water productivity and system efficiency is a function of solar radiation, mass flow rates (MFR), tilt angle of flat plate collector (FPC) and inlet hot water temperature. The result shows that the daily specific fresh water productivity was found to be 4.5 l/m(2) with an overall system efficiency of 52%. The result also shows that the heat recovery of vapors in condensation chamber (CC) increases the system efficiency by 6% and the gain output ratio (GOR) of the system was found in the range of 1.7-2.2. The water quality tests show that the quality parameters are in line with WHO water quality standards and the concentration of arsenic, E. coli and facial coliform remained undetectable in the distillate. The cost per liter of water from the system was found to be $0.021 which is lower than the cost of the available bottled fresh water in the country.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	68						80	90		10.5004/dwt.2017.20306								WOS:000403569900009

This study evaluated the physical and chemical parameters of 19 wells located in South Khorasan Province, within the boundary of Birjand City (with an area of 5,400 km(2)). First, using ArcGIS 10.22 software, the zoning maps were plotted for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), bicarbonate, ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium. Then, WQI was employed to evaluate water quality. According to the results, in over 90% of the studied area, EC, TDS, and TH values were above the allowable limit. Considering the zoning map and the results of spatial analysis of the parameters, the more we moved from the south of the studied region to the north, the parameters values increased, representing the worsened quality of water. Based on the results of WQI classification, only 10.5% of the studied wells were placed in the first group (excellent water), while the majority of sampling points (36.84%) were placed in the third group (poor water). The zoning and spatial analysis of water quality showed that water quality was suitable for drinking purposes only in 1,958 km(2) (36.28%) of the entire studied region. Moreover, in 3,437.53 km(2) (63.69%) of the studied area, water quality was unsuitable for drinking. Therefore, the application of WQI and spatial analysis through GIS was effective for monitoring groundwater quality in the studied region, and it can be considered as a promising tool for understanding the spatial patterns and changes.				eslami, hadi/S-6433-2017; khodadadi, maryam/J-4091-2017	eslami, hadi/0000-0001-5137-4764; khosravi, Rasoul/0000-0003-0202-2353												1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	67						74	83		10.5004/dwt.2017.20458								WOS:000403569700008

This process is free of the harmful by substances associated with chemical disinfection. Furthermore, it has the added benefit of not compromising the taste, the color and the odor of the treated water. In order to operate UV disinfection plants at the optimum conditions, an efficient control based on multivariable model has to be implemented. The main objective of this paper is development of a novel multiple- input multiple-output model of the UV disinfection process. Compared with other developed models, this new dynamic model, based on empirical transfer matrix and extended to a state-space model, takes into account various water quality parameters. It is also easy to be used in simulation and in practical implementation. The accuracy of our developed model is demonstrated by computer dynamic simulation and validated by experimental results. A good agreement was observed.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	67						89	96		10.5004/dwt.2017.20451								WOS:000403569700010

In this study, a combined processing method was established to enhance discharge water quality. This process incorporated a pretreatment system, a biological contact oxidation unit, an ozone oxidation unit, and an intensive treatment system. Through this treatment approach, the ozonation of textile wastewater was examined to determine the effects of ozone dosage, ozonation time, and color/chemical oxygen demand (COD) of feed wastewater. Results revealed that the color and COD removal rates increased with increased ozone dosage. Color and COD decreased whereas NH3-N slightly increased with the progress of ozonation. Color removal rate decreased whereas ozone dosage increased with increased feed color and COD. Feed color greatly influenced ozone dosage but not COD. Color removal rate during ozonation can be controlled to 50%-55% at a response time of approximately 2 h. The average ozone dosage was 51 g m(-3). After treatment by the combined process, the final discharge water was able to meet the national first-grade emission standard (GB4287-2012). The total removal rates of COD and color reached 95.2% and 95.4%, respectively. The cost of wastewater treatment amounted to only approximately 1.70 Yuan RMB m(-3) wastewater.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	66						140	148		10.5004/dwt.2016.1619								WOS:000403569400017						
J	Xue, SA; Liu, Y; Wen, Y; Li, FY				Xue, Shuang; Liu, Ying; Wen, Yang; Li, Fayun			The distribution and characteristics of dissolved organic matter fractions in urban rivers during icebound season	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters has important implication for water quality, and also plays an important role in the distribution, bioavailability, and toxicity of pollutants in waters. The distribution, spectroscopic characteristics and chlorine reactivity of DOM fractions in the North Canal in Shenyang during icebound season were investigated. DOM was fractionated using XAD resins into five fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The results showed that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in river waters were relatively high during icebound season. DOC values of the bulk DOM, HPO-A, TPI-A and TPI-N in ice phase were lower than those corresponding values in liquid phase. The variation trend of absorbance of ultraviolet light at 254 nm (UV254) along the direction of water was inconsistent with that of DOC in both liquid and ice phases. HPO-A and TPI-A were the dominant ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing compounds in both liquid and ice phases. The variation trend of fluorescent materials in ice phase along the direction of water was similar to that in liquid phase. HPO-A, HPO-N and TPI-N were the main trihalomethane precursors in both liquid and ice phases. Trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of HPO-A, TPI-A, HPO-N and TPI-N in ice phase was lower than that in liquid phase. Such knowledge can assist in our understanding of DOM dynamics in urban rivers during icebound season, and thus provides improved insight into the development of effective water quality management.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAR	2017	66						184	194		10.5004/dwt.2017.20207								WOS:000403569400022

The sediments were characterized using XRD, XRF and FTIR techniques. The physico-chemical parameters and heavy metals content of water were also measured to evaluate their impact on water quality and fitness for human consumption. The highest percentages of Fe, total Cr and Mg (83.46, 27.43, and 88.83%, respectively) were predominantly associated with the residual fraction of the sediments. Elements such as Ca and Mn were mostly bound to the exchangeable fraction of the sediments. Association of Fe, total Cr and Mg with the residual fraction as predicted by speciation calculations suggests that these metals are strongly bound to the sediments and therefore less susceptible to cause pollution. The mobility order of the heavy metals in the sediments samples was Ca > Mn > Mg > Fe > Cr. For the first time the implication of organic matter in the sediments along the Mooi River on the retention of metals was investigated and it was found that organic matter occurring in various concentrations in these sediments, contained binding groups such as C-O, C-C=C, O-H and = C-H much likely to contribute to the retention of metals in the exchangeable fraction of the sediments. The amount of inorganic pollutants in water was found to basically decrease moving downstream, but the water quality remained unfit for human consumption at most of the sampling points.

Membrane bioreactor (MBR), integration of membrane and biological processes, is regarded as alternative method due to its high quality of effluent. Coagulants are often added into a bioreactor to comply with the rigid standard of phosphorus. Addition of a lot of coagulants have potential adverse effects on MBR performance such as membrane fouling and low removal efficiency. Therefore, this study attempted to investigate the impact on microorganism or membrane permeability when polyaluminium chloride (PAC) was added for phosphorus removal. In batch test, addition of PAC with lower basicity interfered with biological decomposition of organic matters. When the selected PAC with the highest basicity (71%) was employed in continuous MBR, the process showed stable TMP and high-quality treated water due to no negative effect on microorganism.

These conditions of Namgang Dam led to the growth of Salix subfragilis communities. Initially, they were distributed over small areas but over time, they rapidly proliferated to cover large areas. They generate large amounts of leaf debris particularly in the dry season, so that water quality could be deteriorated. And, in the flood season, they raise water levels by obstructing the water flow in tributary streams, this consequently leads to flooding damages. In addition, Salix subfragilis periodically undergoes self-thinning and the withered trunks and branches turn into driftwood. These problems pose difficulties to dam management. By the way, these communities began to wither in areas lower than the highest water level, after a long-term period of inundation in 2012. To determine the reason for the withering phenomena in this study, the relationship between water level(turbidity) and the withering of Salix subfragilis in dam reservoir was investigated, and the withering characteristics of Salix subfragilis communities were analyzed through aerial photographys and field surveys. Results of this study show that disruption of photosynthesis due to high turbidity during the long-term inundation is what was caused their withering.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		70	74		10.2112/SI79-015.1								WOS:000403856800015

The thermal effluent is mixed with sea water and diffused to Youngil Bay. At the beginning of the 1990s, the thermal effluent affects brackish water zone of Hyeongsan River and Youngil Bay and becomes a main cause of red tide in this sea area, which starts to occur from January. Besides, the thermal effluent also affects coastal sea water quality and ecosystem raising the surrounding sea water temperature. In this study, we figured out the present circumstances and problems in the brackish water zone of Hyeongsan River estuary and Youngil Bay, which resulted from the thermal effluent in winter season. We also found out the cause of red tide on the basis of 8 measured categories on site, such as temperature, salinity, DO, COD, TN, TP, chlorophyll-a, and flow velocity, and performed a numerical analysis using the measured data to precisely investigate the occurrence mechanism of red tide. The results show that intrusion range of saline wedge in the lower layer of water depth is reduced in summer season because of increased river discharge, however, the river water and thermal effluent is diffused to Youngil Bay forming a typical estuary front with stratified condition. On the contrary, in winter season, a constant vertical density distribution, resulting from a strong mixing of the upper and lower water layers, is formed at downstream of the thermal effluent outlet. However, a thermohaline front, developing a less denser distribution than that developed in the strong mixing area, is formed at downstream of the strong mixing area. The formation of thermohaline front induces flow stagnation in Youngil Bay and subsequently obstructs river discharge to Youngil Bay. Thus, a mass of chlorophyll-a is bred by the thermal effluent and consequently a red tide.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		174	178		10.2112/SI79-036.1								WOS:000403856800036

However, numerous accidents occur on the eastern coast because of the topographical characteristics of the beach, and most accidents are caused by rip currents. Additionally, in the summer, as many tourists prefer beaches near swash zones, exposure to non-point pollutant sources can occur, significantly harming the health of visitors. Enterococci have shown the strongest correlation to gastrointestinal symptoms in a study examining the relationship between swimming-associated gastrointestinal illness and microorganisms. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found a direct relationship between the density of E. coli and enterococci in surface waters and increased swimmer-associated gastroenteritis. These reports suggest that E. coli and enterococci can be used as bacterial indicators compared to total coliform. Therefore, in this study, the safety of beach seawater was evaluated using E. coli and enterococci as bacterial indicators. Enterococcus and E. coli were isolated during the summer holiday season from the Gyeongpo Beach located on the eastern coast of Korea. The results indicated that the source of pollution near a swash zone, where people are crowded, was larger than that at the dry beach and near swimming zone.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					79		249	253		10.2112/SI79-051.1								WOS:000403856800051

Organic matter has important role in determining water quality to support shrimp growth and production. As increase in organic content tend to reduce oxygen level and inhibite the growth of shrimp. Introduction of seaweeds in shrimp ecosystem is supposed to reduce phytoplankton community and organic level in water all at once. The presence of seaweeds is hypothesized to reduce organic matter in shrimp pond. We proposed to used two species of seaweeds to create shrimp seaweeds poly culture system. These are Sargassum plagyophyllum and Gracillaria verrucosa. The different density of Gracillaria was also introduced as this species was not only survive, but also perform a better growth rate. During the experiment, we monitored the profile of total dissolved organic matter, by assesing its content weekly. Results indicated that there were a constanc weekly increase of total dissolved organic matter during the experiment. In average the presence of Gracilaria capable in reducing organic content by 2,5%, while with Sargassum the organic content was slightly increase by 0,4%. In general, the presence of Gracilaria reduced the total dissolved organic matter in the water, however, the different between its density was not significant.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				MAR	2017	23	3					2361	2363		10.1166/asl.2017.8666								WOS:000403973500207

Detergent Concentrate and Carwash Water Residue Purity Using Charcoal, Rock, and Sand as Filter	ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS					International Workshop on Intelligent Information Technology (2WINTECH)	OCT 20-22, 2016	Cheonan, SOUTH KOREA					Carwash industries emerge in many area as a result of vehicle ownership. Aside from having the advantage economically, carwash industry also causes many problems such as land and water pollution that resulted from the carwash's soap waste. This research aimed to create a simple container to filter the waste so the water output could meet the waste water quality standard. Soap contains detergent that if not managed properly, could cause pollution inside the earth surface and/or the river that are used to discard the carwash waste. The method of this research is to create a prototype and test using the multi-tiered filter that are using charcoal combination (wood and coconut shell), rock (river rock and mountain rock) and sand. One of the parameter that are used in this research is detergent concentration and purity of the filtered water. The result of the filtering process using the prototype device showed that the detergent concentration is still higher than 0,5 mg/L, however, the display of the filtered water itself that are using coconut shell looked clear, while the result that are using the wooden charcoal still looked opaqued or still the same with the sample in the beginning (before being filtered using the device).

Plumbon watershed has an area of 22.5 km(2) and length of 19.75 km. Plumbon River is utilized by local communities as a clean water source, and for aquaculture, agriculture, and sanitary activities. Such community activities development potentially result in BOD and fecal coliform which would enter the water body. Therefore, the study of BOD and fecal coliform pollution loading capacity is required by QUAL2E software. Government Regulation Number 82 of 2001 regarding water quality management and water pollution control becomes the base regulation of pollution loading capacity. The simulation result on minimum discharge (dry season) and maximum discharge (rain season) did not fulfill class 1 or class 2 requirement, and on the other hand Fecal coliform loading capacity did not fulfill the regulation's requirement (except on segment 7). This condition is resulted from such a high quantity of domestic pollutant in the river. According to laboratory test on physics-chemical, and microbiology parameter, Plumbon River was included in the class 3 category. As a controlling strategy for pollution loading capacity, improving wastewater treatment via communal sanitary facility supply from settlement area and routine monitoring on the river's water quality were conducted.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				MAR	2017	23	3					2454	2457		10.1166/asl.2017.8742								WOS:000403973500236

Assessing Water Quality of Ciujung River in Lebak Regency by Using Pollution Index	ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS					International Workshop on Intelligent Information Technology (2WINTECH)	OCT 20-22, 2016	Cheonan, SOUTH KOREA					The Ciujung River basin starts at Lebak Regency and located in Banten Province. Ciujung River plays an important role in Lebak Regency, as a source of irrigation and potable water. In term of sustainable water pollution prevention strategies, it is very important to understand and evaluate the trend of river water quality. The purpose of this study was to determine the water quality status of Ciujung River. A preliminary rapid river water quality status was determined by using pollution index. Dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solid (TDS), total biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), orthophosphates as phosphorus (PO4-P), total coliform, fecal coliform and mercury (Hg) was measured in this study. Based on obtained sampling on 6 sites in Ciujung River, all water quality parameters met water quality standard class as stipulated in Government Regulation No 82/2001. Application of water pollution index towards 6 sampling sites showed good water quality status (water quality standard class III and IV) with pollution index started from 0.44 to 0.92 and showed lightly polluted for water quality standard class I and II with pollution index started from 1.16 to 1.85. Based on these pollution indexes, it is concluded that Ciujung River did not meet the requirements of potable water in Lebak Regency.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				MAR	2017	23	3					2462	2464		10.1166/asl.2017.8749								WOS:000403973500238

Considering the frequent use of automated water quality monitoring systems, their importance in generating data and information for the efficient management of water treatment plants, the design of such an index would allow the detection of point-pollution episodes, which otherwise would occur undetected and would have a significant impact on the water quality and its further treatment. In this study, a versatile weighted water quality index is presented. The proposed index is validated by using historical data recorded by the on-line monitoring system at the intake from Prut River during the period February - December 2012. The parameters selected for evaluation were: pH, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, nitrates and total organic carbon. The weighted index is compared with the well-known Canadian water quality index. For the period under study, the scores for both indexes resulted in class IV of quality, corresponding to a medium water quality. The sensitivity analysis indicates a higher accuracy of the weighted index model as compared to the Canadian index model. The proposed index may be used as a communication tool for water quality towards the general public and various other water stakeholders, and as an operational control instrument for comparing water quality to diverse uses requirements (drinking water use in this study).

At European level, several directives were implemented, with the purpose of regulating the degree of pollution for water sources. Both surface and underground water resources in Romania are being affected by pollutants, such as nitrites, phosphorus, generated through irrational usage of chemical fertilizers, but also through the discharge of urban waste water directly into river courses. The spatiotemporal analysis of water quality in North-Eastern Romania, for Suceava, Ozana and Tazlau drainage basins, was based, in the current study, on the water quality index that has been applied (WQI), and also the variation rate of water quality (R). The results have pointed out the fact that there are no substantial differences concerning water quality, on a North-South direction, but a decrease in the values of these parameters can be observed from upstream, to downstream, for each basin. WQI is associated with a Good Water Quality class, for Suceava river basin (with a value of 39.78), and also for Tazlau basin (with a value of 33.31), but Ozana basin has a value of 16.09, being associated with an Excellent Water Quality class. The results generated by the calculation of the water quality variation rate have emphasized the fact that 57% of the analyzed parameters reveal a worsening tendency, in Suceava and Tazlau drainage basins, while Ozana basin has a value of only 28%.

The final results classify the water quality of the Siret River in Pascani town area as "medium" to "good" (i.e. calculated standard water quality indices-WQI, varying between 63.20 to 72.62 in 2013, and between 53.92 to 76.54 in 2014). The evaluation score (ES) for water quality corresponded to values between 6.28 to 6.57 in 2013, and 5.69 to 6.88 in 2014. The real pollution status of the Siret River is estimated by the global pollution index (I*(GP)), giving values in the range of 2.32 - 2.53 (2013), or 2.11 - 3.09 (2014), which indicate "an aquatic environment modified by domestic and urban wastewater treatment activities, generating discomfort effects for different life forms (especially, daphnia) or human health". It is recommended that continuous monitoring of the Siret River water quality to be undertaken, and the implementation of preventive control and remediation actions (periodic cleaning/sanitation services) in order to perform at least `good' water quality until 2015-2018, at all strategic control sections. Overall, the water quality of the Siret River in Pascani town area was found as improving, and the standard European quality classification target of "good" was partially attained in some control sections in winter season of 2013-2014.

It is a shallow lake with an average depth of 3m and average extent of 1.32 km(2), having a particular importance for the area in which is situated. This importance derives from its main functions in the ecosystem, namely: source of food, shelter and breeding place for almost 54 bird, balneary tourism attraction and jobs for the residents of Amara who live in the northern part of the lake. Under these conditions, the sustainable development of this area is required, and this can be attained by proposing and implementing practices which will protect and harmonize the area from economic, social and ecological point of view. In this study, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis of Amara Lake ecosystem was performed in order to found the most adequate management solution, whose implementation would allow the sustainable development of area. The proposed management solution considers the forestation of southern shore of the lake with Acer campestre tree species. The effects of this solution on Amara Lake ecosystem were evaluated by monitoring three water quality indicators (total nitrogen, total phosphorus and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5)) during of six years (2010- 2015). These indicators are strictly related to the eutrophication process of lake water, and their variations during the monitoring period indicated that the forestation of southern shore of the lake can be considered a viable management solution.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				MAR	2017	16	3					625	631										WOS:000403508600014

The surface water and groundwater samples were collected quarterly in two time periods: January 2012 - June 2013, when the landfill was operational and July 2013 - December 2014, after the landfill was closed. The parameters analyzed in this study include: pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH4+ Cl-, NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Hg, Cr, Cu, Ni). In the case of surface water, for both investigated periods, the only parameter that exceeds the maximum allowable limit is the chemical oxygen demand with a maximum value of 235 mg O-2/L. The high values of the COD indicator may be attributed to the contamination of the surface water with persistent organic pollutants from landfill leachate. The results recorded in the case of groundwater show that the maximum allowable limits for parameters BOD5, COD, NH4+, Cl-, NO2- are exceeded for both investigated periods. All the mean concentrations of heavy metals for the two periods investigated showed values that exceed the maximum allowable limits, except Pb (3.5-6.67 mu g/L) and Hg (n.d.) which were below the limits. Analyzing the results, it can be noticed that the landfill affected the groundwater and the surface water quality, both during the period when it was in use, and after its closure. It represents a risk to human health due to the contaminants that seep into the groundwater, given the proximity of the landfill to the inhabited area (about 200 m). Since this landfill is a source of contamination even after being closed, it is necessary to neutralize it and to monitor the surface and groundwater quality indicators periodically.

When water is loaded with various chemicals due to erosion, corrosion and human activities, the pollution phenomenon appears, causing harmfull effects over plant and animal organisms. The presence in water of substances derived from agriculture or mismanagement of manure organic obtained from various species of domestic animals affects the environmental quality and human health through the development of different types of diseases of the digestive system, circulatory etc. This made all the administrative units in the study area to be declared as vulnerable to pollution by nitrates from agricultural sources. This study was conducted in the drainage basin of Geru River in Galati County and was focused on three periods (2011, 2012, 2013) for calculation of livestock and production of waste and nutrients sewage and in three periods (July 2012, July 2013, November 2013) for the monitoring of water quality. The results revealed that the production of nutrients does not generate a high pressure over land, but point pollution affected the aquifer on an extended area. Therefore, groundwater could have poor quality and it is not recommended for drinking in the villages where nitrate levels are very high. Our study showed that organic manure production was not large enough to put high pressure on agricultural land, but causes the increase in the amount of nitrate in the groundwater, as a result of manure mismanagement.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				MAR	2017	16	3					653	668										WOS:000403508600017

Water Quality and Mangrove-Derived Tannins in Four Coastal Lagoons from the Gulf of Mexico with Variable Hydrologic Dynamics	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												This study explored the spatial variability of physico-chemical water variables e., salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus and tannins) in contrasting seasons in four coastal lagoons (Chica y Grande, La Mancha, Sontecomapan and El Ostion) along Veracruz state, Mexico. We also calculated the mangrove and central basin water areas and associated them to physico-chemical data to analyze them by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) due to high correlation among variables. Finally, we elaborated coded maps of each lagoon to represent the gradients of the variables with statistically significant loadings in either of the first two components accounting for 50 to 70% of total data variability.. In La Mancha, NH4, NO3 and RP but not salinity were associated with river outflows. In Grande and Chica, NH4, NO3 and RP were higher near the lagoon inlet, but the major river outflows was also in that area, confounding their actual source. Finally, NO3 were strongly associated with river outflows in Sontecomapan and El Ostion. However, the concentrations of tannins were directly associated with mangrove cover in the four lagoons. Our results indicate that the connection with the sea, the position of the inflowing rivers, and the morphology of the lagoon provides the "estuarine signature" of each lagoon.

It is important to revert this tendency and promote medium term studies that can help to foresee the unwanted effects, sometimes irreversible, of human activities on the environment. This paper includes results from hydrodynamic and water quality studies carried out in Petacalco Bay, Guerrero (Mexican Pacific) in order to present elements for future appropriate management of industrial outflows in the region. Around this bay theft are important rivers and small villages, a major port, chemical and thermoelectric plants, all discharging their (generally untreated) effluents directly into the sea. The results of this study show that the overall water quality is similar to natural concentrations found in the ocean. Nevertheless, eutrophization was found, associated with the fertilizer industry, and the hot water discharge from the thermoelectric plant generates hot plumes, which dissipate in the environment, despite the intense and variable hydrodynamic characteristics of the region.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SPR	2017					77		39	50		10.2112/SI77-005.1								WOS:000403526200005

Compared with point-source pollutants, the identification and quantification of non-point-source pollutants are critical but difficult issues in water environmental pollution studies. The Jinghe River is one of the main tributaries of the Weihe River. However, the non-point-source pollution of this river is not well understood. In order to analyze the sources of pointand non-point loads to river water, the river water quality model QUAL2E and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & Factor Analysis (FA) were applied simultaneously to calculate the point-and non-point-source loads of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, respectively, in dry and wet seasons from 2002 to 2007. The results show that NO3- -N can be associated with point-source pollution, such as domestic sewage in dry seasons, but non-point-source pollution generated by precipitation in wet seasons. NH4+-N can be associated with point-source pollution throughout the year. The methods applied in this research provide reliable results on non-point-source pollution caused by storm runoff.																	0187-8336	2007-2422				MAR-APR	2017	8	2					117	126										WOS:000403101600011

Winter oilseed production for biofuel in the US Corn Belt: opportunities and limitations	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY												Interest from the US commercial aviation industry and commitments established by the US Navy and Air Force to use renewable fuels has spurred interest in identifying and developing crops for renewable aviation fuel. Concern regarding greenhouse gas emissions associated with land-use change and shifting land grown for food to feedstock production for fuel has encouraged the concept of intensifying current prominent cropping systems through various double cropping strategies. Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) and field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) are two winter oilseed crops that could potentially be integrated into the corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [(Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cropping system, which is the prominent cropping system in the US Corn Belt. In addition to providing a feedstock for renewable aviation fuel production, integrating these crops into corn-soybean cropping systems could also potentially provide a range of ecosystem services. Some of these include soil protection from wind and water erosion, soil organic C (SOC) sequestration, water quality improvement through nitrate reduction, and a food source for pollinators. However, integration of these crops into corn-soybean cropping systems also carries possible limitations, such as potential yield reductions of the subsequent soybean crop. This review identifies and discusses some of the key benefits and constraints of integrating camelina or field pennycress into corn-soybean cropping systems and identifies generalized areas for potential adoption in the US Corn Belt.																	1757-1693	1757-1707				MAR	2017	9	3					508	524		10.1111/gcbb.12297								WOS:000402740900003

There are many reasons behind the wet pack occurrences after autoclaving like poor quality of wrapping materials, faulty valves of rigid container, faulty loading and packaging technique, poor steam quality, sterilizer malfunction and may be design related problems in CSSD sterile storage area. Cause of wet pack after steam sterilization processes may occur severe problems because of wasted time and effort, increased work load, increased cost, potentially contaminated instruments, infection risk to the patient, poor patient outcomes and delayed or cancellation of procedures. But such wet pack scenario can be avoided by various methods by using good steam (water) quality, performing periodic maintenance of the Autoclaves, avoidance of sterilizer overloading, allowing adequate post sterilization time to cool down the materials to room temperature, using good quality wrapping materials, properly maintain temperature and humidity of sterile storage area etc. (C) 2016 King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences.

Relationships between fish assemblages and selected habitat features were examined in the Pearl River, the largest subtropical river in southern China. Altogether, 94 fish species, representing 17 families and 5 orders were sampled. The dominant fish family was Cyprinidae, accounting for 49 taxa. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was applied to the collected data and it was found that the spatial variation of upstream fish assemblages was significantly different from downstream. Both water quality and habitat climate were significantly related to assemblages. Redundancy analysis revealed that the spatial patterns of fish assemblages were mostly explained by river width, temperature, river discharge, transparency and precipitation. It was concluded that the spatial patterns of fish assemblages in the Pearl River are closely associated with local abiotic features. Understanding the mechanisms such as those outlined in this research paper is the basis of conservation of fish community diversity, which is a critical resource to a successful sustainable wild fishery in the Pearl River.																	1863-9135					MAR	2017	189	4					329	340		10.1127/fal/2016/0922								WOS:000400955400004

Optical response associated with changing summer biogeochemical conditions in a turbid lake	LIMNOLOGICA												Water quality degradation in inland water bodies during summer periods due to phytoplankton growth is a global problem. Lake Burley Griffin (LBG) in Canberra, Australia is an artificial, turbid, urban lake which is prone to water quality degradation in summer due to phytoplankton blooms. In Australia only limited (spatial, spectral and temporal) datasets are available that detail the full bio-optical condition of the water body during summer transformation processes. In this study, we conducted field campaigns in LBG to measure biogeochemical as well as inherent optical properties (IOP) during summer 2010 to understand the variability in the optical response. Optically active biogeochemical components such as total suspended solids (TSS), Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) varied over a wide range in response to changing environmental conditions during summer. The underwater optical environment was dominated by light scattering properties and the light absorption budget varied in response to changing CDOM and phytoplankton distributions. Specific inherent optical properties and spectral slopes of ICP observed here were different to other regional datasets, thus indicated the limitation in the extrapolation of optical models from other regions. Optical response as described by the scattering to absorption ratio and backscattering albedo showed that absorption due to CDOM and non-algal particulate matter (NAP) masked phytoplankton absorption features limiting the application of standard optical algorithms. A through description of bio-optical properties, relationships and their variability in response to changing summer biogeochemical conditions in a turbid optically complex lake is presented here.

Macrophytes-cyanobacteria allelopathic interactions and their implications for water resources management-A review	LIMNOLOGICA												Macrophytes and phytoplankton including cyanobacteria are main primary producers in aquatic environments.Macrophytes can maintain water quality by suppressing phytoplankton growth through a number of mechanisms: while e.g. the absorption of high amounts of nutrients and the provision of refuge from predation for herbivorous aquatic fauna are widely accepted macrophyte functions, the role of their release of allelopathic substances in suppressing phytoplankton is increasingly being studied. Some macrophyte species can support the growth of epiphytic cyanobacteria providing them an advantage over planktonic species in the competition for nutrients. On the other hand, some cyanobacteria dominate in eutrophic water bodies and produce cyanotoxins that exert allelopathic substances which may contribute to the decline of macrophytes. Macrophytes can interact with these cyanotoxins in different ways including bioaccumulation and biotransformation. This review focuses on such allelopathic interactions between macrophytes and toxic cyanobacteria. The article also suggests methods for researchers and water resources managers for the application of macrophytes to control harmful cyanobacterial blooms and as phytoremediators for toxin elimination from water bodies.

They bridge the gap between laboratory and field studies by creating a contained test apparatus that allows for greater control over test organisms while still exposing them to natural environmental variations. A new mesocosm was designed to monitor the in-situ settlement patterns of barnacles. This paper focuses on testing the efficacy of the mesocosm to manage potential problems such as biofouling, corrosion, and poor water quality. The mesocosm consisted of a PVC cube, where four of the six sides had windows covered with 100-mu m plankton mesh. Every 2 days, the cube was rotated so that one of the mesh sides was held out of the water, preventing biofouling from clogging the mesh. Biofouling on the outside of the mesocosm significantly correlated to the days of immersion in the marine environment; the longer a side was immersed, the greater the biofouling coverage (p < 0.05, R-2 > 0.50). Therefore, the design successfully managed fouling without the use of harmful chemicals. Phytoplankton composition inside and outside the mesocosm was not significantly different (p > 0.05), proving that there was food available to the barnacle larvae for development. There was a lower amount of meroplankton inside the mesocosm (p < 0.05) as compared to outside, showing that this mesocosm successfully excluded most competing larvae. This mesocosm design was successful at inhibiting biofouling growth, maintaining water quality and sufficient food, preventing competitive settlers, and housing specific settlement experimentation.																	0025-3324	1948-1209				MAR-APR	2017	51	2					31	38		10.4031/MTSJ.51.2.8								WOS:000401220700004

In order to determine the distributions of dissolved and particulate As and Hg in Sungai Kuantan and evaluate its changes temporally and spatially, water samples were collected from the surface and bottom layers in a grid of 9 stations from estuary towards the upstream of Sungai Kuantan from May 2012 till October 2012. The dissolved metals were pre-concentrated using Chelex-100 while particulate metals were digested using Teflon bomb and subsequently were analyzed using ICP-MS. Dissolved As ranging from 4.650 to 36.894 mu g L-1 while dissolved Hg ranging from BDL to 0.011 mu g L-1. Particulate As and Hg varied from 0.650 to 86.087 mg L-1 and BDL to 5.873 mg L-1, respectively. Higher concentration of the dissolved elements were found mainly in October 2012 and particulate elements concentration mostly higher in May 2012. The source of the studied metals in the river may be the run-off from the effluent discharges and other natural sources. The toxic elements studied in Sungai Kuantan waters were still below the Interim Marine Water Quality Standard (INWQS) permissible limits.																	0126-6039					MAR	2017	46	3					393	399		10.17576/jsm-2017-4603-06								WOS:000401432600006

Water quality was determined at 12 stations along Batang Rajang and its tributaries in terms of in-situ and ex-situ water quality parameters. The results showed that most stations at main river were categorized as slightly polluted while most tributaries were clean according to the Water Quality Index. The river is suffering from organic pollution where almost all stations along the river contained high chemical oxygen demand (approximate to 43.1 mg/L) and total ammonia nitrogen (approximate to 0.520 mg/L) and were classified as Class III and IV at most of the stations. High suspended solids (218.3 mg/L) and low dissolved oxygen (4.6 mg/L) were observed at the main river. The low dissolved oxygen content from the Bakun dam upstream of the study area has an impact on the river particularly during dry season where DO dropped below the minimum required for sensitive aquatic organisms. As seven tributaries are within Class II indicating healthy freshwater ecosystems, they should be conserved as habitats for sensitive aquatic organisms. Conversely, proper management need to be initiated in particular, Sungai Merit tributary and the main river where DO were below the minimum required for sensitive aquatic organisms.

A space mission design and analysis was performed in this work. The system consists of three segments; space segment including a constellation of nano-satellites, ground segment entailing the ground station and user-segment containing the in-situ water quality sensors. The authors studied the orbit characteristics and the number of nano-satellites required to cover the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) which presents the most water scarce region of the world. Thus, 9 nano-satellites distributed in 5 low earth orbits (600 km) are needed to cover MENA region continuously for about all the day. Data collected by various sensors such as pH and temperature are sent through Software Defined Radio (SDR) module which is responsible for the satellite communication.																	2158-107X	2156-5570				MAR	2017	8	3					357	362										WOS:000400159400050

Meteorological influence on summertime baroclinic exchange in the Straits of Mackinac	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Straits flows can impose a complex hydrodynamic environment with high seasonal variability and significant impacts to nearby water bodies. In the Straits of Mackinac, exchange flow between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron influences water quality and ecological processes, as well as the transport of any contaminants released in or near the straits. Although previous work has shown that a Helmholtz mode is responsible for the barotropic flow oscillations in the straits, baroclinic effects impose opposite surface and subsurface flows during the summer months. In this study, we use observations of currents and water temperatures from instruments deployed in the straits to validate a hydrodynamic model of the combined Lake Michigan-Huron system and then use the model results to investigate the baroclinic flow and determine the forcing mechanisms that drive exchange flow in the Straits of Mackinac. Analysis shows that although the Helmholtz mode drives a 3 day oscillation throughout the year, thermal stratification in the summer establishes a bidirectional flow that is governed by a shift from regional-scale to local-scale meteorological conditions. These results detail the seasonal variability in the straits, including the barotropic and baroclinic contributions to exchange flow and the influence of local atmospheric forcing on transport through the Straits of Mackinac.

The main aim of this study is to analyse the variability of selected physical and chemical properties of surface waters in the catchment area in the years 1988-2012. It was found that surface waters in the catchment can be classified as hard and very hard, with slightly basic pH. The deterioration of Rozany Strumien water quality concerns chemical oxygen demand, conductivity, chlorides, sodium, ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen concentrations. The authors of the study have noticed a decrease in the amount of phosphates and sulphates in the water. As observed, the hydrogeochemical type of water changed from calcium-hydrogen carbonate-sulphate into calcium-sodium-hydrogen carbonate-sulphate-chloride. Changes in water chemistry are probably a result of anthropogenic impacts, and they can be associated with the transformation of land use in the catchment area, i.e. the ongoing urbanization of the area.

J	Jamwal, P				Jamwal, Priyanka			Fate of Nutrients in Human Dominated Ecosystems A Case Study of Jakkur Lake in Bengaluru	RESONANCE-JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION												Jakkur Lake in the city of Bengaluru covers an approximate area of 55 hectares and primarily receives inflows from the Jakkur sewage treatment plant (STP) and an open storm drain. Jakkur STP discharges an average of 10 million litres of treated water daily (MLD) into the lake. The open drain discharges about 0.5 MLD of raw sewage into the lake. In the absence of environmental flows it becomes critical to assess the impact of nutrient flux on the quality of water, and design cost effective treatment solutions to address the issues of lake water quality. As part of this study, we have assessed the impact of these two primary inflows on the overall water quality of Jakkur Lake. The results have shown that nutrient inflows have led to the increase of chlorophyll-a levels, eventually causing hyper-eutrophication of Jakkur lake. We have also used simple mass balance approach to assess the contributions of in-lake activities (sedimentation and reaction) on removal of nutrients from the lake. We have concluded that the phosphorus load has to be reduced by approximately 96% from the current levels to prevent algal blooms within Jakkur Lake.																	0971-8044	0973-712X				MAR	2017	22	3					279	290		10.1007/s12045-017-0460-7								WOS:000400466600010

Two water-sampling points were selected: Jijia-Victoria [5.1] and JijiaOpriseni [5.21 The high values of nitrates are caused by the use of nitrogen-based chemical fertilizers and of manure. Contamination with nitrites (N-NO) and nitrates (N-NO,) of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the floodplain ofJijia is still high because of agricultural and zootechnical activities.

This flood was Canada's most costly natural disaster, with five to six billion Canadian dollars in damages, The first objective of this study was to determine if the flood caused an increase in private drinking water well contamination in the Calgary Health Zone by comparing contamination rates to previous years. The second objective was to determine which environmental factors were associated with contamination during this flood event. Test results of total coliforms (TC) and Escherichia colt (EC) of private water wells were used to determine contamination. A geographically weighted Poisson regression analysis suggested that TC contamination was not associated with this flood. The EC contamination is positively associated with floodways, flood fringe, farms, and negatively associated with intermittent water (sloughs). These results suggest that for the 2013 flood, individual well characteristics are more important than surrounding geographic features. Thus, it is recommended that homeowners who live in a high-risk area ensure their wells are properly maintained to reduce risk of water well contamination.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Impacts of the 2014 severe drought on the Microcystis bloom in San Francisco Estuary	HARMFUL ALGAE												The increased frequency and intensity of drought with climate change may cause an increase in the magnitude and toxicity of freshwater cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (CHABs), including Microcystis blooms, in San Francisco Estuary, California. As the fourth driest year on record in San Francisco Estuary, the 2014 drought provided an opportunity to directly test the impact of severe drought on cyanobacteria blooms in SFE. A field sampling program was conducted between July and December 2014 to sample a suite of physical, chemical, and biological variables at 10 stations in the freshwater and brackish reaches of the estuary. The 2014 Microcystis bloom had the highest biomass and toxin concentration, earliest initiation, and the longest duration, since the blooms began in 1999. Median chlorophyll a concentration increased by 9 and 12 times over previous dry and wet years, respectively. Total microcystin concentration also exceeded that in previous dry and wet years by a factor of 11 and 65, respectively. Cell abundance determined by quantitative PCR indicated the bloom contained multiple potentially toxic cyanobacteria species, toxic Microcystis and relatively high total cyanobacteria abundance. The bloom was associated with extreme nutrient concentrations, including a 20-year high in soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and low to below detection levels of ammonium. Stable isotope analysis suggested the bloom varied with both inorganic and organic nutrient concentration, and used ammonium as the primary nitrogen source. Water temperature was a primary controlling factor for the bloom and was positively correlated with the increase in both total and toxic Microcystis abundance. In addition, the early initiation and persistence of warm water temperature coincided with the increased intensity and duration of the Microcystis bloom from the usual 3 to 4 months to 8 months. Long residence time was also a primary factor controlling the magnitude and persistence of the bloom, and was created by a 66% to 85% reduction in both the water inflow and diversion of water for agriculture during the summer. We concluded that severe drought conditions can lead to a significant increase in the abundance of Microcystis and other cyanobacteria, as well as their associated toxins. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Combined physical, chemical and biological factors shape Alexandrium ostenfeldii blooms in the Netherlands	HARMFUL ALGAE												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are globally expanding, compromising water quality worldwide. HAB dynamics are determined by a complex interplay of abiotic and biotic factors, and their emergence has often been linked to eutrophication, and more recently to climate change. The dinoflagellate Alexandrium is one of the most widespread HAB genera and its success is based on key functional traits like allelopathy, mixotrophy, cyst formation and nutrient retrieval migrations. Since 2012, dense Alexandrium ostenfeldii blooms (up to 4500 cells mL(-1)) have recurred annually in a creek located in the southwest of the Netherlands, an area characterized by intense agriculture and aquaculture. We investigated how physical, chemical and biological factors influenced A. ostenfeldii bloom dynamics over three consecutive years (2013-2015). Overall, we found a decrease in the magnitude of the bloom over the years that could largely be linked to changing weather conditions during summer. More specifically, low salinities due to excessive rainfall and increased wind speed corresponded to a delayed A. ostenfeldii bloom with reduced population densities in 2015. Within each year, highest population densities generally corresponded to high temperatures, low DIN:DIP ratios and low grazer densities. Together, our results demonstrate an important role of nutrient availability, absence of grazing, and particularly of the physical environment on the magnitude and duration of A. ostenfeldii blooms. Our results suggest that predicted changes in the physical environment may enhance bloom development in future coastal waters and embayments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

They were among the largest of such outbreaks around the world, and these blooms likely originated along the coast of the Jiangsu Province, China. Understanding the roles of nutrients in the onset of these macroalgal blooms is needed to identify their origin. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variations in dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus (DIN and PO4-P) and the N/P ratio along the Jiangsu coast from 1996 to 2014 during late-March to April, the months which corresponds to the pre-bloom period of green tides since 2007. A zone of high DIN and PO4-P concentrations has developed along the Jiangsu coast, between the cities of Sheyang and Nantong, since 1996. There was an 18-year trend of increasing DIN concentrations during the pre-bloom period as well as a positive correlation between the U. prolifera biomass and DIN concentrations. Nutrient inputs from rivers and mariculture in the Jiangsu Province may have provided nitrogen that contributed the magnitude of macroalgal blooms that subsequently spread into the southern Yellow Sea.

Results show that, depending on how respondents perceived the issue, knowledge level and perception of a problem both are dominating factors in people's understanding of their water source. Using a survey to identify relationships, the study found that those respondents from cities with lead levels that exceeded the action level showed higher concern for their tap water quality; this increased when the respondents could not identify their water source. Looking at these results in the context of the theory of planned behavior (specifically perception, knowledge, and behavior), showed that the more people know about their source water, the less likely they are to express unnecessary concern due to a misperception of an issue.

Biologically active filtration successfully decreased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) by 5-25% and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) by 5-38%. The removal of these parameters corresponded to some decreases in carbonaceous and nitrogenous DBP formation. Formation potential tests showed 13-45% and 18-57% reduction in the formation of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids, respectively. Bromine incorporation factors of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids increased across the biofilters. Biofilters also showed 25-48%, 15-20%, and 34-50% removal of halonitromethane, haloacetonitrile, and N-nitrosodimethylamine precursors, respectively. The effects of filter media and phosphate amendment were also evaluated in full-and pilot-scale systems. Results showed that replacing the anthracite layer with granular activated carbon increased the removal of DOC, DON, and DBP precursors. Phosphate amendment had no distinct effect on the removal of DOC, DON, or DBP precursors.																	2164-4535					MAR	2017	109	3					E73	E84		10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.0014								WOS:000400052000004

Modeling sprinkler irrigation infiltration based on a fuzzy-logic approach	SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												In this study, the irrigation water infiltration rate (IR) is defined by input variables in linguistic terms using a fuzzy-logic approach. A fuzzy-logic model was developed using data collected from published data. The model was trained with three fuzzy membership functions: triangular ('trimf'), trapezoid ('trapmf'), and pi ('pimf'). The fuzzy system considered the number of irrigation events, applied water depth, polyacrylamide application rate, water application time, water electrical conductivity, soil surface slope, and soil texture components as input variables. The inputs were classified in terms of low, medium, and high levels. The output variable (i.e., IR) was rated in terms of five levels: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. Using statistical analysis, the values of IR resulting from the developed fuzzy-logic model were compared with the observations from the experiments. The results confirm that the agreement between the observations and predictive results was acceptable, except for fuzzy 'trimf'. The coefficient of determination provided the greatest value when using the 'trapmf' and 'pimf', with the value estimated for the 'pimf' slightly higher than that of 'trapmf'. Based on the results that were obtained, irrigation managers can use the fuzzy-logic approach to modify their field practices during the growing season to improve on-farm water management.																	1695-971X					MAR	2017	15	1							e1201	10.5424/sjar/2017151-9179								WOS:000400100600015

Membrane filtration processes are an attractive source of process water recovery since the technology is already utilized in the dairy industry and its use is expected to grow considerably. At Arla Foods Ingredients (AFI), permeate from a reverse osmosis polisher filtration unit is sought to be reused as process water, replacing the intake of potable water. However, as for all dairy and food producers, the process water quality must be monitored continuously to ensure food safety. In the present investigation we found urea to be the main organic compound, which potentially could represent a microbiological risk. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with multivariate modeling has a long-standing reputation as a real-time measurement technology in quality assurance. Urea was quantified Using NIRS and partial least squares regression (PLS) in the concentration range 50-200 ppm (RMSEP = 12 ppm, R-2 = 0.88) in laboratory settings with potential for on-line application. A drawback of using NIRS together with PLS is that uncertainty estimates are seldom reported but essential to establishing real-time risk assessment. In a multivariate regression setting, sample-specific prediction errors are needed, which complicates the uncertainty estimation. We give a straightforward strategy for implementing an already developed, but seldom used, method for estimating sample-specific prediction uncertainty. We also suggest an improvement. Comparing independent reference analyses with the sample-specific prediction error estimates showed that the method worked on industrial samples when the model was appropriate and unbiased, and was simple to implement.				van den Berg, Frans/N-2899-2014	van den Berg, Frans/0000-0002-9170-9052; Skou, Peter/0000-0003-2540-5496; Rasmussen, Morten Arendt/0000-0001-7431-5206												0003-7028	1943-3530				MAR	2017	71	3					410	421		10.1177/0003702816654165								WOS:000399925900006	27899431

The aim of this study was to evaluate the water quality from the fountains located in three public parks in Curitiba, Parana, Brasil. The monitoring was conducted monthly by microbiological analysis of total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli (EC) and heterotrophic bacteria (HB) and the pH was taken, with triplicate samples during a year at three sites: Atuba Park (A), Gutierrez Park (B) and Sao Lourenco Park (C). The results showed TC in site A; at B it was observed the presence, at high levels, of TC (log 2.4350 +/- 0.6730 NMP center dot 100 mL(-1)), EC (log 1.0890 +/- 0.6327 NMP center dot 100 mL(-1)) and HB (log 1.9170 +/- 0.6920 UFC center dot mL-1), significant differences among sampling periods were not observed (p>0.05). It was observed that in the rainy season the condition of water portability decreased in all evaluated sites with a significant increase in TC, followed by increasing of HB, suggesting infiltration in the channeled sources. The presence of E. coli in site B suggests wastewater pollution, which can endanger the health people consuming the available water in the taps.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					271	275		10.1590/S1413-41522016158283								WOS:000397875300006

One of key goals of Water Framework Directive is to classify rivers and streams using biological quality elements and type specifi c reference conditions. According to system B which incorporates additional abiotic descriptors, there are 24 water types in Croatia. For biological analyses 92 rivers and streams with 140 sampling points were chosen and sampled for benthic diatoms and water chemistry simultaneously. Self organizing map (SOM) analysis was used to defi ne biotypes from species composition and abundance of benthic diatoms. Grouping of samples in SOM resulted in 10 distinctive groups. Based on their geographical position and site characteristics, groups represent sites with similar properties (as waterbed, catchment size, altitude, size of stream) belonging to different ecoregions in Croatia. Analysis of variance revealed statistically signifi cant differences (p<0.05) among SOM groups concerning ammonia, nitrates and total phosphorus. Indicator species analysis (IndVal) singled out species that were signifi cantly characteristic (p<0.05) for SOM and abiotic types. Compared to abiotic groups, in which 7 out of 24 have no indicator species, all SOM groups have one or several characteristic diatom species, thus indicating diatom assemblages as valuable site descriptors. Canonical analysis of principal coordinates analysis also indicated that SOM grouping of samples is statistically reliable. Grouping of similar sites, although placed into different abiotic types, makes SOM groups with its corresponding representative species an easy tool for water quality assessment and description of reference assemblage.

J	Tokatli, C				Tokatli, Cem			Bioecological and statistical risk assessment of toxic metals in sediments of a worldwide important wetland: Gala Lake National Park (Turkey)	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												Gala Lake National Park that has an international importance is one of the most important wetland ecosystems for Turkey. As same as many aquatic habitats, Gala Lake is under a significant anthropogenic pressure originated from agricultural activities conducted around the lake and from industrial discharges by means of Ergene River. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sediment quality of Gala Lake and Irrigation Canal by investigating some toxic element accumulations (As, B, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd, Zn and Cu) from a statistical perspective. Pearson Correlation Index (PCI) and Factor Analysis (FA) were applied to detected data in order to determine the associated contaminants and effective factors on the system. Potential Ecological Risk Index (R-I) and Biological Risk Index based sediment quality guidelines (mERM-Q) applied to detected data in order to assess the ecological and biological risks of heavy metals in the ecosystem. Also Geographic Information System (GIS) technology was used to make visual explanations by presenting distribution maps of investigated elements. According to the results of PCI, significant positive correlations were recorded among the investigated toxic elements at 0.01 significance level. According to the results of FA, two factors, which were named as "Agricultural Factor" and "Industrial Factor", explained 86.6% of the total variance. According to the results of Potential Ecological Risk Index, cadmium was found to be the highest risk factor and according to results of Biological Risk Index, nickel and chromium were found to be the highest risk factors for Gala Lake and Irrigation Canal. As a result of the present study, it was also determined that heavy metal contents in sediments of Gala Lake National Park reached to critical levels and the system is intensively under effect of agricultural and industrial originated pollution.																	2083-4772	2083-4810				MAR	2017	43	1					34	47		10.1515/aep-2017-0007								WOS:000399253500005

Our study aims to investigate the impact of a community-level hygiene education program and a water quality intervention using riverbank filtration (RBF) technology on diarrhoeal prevalence. Methods and analysis: We have designed a stepped wedge cluster randomised trial to estimate the health impacts of our intervention in 4 rural villages in Karnataka, India. At baseline, surveys will be conducted in all villages, and householders will receive hygiene education. New pipelines, water storage tanks and taps will then be installed at accessible locations in each village and untreated piped river water will be supplied. A subsequent survey will evaluate the impact of hygiene education combined with improved access to greater water volumes for hygiene and drinking purposes (improved water quantity). Villages will then be randomly ordered and RBF-treated water (improved water quality) will be sequentially introduced into the 4 villages in a stepwise manner, with administration of surveys at each time point. The primary outcome is a 7-day period prevalence of self-reported diarrhoea. Secondary outcomes include self-reported respiratory and skin infections, and reported changes in hygiene practices, household water usage and water supply preference. River, tank and tap water from each village, and stored water from a subset of households, will be sampled to assess microbial and chemical quality. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was obtained from the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee in Australia and The Energy and Resources Institute Institutional Ethics Committee in India. The results of the trial will be presented at conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated to relevant stakeholders. This study is funded by an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) project grant.

However, deficiencies with water quality and quantity at the household level and community coverage and actual use of toilets have led Gram Vikas, a local non-governmental organization in Odisha, India, to develop an approach that provides household-level piped water connections contingent on full community-level toilet coverage. Methods: This matched cohort study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a combined piped water and sanitation intervention. Households with children <5 years in 45 randomly selected intervention villages and 45 matched control villages will be followed over 17 months. The primary outcome is prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases; secondary health outcomes include soil-transmitted helminth infection, nutritional status, seroconversion to enteric pathogens, urogenital infections and environmental enteric dysfunction. In addition, intervention effects on sanitation and water coverage, access and use, environmental fecal contamination, women's empowerment, as well as collective efficacy, and intervention cost and cost-effectiveness will be assessed. Ethics and dissemination: The study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the ethics boards of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK and KIIT University, Bhubaneswar, India. Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed literature and presentation to stakeholders, government officials, implementers and researchers.																	2044-6055					MAR	2017	7	3							e012719	10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012719								WOS:000398959400025	28363920

This study investigated the potential efficiency of water quality improvement, as well as genotoxicity and cytotoxicity reduction along the ecological restoration project of this polluted urban river. Results showed that the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) of the reclaimed municipal effluent were reduced by more than 45 and 70%, respectively, meeting the Chinese surface water environmental quality standard level IV, while the total phosphorus and metal concentrations had no significant reduction along the restoration project, and Pb concentrations in all river water samples exceeded permissible limit in drinking water set by WHO (2006) and China (GB5749-2006). The in vitro SOS/umu assay showed 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide equivalent (4-NQOEQ) values of reclaimed municipal wastewater of 0.69 +/- 0.05 mu g/L in April and 0.68 +/- 0.06 mu g/L in December, respectively, indicating the presence of genotoxic compounds. The results of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) and hepatic cell apoptosis in zebrafish after a chorionic long-term (21 days) in vivo exposure also demonstrated that the reclaimed municipal wastewater caused significant DNA oxidative damage and cytotoxicity. After the ecological purification of 18.5-km field-scale restoration project, the genotoxicity assessed by in vitro assay was negligible, while the DNA oxidative damage and cytotoxicity in exposed fish were still significantly elevated. The mechanisms of DNA oxidative damage and cytotoxicity caused by the reclaimed municipal wastewater need further study.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2017	24	7					6715	6723		10.1007/s11356-016-8352-z								WOS:000399163700076	28091988

A non-parametric regression method, generalized additive models (GAM), was used to analyse the correlations among eleven physicochemical and biological parameters as well as three meteorological factors (wind speed, rainfall and solar radiation) which we collected from 2000 to 2011. The results indicate that the three meteorological factors may have positive effects on SS. Moreover, statistically significant correlations between many water quality parameters and SS or TDS were exhibited seasonally. The correlations between electrical conductivity (EC) and SS were opposite to correlations between EC and TDS. This finding reveals that TDS have a positive impact on EC, while EC negatively affects SS. The results indicated that many parameters, such as total nitrogen, total phosphorus, biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), were related to SS due to the adsorption of SS. Moreover, both positive and negative correlations between COD and TDS were observed in this freshwater reservoir. The positive correlation between chlorophyll a and SS suggested that the change of SS concentration in autumn was caused by the growth of algae. Meanwhile, significant correlations between SS and meteorological factors were also observed, indicating that meteorological factors had effects on SS dynamics. This study provides useful information regarding the correlations among water quality parameters, SS and TDS with meteorological factors in a freshwater reservoir.

This is reflected in increasing public and political focus on a more sustainable use of pesticides, as well as a reduction in diffuse pollution. Climate change will likely to lead to an even more intensive use of pesticides in the future, affecting agriculture in many ways. At the same time, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) and associated EU policies called for a "good" ecological and chemical status to be achieved for water bodies by the end of 2015, currently delayed to 2021-2027 due to a lack of efficiency in policies and timescale of resilience for hydrosystems, especially groundwater systems. Water managers need appropriate and user-friendly tools to design agro-environmental policies. These tools should help them to evaluate the potential impacts of mitigation measures on water resources, more clearly define protected areas, and more efficiently distribute financial incentives to farmers who agree to implement alternative practices. At present, a number of reports point out that water managers do not use appropriate information from monitoring or models to make decisions and set environmental action plans. In this paper, we propose an integrated and collaborative approach to analyzing changes in land use, farming systems, and practices and to assess their effects on agricultural pressure and pesticide transfers to waters. The integrated modeling of agricultural scenario (IMAS) framework draws on a range of data and expert knowledge available within areas where a pesticide action plan can be defined to restore the water quality, French "Grenelle law" catchment areas, French Water Development and Management Plan areas, etc. A so-called "reference scenario" represents the actual soil occupation and pesticide-spraying practices used in both conventional and organic farming. A number of alternative scenarios are then defined in cooperation with stakeholders, including socio-economic conditions for developing alternative agricultural systems or targeting mitigation measures. Our integrated assessment of these scenarios combines the calculation of spatialized environmental indicators with integrated bio-economic modeling. The latter is achieved by a combined use of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling with our own purpose-built land use generator module (Generator of Land Use version 2 (GenLU2)) and an economic model developed using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) for cost-effectiveness assessment. This integrated approach is applied to two embedded catchment areas (total area of 360,000 ha) within the Charente river basin (SW France). Our results show that it is possible to differentiate scenarios based on their effectiveness, represented by either evolution of pressure (agro-environmental indicators) or transport into waters (pesticide concentrations). By analyzing the implementation costs borne by farmers, it is possible to identify the most cost-effective scenarios at sub-basin and other aggregated levels (WFD hydrological entities, sensitive areas). Relevant results and indicators are fed into a specifically designed database. Data warehousing is used to provide analyses and outputs at all thematic, temporal, or spatial aggregated levels, defined by the stakeholders (type of crops, herbicides, WFD areas, years), using Spatial On-Line Analytical Processing (SOLAP) tools. The aim of this approach is to allow public policy makers to make more informed and reasoned decisions when managing sensitive areas and/or implementing mitigation measures.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2017	24	8					6923	6950		10.1007/s11356-016-7657-2								WOS:000399164600009	27726081

Nineteen different herbicides were observed in one or more water samples from the five sites; chemicals observed at more than 40% of sites were simazine (100%), MCPA (83%), diuron (63%) and atrazine (53%). Using the toxicity unit (TU) concept to assess potential risk to aquatic ecosystems, none of the detected herbicides were considered to pose an individual, group or collective short-term risk to fish or zooplankton in the waters studied. However, 13 herbicides had TU values suggesting they might have posed an individual risk to primary producers at the time of sampling. Water quality guideline levels were exceeded on many occasions for Cd, Cu, Cr, Pb and Zn. Similarly, RQ(med) and RQ(max) exceeded 1 for Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Vand Zn. Almost all the metals screened exceeded a log(10)TU of -3 for every trophic level, suggesting that there may have been some impact on aquatic organisms in the studied waterbodies. Our data indicate that Melbourne's urban aquatic environments may be being impacted by approved domestic, industrial and sporting application of herbicides and that stormwater quality needs to be carefully assessed prior to reuse. Further research is required to understand the performance of different urban stormwater wetland designs in removing pesticides and trace metals. Applying the precautionary principle to herbicide regulation is important to ensure there is more research and assessment of the long-term 'performance' standard of all herbicides and throughout their 'life cycle'. Implementing such an approach will also ensure government, regulators, decision makers, researchers, policy makers and industry have the best possible information available to improve the management of chemicals, from manufacture to use.

Investigation of heavy metal pollution in eastern Aegean Sea coastal waters by using Cystoseira barbata, Patella caerulea, and Liza aurata as biological indicators	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In order to have an extensive contamination profile of heavy metal levels (Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn), seawater, sediment, Patella caerulea, Cystoseira barbata, and Liza aurata were investigated by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). Samples were collected from five coastal stations along the eastern Aegean Sea coast (Turkey) on a monthly basis from July 2002 through May 2003. According to the results of this study, heavy metal levels were arranged in the following sequence: Fe > Pb > Zn > Mn > Ni > Cu > Cd for water, Fe > Cu > Mn > Ni > Zn > Pb > Cd for sediment, Fe > Zn > Mn > Pb > Ni > Cd > Cu for C. barbata, Fe > Zn > Mn > Ni > Pb > Cu > Cd for P. caerulea, and Fe > Zn > Mn > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cd for L. aurata. Moreover, positive relationships between Fe in water and Mn in water, Fe in sediment and Mn in sediment, Fe in C. barbata and Mn in C. barbata, Fe in P. caerulea and Mn in P. caerulea, and Fe in L. aurata and Mn in L. aurata may suggest that these metals could be originated from the same anthropogenic source. C. barbata represented with higher bioconcentration factor (BCF) values, especially for Fe, Mn, and Zn values. This observation may support that C. barbata can be used as an indicator species for the determinations of Fe, Mn, and Zn levels. Regarding Turkish Food Codex Regulation's residue limits, metal values in L. aurata were found to be lower than the maximum-permissible levels issued by Turkish legislation and also the recommended limits set by FAO/WHO guidelines. The results of the investigation indicated that P. caerulea, L. aurata, and especially C. barbata are quantitative water-quality bioindicators and biomonitoring subjects for biologically available metal accumulation for Aegean Sea coastal waters.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2017	24	8					7310	7334		10.1007/s11356-016-8226-4								WOS:000399164600038	28105592

Comparative Assessment and Multivariate Optimization of Commercially Available Small Scale Reverse Osmosis Membranes	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Requirement of reverse osmosis (RO) process at places facing energy and water quality problem makes its assessment and optimization vital while considering recovery, rejection as well as specific energy consumption. In the present paper, three thin film composite (TFC) RO membranes (make: CSM, Dow and Vontron) in spiral wound (SW) configuration have been chosen to study their relative performance. Comparative study of RO membranes was conducted using experimental observations supported by membrane characterization. Optimization experiments were performed using central composite design (CCD) of response surface methodology (RSM). Four input variables viz. feed water pH, temperature, pressure and concentration were optimized and interaction between them was observed, while, recovery, rejection and specific energy consumption (SEC) were taken as response attributes. The experiments conducted employing the optimized input values validated the developed RSM model. Predictive model using multiple response optimization revealed the optimal efficiency of CSM RO membrane at 6.53 pH, 1500 mg/L concentration, 0.78 MPa pressure and 31.94 degrees C temperature producing 19.25% water recovery, 89.21% salt rejection and 17.60 kWh/m(3) SEC, respectively. Membrane surface characterization was carried out by FE-SEM, AFM, contact angle measurement and FTIR. The lesser contact angle and smoother surface apparently contributed to the better performance of CSM RO membrane. This paper may demonstrate a simple method for optimizing the commercially available small scale RO membranes.																	1726-2135	1684-8799				MAR	2017	29	1					39	52		10.3808/jei.201700357								WOS:000399355600004

The results were compared with the values stipulated by Indian Standards (IS : 10500) for drinking water quality. The water quality index of the ground water samples analyzed is found to be beyond the standard values and hence the water in the said villages under study is not recommended for human consumption.																	0019-4522					MAR	2017	94	3					311	319										WOS:000399436700009						
J	Chimner, RA; Cooper, DJ; Wurster, FC; Rochefort, L				Chimner, Rodney A.; Cooper, David J.; Wurster, Frederic C.; Rochefort, Line			An overview of peatland restoration in North America: where are we after 25 years?	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Peatland restoration in North America (NA) was initiated approximately 25years ago on peat-extracted bogs. Recent advances in peatland restoration in NA have expanded the original concepts and methodology. Restoration efforts in NA now include restoring peatlands from many diverse types of disturbances (e.g. roads, agriculture, grazing, erosion, forestry, and petrol industry infrastructure impacts) and occur in a greater array of peatland types (e.g. fens and swamps). Because fens are groundwater and surface flow driven, techniques to restore the hydrology of fens are generally more complicated than bogs. Restoring a greater variety of peatland types on a large-scale basis (> 10ha) commands new techniques for reestablishing a broader array of plants other than Sphagnum spp., including non-Sphagnum mosses, sedges, nonericaceous shrubs, and trees. The rationale for restoring peatlands has expanded to include legal requirements, wetland mitigation and banking, climate mitigation, water quality, and as part of responsible ecosystem management for industry or society. In the past 25 years, peatland restoration in NA has evolved from (1) trial and error to a more empirically based scientific approach, (2) small site-specific experiments to landscape-scale restoration (e.g. hydrological connectivity, ecological fragmentation), and (3) individual stakeholder (academic) to multiple stakeholders across jurisdictional boundaries (private, local, and regional governmental agencies, NGOs, and so on). However, many research gaps still exist that must be addressed to enhance our ability to restore peatlands successfully.

Two vegetable crops (capsicum and zucchini) were grown in summer 2010-2011 and winter 2011 respectively using four different management practices (Conventionalplastic mulch, bare inter-row conventional tillage and commercial fertilizer inputs; Improvedimproved practice with plastic mulch, inter-row vegetative mulch, zonal tillage and reduced fertilizer rates; Trash mulchimproved practice with cane-trash or forage-sorghum mulch with reduced fertilizer rates, minimum or zero tillage; and Vegetable onlyimproved practice with Rhodes grass or forage-sorghum mulch, minimum or zero tillage, reduced fertilizer rates). Results suggest improved and trash mulch systems reduced sediment and nutrient loads by at least 50% compared to conventional systems. The residual nitrate nitrogen in soil accumulated at the end-of-break crop cycle was lost by deep drainage before the subsequent sugarcane crop could utilize it. These results suggest that future research into establishing the linkages between deep drainage, groundwater quality and lateral movement into adjacent streams is needed. The improvement in runoff water quality was accompanied by yield reductions of up to 55% in capsicum and 57% in zucchini under trash mulch systems, suggesting a commercially unacceptable trade-off between water quality and productivity for a practice change. The current study has shown that variations around improved practice (modified nutrient application strategies under plastic mulch, but with an inter-space mulch to minimize runoff and sediment loss) may be the most practical solution to improve water quality and maintain productivity. However, more work is required to optimize this approach and thus reduce the size of any potential productivity and profitability gap that would necessitate an expensive policy intervention to implement.

J	Sharma, S; Chaubey, I				Sharma, Suresh; Chaubey, Indrajeet			Surface and Subsurface Transport of Nitrate Loss from the Selected Bioenergy Crop Fields: Systematic Review, Analysis and Future Directions	AGRICULTURE-BASEL												Nitrate loss from bioenergy crop fields has attracted considerable attention during the last few years because of its potential negative impact on aquatic and human health. Both controllable and uncontrollable factors for nitrate loss have been the subject of several previous studies. Due to differences in climate, biophysical dissimilarities and land management characteristics in different parts of the world the factors affecting nitrate loss are often inconsistent and hence difficult to generalize. Therefore, reanalyzing the experimental field or plot scale studies to understand the nitrate loss factors in crop fields is useful and necessary in developing management strategies for reducing nitrate loss. This research synthesized and investigated 36 peer reviewed scientific journal articles related to selected bioenergy crop fields that included: continuous corn, corn in rotation with soybean, switchgrass and Miscanthus to conduct a meta-analysis of the available research. In this study, factors such as drain tile spacing, tillage practices, type and timing of the fertilization rate, irrigation and various other factors, which are challenging to represent in regression equations, were also systematically analyzed. In addition, various other agronomic characteristics that are attributed too nitrate loss are caused by perennially planted bio energized crops such as Miscanthus and switchgrass. Results indicated that 49% of nitrate loss through surface runoff from corn fields is directly related to the annual precipitation and fertilization rate. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to estimate the annual subsurface nitrate loss for the continuous corn fields with a R-2 value of 0.65, 0.58 and 0.26 for sandy loam, silty loam and clay loam, respectively. Our analysis resulted in the conclusion that corn has a 2 to 3 times higher nitrate loss in surface runoff compared to switchgrass. Likewise, continuous corn and corn in rotation with soybean contributed more than 9 times the subsurface loss of nitrate compared to the established subsurface loss attributed to the Miscanthus and switchgrass.																	2077-0472					MAR	2017	7	3							27	10.3390/agriculture7030027								WOS:000398694500012						
J	Bajjali, W; Al-Hadidi, K; Ismail, M				Bajjali, William; Al-Hadidi, Kheir; Ismail, Ma'mmon			Water quality and geochemistry evaluation of groundwater upstream and downstream of the Khirbet Al-Samra wastewater treatment plant/Jordan	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Groundwater in the northeastern Amman-Zarqa basin is an important source of water for irrigation. The quality and quantity of water has deteriorated due to mismanagement and misunderstanding of the hydrogeological system. Overexploitation of groundwater resources upstream of the Khirbet Al-Samra wastewater treatment plant (KSWTP) has lowered the water table 43 m since the beginning of groundwater development in 1968. Heavy pumping of groundwater downstream of KSWTP has not dropped the water level due to constant recharge from the Zarqa river bed. The water level of groundwater is rising continuously at a rate of 20 cm per year since building the KSWTP in 1985. Groundwater salinity has also shifted the quality of the aquifer from fresh to brackish. Continual irrigation from the groundwater upstream of KSWTP dissolves accumulated salt from the soil formed by evaporation, and the contaminated water infiltrates back to the aquifer, thereby increasing both salt and nitrate concentrations. The intense irrigation from the reclaimed water downstream of KSWTP and leakage of treated wastewater from the Zarqa River to the shallow groundwater is a secondary source of salt and nitrates. The isotopic composition of groundwater varies over a wide range and is associated with the meteoric water line affected by Mediterranean Sea air moisture. The isotopic composition of groundwater is represented by evaporation line (EL) with a low slope of 3.6. The enrichment of groundwater in delta O-18 and delta D is attributed mainly to the two processes of evaporation before infiltration of return flow and mixing of different types of water in KSWTP originating from different aquifers. The EL starts from a location more depleted than the weighted mean value of the Amman rainfall station on the Eastern Meteoric Water Line indicating that the recharge took place under the climate regime prevailing today in Jordan and the recharge of the groundwater originates from a greater elevation than that of the Amman station. Elevated high tritium levels observed in wells in close proximity to a regional fault system signify local recharge and short residence time. The Khaldyia dam is a local source for groundwater recharge.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					53	69		10.1007/s13201-014-0263-x								WOS:000398963100004

For this study, a total of six water samples were collected from three borehole and three spring water sources. The analyses for 14 physico-chemical parameters, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids total hardness cations (Ca2+, Mg2+), anions (NO2-, NO3-, SO42- and PO43-) and heavy metals (Fe and Mn), were done in the laboratory by adopting standard procedures suggested by the American Public Health Association (APHA). Descriptive statistics were used to describe data, while Pearson correlation was used to determine the influences of the physico-chemical variables. The single factor analysis of variance (t test) was used to determine possible differences between the borehole and spring water, while means plots were used for further structure detection. From the total samples analyzed, most of the samples comply with the water quality guidelines of Ethiopian limit, WHO and U.SEPA. The pH of the water samples from borehole groundwater source was found to be slightly acidic and bove the maximum permissible limit (MPL). High concentration of Fe and Mn that exceeds the MPL set by WHO was found in the three boreholes. The spring water sources were found to be better for drinking than borehole water sources.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					155	164		10.1007/s13201-016-0502-4								WOS:000398963100011

Physico-chemical, bacteriological water quality parameters and trace metal concentration of water samples from five different treatment points from the Owabi water treatment plant were investigated. The raw water was moderately hard with high turbidity and colour that exceeds the WHO guideline limits. Nutrient concentrations were of the following order: NH3 < NO2- < -NO3- < PO43- < SO42- and were all below WHO permissible level for drinking water in all the samples at different stages of treatment. Trace metal concentrations of the reservoir were all below WHO limit except chromium (0.06 mg/L) and copper (0.24 mg/L). The bacteriological study showed that the raw water had total coliform (1,766 cfu/100 mL) and faecal coliform (257 cfu/100 mL) that exceeded the WHO standard limits, rendering it unsafe for domestic purposes without treatment. Colour showed strong positive correlation with turbidity (r = 0.730), TSS (r >= 0.922) and alkalinity (0.564) significant at p < 0.01. The quality of the treated water indicates that colour, turbidity, Cr and Cu levels reduced and fall within the WHO permissible limit for drinking water. Treatment process at the water treatment plant is adjudged to be good.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					175	186		10.1007/s13201-014-0232-4								WOS:000398963100013						
J	Guettaf, M; Maoui, A; Ihdene, Z				Guettaf, M.; Maoui, A.; Ihdene, Z.			Assessment of water quality: a case study of the Seybouse River (North East of Algeria)	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The assessment of water quality has been carried out to determine the concentrations of different ions present in the surface waters. The Seybouse River constitutes a dump of industrial and domestic rejections which contribute to the degradation of water quality. A total of 48 surface water samples were collected from different stations. The first objective of this study is the use of water quality index (WQI) to evaluate the state of the water in this river. The second aim is to calculate the parameters of the quality of water destined for irrigation such as sodium adsorption ratio, sodium percentage, and residual sodium carbonate. A high mineralization and high concentration of major chemical elements and nutrients indicate inevitably a high value of WQI index. The mean value of electrical conductivity is about 945.25 mu s/cm in the station 2 (Bouhamdane) and exceeds 1,400 mu s/cm in station 12 of Nador. The concentration of sulfates is above 250 mg/l in the stations 8 (Zimba) and 11 (Helia). A concentration of orthophosphate over 2 mg/l was observed in the station 11. The comparison of the obtained and the WHO standards indicates a before using it use in agricultural purposes.

This is driving the need for environmental compliance in industries like mining, metal processing, pulp and paper, sewage treatment, and chemical manufacturing. The sulfate removal from synthetic water by high cross-linked polystyrene divinylbenzene resin was studied at batch experiments in this study. The effect of pH, contact time, sulfates concentration, and adsorbent dose on the sulfate sequestration was investigated. The optimum conditions were studied on Saline water as a case study. The results showed that with increasing of the absorbent amount; contact time, and pH improve the efficiency of sulfate removal. The maximum sulfates uptake was obtained in pH and contact time 3.0 and 120 min, respectively. Also, with increasing initial concentration of sulfates in water, the efficiency of sulfate removal decreased. The obtained results in this study were matched with Freundlich isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetic. The maximum adsorption capacity (Qm) and constant rate were found 0.318 (mg/g) and 0.21 (mg/g.min), respectively. This study also showed that in the optimum conditions, the sulfate removal efficiency from Saline water by 0.1 mg/L sulfates was 65.64 %. Eventually, high cross-linked polystyrene divinylbenzene resin is recommended as a suitable and low cost absorbent to sulfate removal from aqueous solutions.

J	Alhamed, M				Alhamed, Mohammad			The hydrological and the hydrogeological framework of the Lottenbachtal, Bochum, Germany	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												This study was performed to investigate the hydrological and the hydrogeological framework of the Lottenbachtal, Germany. Long-term climatic data were statistically analyzed, water and soil samples were collected and analyzed, stream flow discharge was measured and separated, the hydrological balance of this catchment was calculated and a hydrological and hydrogeological conceptual model was constructed. The study area is characterized mainly by the precipitation value ranged between 0.1 and 5 mm/day. The actual evapotranspiration constitutes 31.90 % of the total precipitation, the direct surface runoff constitutes 61.04 %, the soil storage constitutes 3 % and the groundwater recharge of the Lottenbachtal constitutes only 4 % of the total precipitation. The Lottenbachtal has largely affected the diversity of the land use, which includes forests, arable areas, abandoned coal mines and settlement areas. The soil of the forested area is represented by relatively high acidic conditions and relatively high sulfate concentrations, while the soil of the arable areas is represented by near-neutral conditions associated with relatively high concentrations of nutrients and other chemical elements (calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, sulfate, nitrate). The settlement areas are characterized by huge blocks of concrete and backfills, which are rich in calcium and magnesium carbonates. The effects of this diversity in the land use on groundwater and surface water quality resulting by leaching the chemical elements from the soil covers and the other materials. These effects are represented by the following complex water types of Ca-Na-Mg-Cl-SO4-HCO3, Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4, Ca-Na-Mg-Cl-SO4, Ca-Na-Mg-Cl-SO4 and Ca-HCO3, which represent the diversity of the flow paths of the water as well as to mixing processes. The diversity of the land use also affected the physical hydrological-hydrogeological characteristics of the study area by increasing the direct surface runoff and decreasing the groundwater recharge. The impervious surfaces of the settlement areas and the low hydraulic conductivities of the soil covers are responsible for these conditions.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					315	328		10.1007/s13201-014-0247-x								WOS:000398963100025

Spatio-temporal variability of hydro-chemical characteristics of coastal waters of Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve (GoMMBR), South India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The intention of this study was to appraise the spatial and temporal variations in the physico-chemical parameters of coastal waters of Rameswaram Island, Gulf of Mannar Marine Biosphere Reserve, south India, using multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, factor analysis and principal component analysis. Spatio-temporal variations among the physico-chemical parameters are observed in the coastal waters of Gulf of Mannar, especially during northeast and post monsoon seasons. It is inferred that the high loadings of pH, temperature, suspended particulate matter, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, nutrient species of nitrogen and phosphorus strongly determine the discrimination of coastal water quality. Results highlight the important role of monsoonal variations to determine the coastal water quality around Rameswaram Island.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					361	373		10.1007/s13201-014-0251-1								WOS:000398963100029

It accounts for 80 % of the total Tunisian surface water. In this paper, hydrographical methods and PHREEQC geochemical program were used to characterize water quality of Medjerda River, whereas its suitability for irrigation was determined in accordance with its electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and sodium concentrations. It was established that the water samples were undersaturated with calcite, dolomite, aragonite, anhydrite, gypsum and halite except in one water sample which is supersaturated with carbonate minerals. The quality assessment of Medjerda River for irrigation purposes showed that some points belonged to the excellent-to-good and good-to-permissible irrigation water categories, while the remaining ones were classified as doubtful to unsuitable for irrigation making the river water use limited to plants with high salt tolerance. Moreover, based on FAO guidelines, almost all water samples may cause immediate salinity to gradual increasing problem but no soil infiltration problems except for two sampling points. However, immediate development or possible increasing of severe toxicity problems may be caused by the continuous use of this water for irrigation due to troublesome concentrations of chloride and sodium.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAR	2017	7	1					469	480		10.1007/s13201-015-0265-3								WOS:000398963100040

J	Bryant, M; Allan, P; Kebbell, S				Bryant, Martin; Allan, Penny; Kebbell, Sam			A Settlers' Guide: Designing for Resilience in the Hinterlands	BUILDINGS												There has often been a mutually beneficial relationship between cities and their rural hinterlands. The Kapiti region outside the city of Wellington in New Zealand is a prime example: it once provided Wellington's food, water and cultural diversity for both Mori and European settlers. However, productivity-driven agriculture and extensive dormitory-suburbanization have affected significant parts of this once-abundant hinterland. Food production is becoming more mono-cultural, water quality is degrading, ecosystems' biodiversity is disappearing, provincial town centres are shrinking, emigrating youth are leaving unbalanced demographics, Mori are increasingly disassociating their culture from their traditional lands and natural disasters are causing more impactall of which is making Kapiti less resilient, and severing the once-healthy city-hinterland relationship. Our work on future settlement opportunities in Kapiti proposes alternatives, using experimental design-led research methods to develop speculative architectural and landscape architectural schemes. The schemes are framed by some of the spatial attributes of resilience: diversity, complexity, redundancy, interconnectivity and adaptability. Collectively, the work reveals design strategies that have a potential to rebuild hinterlands' culture, town centres, housing, agriculture, community and ecosystems and to recalibrate the broader relationship between hinterlands and metropolitan systems.																	2075-5309					MAR	2017	7	1							23	10.3390/buildings7010023								WOS:000398691800022

This paper investigated the uncertainty originating from hydrological model calibration and structure in low-flow simulations under climate change conditions. Two hydrological models of contrasting complexity, GR4J and SWAT, were applied to four sub-watersheds of the Yamaska River, Canada. The two models were calibrated using seven different objective functions including the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSEQ) and six other objective functions more related to low flows. The uncertainty in the model parameters was evaluated using a PARAmeter SOLutions procedure (PARASOL). Twelve climate projections from different combinations of General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Regional Circulation Models (RCMs) were used to simulate low-flow indices in a reference (1970-2000) and future (2040-2070) horizon. Results indicate that the NSEQ objective function does not properly represent low-flow indices for either model. The NSE objective function applied to the log of the flows shows the lowest total variance for all sub-watersheds. In addition, these hydrological models should be used with care for low-flow studies, since they both show some inconsistent results. The uncertainty is higher for SWAT than for GR4J. With GR4J, the uncertainties in the simulations for the 7Q2 index (the 7-day low-flow value with a 2-year return period) are lower for the future period than for the reference period. This can be explained by the analysis of hydrological processes. In the future horizon, a significant worsening of low-flow conditions was projected.																	2225-1154					MAR	2017	5	1							19	10.3390/cli5010019								WOS:000398698500018

Learning in and about rural places: Connections and tensions between students' everyday experiences and environmental quality issues in their community	CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION												Guided by sociocultural perspectives on the importance of place as a resource for learning, we investigated 14- and 15-year old students' understandings of their community and water quality during a school-based watershed unit. Methods included a theory-driven thematic analysis of field notes and video transcripts from four biology classrooms, a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 67 pairs of matched pre- and post-intervention mindmaps, and a content analysis of 73 student reflections. As they learned about water quality, learners recognized the relevance of the watershed's health to the health of their community. Students acknowledged the impacts of local economically driven activities (e.g., natural gas wells, application of agrichemicals) and leisure activities (e.g., boating, fishing) on the watershed's environmental health. As students learned in and about their watershed, they experienced both connections and tensions between their everyday experiences and the environmental problems in their community. The students suggested individual sustainability actions needed to address water quality issues; however, the students struggled to understand how to act collectively. Implications of rural experiences as assets to future environmental sciences learning are discussed as well as the implications of educational experiences that do not include an advocacy component when students uncover environmental health issues. We suggest further consideration is needed on how to help young people develop action-oriented science knowledge, not just inert knowledge of environmental problems, during place-based education units.																	1871-1502	1871-1510				MAR	2017	12	1			SI		7	31		10.1007/s11422-016-9757-1								WOS:000398857600002						
J	Li, SM; Wang, XL; Qiao, B; Li, JS; Tu, JM				Li, Songmin; Wang, Xiaoling; Qiao, Bin; Li, Jiansheng; Tu, Jiamin			First flush characteristics of rainfall runoff from a paddy field in the Taihu Lake watershed, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Nonpoint storm runoff remains a major threat to surface water quality in China. As a paddy matures, numerous fertilizers are needed, especially in the rainy seasons; the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in rainfall runoff from farmland is much higher than at other times, and this poses a great threat to water bodies and is the main reason for water eutrophication, especially in high concentration drainages. To date, most studies regarding the characteristics of pollutants in rainfall runoff have mainly been concentrated on urban runoff and watershed runoff; therefore, it is particularly important to investigate the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in rainfall runoff from paddy fields. To study the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss and whether the first flush effect exists, continuous monitoring of the rainfall runoff process of six rainfall events was conducted in 2013, of which four rainfall events during storm, high, middle, and low intensity rainfalls were analyzed, and runoff and quality parameters, such as suspended solids (SS), total nitrogen (TN), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3 (-)-N), total phosphorus (TP), and phosphate (PO43--P), were analyzed to determine the relationship between runoff and water quality. The paddy field is located north of Wuxi Lake Basin along the Hejia River upstream in Zhoutie town, Yixing city. An analysis of the load distribution during rainfall runoff was conducted. Event mean concentration (EMC) was used to evaluate the pollution situation of the paddy field's rainfall runoff. A curve of the dimensionless normalized cumulative load (L) vs. normalized cumulative flow (F) (L-F curve), the probability of the mass first flush (MFFn), and the pollutants carried by the initial 25% of runoff (FF25) were used to analyze the first flush effect of the paddy field runoff, and different contaminants show different results: the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus fluctuate and follow a similar trend as runoff changes, NO3 (-)-N concentration is lower in the early part of runoff and higher in the later, and TP mainly occurs in the particle state in storm runoff and mainly in the dissolved state when the rainfall intensity is smaller. Nitrogen and phosphorus losses from paddy fields are closely related to the average rainfall intensity and the max rainfall intensity, and the runoff loss of nitrogen and phosphorus is more severe when the rainfall intensity is large. Based on an analysis of multiple methodologies, TN and NH4+-N show a certain degree of a first flush effect, whereas the first flush effect of TP is not obvious. The first flush effect of SS is obvious in larger intensity rainfall and shows a slight secondary flush effect in smaller rainfall events.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAR	2017	24	9					8336	8351		10.1007/s11356-017-8470-2								WOS:000399162900043	28168564

This study characterized physicochemical properties of the EOM and IOM solution extracted from different growth phases of Microcystis aeruginosa and investigated the corresponding formation potential of DBPs during chlor(am)ination process. Besides, the effects of initial concentration of xEOM, IOM, and Br- on the yields of disinfection by-product formation potential were studied. The results indicated that the specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) values of IOM and EOM (1.09 and 2.66 L/mg m) were considerably lower than that of natural organic matter (NOM) (4.79 L/mg m). Fluorescence dates showed the soluble microbial by-product was dominant in both EOM and IOM, and the tryptophan was the main component of AOM. From the excitation-emission matrix figure of EOM and IOM, we found that the content of the high molecular weight protein substance in IOM was higher than EOM. During chlorination of EOM and IOM, the yields of four kinds of DBPs followed the order trichloroethene (TCM) > 1,1-DCP > dichloride acetonitrile (DCAN) > trichloronitromethane (TCNM), while the order was TCM > DCAN > TCNM > 1,1-DCP during chloramination process. The bromine substitution factor (BSF) value increased with the increasing of the concentration of Br-. When the concentration of Br- was 500 mu g/L, the BSF values of chlorination EOM and IOM were 51.1 and 68.4%, respectively.

The aims of this study were to clarify the N wet deposition first flush effect and estimate the contribution of N wet deposition on both N export and water quality in a subtropical watershed. Results showed that total nitrogen (TN) flux was 41.72 kg N hm(-2) year(-1) and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) was 23.18 kg N hm(-2) year(-1), respectively. Light rain events lead to the highest DTN and dissolve inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations of wet deposition. Rainstorm concentrations were lowest during spring rainfall-runoff events. In contrast to the baseflow, the different N forms were higher than they were under the rainfall-runoff. Rainfall event contributions on N export were greater than 93.2% in the watershed for the whole year. Finally, TN concentrations were higher than river eutrophication thresholds for the entire watershed.

High prevalence of Legionella in non-passenger merchant vessels	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION												There is a paucity of information on the risk from potable water in non-passenger merchant vessels (NPMVs) particularly with regard to Legionella and other bacteria. This retrospective study examined water samples from 550 NPMVs docked in eight UK ports. A total of 1027 samples from 412 NPMVs were examined for total aerobic colony counts (ACC), coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci; 41% of samples yielded ACC above the action level (> 1 x 10(3) c.f.u./ml) and 4.5% contained actionable levels (> 1 c.f.u./100 ml) of faecal indicator bacteria. Eight hundred and three samples from 360 NPMVs were cultured specifically for Legionella and 58% of vessels proved positive for these organisms with 27% of samples showing levels greater than the UK upper action limit of 1 x 10(3) c.f.u./l. Cabin showers (49%) and hospital shower (45%) were frequently positive. A subset of 106 samples was analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for Legionella and identified a further 11 Legionella-positive NPMVs, returning a negative predictive value of 100%. There was no correlation between NPMV age or size and any microbial parameters (P > 0.05). Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated from 46% of NPMVs and sequence-based typing of 17 isolates revealed four sequence types (STs) previously associated with human disease. These data raise significant concerns regarding the management of microbial and Legionella risks on board NPMVs and suggest that better guidance and compliance are required to improve control.

A place-based approach to payments for ecosystem services	GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS												Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are proliferating but are challenged by insufficient attention to spatial and temporal inter-dependencies, interactions between different ecosystems and their services, and the need for multi-level governance. To address these challenges, this paper develops a place-based approach to the development and implementation of PES schemes that incorporates multilevel governance, bundling or layering of services across multiple scales, and shared values for ecosystem services. The approach is evaluated and illustrated using case study research to develop an explicitly place-based PES scheme, the Peatland Code, owned and managed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's UK Peatland Programme and designed to pay for restoration of peatland habitats. Buyers preferred bundled schemes with premium pricing of a primary service, contrasting with sellers' preferences for quantifying and marketing services separately in a layered scheme. There was limited awareness among key business sectors of dependencies on ecosystem services, or the risks and opportunities arising from their management. Companies with financial links to peatlands or a strong environmental sustainability focus were interested in the scheme, particularly in relation to climate regulation, water quality, biodiversity and flood risk mitigation benefits. Visitors were most interested in donating to projects that benefited wildlife and were willing to donate around (sic)2 on-site during a visit. Sellers agreed a deliberated fair price per tonne of CO2 equivalent from (sic)11.18 to (sic)15.65 across four sites in Scotland, with this range primarily driven by spatial variation in habitat degradation. In the Peak District, perceived declines in sheep and grouse productivity arising from ditch blocking led to substantially higher prices, but in other regions ditch blocking was viewed more positively. The Peatland Code was developed in close collaboration with stakeholders at catchment, landscape and national scales, enabling multi-level governance of the management and delivery of ecosystem services across these scales. Place based PES schemes can mitigate negative trade-offs between ecosystem services, more effectively include cultural ecosystem services and engage with and empower diverse stakeholders in scheme design and governance.

A Community Multi-Omics Approach towards the Assessment of Surface Water Quality in an Urban River System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												A multi-omics approach was applied to an urban river system (the Brisbane River (BR), Queensland, Australia) in order to investigate surface water quality and characterize the bacterial population with respect to water contaminants. To do this, bacterial metagenomic amplicon-sequencing using Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the V5-V6 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene and untargeted community metabolomics using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were utilized. The multi-omics data, in combination with fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) counts, trace metal concentrations (by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)) and in-situ water quality measurements collected from various locations along the BR were then used to assess the health of the river ecosystem. Sites sampled represented the transition from less affected (upstream) to polluted (downstream) environments along the BR. Chemometric analysis of the combined datasets indicated a clear separation between the sampled environments. Burkholderiales and Cyanobacteria were common key factors for differentiation of pristine waters. Increased sugar alcohol and short-chain fatty acid production was observed by Actinomycetales and Rhodospirillaceae that are known to form biofilms in urban polluted and brackish waters. Results from this study indicate that a multi-omics approach enables a deep understanding of the health of an aquatic ecosystem, providing insight into the bacterial diversity present and the metabolic output of the population when exposed to environmental contaminants.

However, the size and complexity of upstream basins makes the planning and implementation of watershed-scale pollution management a challenge. In this study, we established an evaluation system based on 17 factors, representing the potential point and non-point source pollutants and the environmental carrying capacity which are likely to affect the water quality in the Dahuofang Reservoir and watershed in northeastern China. We used entropy methods to rank 118 subwatersheds by their potential pollution threat and clustered subwatersheds according to the potential pollution type. Combining ranking and clustering analyses allowed us to suggest specific areas for prioritized watershed management (in particular, two subwatersheds with the greatest pollution potential) and to recommend the conservation of current practices in other less vulnerable locations (91 small watersheds with low pollution potential). Finally, we identified the factors most likely to influence the water quality of each of the 118 subwatersheds and suggested adaptive control measures for each location. These results provide a scientific basis for improving the watershed management and sustainability of the Dahuofang reservoir and a framework for identifying threats and prioritizing the management of watersheds of large reservoirs around the world.

The objective of this study is to establish a quantitative model for estimating the Chl-a and the TSS concentrations in irrigation ponds in Higashihiroshima, Japan, using field hyperspectral measurements and statistical analysis. Field experiments were conducted in six ponds and spectral readings for Chl-a and TSS were obtained from six field observations in 2014. For statistical approaches, we used two spectral indices, the ratio spectral index (RSI) and the normalized difference spectral index (NDSI), and a partial least squares (PLS) regression. The predictive abilities were compared using the coefficient of determination (R-2), the root mean squared error of cross validation (RMSECV) and the residual predictive deviation (RPD). Overall, iterative stepwise elimination based on PLS (ISE-PLS), using the first derivative reflectance (FDR), showed the best predictive accuracy, for both Chl-a (R-2 = 0.98, RMSECV = 6.15, RPD = 7.44) and TSS (R-2 = 0.97, RMSECV = 1.91, RPD = 6.64). The important wavebands for estimating Chl-a (16.97% of all wavebands) and TSS (8.38% of all wavebands) were selected by ISE-PLS from all 501 wavebands over the 400-900 nm range. These findings suggest that ISE-PLS based on field hyperspectral measurements can be used to estimate water Chl-a and TSS concentrations in irrigation ponds.

Identifying the types of pollutants is necessary after detecting the presence of pollutants to provide warning information about pollutant characteristics and emergency solutions. Thus, a real-time contaminant classification methodology, which uses the multi-classification support vector machine (SVM), is proposed in this study to obtain the probability for contaminants belonging to a category. The SVM-based model selected samples with indistinct feature, which were mostly low-concentration samples as the support vectors, thereby reducing the influence of the concentration of contaminants in the building process of a pattern library. The new sample points were classified into corresponding regions after constructing the classification boundaries with the support vector. Experimental results show that the multi-classification SVM-based approach is less affected by the concentration of contaminants when establishing a pattern library compared with the cosine distance classification method. Moreover, the proposed approach avoids making a single decision when classification features are unclear in the initial phase of injecting contaminants.																	1424-8220					MAR	2017	17	3							581	10.3390/s17030581								WOS:000398818700154	28335400

An Alternative Method of Spatial Autocorrelation for Chlorophyll Detection in Water Bodies Using Remote Sensing	SUSTAINABILITY												Additional measures of in situ water quality monitoring in natural environments can be obtained through remote sensing because certain elements in water modify its spectral behavior. One of the indicators of water quality is the presence of algae, and the aim of this study was to propose an alternative method for the quantification of chlorophyll in water by correlating spectral data, infrared images, and limnology data. The object of study was an artificial lake located at Unisinos University, SAo Leopoldo/RS, Brazil. The area has been mapped with a modified NGB (near infrared (N), green (G) and blue (B)) camera coupled to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). From the orthorectified and georeferenced images, a modified normalized difference vegetation index (NDVImod) image has been generated. Additionally, 20 sampling points have been established on the lake. At these points, in situ spectral analysis with a spectroradiometer has been performed, and water samples have been collected for laboratory determination of chlorophyll concentrations. The correlation resulted in two models. The first model, based on the multivariate analysis of spectral data, and the second model, based on polynomial equations from NDVI, had coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.86 and 0.51, respectively. This study confirmed the applicability of remote sensing for water resource management using UAVs, which can be characterized as a quick and easy methodology.

Blast furnace slag (BFS; fine aggregates (agg.)), coarse aggregates, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber (hydrophilic fiber), and red clay (ecofriendly additive material) were applied to the construction of the porous vegetation red clay green roof blocks. A decrease in cement use is one way of reducing carbon emissions. To increase the water retentivity and the efficiency of roof vegetation blocks, blast furnace slag aggregates with excellent water absorptivity and polyvinyl alcohol fiber with a water absorption rate above 20% were added. In particular, the addition of polyvinyl alcohol fiber prevents performance reduction of the green roof vegetation blocks during freezing and melting in winter. Compressive strength, void ratio, and unit-mass tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the roof vegetation blocks. After their application to roof vegetation, the effect of water purification was evaluated. According to the experimental results, the mix that satisfies the target performance of green roof vegetation blocks (compression strength above 8 MPa, void ratio above 20%, unit mass 2.0 kg/cm(3) or below) is: cement = 128.95 kg/m(3), BFS = 96.75 kg/m(3), red clay = 96.75 kg/m(3), water = 81.50 kg/m(3), BFS agg. = 1450 kg/m(3), PVA fiber = 1.26 kg/m(3). The green roof vegetation blocks were designed using the mix that satisfied the target performance. To find the amount of attainable water due to rainfall, a rainfall meter was installed after application of the roof vegetation to measure daily rainfall and calculate the amount of attainable water. The results show that, for 1 mm of rainfall, it is possible to attain about 0.53 L of water per 1 m(2). In addition, the water quality of effluents after application of roof vegetation was analyzed, and the results satisfied Class 4 of the River-life Environmental Standard for Availability of Agricultural Water.																	2071-1050					MAR	2017	9	3							357	10.3390/su9030357								WOS:000398714100034

This paper presents the LUCC in Portugal at the regional level (NUTS II) from 1995 to 2010 and discusses the main driving forces and implications associated with these LUCC. The main objectives of this work are: (a) to quantify the land use and land cover (LUC) types (level I of LUC cartography) by NUT II in Portugal for the years 1995, 2007 and 2010; (b) to assess the spatio-temporal LUCC; and (c) to identify and discuss the main driving forces of LUCC and corresponding implications based on correlations and Principal Components Analysis. The results revealed large regional and temporal LUCC and further highlighted the different and sometimes opposite time trends between neighboring regions. By associating driving forces to LUCC, different influences at the regional level were observed, namely LUCC into agriculture land derived from the construction of dams (Alentejo region), or the conversion of coniferous forest into eucalypt forest (Centre region) associated with increased gross value added (GVA) and employment in industry and forestry. Temporal differentiation was also observed, particularly in the settlements that expanded between 1995 and 2007 due to the construction of large infrastructures (e.g., highways, industrial complexes, or buildings), which is reflected on employment in industry and construction and respective GVA. However, certain LUCC have implications, particularly in energy consumption, for which different behavior between regions can be highlighted in this analysis, but also on land-use sustainability.

J	Sikorska, D; Sikorski, P; Hopkins, RJ				Sikorska, Daria; Sikorski, Piotr; Hopkins, Richard James			High Biodiversity of Green Infrastructure Does Not Contribute to Recreational Ecosystem Services	SUSTAINABILITY												Urban lakes, especially those of natural origin, provide ecosystem services, recreation being one of the most important and highly valued by city dwellers. Fulfilling the needs of city residents to relax and have contact with nature has become a priority in urbanized areas and has been proven to positively affect people's health and well-being. The recreational potential of water bodies was identified to be the most important aspect of ecosystem services to the residents of the neighboring areas. An assessment of recreational ecosystem services (RES) provisioning to society based on the real time spent by the citizens and housing values in the urban-rural gradient revealed that the economic benefits of lakes differ in urbanized, suburban and rural landscapes. The growth of cities has led to an increased population density in the surroundings of ecologically valuable areas, resulting in higher pressure from visitors seeking recreational areas. Along with urbanization, the impoverishment of ecosystem functions takes place, limiting their capability to provide ecosystem services. In this work, the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services of 28 floodplain lakes located along the urban-rural gradient of the Warsaw agglomeration was assessed. The relationship between the ecological value of the water bodies, measured using naturalness indices, and the recreational ecosystem services they can provide was assessed. The results showed that the floodplain lakes located along the urban-rural gradient are of great importance to the citizens due to their recreational potential. The provisioning of recreational ecosystem services is poorly connected with the ecological characteristics of the floodplain lakes. Only hemeroby was significantly correlated with provisioning, and there was no relationship with factors such as naturalness of vegetation or water quality, demonstrating that public preference was not generally influenced by high ecological quality. These data should be available to potential buyers and be integrated in spatial planning management plans in order to shape future housing policy.

The experiment was carried out with two of fish: cultivated in conventional system - the carp was fed with 4.5 kg wheat per kg of fish growth and cultivated in organic system - the carp was fed with natural food from the ponds. In comparison to the conventional systems, the meat obtained from organic cultivated carp (Cyprinus carpio L.), was with 0.2 - 0.4 more alkaline pH; 1.5 - 2.0% higher water holding capacity; 0.7 - 1.3% higher total lipid content; 2.4 - 4.1% higher PUFAs concentration; 0.13 - 0.14 % higher lypolitical activity; 10.8 - 23.3% higher color redness (a*); 1.1 - 6.7% lower brightness of the color (L*) and 52.7 - 72.7% lower color yellowness (b*). The organic cultivated fresh and grill carp meat were assessed with 19 to 34% higher overall sensory scores resp. fish. The cultivation of carp in conventional system can be successfully replaced by organic cultivation.																	1303-2712					MAR	2017	17	2					395	403		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_2_19								WOS:000398698700019

Assessing the Impact of Recycled Water Quality and Clogging on Infiltration Rates at A Pioneering Soil Aquifer Treatment (SAT) Site in Alice Springs, Northern Territory (NT), Australia	WATER												Infiltration techniques for managed aquifer recharge (MAR), such as soil aquifer treatment (SAT) can facilitate low-cost water recycling and supplement groundwater resources. However there are still challenges in sustaining adequate infiltration rates in the presence of lower permeability sediments, especially when wastewater containing suspended solids and nutrients is used to recharge the aquifer. To gain a better insight into reductions in infiltration rates during MAR, a field investigation was carried out via soil aquifer treatment (SAT) using recharge basins located within a mixture of fine and coarse grained riverine deposits in Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia. A total of 2.6 Mm(3) was delivered via five SAT basins over six years; this evaluation focused on three years of operation (2011-2014), recharging 1.5 Mm(3) treated wastewater via an expanded recharge area of approximately 38,400 m(2). Average infiltration rates per basin varied from 0.1 to 1 m/day due to heterogeneous soil characteristics and variability in recharge water quality. A treatment upgrade to include sand filtration and UV disinfection (in 2013) prior to recharge improved the average infiltration rate per basin by 40% to 100%.

Relating Watershed Characteristics to Elevated Stream Escherichia coli Levels in Agriculturally Dominated Landscapes: An Iowa Case Study	WATER												Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) are a leading cause of surface water impairments in the United States. However, the relative impacts of different watershed characteristics on microbial water quality in agriculturally dominated watersheds are unclear. Spatial and statistical analyses were utilized to examine relationships between watershed characteristics and FIB and a multiple regression model was created. Geometric mean E. coli concentration data were obtained for 395 ambient water quality monitoring locations in Iowa. Watersheds were delineated for thirty randomly selected monitoring locations and drainage areas ranged from 93 to 1.1 million hectares. Watershed characteristics examined include area, presence of animal units (open feed lots and confinements), percent of watershed area receiving manure application, presence of point-source discharges, and land cover. The results from the analyses reveal that the presence of animal feeding operations and agriculture, wetland, and woody vegetation land covers are the most influential watershed characteristics regarding E. coli concentration. A significant positive correlation was identified between E. coli concentration and agriculture while significant negative correlations were identified with animal feeding operations and wetland and woody vegetation. Establishing relationships between watershed characteristics and presence of E. coli is needed to identify dominant watershed characteristics contributing to pathogen water impairments and to prioritize remediation efforts.

However, this hypothesis must be validated in various contexts as interactions between multiple land use and land cover (LULC) types, ecological variables and water quality variables render this relationship highly complex. This paper applies a straightforward multivariate approach on a typical large monitoring dataset of a highly managed and densely populated area (Wallonia, Belgium; 10-year dataset), quantifying forest cover effects on nine physico-chemical water quality variables. Results show that forest cover explains about one third of the variability of water quality and is positively correlated with higher quality water. When controlling for spatial autocorrelation, forest cover still explains 9% of water quality. Unlike needle-leaved forest cover, broad-leaved forest cover presents an independent effect from ecological variables and explains independently 4.8% of water quality variability while it shares 5.8% with cropland cover. This study demonstrates clear independent effects of forest cover on water quality, and presents a method to tease out independent LULC effects from typical large multivariate monitoring datasets. Further research on explanatory variables, spatial distribution effects and water quality datasets could lead to effective strategies to mitigate pollution and reach legal targets.

J	Hosseini, N; Johnston, J; Lindenschmidt, KE				Hosseini, Nasim; Johnston, Jacinda; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Impacts of Climate Change on the Water Quality of a Regulated Prairie River	WATER												Flows along the upper Qu'Appelle River are expected to increase in the future via increased discharge from Lake Diefenbaker to meet the demands of increased agricultural and industrial activity and population growth in southern Saskatchewan. This increased discharge and increased air temperature due to climate change are both expected to have an impact on the water quality of the river. The Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP7) was used to model current and future water quality of the upper Qu'Appelle River. The model was calibrated and validated to characterize the current state of the water quality of the river. The model was then used to predict water quality [nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations and oxygen dynamics] for the years 2050-2055 and 2080-2085. The modelling results indicate that global warming will result in a decrease in ice thickness, a shorter ice cover period, and decreased nutrient concentrations in 2050 or 2080 relative to 2010, with a greater decrease of nutrient concentrations in open water. In contrast to the effect of warmer water temperatures, increased flow through water management may cause increases in ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen concentrations and decreases in orthophosphate concentrations in summer.

A Methodology to Model Environmental Preferences of EPT Taxa in the Machangara River Basin (Ecuador)	WATER												Rivers have been frequently assessed based on the presence of the EphemeropteraPlecopteraTrichoptera (EPT) taxa in order to determine the water quality status and develop conservation programs. This research evaluates the abiotic preferences of three families of the EPT taxa Baetidae, Leptoceridae and Perlidae in the Machangara River Basin located in the southern Andes of Ecuador. With this objective, using generalized linear models (GLMs), we analyzed the relation between the probability of occurrence of these pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrates families and physicochemical water quality conditions. The explanatory variables of the constructed GLMs differed substantially among the taxa, as did the preference range of the common predictors. In total, eight variables had a substantial influence on the outcomes of the three models. For choosing the best predictors of each studied taxa and for evaluation of the accuracy of its models, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used. The results indicated that the GLMs can be applied to predict either the presence or the absence of the invertebrate taxa and moreover, to clarify the relation to the environmental conditions of the stream. In this manner, these modeling tools can help to determine key variables for river restoration and protection management.

The objective of this paper is to assess the effect of projected climate change on water quantity and quality in two lowland catchments (the Upper Narew and the Barycz) in Poland in two future periods (near future: 2021-2050, and far future: 2071-2100). The hydrological model SWAT was driven by climate forcing data from an ensemble of nine bias-corrected General Circulation ModelsRegional Climate Models (GCM-RCM) runs based on the Coordinated Downscaling ExperimentEuropean Domain (EURO-CORDEX). Hydrological response to climate warming and wetter conditions (particularly in winter and spring) in both catchments includes: lower snowmelt, increased percolation and baseflow and higher runoff. Seasonal differences in the response between catchments can be explained by their properties (e.g., different thermal conditions and soil permeability). Projections suggest only moderate increases in sediment loss, occurring mainly in summer and winter. A sharper increase is projected in both catchments for TN losses, especially in the Barycz catchment characterized by a more intensive agriculture. The signal of change in annual TP losses is blurred by climate model uncertainty in the Barycz catchment, whereas a weak and uncertain increase is projected in the Upper Narew catchment.																	2073-4441					MAR	2017	9	3							UNSP 156	10.3390/w9030156								WOS:000398721300007

Pilot Scale Testing of Adsorbent Amended Filters under High Hydraulic Loads for Highway Runoff in Cold Climates	WATER												This paper presents an estimation of the service life of three filters composed of sand and three alternative adsorbents for stormwater treatment according to Norwegian water quality standards for receiving surface waters. The study conducted pilot scale column tests on three adsorbent amended filters for treatment of highway runoff in cold climates under high hydraulic loads. The objectives were to evaluate the effect of high hydraulic loads and the application of deicing salts on the performance of these filters. From previous theoretical and laboratory analysis granulated activated charcoal, pine bark, and granulated olivine were chosen as alternative adsorbent materials for the present test. Adsorption performance of the filters was evaluated vis-a-vis four commonly found hazardous metals (Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn) in stormwater. The results showed that the filters were able to pass water at high inflow rates while achieving high removal. Among the filters, the filters amended with olivine or pine bark provided the best performance both in short and long-term tests. The addition of NaCl (1 g/L) did not show any adverse impact on the desorption of already adsorbed metals, except for Ni removal by the charcoal amended filter, which was negatively impacted by the salt addition. The service life of the filters was found to be limited by zinc and copper, due to high concentrations observed in local urban runoff, combined with moderate affinity with the adsorbents. It was concluded that both the olivine and the pine bark amended filter should be tested in full-scale conditions.																	2073-4441					MAR	2017	9	3							230	10.3390/w9030230								WOS:000398721300080

This study presents a generalised framework for assessing and mitigating the impacts of intense rainfall on sanitary sewer networks. The first part of the proposed framework involves a detailed hydraulic modelling to evaluate the performance of the sewer network. The second part deals with the development of SSO mitigation strategies based on Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) approaches. This paper also demonstrates the application of the first part of the proposed framework for a case study catchment in Melbourne, Australia. The hydraulic performance of the case study sewer network during a wet and a dry year is presented. The analysis found that for the wet year, 11 manholes had sewer overflows, whereas 53 of 57 manholes in the network of 3.2 km had surcharges. Such a study will benefit the water authorities to develop mitigation strategies for controlling SSOs in their sewer systems.

This study presents a unique pilot site at Horni Bekovice in Central Bohemia, where wastewater parameters are significantly influenced by the effluent from a local psychiatric hospital, and where the treated wastewater infiltrates into a shallow aquifer over a long period. The survey compared the quality parameters of local wastewater with those of the wastewater in four other catchments with no sources of concentrated pharmaceutical contamination. A total of 10 pharmaceuticals were detected while monitoring a common sewage system, but their number increased 3-fold at Horni Bekovice. The water quality data revealed the effectiveness of the removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater at the local sewage treatment plant and tracked the fate of substances that move from the treatment plant into the recharge ponds and then gradually into groundwater. The findings showed a significant decrease in all the monitored micropollutants that remained bound in sediments and in the unsaturated zone. Their passage into groundwater was highly reduced, and they virtually disappear after a few hundred meters in the saturated zone. The only exception is carbamazepine. This substance passes through the treatment technology and unsaturated zone. It systematically appears in the groundwater samples collected about 1 km from the infiltration site.

J	Shen, Y; Cao, HM; Tang, MF; Deng, HB				Shen, Yuan; Cao, Huiming; Tang, Mingfang; Deng, Hongbing			The Human Threat to River Ecosystems at the Watershed Scale: An Ecological Security Assessment of the Songhua River Basin, Northeast China	WATER												Human disturbances impact river basins by reducing the quality of, and services provided by, aquatic ecosystems. Conducting quantitative assessments of ecological security at the watershed scale is important for enhancing the water quality of river basins and promoting environmental management. In this study, China's Songhua River Basin was divided into 204 assessment units by combining watershed and administrative boundaries. Ten human threat factors were identified based on their significant influence on the river ecosystem. A modified ecological threat index was used to synthetically evaluate the ecological security, where frequency was weighted by flow length from the grids to the main rivers, while severity was weighted by the potential hazard of the factors on variables of river ecosystem integrity. The results showed that individual factors related to urbanization, agricultural development and facility construction presented different spatial distribution characteristics. At the center of the plain area, the provincial capital cities posed the highest level of threat, as did the municipal districts of prefecture-level cities. The spatial relationships between hot spot locations of the ecological threat index and water quality, as well as the distribution areas of critically endangered species, were analyzed. The sensitivity analysis illustrated that alteration of agricultural development largely changed the ecological security level of the basin. By offering a reference for assessing ecological security, this study can enhance water environmental planning and management.																	2073-4441					MAR	2017	9	3								10.3390/w9030219								WOS:000398721300069

Observations and Prediction of Recovered Quality of Desalinated Seawater in the Strategic ASR Project in Liwa, Abu Dhabi	WATER												To be able to overcome water shortages, Abu Dhabi Emirate started an Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) project with desalinated seawater (DSW) as source water near Liwa. It is the largest DSW-ASR project in the world (stored volume similar to 10 Mm(3)/year), and should recover potable water for direct use. DSW is infiltrated into a desert dune sand aquifer using sand-covered gravel-bed recharge basins. In this study, we evaluate the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical stratification of the (sub)oxic target aquifer, and water quality changes of DSW during trial infiltration runs. We predict water quality changes of DSW after 824 d of infiltration, during 90 d of intensive recovery (67% recovered) without storage (scenario A), as well as after 10 years of storage (scenario B, with significant bubble drift). Monitoring of preceding trials revealed a lack of redox reactions; little carbonate dissolution and Ca/Na exchange; much SiO2 dissolution; a strong mobilization of natural AsO43-, B, Ba, F, CrO42-, Mo, Sr and V from the (sub)oxic aquifer; and immobilization of PO4, Al, Cu, Fe and Ni from DSW. The Easy-Leacher model was applied in forward and reverse mode including lateral bubble drift, to predict water quality of the recovered water. We show that hydrogeochemical modeling of a complex ASR-system can be relatively easy and straightforward, if aquifer reactivity is low and redox reactions can be ignored. The pilot observations and modeling results demonstrate that in scenario A recovered water quality still complies with Abu Dhabi's drinking water standards (even up to 85% recovery). For scenario B, however, the recovery efficiency declines to 60% after which various drinking water standards are exceeded, especially the one for chromium.

Simulation of Hydrology and Nutrient Transport in the Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China	WATER												Intensive agricultural activities in the Hetao irrigation district have severely degraded local aquatic ecosystems and water quality, and Ulansuhai Lake is now the most rapidly degrading eutrophic lake in China. A better understanding of the hydro-agronomic and pollutant transport processes in the area is thus urgently needed. This study simulated monthly streamflow, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) for the Hetao irrigation district using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate the nutrient load, source areas, and hydrological pathways. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values obtained for the streamflow simulations were 0.75 and 0.78 for the calibration and evaluation periods, respectively. The SWAT model captured the temporal variation in streamflow (R-2 > 0.8) for two periods; the NSE values for the TN and TP loads were 0.63 and 0.64 for the calibration period and 0.48 and 0.42 for the evaluation period, respectively. The predicted monthly TN load was correlated with irrigation (r = 0.61) and the monthly TP load with precipitation (r = 0.89), indicating that nitrogen transport is primarily associated with soil leaching and groundwater flow, and phosphorus is primarily transported by sediments caused by rainfall erosion. A case study of split nitrogen fertilizer applications demonstrated reduced annual TN load by as much as 13% in one year. Fertilization timing also affects the load in different pathways especially in lateral subsurface flow and shallow groundwater. Better agricultural management could thus reduce nitrogen losses, and buffer strips could minimize phosphorus transport.

Identifying Ground-water Resources and Intrabasinal Faults in the Hueco Bolson, West Texas, using Airborne Electromagnetic Induction and Magnetic-field Data	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENGINEERING GEOPHYSICS												We conducted a high-resolution airborne geophysical survey at the eastern margin of the basin-and-range province of the southwestern U.S. to examine the hydrostratigraphy of the Hueco Bolson and identify possible ground-water resources in this arid area. The survey, flown in 2001 over a 372-km(2) area east of El Paso, Texas, acquired time-domain electromagnetic induction (TDEM) and magnetic field data. These data were used to map conductivity trends to depths of at least 200 m that are related to lateral and vertical changes in lithology, water content, water chemistry (EM data), basin geometry, and the location of intrabasinal faults (magnetic data). Pre-survey, ground-based TDEM soundings established the achievable exploration depths and demonstrated that the relatively deep groundwater (80 to 120 m) significantly influenced the transient signal and was within the exploration depth of the airborne system. Airborne EM and magnetic field data identified intrabasinal faults that influence basin-fill deposition. Conductivity-depth slices constructed from airborne TDEM data allowed lateral variations in water quality and lithology to be mapped that helped predict ground-water resource quality within these fault-bounded basins filled with alluvial, lacustrine, and eolian sediments.																	1083-1363					MAR	2017	22	1			SI		63	81		10.2113/JEEG22.1.63								WOS:000397353200007

The influence of habitat structure on fish assemblages in Amazonian streams of Machado river basin	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Igarapes are Amazonian streams that are extremely susceptible to environmental changes. Due to the rapidly occurring riparian land use changes, and the several impacts these may have on fish assemblages, it is highly valuable to describe and understand the current relationships between these assemblages and the local environmental conditions, especially in barely know areas. In this research, we studied the taxonomic composition and fish assemblage attributes variation in three streams with different riparian conservation conditions: forest, intermediate and pasture. Samplings were performed every two months from October 2011 to September 2012, in three 1(st) order streams in the Machado River Basin, Rondonia. Fish were collected using trawls (seine net with a mesh size of 2 mm) and dip nets (2 mm mesh) along the entire stretch; the obtained samples were preserved and identified per site type. A total of 2 141 fish specimens belonging to 59 species, 17 families and five orders were recorded. Unlike the intermediate and pasture streams, the forest stream showed a high richness and low abundance. The forested stream exhibited the highest diversity and evenness value, and had low dominance, unlike the other streams. The variance partitioning and partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA) indicated that assemblage composition was significantly explained by the environmental variables such as: depth, water velocity, pteridophytes and grasses, but not by spatial predictors. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis showed that intermediate and pasture streams separated from the forested stream. We concluded that both, the stream environmental variables and fish assemblage attributes were influenced by the different conservation status and land cover. Given the influence of regional processes, which have a pervasive role in local fish assemblages, land use at the watershed scale is important, especially to explain the higher richness and diversity found in forested streams.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				MAR	2017	65	1					103	115										WOS:000397173700010	29466632

Genotoxic evaluation of Rio Grande water (Antioquia, Colombia) by frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes of Brycon henni (Characiformes: Characidae)	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The permanent monoculture of bananas and plantains farming in the middle of Rio Grande (Turbo - Antioquia) requires the application of a variety of pesticides. Inappropriate banana production practices in this region, have often led to waterbody pollution by agrochemicals from leachate and runoff processes. Currently, fish are the most common vertebrates used as bioindicators of water quality, because they are very sensitive to the presence of contaminants. Our main goal with this study was to compare the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes (MNE) in peripheral blood specimens of fish Biycon henni, from two locations (polluted and unpolluted) in the Rio Grande. We evaluated the frequency of MNE in peripheral blood samples of fish B. henni from each location during two rainy seasons in 2010 and two dry seasons in 2011. Blood samples were collected, fixed for 24 h, and then were stained with Giemsa. Among results, we found that the median frequency of MNE was higher in the polluted site by agrochemical discharges (0.15 0.18), than in the unimpacted site (0.06 0.08). Furthermore, the frequency of MNE in B. henni during the dry season was highly significant for both locations. The results of this study indicated that the analysis of MNE in B. henni could be recommended as a suitable method for in situ detection of environmental genotoxins.																	0034-7744	2215-2075				MAR	2017	65	1					405	414										WOS:000397173700032	29466654

Changes in runoff chemistry and soil fertility after multiple years of cattle winter bale feeding on annual cropland on the Canadian prairies	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Feeding cattle on cropland through the winter months using pre-placed fodder bales (bale grazing or infield bale feeding) has demonstrated economic benefits when compared to confined winter feeding, but very little research has been done to quantify the impacts of recurring cycles of in-field feeding on runoff water quality. In this study, two small watersheds (with and without winter bale grazing; WBG) located in the same annual cropped field in southern Manitoba, Canada were monitored from 2008 to 2016. Winter feeding in the WBG treatment occurred in the winters of 2008/09, 2010/11, 2012/13, and 2014/15. Export of N and P with the WBG treatment was also contrasted with the alternative practice of higher density confined feeding (CF). For WBG, soil fertility was improved, with higher soil test phosphorus (Olsen-P) and soil nitrate (NO3(-)-N) following WBG. Exports of N and P with surface runoff were also higher in snowmelt following WBG when compared to the control watershed, primarily due to higher concentrations of particulate N and P, NH4+-N, and dissolved organic N. Higher P loss from the WBG watershed than from the control watershed persisted in the non-grazing years following each bale grazing. In contrast, concentrations of all forms of nitrogen in runoff consistently returned to levels observed prior to bale grazing following a winter without treatment. Annual runoff export of N and P per animal unit day (AUD) following WBG was comparable to that for two CF sites. Higher annual volumes of runoff were observed from the larger area and lower density bale feeding treatment, but with lower concentrations of N and Pin comparison to feedlot sites. If WBG continues to be utilized to improve soil fertility and reduce manure transportation costs, the potential negative impacts on runoff water quality must be considered. Higher volumes of snowmelt runoff per AUD from WBG in comparison to CF sites will make runoff capture options more expensive to implement. WBG timing or siting changes that reduce runoff volume and make retention feasible or that decrease accumulation of P at the soil surface will reduce negative water quality impacts associated with WBG.

Richard; Jeong, Jaehak			Evaluating the ranch and watershed scale impacts of using traditional and adaptive multi-paddock grazing on runoff, sediment and nutrient losses in North Texas, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Grazing management practices have a significant influence on ecosystem services provided by rangelands. An assessment of hydrologic and water quality impacts of traditional and alternate grazing management practices facilitates adoption of best management practices for long-term sustainability of rangelands. A study was conducted to quantify the runoff, sediment and nutrient losses under traditional continuous and adaptive multi-paddock (MP) grazing management practices in the rangeland dominated (71% rangeland) Clear Creek Watershed (CCW) in north Texas in the United States using the Agricultural Policy/Environmental Extender (APEX) model. The model was calibrated and validated using observed herbaceous plant biomass and daily soil moisture data at four study ranches in the CCW [two under MP grazing and one each under light continuous (LC) and heavy continuous (HC) grazing practices], and using monthly streamflow, sediment, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) data measured at the watershed outlet. Both ranch- and watershed-scale results indicated a strong influence of the grazing practice on runoff and water quality. When the grazing management was changed from the baseline MP to HC at one of the study ranches, the simulated average (1980-2013) annual surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP losses increased by 148%, 142%, 144% and 158%, respectively. At the watershed-scale, changing grazing management from the baseline HC to adaptive MP reduced the average annual surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP loads at the watershed outlet by 39%, 34%, 33% and 31%, respectively. In addition, implementation of adaptive MP grazing reduced streamflow during the high flow conditions that have <10% exceedance probability, by about 20%, and hence reduced the chances of flooding downstream of the watershed. Adaptive MP grazing was therefore found to be an effective conservation practice on grazing lands for enhancing water conservation and protecting water quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Leslie, JE; Weersink, A; Yang, W; Fox, G				Leslie, Jennifer E.; Weersink, Alfons; Yang, Wanhong; Fox, Glenn			Actual versus environmentally recommended fertilizer application rates: Implications for water quality and policy	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Excessive application of crop nutrients has been identified as a threat to surface water quality in many jurisdictions. The Western Basin of Lake Erie Collaborative Agreement commits the governments of Michigan, Ohio and Ontario to reduce phosphorus entering the Lake Erie's western basin by 40% by 2025/2026 from 2008 levels by, among other things, reducing fertilizer use in agriculture. The International Joint Commission (2014) estimates that agriculture accounts for 44% of total phosphorus loadings to Lake Erie. Our study uses a unique micro level data set of 16 farms over 6 years that allows us to examine 397 individual nutrient application choices at the field and farm level. If efforts to reduce excessive application of nutrients are to be successful at aggregate level, they need to be informed by an understanding of how farmers make nutrient application decisions within existing production systems. The study aims to enhance our understanding by determining whether farmers applying nutrients to maximize yields, to maximize net returns or to meet environmental targets, and whether over application depends on factors such as farm size, crop type, manure use, and type of nutrient. We compare actual nutrient application rates with site specific rates intended to minimize excess nutrient application and we regress nutrient application levels against potential explanatory variables including farm size, crop rotation practices, and application of livestock. The data were collected from farmers in the Gully Creek watershed in Ontario. We found that excess nutrient applications, as a percentage of the total nutrient applications, are much higher for phosphorus than for nitrogen and higher for wheat than for corn. While most of the farmers in the study are not required to comply with provincial nutrient management regulations, many of them apply fertilizer at rates close to that recommended by those regulations and some at rates significantly less. While most farms are applying fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, at rates close to the minimum crop requirements, nevertheless, a few farms apply much more phosphorous than recommended. Policy and research efforts should be directed toward targeting these individuals that appear to be the primary contributor to the nutrient loading issue. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Behavioural Response Analysis Using Vision Engineering (BRAVENet)	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENT INFORMATICS												A new engineering methodology is proposed to improve the automation process in monitoring the water quality in a small scale aquaculture system. Behavioural Response Analysis using Vision Engineering Network or BRAVENet is proposed, as a support system to a traditional sensor-based system, to monitor critical water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, salinity and dissolved oxygen. BRAVENet is based on the reactions or behavioural responses of tiger prawns to different water conditions. The performance of both the sensor-based system and BRAVENet are analysed and discussed. It is shown that the BRAVENet can identify unsafe levels of water parameters and is a good monitoring and prediction tool for water conditions especially those instances when industry grade sensors fail or become erroneous. Promising results show that BRAVENet can be used as a support system, if not as a replacement, in continuously monitoring the status of the critical water quality parameters of aquaculture systems.																	1343-0130	1883-8014				MAR	2017	21	2					211	220		10.20965/jaciii.2017.p0211								WOS:000398603500005

In order to support the decision maker (DM) to find his/her most preferred solution, we propose an interactive multi-objective optimization method based on the DM's preferences in the form of indifference tradeoffs. The method combines evolutionary algorithms with the gradient-based interactive step tradeoff (GRIST) method. An evolutionary algorithm is used to generate an approximate Pareto optimal solution at each iteration. The DM is asked to provide indifference tradeoffs whose projection onto the tangent hyperplane of the Pareto front provides a tradeoff direction. An approach for approximating the normal vector of the tangent hyperplane is proposed which is used to calculate the projection. A water quality management problem is used to demonstrate the interaction process of the interactive method. In addition, three benchmark problems are used to test the accuracy of the normal vector approximation approach and compare the proposed method with GRIST.																	1343-0130	1883-8014				MAR	2017	21	2					284	292		10.20965/jaciii.2017.p0284								WOS:000398603500015

The multivariate statistical techniques were used in the hydrochemical evaluation of waters. Statistical analysis of water quality parameters was made to seeing the interrelationship between different variables in order to explain the water quality and pollution status of study area. For this purpose, water samples were taken from lake, river, stream, and springs which are represented by investigated area and water qualities were evaluated. Generally, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl-, HCO3- ions are dominant within surface water and water sources. Arsenic concentration increase is determined in Isikli spring and Kufi stream water samples. Also, aluminum concentration is high level in the Kufi stream water samples. This increase was related to igneous rocks as geogenic origin. Also, geogenic contamination was identified in R-mode factor and cluster analyses. There is high correlation between electrical conductivity and major ions of waters.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2017	10	6							143	10.1007/s12517-017-2877-4								WOS:000396895200018

Evaluation of ground water quality contaminants using linear regression and artificial neural network models	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Contamination of groundwater is one of the major health concerns in the rapidly urbanizing and industrializing world. Since groundwater is one of the most important resources for the domestic, industrial, and agricultural purposes, the quality and quantity is of prime importance. Nitrite which is a reduced form of nitrate ion is one of the potential contaminants in the groundwater. The detection of nitrite ion is one of the laborious works and also it gets easily oxidized to nitrate ion and hence modeling approaches for the nitrite concentration will be one of the resilient quantification techniques. In the present study, the effective performance of the linear and non-linear models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR), artificial neural network (ANN), and the integrated technique of principal components and artificial neural network (PC-ANN) is evaluated in the prediction of the nitrite concentration. The MLR and PCR showed better results either in generation step or in the validation step but not both. ANN shows better results in both generation and validation steps but the results in the validation steps, though good but accuracy is comparatively lower than the generation step. In the case of PC-ANN, the prediction of the model is found to be good both in the generation and in the validation steps. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency test clearly illustrates better performance of PC-ANN in comparison with other models in the present study for the quantification of nitrite concentration in groundwater.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2017	10	6							128	10.1007/s12517-017-2867-6								WOS:000396895200003

However, the model had its own disadvantages in various aspects. In this work, several methods and the technologies have been introduced to improve on the traditional model. The type of the aquifer was replaced by the thickness of the aquifer, and the index of topography was removed. The indexes of the exploitation of the groundwater and the type of land use that reflected the special vulnerability were added to the system. Furthermore, considering the wideness of the study area, the fixed weights in the DRASTIC model were not suitable. An analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and an entropy weight (Ew) method were introduced to calculate the weights of parameters. Then, the Spearman Rho correlation coefficients between IVI and the Nemerow synthetical pollution index (NI) of the groundwater quality were significantly improved, after the four steps of modification. The level differences with little gaps between Nemerow comprehensive pollution indexes and groundwater vulnerability occupied the proportion of the area from 75.68 to 84.04%, and finally, a single-parameter sensitivity analysis for the two models was used to compute the effective weights of these parameters. By comparison, the DRMSICEL model seems to perform better than the DRASTIC model in the study area. And the results show discrepancies between the vulnerability indices and groundwater quality as indicated by existence of vulnerable areas with bad water quality and vice versa.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2017	10	6							144	10.1007/s12517-017-2885-4								WOS:000396895200019

This model used PCA to extract the PC of aquaculture ecological indexes, then reduced the input vector dimension of the model, and utilized differential evolutionary algorithm to optimize the weight parameter of FNN, in order to automatically obtain the optimum parameters and build nonlinear prediction model of DO in aquaculture water quality. The model was applied in a predictive analysis on the water quality data online monitored from December 1st 2015 to December 8th 2015 in a Penaeus orientalis culture pond. The testing results show that this model has obtained a good predictive effect. Compared to BP-FNN model, in PCA-FNN-DEBP model, the absolute error of 95.8% test samples is less than 20%, and the maximum error is 0.22 mg/L, both of which are superior than BP-FNN prediction method. Due to rapid computation speed and high prediction accuracy, PCA-FNN-DEBP algorithm can provide strategic basis for the regulation and management of water quality in P. orientalis culture.																	1386-7857	1573-7543				MAR	2017	20	1			SI		131	140		10.1007/s10586-017-0738-2								WOS:000397969100012

To conduct this study the major ion concentrations, including HCO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, SO42- and Cl- and water levels in ten water wells and the dam reservoir were measured during two periods ( June 2009 and June 2011), analyzed by factor analysis and plotted in water quality charts. The results of factor analysis show that most of the dissolved ions including Mg2+, Ca2+, SO42-, Cl- and HCO3-, particularly in 2009, were mainly originated from carbonate and evaporitic formations as well as from the playa lake ( Factor 1). In 2011, elevated salinity levels were found to be mainly related to intense evaporation during irrigation that are proportional to Na+ and K+ concentrations ( Factor 2) and depend on the type of crop and irrigation method. It was also found that the surface waters from deeper origins had less of an effect on groundwater recharge compared to upstream carbonate aquifers.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	6							238	10.1007/s12665-017-6550-8								WOS:000398451000006

Short-term forecasting of saltwater occurrence at La Comte River (French Guiana) using a kernel-based support vector machine	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Saltwater intrusion into rivers is a major concern for freshwater exploitation and management in French Guiana (South America). To detect and analyse saltwater occurrence, a permanent station was installed on La Comte River to measure the electrical conductivity C. The objective of the present study was twofold. First, the temporal link between C, sea water level SWL and river discharge Q was explored during the dry seasons from 2009 to 2012 (total measurement duration of similar to 6 months). A lag of 3 h between C and SWL was evidenced (i.e. the C peaks are delayed by 3 h with high water conditions), as well as the co-occurrence of sea water intrusion with the low Q period. Second, a data-driven approach was set up through a kernel-based support vector machine SVM technique to forecast two events: (1) the forthcoming maximum value of C (for the next 3 h) exceeds 500 mu S/cm; (2) C exceeds 500 mu S/cm during more than 2 h. One potential drawback of such a data-driven approach is to fail to predict outside the range of calibration: this issue was thoroughly explored by means of an intensive bootstrap-based test exercise. It was showed that SVM has very high degree of predictive capability with accuracy and area under receiver operator curve above 90% in average. We additionally analyse the practical implementation of the SVM model with comparison to alternative popular classification techniques (logistic regression, random forest, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis): the SVM strength is to provide the nonlinear decision boundary without making a priori restrictive assumptions on its shape (like linear or quadratic methods) and without being too sensitive to noisy observations/outliers. Yet this strength can turn to be a weakness unless a careful examination of the shape is done from a physical perspective.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	6							246	10.1007/s12665-017-6553-5								WOS:000398451000014

Reservoir dams are local for the accumulation of sediments transported from upstream. The amount of P release from sediments to water is potentially controlled by the retention characteristics of sediments. In this regard, 100 sediment samples were taken from surface sediments to determine the P retention capacity of sediments in Ekbatan Dam, Hamadan, Iran, and 15 water samples were collected from the interface of bottom sediments with lake water to determine different types of water P, including water-soluble P (WSP), dissolved reactive P (DRP), suspended solids P (SSP), and total P (TP). Firstly, some physical and chemical properties of sediments such as pH, cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), organic carbon (OC) content, equivalent CaCO3 (TNV), aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe) content were measured, and then WSP, TP, SSP, and DRP as well as P isotherms were determined. Moreover, three isotherm equations of Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin were fitted to the experimental data. Finally, the map of spatial variation of degree of P saturation (DPS) was plotted. The results revealed that the amount of DRP in water was at high level (0.02 mg L-1). The maximum adsorption in the sediments ranged from 83.93 to 634.13 mg kg(-1) that was significantly correlated with the physical and chemical properties of sediments, such as clay percentage, OC, and TNV. The equilibrium concentration of P at zero point was significantly higher than DRP. This demonstrated the release of P from sediments into water. P binding energy in the sediments ranged from 0.03 to 5.48 L mg(-1). There was a significant correlation between the binding energy and oxalate-extractable Fe, representing that the poorly crystalline or amorphous Fe would play a dominate role in the P adsorption under the slightly alkaline condition. The results suggested that the sediments not only had high P adsorption capacity and binding energy but released loosely bound WSP to water as well, which can cause eutrophication in the long term.

However, increasing the harvest intensity may affect the soil nutrient stores and water quality. Here, effects on soil-water chemistry after stem-only and whole-tree harvesting were investigated using data from five experimental sites in Sweden, representing medium-to high-fertility sites. They were located in recharge areas on mineral soil and harvested between the years 1995 and 2001. Soil-water samples had previously been collected from below the main part of the root zone in study plots subjected to stem-only or whole-tree harvest. Soil-water chemistry data from the five sites were jointly analyzed by ANOVA using seasonal mean concentrations from the first six seasons after clear-cutting. The concentrations of NO3--N, K+, and Mg2+ were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the two harvest regimes, indicating lower levels after whole-tree harvest than after stem-only harvest. No significant differences were detected for electrical conductivity, pH, or the concentrations of NH4+-N, Al, Ca2+, SO42--S, and Cl-. Measurements at one site suggested that the logging residues left on the ground increased the influx of Cl-to the soil. Simple budget calculations indicated that the nutrient export by logging-residue harvest was greater than the export by leaching during the regeneration phase.

Modeling of subsurface agricultural drainage using two hydrological models with different conceptual approaches as well as dimensions and spatial scales	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												In regions where soils are seasonally or perennially wet, subsurface drainage represents an essential water management practice. Two hydrological models with different modeling approaches as well as different dimensional and spatial scales, DRAINMOD (1D, lumped and field-scale) and CATHY (3D, spatially distributed and watershed-scale), were compared in terms of their performance to predict tile-drain flow and to simulate evapotranspiration (ET) under field conditions. Two metrics were defined to assess the capacity of the models to represent the soil water dynamics: relative errors in simulating peak flow and drainage volume. Using different hydraulic conductivity scenarios, both models provided similar results. For the total predicted/observed tile-drain flow comparison, the two models yielded very similar results. In terms of coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE), their performances were low in simulating tile-drain flows for dry periods (low observed tile-drain flow). During periods with higher observed tile-drain flow, the performance of both models was good (R-2>0.75 and NSE mostly>0.60), but DRAINMOD produced better results than CATHY did. The two models had similar ET values (R-2>0.80). Regarding the impact of the hydraulic conductivity of each soil layer on subsurface drainage outflow, this study showed that the soil layer below the tile-drain system was the most influential for the two models.																	0701-1784	1918-1817				MAR	2017	42	1					38	53		10.1080/07011784.2016.1231014								WOS:000395100900004

Integrating hydrogeomorphological concepts in management approaches of lowland agricultural streams: Perspectives, problems and prospects based on case studies in Quebec	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Alternative management approaches for agricultural streams based on hydrogeomorphological principles such as a two-stage channel are promising, but need to be further tested in contexts other than the Midwestern United States. In Quebec (Canada), the presence of many deep drain outlets may limit their applicability. The objectives of this research are to (1) assess the feasibility of implementing the two-stage channel design in Quebec; (2) determine how alternative management approaches compare with traditional management from an economical point of view, and (3) evaluate the impact of modifying the drain outlet design using small horseshoe wetlands to accommodate hydrogeomorphological adjustments of the channel. A combination of case studies and numerical modelling (HEC-RAS, Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System) was used for three study sites located in the Monteregie region (QC). Based on regional hydraulic geometry curves, additional space on each bank required for a two-stage channel ranged between 1.3 and 2.8 m for a width equal to 3 times the inset channel. Hydraulic modelling confirms previous findings of improved drainage capacity at high flow, (up to a 54% increase). Cost analysis reveals that two-stage and over-widened channels are 3 to 4 times more expensive to implement when compared to traditional trapezoidal clean-out dredging operations, mainly due to spoil removal and transportation. However, self-formed channels are less expensive since they only require additional riparian land. A crop yield analysis in the near-stream zone at three sites which are frequently flooded revealed markedly lower productivity in zones within the flooding space. The horseshoe wetland design for drain outlets could also be maintained at low cost, and would promote more heterogeneity than the traditional trapezoidal ditches. Using alternative agricultural stream management approaches based on hydrogeomorphological concepts would be feasible in the Quebec context without compromising the overall productivity of this key economic sector.																	0701-1784	1918-1817				MAR	2017	42	1					54	69		10.1080/07011784.2016.1163241								WOS:000395100900005

The oxygen consumption rate and asphyxiation point in Chanodichthys mongolicus were detected under laboratory conditions using an improved respirometer chamber. The results revealed that more accurate estimates can be obtained by adjusting the volume of the respirometer chamber, which may avoid system errors caused by either repeatedly adjusting fish density or selecting different equipment specifications. The oxygen consumption rate and asphyxiation point of C. mongolicus increased with increasing water temperature and decreasing fish size. Changes in the C. mongolicus oxygen consumption rate were divided into three stages at water temperatures of 11-33 degrees C: (1) a low temperature oxygen consumption rate stage when water temperature was 11-19 degrees C, (2) the optimum temperature oxygen consumption rate stage when water temperature was 19-23 degrees C, and (3) a high temperature oxygen consumption rate stage when water temperature was >27 degrees C. The temperature quotients (Q(10)) obtained suggested that C. mongolicus preferred a temperature range of 19-23 degrees C. At 19 degrees C, C. mongolicus exhibited higher oxygen consumption rates during the day when the maximum values were observed at 10:00 and 14:00 than at night when the minimum occurred at 02:00.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				MAR	2017	35	2					294	302		10.1007/s00343-016-5293-9								WOS:000396021400008

In this study, empirical algorithms were established to infer sea surface salinity and turbidity of YR plume using on surface reflectance products of MODIS and GOCI satellites in combination with observations from hydrographic surveys during the 2014 WSR event. Inter- and intraday variability of salinity and turbidity were quantitatively assessed and correlated with external forces including river discharge, tides, Coriolis force, and wind-driven circulation. The results revealed the enhanced offshore extension of turbid plume as WSR drastically increased freshwater and sediment discharge to river mouth. During WSR event, the area of low salinity plume ( < 25 psu) increased to 267 km(2), while sediment plume (SR645 > 0.12sr(-1)) occupied a maximum area of 162 lung. Intraday variation observed from geostationary GOCI data clearly illustrated the dominance of tidal current on short term dispersal pattern of freshwater and sediment plume. In comparison, wind field dominated the seasonal variation in flume transport but had insignificant impact on short term river plume dynamic during WSR. Overall, this study demonstrated that the spatial and temporal dynamic of YR plume was successfully captured by satellite remote sensing, which provided an effective tool for evaluating the environmental and ecological impact of WSRs.																	0278-4343	1873-6955				MAR 1	2017	135						74	85		10.1016/j.csr.2017.01.017								WOS:000396956800007

Suspended sediment transport dynamics in rivers: Multi-scale drivers of temporal variation	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Suspended sediment is a natural part of river systems and plays an essential role in structuring the landscape, creating ecological habitats and transporting nutrients. It is also a common management problem, where alterations to sediment quantity and quality negatively impact ecological communities, increase flood hazard and shorten the lifespan of infrastructure. To address these challenges and develop sustainable management strategies, we need a thorough understanding of sediment sources, pathways and transport dynamics and the drivers that underlie spatial and temporal variability in suspended sediment transport in rivers. However, research to date has not sufficiently addressed the temporal complexity of sediment transport processes, which is limiting our ability to disentangle the hydro-meteorological, catchment, channel and anthropogenic drivers of suspended sediment transport in rivers. This review critically evaluates previously published work on suspended sediment dynamics to demonstrate how the interpretation of sediment sources and pathways is influenced by the temporal scale and methodology of the study. To do this, the review (i) summarizes the main drivers of temporal variation in suspended sediment transport in rivers; (ii) critically reviews the common empirical approaches used to analyze and quantify sediment sources and loads, and their capacity to account for temporal variations; (iii) applies these findings to recent case studies to illustrate how method and timescale affect the interpretation of suspended sediment transport dynamics; and finally (iv) synthesizes the findings of the review into a set of guidelines for a multi-timescale approach to characterize the sediment regime of a river. By recognizing a priori that study design and temporal scale have an impact on the interpretation of suspended sediment dynamics and employing methods that address these issues, future research will be better able to identify the drivers of suspended sediment transport in rivers, improve sediment transport modelling, and propose effective, sustainable solutions to sediment management problems.

Headwater streams in the neotropical savanna are severely threatened by large-scale landscape changes that degrade local habitat characteristics and lead to biodiversity loss. The objective of our study was to evaluate Ephemeroptera assemblages as bioindicators of catchment land use and cover, local streambed and riparian vegetation conditions, and instream water quality. To do so, we sampled mayfly nymphs in 184 stream sites across a broad disturbance gradient in four hydrologic units of the Brazilian neotropical savanna. We selected seven metrics without significant co-variation with natural variability: % catchment urban, riparian vegetation condition index (RCOND), human disturbances of the stream channel and riparian zone (Wl_HALL), substrate mean embeddedness (XEMBED), dissolved oxygen (mg L-1), pH, and total phosphorus (mg L-1). We ran threshold indicator taxa analysis (TITAN) for each disturbance metric to detect change points in mayfly genera responses (whether sensitive or tolerant) and assemblage turnover pattern. TITAN showed that 20 of the 39 genera found were robust bioindicators (based on purity and reliability values >0.95), sixteen of them being sensitive to increased disturbance. The most sensitive genera were Tricorythopsis (Leptohyphidae) and Camelobaetidius (Baetidae), showing decreased abundance to most disturbance metrics. We found a turnover pattern of mayfly genera in response to Wl_HALL in a narrow variation range. For total phosphorus, the benchmark value defined in Brazilian Federal Legislation is higher than the turnover threshold of several mayfly genera. This indicates that we will lose many sensitive genera even within the limits imposed by national environmental legislation. The indicator taxa approach, based on multiple taxa rather than univariate metrics or single indicator species, demonstrates the value of quantitative ecological information for conserving and managing freshwater ecosystems globally.

Development of an epiphyte indicator of nutrient enrichment: Threshold values for seagrass epiphyte load	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Metrics of epiphyte load on macrophytes were evaluated for use as quantitative biological indicators for nutrient impacts in estuarine waters, based on review and analysis of the literature on epiphytes and macrophytes, primarily seagrasses, but including some brackish and freshwater rooted macrophyte species. An approach is presented that empirically derives threshold epiphyte loads which are likely to cause specified levels of decrease in macrophyte response metrics such as biomass, shoot density, percent cover, production and growth. Data from 36 studies of 10 macrophyte species were pooled to derive relationships between epiphyte load and.25 and 50% seagrass response levels, which are proposed as the primary basis for establishment of critical threshold values. Given multiple sources of variability in the response data, threshold ranges based on the range of values falling between the median and the 75th quantiles of observations at a given seagrass response level are proposed rather than single, critical point values. Four epiphyte load threshold categories low, moderate, high, very high, are proposed. Comparison of values of epiphyte loads associated with 25 and 50% reductions in light to macrophytes suggest that the threshold ranges are realistic both in terms of the principle mechanism of impact to macrophytes and in terms of the magnitude of resultant impacts expressed by the macrophytes. Some variability in response levels was observed among climate regions, and additional data collected with a standardized approach could help in the development of regionalized threshold ranges for the epiphyte load indicator.

Testing the efficacy of an estuarine eutrophic condition index: Does it account for shifts in flow conditions?	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Eutrophication of estuaries via anthropogenic nutrient enrichment is an issue being addressed extensively on a global scale, however it remains a topic that garners further attention due to its complexity. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a recently proposed eutrophic condition index in five permanently open estuaries, subsequent to flow variations. Further, in order to elucidate their potential role in augmenting eutrophic conditions, the influence of vegetated habitats on associated microalgal communities was investigated. The study took place in the summer of 2014 and 2015. On each sampling occasion, all of the proposed 'state' indicators (nutrients, oxygen and microalgal communities) were assessed and supplemented with a heuristic 'pressure' component (flow conditions). Overall, the proposed index was shown to be sensitive to environmental perturbations providing shifts in classification ratings illustrating the dilution (Swartkops Estuary) or augmenting (Kromme, Gamtoos, and Kariega estuaries) effect of freshwater pulse events. Additionally, the sensitivity of selected epiphyte and microphytobenthos (MPB) parameters to water quality variations was verified, thus supporting their inclusion as indicators in the proposed index. Regarding the role of microhabitats in promoting microalgal growth, it was found that MPB biomass was higher (5-290%) and benthic diatom diversity generally lower (5-50%) in vegetated compared to unvegetated habitats - an important consideration when applying the index. The habitat complexity and stabilisation provided by estuarine macrophytes (Phragmites australis and Zostera capensis) supported notable autotroph colonisation. This highlights their importance in structuring trophic pathways, whilst also potentially providing a corridor for the intensification of eutrophic symptoms in estuaries. Overall, this study provides an important step towards the verification of a proposed assessment methodology which may serve to provide a baseline from which the eutrophic status of estuaries can be monitored - particularly in countries where such assessment frameworks are lacking.

J	Wichelns, D				Wichelns, Dennis			Volumetric water footprints, applied in a global context, do not provide insight regarding water scarcity or water quality degradation	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Many authors have presented estimates of volumetric water footprints in the context of describing and comparing the water requirements of crop production and industrial activities. In recent years, water footprints have been proposed as indicators for use in assessing the sustainability, efficiency, and equity of water allocations in a global context. That perspective is notably ambitious, given that volumetric water footprints contain information pertaining to just one resource, with no consideration of scarcity values, opportunity costs, or the impacts of water use on the environment, livelihoods, or human health. The suggestion that water scarcity must be assessed from a global perspective also is misplaced. Water scarcity and water quality degradation arise in local and regional settings. The impacts and potential remedies must be evaluated at those levels, by scientists and public officials charged with determining the policies and investments needed to ensure wise use of water resources. Efforts to extend access to clean, safe, and affordable water to the millions of households lacking such access also must be designed and implemented locally. Public officials will not gain useful insight by comparing volumetric water footprints in a global context. Water scarcity and water quality degradation cannot be resolved by reorganizing production activities across river basins and continents. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

S.; Suthar, Surindra			Hydrochemistry of groundwater in North Rajasthan, India: chemical and multivariate analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents the hydrochemistry of groundwater of the northern districts of Rajasthan, India. Groundwater samples were collected from 50 sampling stations (rural and suburban areas) and analyzed for pH, EC, TDS, TH, NO3-, SO4 (2-), PO43-, Na (+), K (+), Mg2+, Ca (2+), Fe (2+), F(-)and Cl-. The pH varied from 6.54 to 9.51 in groundwater, slightly higher than WHO limit. The majority of sampling sites (80-100%) showed the high EC, TDS, TH and Na (+) contents in groundwater with an average value of 4.46 S/cm, 2856.1, 1774.4 and 426 mg/L, respectively. Na (+)/Cl(-)ratio was >1 in most of the sampling locations, which indicates the releasing of Na+ from silicate weathering. NO3- in groundwater ranged between (0.37 and 51.4 mg/L), and a few sites indicate an anthropogenic contribution of NO3- in groundwater. The F-in groundwater is a major issue in this area, and F-varied from 0.02 to 7.18 mg/L (with an average of 2.08 mg/L). Piper diagram identified Ca-Mg-HCO3 ([80%) and NaK- HCO(3)(-)as the dominant types of water of this area. The strong correlation between Na-Cl and K-Cl, Ca-Mg-SO4 suggests feldspar weathering in groundwater. Six components with a variance of 79% were extracted, which suggests cation exchange, rock-water interaction and anthropogenic activities as major factors affecting groundwater chemistry of this area. Water quality index of study area ranged between 178.58 and 944.8, and groundwater of about 58% of the study site fell under unsuitable for drinking category. The result of SAR analysis indicated the high Na+ content in groundwater (>10% sites), unsuitable for irrigation purposes. Langelier saturation index indicates that >60% sampling sites may have scaling problems due to excess CaCO3 in groundwater. Results suggest complex geological processes and anthropogenic pressure as major causes of deterioration of the overall quality of groundwater in this area.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	5							203	10.1007/s12665-017-6496-x								WOS:000396208400016

Under various river management and conservation strategies for its protection, the assessment of water quality of its main tributary Ramganga River is lacking. This study focuses on assessment of physicochemical and heavy metal pollution of the Ramganga River by application of multivariate statistical techniques. Sampling of Ramganga River at sixteen sampling sites was carried out in three seasons (summer, monsoon and winter) of 2014. The collected water samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters and heavy metals. Results from cluster analysis (CA) of the data divided the whole stretch of the river into three clusters as elevation from 1304 to 259 m as less polluted, from 207 to 154 m as moderately polluted and from elevation 154 to 139 m as high-polluted stretches with anthropogenic as main sources of pollution in high-polluted stretch. Principal component analysis of the seasonal dataset resulted in three significant principal components (PC) in each season explaining 72-8% of total variance with strong loadings (>0.75) of PC1 on fluoride (F-), chloride (Cl-), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium Mg2+), bicarbonate (HCO3-), total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. Temporal variation by one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) showed significant seasonal variation was in the pH, chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, turbidity, HCO3-, F-, Zn, cadmium (Cd) and Mn (p < 0.05). Turbidity showed approximately a twofold increase in monsoon season due to rainfall in the catchment area and subsequent flow of runoff into the river. Concentration of HCO3-, F- and pH also showed similar increase in monsoon. The concentration of Zn, Cd and Mn showed an increasing trend in summers compared to monsoon and winter season due to dilution effect in the monsoon season and its lasting effect in winters.

GIS-based FRASTIC model for pollution vulnerability assessment of fractured-rock aquifer systems	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												All groundwater is vulnerable to pollution, but the level of susceptibility depends on the spatial peculiarities of a region. Among the numerous vulnerability assessment methodologies, the geographical information system-based DRASTIC model is the most sophisticated and achieves reliable results even in complex areas. Fractured-rock aquifers are not only complex, but they are also potential sources of radioactive and other types of waste and are liable to high recharge rates. Hence, they can serve as a conduit for fluid (and potentially) contaminants. Therefore, in this study, a new parameter, 'fracture media' (F), is fashioned to replace the weakest parameter (i.e. depth to water, D) in the standardized DRASTIC model to create a new model (FRASTIC) for the complex fractured aquifer system. The proposed model was tested on a case study area (Kano, Nigeria), and the FRASTIC minimum and maximum indices obtained were in the range of 63-170. The region was characterized as having very low (covering 0.16% of the total study area), low (55.52%), medium (42.53%), and high (1.79%) vulnerability based on the standardized classification system. In addition, the modified FRASTIC model was further developed using the sensitivity analysis (SA) and recorded the highest vulnerable area coverage (32.86%) within Kano. Thus, the modified FRASTIC model is appropriate for the complex nature of the study area because it contributes appreciably to defining the vulnerable zones. The single-parameter SA was employed to obtain effective weights for two modified models, which were then implemented to improve efficacy. Conventional nitrate validation indicated that there is a strong correlation between nitrate and vulnerability for the modified models. In addition, a new approach for identifying the relationship between the water quality and vulnerability indices was developed by this study and was proven to be an effective validation tool.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAR	2017	76	5							197	10.1007/s12665-017-6520-1								WOS:000396208400010

Under the hydrochemical condition, the solar photocycle would result in changes of the water temperature, in photosynthesis and in iron photoreduction, which leads to substantial hydrochemical fluctuations, especially for heavy metals. It is important to consider the daily variations in water quality when developing a hydrochemical monitoring plan for an area with highly developed agriculture, such as the Tatun Volcano Group watershed area in this study. The results show that the water chemistry is highly complicated by both solar photocycles and hydrochemical fluctuations in the upstream area. Using principal component analysis, the contributions from the two factors can be successfully separated. During the daytime, the photocycle results in the formation of aluminum hydroxide, which can remove heavy metals from water. Consequently, the content of heavy metals, including As, Cu, Ni, Co and Ba, increases after sunset and can reach a maximum before sunrise, while Fe behaves inversely due to the photoreduction. The variation of As during a diel cycle can reach 97%. However, the content of most of the heavy metals during diel cycle is incomparable with those in the earlier studies due to the formation of aluminum hydroxide instead of iron hydroxide. The other significant factor, hydrochemical fluctuation, can explain the variation of major components in water including Cl, SO4. Rare earth elements (REEs) were also analyzed and can be an excellent natural tracer in this study. The distribution of REEs shows a depletion of light REEs and an even normalized concentration of middle and heavy REEs. It is theorized that the REEs in the water in this study derive mainly from the reservoir rock of geothermal water. In a hydrochemical monitoring plan, REEs can be an indicator for identifying an anthropogenic source.

J	Wu, JH; Xue, CY; Tian, R; Wang, S				Wu, Jianhua; Xue, Chenyang; Tian, Rui; Wang, Siting			Lake water quality assessment: a case study of Shahu Lake in the semiarid loess area of northwest China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												A comprehensive assessment on lake water quality was carried out in Shahu Lake, northwest China, to provide valuable information about present lake water quality for decision making. Major ions, general parameters, bacteriological parameters, organics and trace metals monitored monthly in 2014 were considered. Monitored parameters were compared with quality criteria for surface water of China, and overall water quality assessment was carried out using an entropy weighted water quality index (EWQI) based on 20 selected parameters. Lake water quality was also assessed for irrigation purpose. The results show that the lake water is of Cl center dot SO4-Na facies with high salinity and COD. The geochemistry of the lake water is regulated by intense evaporation and human activities. TP, TN and F- are major inorganic contaminants, with over 50% of the water samples polluted by them. Oil, mainly attributed by leaky motor tourist boats, is the major organic pollutants in the lake water, with 10 samples (37.04%) showing higher oil content than the permissible limit. The concentrations of other inorganic and organic contaminants as well as trace metals are well below the permissible limits. The present study indicates that inorganic contamination in the lake water is more severe than organic pollution. The overall lake water quality, assessed by EWQI, is poor and very poor with SO42-, TDS, TH and Cl-being the dominant contributing factors. The lake water is suitable for irrigation in terms of alkalinity, but is unsuitable for irrigation from the salinity point of view. Accelerating the circulation and replenishment of the lake water is an important way of reducing contaminant concentrations. This study is important in providing comprehensive information on lake water quality for decision makers and valuable reference for international lake water researchers.

A comparison of metrics to evaluate the effects of hydro-facility passage stressors on fish	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Hydropower is the most common form of renewable energy, and countries worldwide are considering expanding hydropower to new areas. One of the challenges of hydropower deployment is mitigation of the environmental impacts including water quality, habitat alterations, and ecosystem connectivity. For fish species that inhabit river systems with hydropower facilities, passage through the facility to access spawning and rearing habitats can be particularly challenging. Fish moving downstream through a hydro facility can be exposed to a number of stressors (e.g., rapid decompression, cavitation, blade strike and collision, turbulence, and shear forces), which can affect fish survival in direct and indirect ways. Many studies have investigated the effects of hydroturbine passage on fish; however, the comparability among studies is limited by variation in the metrics and biological endpoints used. Future studies investigating the effects of hydroturbine passage should focus on using metrics and endpoints that are easily comparable. This review summarizes four categories of metrics that are used in fisheries research that have application to hydroturbine passage (i.e., mortality, injury, physiological markers, behavior) and evaluates them based on several criteria (i.e., resources needed, invasiveness, comparability among stressors and species, and diagnostic properties). Additionally, these comparisons are put into context of study setting (i.e., laboratory versus field). Overall, injury and physiological markers are ideal for studies in which there is a need to understand the mechanisms of effect, whereas behavior and mortality metrics provide information on the whole body response of the fish. The study setting strongly influences the comparability among studies. In laboratory-based studies, stressors can be controlled by type, intensity, and duration, allowing for easy comparisons among studies. In contrast, field studies expose fish to realistic passage environments but the comparability is limited. Based on these results, future studies, whether lab or field-based, should focus on metrics that relate to mortality for ease of comparison, while some diagnostic capability is important for furthering the science.

Christopher			ACUTE SENSITIVITY OF A BROAD RANGE OF FRESHWATER MUSSELS TO CHEMICALS WITH DIFFERENT MODES OF TOXIC ACTION	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Freshwater mussels, one of the most imperiled groups of animals in the world, are generally underrepresented in toxicity databases used for the development of ambient water quality criteria and other environmental guidance values. Acute 96-h toxicity tests were conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of 5 species of juvenile mussels from 2 families and 4 tribes to 10 chemicals (ammonia, metals, major ions, and organic compounds) and to screen 10 additional chemicals (mainly organic compounds) with a commonly tested mussel species, fatmucket (Lampsilis siliquoidea). In the multi-species study, median effect concentrations (EC50s) among the 5 species differed by a factor of <= 2 for chloride, potassium, sulfate, and zinc; a factor of <= 5 for ammonia, chromium, copper, and nickel; and factors of 6 and 12 for metolachlor and alachlor, respectively, indicating that mussels representing different families or tribes had similar sensitivity to most of the tested chemicals, regardless of modes of action. There was a strong linear relationship between EC50s for fatmucket and the other 4 mussel species across the 10 chemicals (r(2) = 0.97, slope close to 1.0), indicating that fatmucket was similar to other mussel species; thus, this commonly tested species can be a good surrogate for protecting other mussels in acute exposures. The sensitivity of juvenile fatmucket among different populations or cultured fromlarvae ofwild adults and captive-cultured adults was also similar in acute exposures to copper or chloride, indicating captive-cultured adult mussels can reliably be used to reproduce juveniles for toxicity testing. In compiled databases for all freshwater species, 1 or more mussel species were among the 4 most sensitive species for alachlor, ammonia, chloride, potassium, sulfate, copper, nickel, and zinc; therefore, the development of water quality criteria and other environmental guidance values for these chemicals should reflect the sensitivity of mussels. In contrast, the EC50s of fatmucket tested in the single-species study were in the high percentiles (> 75th) of species sensitivity distributions for 6 of 7 organic chemicals, indicating mussels might be relatively insensitive to organic chemicals in acute exposures.

ACUTE SENSITIVITY OF THE VERNAL POOL FAIRY SHRIMP, BRANCHINECTA LYNCHI (ANOSTRACA; BRANCHINECTIDAE), AND SURROGATE SPECIES TO 10 CHEMICALS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Vernal pool fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, (Branchiopoda; Anostraca) and other fairy shrimp species have been listed as threatened or endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. Because few data exist about the sensitivity of Branchinecta spp. to toxic effects of contaminants, it is difficult to determine whether they are adequately protected by water quality criteria. A series of acute (24-h) lethality/immobilization tests was conducted with 3 species of fairy shrimp (B. lynchi, Branchinecta lindahli, and Thamnocephalus platyurus) and 10 chemicals with varying modes of toxic action: ammonia, potassium, chloride, sulfate, chromium( VI), copper, nickel, zinc, alachlor, and metolachlor. The same chemicals were tested in 48-h tests with other branchiopods ( the cladocerans Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia) and an amphipod (Hyalella azteca), and in 96-h tests with snails (Physa gyrina and Lymnaea stagnalis). Median effect concentrations (EC50s) for B. lynchi were strongly correlated (r(2) (_) 0.975) with EC50s for the commercially available fairy shrimp species T. platyurus for most chemicals tested. Comparison of EC50s for fairy shrimp and EC50s for invertebrate taxa tested concurrently and with other published toxicity data indicated that fairy shrimp were relatively sensitive to potassium and several trace metals compared with other invertebrate taxa, although cladocerans, amphipods, and mussels had similar broad toxicant sensitivity. Interspecies correlation estimation models for predicting toxicity to fairy shrimp from surrogate species indicated that models with cladocerans and freshwater mussels as surrogates produced the best predictions of the sensitivity of fairy shrimp to contaminants. The results of these studies indicate that fairy shrimp are relatively sensitive to a range of toxicants, but Endangered Species Act-listed fairy shrimp of the genus Branchinecta were not consistently more sensitive than other fairy shrimp taxa.

Deirdre; Michael, Edwin			Predicting lymphatic filariasis transmission and elimination dynamics using a multi-model ensemble framework	EPIDEMICS												Mathematical models of parasite transmission provide powerful tools for assessing the impacts of interventions. Owing to complexity and uncertainty, no single model may capture all features of transmission and elimination dynamics. Multi-model ensemble modelling offers a framework to help overcome biases of single models. We report on the development of a first multi-model ensemble of three lymphatic filariasis (LF) models (EPIFIL, LYMFASIM, and TRANSFIL), and evaluate its predictive performance in comparison with that of the constituents using calibration and validation data from three case study sites, one each from the three major LF endemic regions: Africa, Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea (PNG). We assessed the performance of the respective models for predicting the outcomes of annual MDA strategies for various baseline scenarios thought to exemplify the current endemic conditions in the three regions. The results show that the constructed multi-model ensemble outperformed the single models when evaluated across all sites. Single models that best fitted calibration data tended to do less well in simulating the out-of-sample, or validation, intervention data. Scenario modelling results demonstrate that the multi-model ensemble is able to compensate for variance between single models in order to produce more plausible predictions of intervention impacts. Our results highlight the value of an ensemble approach to modelling parasite control dynamics. However, its optimal use will require further methodological improvements as well as consideration of the organizational mechanisms required to ensure that modelling results and data are shared effectively between all stakeholders.

However, not all cyclones produce similar impact on a coastal lagoon, some trigger algal blooms after passage while others just increase the overall turbidity. Asia's largest brackish water lagoon, Chilika Lagoon, India was hit by two anniversary-severe cyclones Phailin (12 October 2013) and Hudhud (12 October 2014) recently. Their impacts were analysed with respect to physical, biological and meteorological factors which favour or restrict a phytoplankton bloom after the passage of a storm. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer surface reflectance data were used to examine the spatio-temporal variability in total suspended sediment (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration pre-and post-cyclone. Comparative results revealed that Phailin was associated with higher rainfall, wind speed and surface runoff compared with Hudhud. These factors contributed to higher TSS concentration in all sectors of the lagoon post-Phailin compared with post-Hudhud. Extreme TSS, limited light, high rainfall and runoff and increased flushing rate post-Phailin restricted the likelihood of a phytoplankton bloom in the lagoon, a commonly reported phenomenon after the passage of a cyclone. In contrast, sufficient light availability due to lower TSS, low runoff and flushing and stable wind supported a phytoplankton bloom post-Hudhud. The observed differential impacts were linked to the individual cyclone's characteristics such as differences in landfall locations, wind speed, trajectory after the landfall, differences in rainfall rate and surface runoff and speed of passage.

Major changes in the distribution of diatom assemblages were determined by multivariate statistical analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to ordinate environmental variables of the water, showing a clear gradient along the estuary, with higher nutrient levels (total phosphorus and total nitrogen) and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations at upstream sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to determine the species-environmental relationship. Total phosphorus (TP) and DO (p < 0.001) as well as salinity and pH (p < 0.002) were the most significant variables related to diatom composition. The neritic planktonic species Thalassionema nitzschioides (Grunow) Mereschkowsky was the most widespread and abundant species in the data set, presumably also reflecting significant influence of oceanic water. Thalassiosira cedarkeyensis Prasad, a marine benthic species, was the second most abundant species and seems to be related to higher nutrient levels, particularly at upstream sites. High abundances of Cyclotella meneghiniana Kutzing and Cyclotella atomus Hustedt were also recorded upstream sites.

The Relationship Between Acute Malnutrition, Hygiene Practices, Water and Livestock, and Their Program Implications in Eastern Chad	FOOD AND NUTRITION BULLETIN												Background: The causes of acute malnutrition are complex and time and geography variant and need to be better understood in order to both design more effective nutrition programs and evaluate them. The findings reported here are part of an evaluation of a 4-year multisectoral nutrition program led by Concern Worldwide in the Sila Region of eastern Chad. Objective: To present evidence and learning about the relationships between acute malnutrition and potential drivers in Sila, Chad. Methods: Quantitative household-level data from a clustered randomized control trial were collected in November/December 2014. The survey was complemented with water quality testing and qualitative data collected in February and March 2013 and 2014. Results: Households who reported not regularly cleaning the container used for transporting water for household consumption were almost twice as likely to have a malnourished child. Households living in villages with larger concentrations of cattle and having more livestock sharing the same water source as for human consumption were significantly more likely to have a malnourished child. However, cleaning the water container mediated the negative impact of living in a village with a large cattle concentration on wasting. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that hygiene practices and livestock water management are correlated with acute malnutrition in Sila, Chad. These findings provide a hypothesis for a possible pathogen driving acute malnutrition ratesCryptosporidiumas part of a complex water chain, whereby the source of infection may be mitigated by hygiene behaviors with important implications for humanitarian programs.																	0379-5721	1564-8265				MAR	2017	38	1					115	127		10.1177/0379572116681682								WOS:000394676000010						
J	Wright-Contreras, L; March, H; Schramm, S				Wright-Contreras, Lucia; March, Hug; Schramm, Sophie			Fragmented landscapes of water supply in suburban Hanoi	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL												Facing the challenges of city planning in the frame of rapid urbanization in the Global South, this study addresses the relationship between the urban development of Hanoi, Vietnam, and water supply including users' perception of water accessibility and satisfaction of coverage, quality, and cost. Because sociospatial disparities are particularly pronounced in suburban areas, these spaces epitomize unequal water access and uneven water quality. Based on the premise that (sub)urban water flows embody and mirror development dynamics and urbanization patterns, the objective is to analyze access to water splintered within the suburban typologies of Hanoi. We analyze the current state of domestic water availability and quality throughout suburban areas and specifically between a new urban area and a periurban village in Hanoi. Through the debates of splintering urbanism and periurban water supply, this paper discusses the differences in water service provision in suburban Hanoi. At the same time, the article considers suburban areas as spaces which reflect a broader spectrum of water supply solutions. Lastly, it informs on how to alleviate the pressure of the increasing demand of water in urbanizing areas by supporting sustainable urban water cycles to improve distributional justice and social equity.

River-groundwater connectivity in a karst system, Wellington, New South Wales, Australia	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												The characterization of river-aquifer connectivity in karst environments is difficult due to the presence of conduits and caves. This work demonstrates how geophysical imaging combined with hydrogeological data can improve the conceptualization of surface-water and groundwater interactions in karst terrains. The objective of this study is to understand the association between the Bell River and karst-alluvial aquifer at Wellington, Australia. River and groundwater levels were continuously monitored, and electrical resistivity imaging and water quality surveys conducted. Two-dimensional resistivity imaging mapped the transition between the alluvium and karst. This is important for highlighting the proximity of the saturated alluvial sediments to the water-filled caves and conduits. In the unsaturated zone the resistivity imaging differentiated between air- and sediment-filled karst features, and in the saturated zone it mapped the location of possible water- and sediment-filled caves. Groundwater levels are dynamic and respond quickly to changes in the river stage, implying that there is a strong hydraulic connection, and that the river is losing and recharging the adjacent aquifer. Groundwater extractions (1,370 ML, megalitres, annually) from the alluvial aquifer can cause the groundwater level to fall by as much as 1.5 m in a year. However, when the Bell River flows after significant rainfall in the upper catchment, river-leakage rapidly recharges the alluvial and karst aquifers. This work demonstrates that in complex hydrogeological settings, the combined use of geophysical imaging, hydrograph analysis and geochemical measurements provide insights on the local karst hydrology and groundwater processes, which will enable better water-resource and karst management.

Partitioning and Transport Behavior of Pathogen Indicator Organisms at Four Cold Region Solid Waste Sites	JOURNAL OF COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING												Freshwater resources in rural Alaska communities, especially those underlain by permafrost, are particularly vulnerable to impacts from nearby waste facilities. The authors investigated the connection between rural solid waste facilities and transmission of pathogenic organisms into nearby water resources by evaluating the (1)prevalence of pathogen indicators E. coli and Enterococcus sp. proximal to cold region waste facilities, and (2)partitioning behavior of both organisms in a controlled snowmelt lysimeter test. Results reveal that E. coli and Enterococcus sp. preferentially attach to and migrate with soil particles in surface waters and are transported off-site during snowmelt runoff. Enterococcus sp. had higher and more sustained viability in cold environmental conditions than E. coli. E. coli and Enterococcus sp. were found in surface waters and soils in the concentration range of 0.7-3.5mean log most probably number (MPN)/100mLH2O. All microbial samples indicated strong site-specific variability.																	0887-381X	1943-5495				MAR	2017	31	1							04016005	10.1061/(ASCE)CR.1943-5495.0000111								WOS:000395523500001

Impacts of Road Salting on Water Quality in Fractured Crystalline Bedrock	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Many rural communities depend on bedrock wells as a primary water source, which raises the issue as to whether increasing amounts of salt application are affecting bedrock water quality and to what degree. Through wellbore profiling, this study investigated changes in specific conductance in two crystalline bedrock wells at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, CT, from 2003 to 2016, with particular emphasis on the impacts of increased salt application with a change in deicing practices at the university after 2009. Hourly specific conductance measurements were collected in 2014 to determine how water source may affect wellbore concentrations seasonally. Chloride was found to be highly persistent in the bedrock, with concentrations consistently increasing from 2003 to 2016 despite year-to-year variations in salt application. A dramatic increase in chloride occurred in the wellbores in response to the change in deicing practices, with an immediate response in fractures having a direct connection to the overburden. In light of the long-term implications of road salting on subsurface chloride contamination, this study argues that consideration be given to deicing management strategies to reduce road salt contamination.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					288	294		10.2134/jeq2016.10.0411								WOS:000397864700007	28380564

Temperature and Nitrogen Effects on Phosphorus Uptake by Agricultural Stream-Bed Sediments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Climate change will likely increase the growing season, temperatures, and ratio of nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) loss from land to water. However, it is unknown how these factors influence P concentrations in streams. We sought to evaluate differences in biotic and abiotic processes affecting stream sediment P dynamics under different temperature and N-enrichment regimes. Three sediments of varying P composition and sorption characteristics were placed into a fluvarium. Synthetic runoff water, with or without added N, was added to the flume's reservoir, and the solution was maintained at 19 or 26 degrees C. Water and sediment samples were taken with time since runoff was introduced. The rate and magnitude of P uptake by sediment was greater at 19 degrees C compared with 26 degrees C, and also when N was added compared with no N added. Analysis of sediment samples indicated that P uptake via abiotic processes was greater at 19 than at 26 degrees C. The addition of N stimulated P uptake by the microbial biomass at 19 degrees C, but microbial uptake was potentially inhibited at 26 degrees C. Because microbial biomass is a temporary store of P, these data suggest that more P may be available with increasing temperatures during the growing season, especially under baseflow, implying that strategies to mitigate P losses from land to water should be strengthened to prevent potential water quality impairment.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					295	301		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0352								WOS:000397864700008	28380551

Urea Release by Intermittently Saturated Sediments from a Coastal Agricultural Landscape	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Urea-N is linked to harmful algal blooms in lakes and estuaries, and urea-N-based fertilizers have been implicated as a source. However, the export of urea-N-based fertilizers appears unlikely, as high concentrations of urea-N are most commonly found in surface waters outside periods of fertilization. To evaluate possible autochthonous production of urea-N, we monitored urea-N released from drainage ditch sediments using mesocosms. Sediments from a cleaned (recently dredged) drainage ditch, uncleaned ditch, forested ditch, riparian wetland, and an autoclaved sand control were isolated in mesocosms and flooded for 72 h to quantify urea-N, NH4+-N, and NO3--N in the floodwater. Sediments were flooded with different N-amended solutions (distilled H2O, 1.5 mg L-1 NH4+-N, 3.0 mg L-1 NH4+-N, 2.6 mg L-1 NO3--N, or 5.1 mg L-1 NO3--N) and incubated at three water temperatures (16, 21, and 27 degrees C). Urea-N concentrations in mesocosms representing uncleaned and cleaned drainage ditches were significantly greater than nonagricultural sediments and controls. While flooding sediments with N-enriched solution had no clear effect on urea-N, warmer (27 degrees C) temperatures resulted in significantly higher urea-N. Data collected from field ditches that were flooded by a summer rainstorm showed increases in urea-N that mirrored the mesocosm experiment. We postulate that concentrations of urea-N in ditches that greatly exceed environmental thresholds are mediated by biological production in sediments and release to stagnant surface water. Storm-driven urea-N export from ditches could elevate the risk of harmful algal blooms downstream in receiving waters despite the dilution effect.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					302	310		10.2134/jeq2016.08.0304								WOS:000397864700009	28380555

Broiler Litter x Industrial By-Products Reduce Nutrients and Microbial Losses in Surface Runoff When Applied to Forages	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The inability to incorporate broiler litter (BL) into permanent hayfields and pastures leads to nutrient accumulation near the soil surface and increases the potential transport of nutrients in runoff. This study was conducted on Marietta silt loam soil to determine the effect of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum and lignite on P, N, C, and microbial concentrations in runoff. Treatments were (i) control (unfertilized) and (ii) BL at 13.4 Mg ha(-1) alone or (iii) treated with either FGD gypsum or lignite applied at 20% (w/w) (2.68 Mg ha(-1)). Rainfall simulators were used to produce a 5.6 cm h(-1) storm event sufficient in duration to cause 15 min of continuous runoff. Repeated rains were applied at 3-d intervals to determine how long FGD gypsum and lignite are effective in reducing loss of litter-derived N, P, and C from soil. Application of BL increased N, P, and C concentrations in runoff as compared to the control. Addition of FGD gypsum reduced (P < 0.05) water-soluble P and dissolved organic C concentrations in runoff by 39 and 16%, respectively, as compared to BL alone. Lignite reduced runoff total N and NH4-N concentrations by 38 and 70%, respectively, as compared to BL alone. Addition of FGD gypsum or lignite failed to significantly reduce microbial loads in runoff, although both treatments reduced microbial concentration by > 20%. Thus, BL treated with FGD and lignite can be considered as cost-effective management practices in the mitigation of P, N, and C and possibly microbial concentration in runoff.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					339	347		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0255								WOS:000397864700013	28380557

Influence of Cattle Trails on Runoff Quantity and Quality	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Cattle trails in grazed pastures close to rivers may adversely affect surface water quality of the adjacent river by directing runoff to it. The objective of this 3-yr study (2013-2015) in southern Alberta, Canada, was to determine if cattle trails significantly increased the risk of runoff and contaminants (sediment, nutrients) compared with the adjacent grazed pasture (control). A portable rainfall simulator was used to generate artificial rainfall (140 mm h(-1)) and runoff. The runoff properties measured were time to runoff and initial abstraction (infiltration), total runoff depth and average runoff rates, as well as concentrations and mass loads of sediment, N, and P fractions. Cattle trails significantly (P <= 0.10) decreased time to runoff and initial abstraction (26-32%) in the 2 yr measured and increased total runoff depth, runoff coefficients, and average runoff rates (21-51%) in 2 of 3 yr. Concentrations of sediment, N, and P fractions in runoff were not significantly greater for cattle trails than for control areas. However, mass loads of total suspended solids (57-85% increase), NH4-N (31-90%), and dissolved reactive P (DRP) (30-92%) were significantly greater because of increased runoff volumes. Overall, runoff quantity and loads of sediment, NH4-N, and DRP were greater for cattle trails compared with the adjacent grazed pasture, and hydrologic connection with cattle-access sites on the riverbank suggests that this could adversely affect water quality in the adjacent river. Extrapolation of the study results should be tempered by the specific conditions represented by this rainfall simulation study.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					348	355		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0280								WOS:000397864700014	28380576

Waterbirds in protected waters have become a nuisance, however, as nutrients from fecal deposits transported by the waterbirds have served to severely deteriorate water quality. Despite the importance of clean water resources, the microecology of small agricultural reservoirs regularly colonized by transitory waterbirds are seldom reviewed. To improve our understanding of the influence of waterbirds on small bodies of water, a microcosm study was conducted using water and sediment from an agricultural reservoir inhabited by 300 to 500 great cormorants. Temporal changes in total nitrogen, total phosphorous, chemical oxygen demand, NH4+-N, PO43--P, and chlorophyll-a concentrations, in addition to the microbial community, were evaluated for microcosms containing 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 g of feces collected from a great cormorant colony. Chemical analysis of the water microcosm revealed that all microcosms showed both immediate and prolonged increases in nutrients due to the addition of feces. Additionally, a mere 0.5 g of feces doubled the concentration of chlorophyll-a from 2.1 +/- 0.99 to 5.2 mu 1.1 mg L-1 within 1 mo. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling of the microbial community structure revealed disturbances in both water and sediment microcosms. Disturbances to the microbial community in the water microcosm were significant only when 5.0 g of feces was added; however, disturbances to sediment microbial communities were induced by a smaller mass of feces. These results confirm the short-term water quality impairment and shift in microbial community structure caused by waterbird droppings and bird colony surface runoff in an agricultural reservoir.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAR-APR	2017	46	2					470	476		10.2134/jeq2016.11.0459								WOS:000397864700029	28380549

Model calibration is thus an essential task to obtain the optimal parameter values, which match simulations with observations as closely as possible. This study used the Zenne River Basin (Belgium) as a case study, which experiences high spatial heterogeneity in terms of geological formation, groundwater recharge, and rainfall-runoff responses. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were to calibrate the SWAT model on the basis of different calibration techniques and identify which technique is suitable for such a heterogeneous basin so that the calibrated SWAT can be used as a tool for integrated management of the Zenne River Basin. Prior to calibration, the sensitive parameters were identified on the basis of a detailed sensitivity analysis (SA) of the Latin hypercube one-factor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) technique and increased sampling intervals. Then, SWAT was calibrated by using single-site calibration (SSC) at the watershed outlet; sequential calibration (SC), calibration from upstream to downstream; and simultaneous multisite calibration (SMSC), where data of two flow gauging stations were simultaneously used in a single calibration. It was found that at least 200 sampling intervals should be considered for the LH-OAT SA method to obtain converged rankings of SWAT parameters. In addition, to well capture the spatial variability of heterogeneous catchment and achieve stable sensitivity ranking, simultaneous multisite SA technique is important. Streamflow findings suggested that the SC and the SMSC techniques provided very good results and significantly improved model performance, but the SSC results were merely satisfactory. Though the results of SC and SMSC techniques were similar, the SMSC was selected over SC because it simultaneously handles the entire catchment spatial variability by assigning different parameter values and allows data information communication among stations in a single calibration. It was thus concluded that simultaneous multisite calibration should be considered for catchments with a high spatial variability like the Zenne River Basin.

Hydrologically-controlled leaching plots have often shown RBS to be effective at buffering nutrients and pesticides, but uncontrolled field studies have sometimes suggested limited effectiveness. The limited RBS effectiveness may be explained by the spatiotemporal hydrological heterogeneity near non -irrigated fields. This hypothesis was tested in conventional corn and soy fields in the St. Lawrence Lowlands of southern Quebec (Canada), where spring melt brings heavy and rapid runoff, while summer months are hot and dry. One field with a mineral soil (Saint-Roch-de-l'Achigan) and another with an organic-rich soil (Boisbriand) were equipped with passive runoff collectors, suction cup lysimeters, and piezometers placed before and after a 3 m-wide RBS, and monitored from 2011 to 2014. Soil topography of the RBS was mapped to a 1 cm vertical precision and a 50 cm sampling grid. On average, surface runoff intersects the RBS perpendicularly, but is subject to substantial local heterogeneity. Groundwater saturates the root zones, but flows little at the time of snowmelt. Groundwater flow is not consistently perpendicular to the RBS, and may reverse, flowing from stream to field under low water flow regimes with stream-aquifer connectivity, thus affecting RBS effectiveness calculations. Groundwater flow direction can be influenced by stratigraphy, local soil hydraulic properties, and historical modification of the agricultural stream beds. Understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of surface and groundwater flows is essential to correctly assess the effectiveness of RBS in intercepting agro-chemical pollution. The implicit assumption that water flows across vegetated RBS, from the field to the stream, should always be verified.

Prediction and visualization of redox conditions in the groundwater of Central Valley, California	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Regional-scale, three-dimensional continuous probability models, were constructed for aspects of redox conditions in the groundwater system of the Central Valley, California. These models yield grids depicting the probability that groundwater in a particular location will have dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations less than selected threshold values representing anoxic groundwater conditions, or will have dissolved manganese (Mn) concentrations greater than selected threshold values representing secondary drinking water-quality contaminant levels (SMCL) and health-based screening levels (HBSL). The probability models were constrained by the alluvial boundary of the Central Valley to a depth of approximately 300 m. Probability distribution grids can be extracted from the 3-D models at any desired depth, and are of interest to water-resource managers, water-quality researchers, and groundwater modelers concerned with the occurrence of natural and anthropogenic contaminants related to anoxic conditions. Models were constructed using a Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) machine learning technique that produces many trees as part of an additive model and has the ability to handle many variables, automatically incorporate interactions, and is resistant to collinearity. Machine learning methods for statistical prediction are becoming increasing popular in that they do not require assumptions associated with traditional hypothesis testing. Models were constructed using measured dissolved oxygen and manganese concentrations sampled from 2767 wells within the alluvial boundary of the Central Valley, and over 60 explanatory variables representing regional-scale soil properties, soil chemistry, land use, aquifer textures, and aquifer hydrologic properties. Models were trained on a USGS dataset of 932 wells, and evaluated on an independent hold-out dataset of 1835 wells from the California Division of Drinking Water. We used cross-validation to assess the predictive performance of models of varying complexity, as a basis for selecting final models. Trained models were applied to cross-validation testing data and a separate hold-out dataset to evaluate model predictive performance by emphasizing three model metrics of fit: Kappa; accuracy; and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC). The final trained models were used for mapping predictions at discrete depths to a depth of 304.8 m. Trained DO and Mn models had accuracies of 86-100%, Kappa values of 0.69-0.99, and ROC values of 0.92-1.0. Model accuracies for cross-validation testing datasets were 82-95% and ROC values were 0.87-0.91, indicating good predictive performance. Kappas for the cross-validation testing dataset were 0.30-0.69, indicating fair to substantial agreement between testing observations and model predictions. Hold-out data were available for the manganese model only and indicated accuracies of 89-97%, ROC values of 0.73-0.75, and Kappa values of 0.06-0.30. The predictive performance of both the DO and Mn models was reasonable, considering all three of these fit metrics and the low percentages of low-DO and high-Mn events in the data.

Acceptance of Mobile Technology for Citizen Science in Water Resource Management	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												Dutch water management is considered highly efficient, but it faces a lack of public awareness and other certain physical challenges. One proposed strategy to deal with these challenges includes increasing citizen participation and citizen science using mobile devices in particular. Such mobile crowd sensing (MCS) can be used to enhance canal operations and model predictive control (MPC) by nonexperts. The data collector often pushes implementations, and little knowledge and experience from the field of product design is used. This can lead to underperformance both with regards to the technology and the volunteer citizens. This study uses an adapted Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM3) to survey Dutch citizens' intentions while operating a mock-up smartphone application to identify key drivers of their acceptance in an early design phase. Included among the important drivers of citizens' behavioral intentions (BI) are usefulness, relevance to the task, and the demonstrability of benefits. These insights can possibly unveil validated design criteria for future MCS applications. Such validated criteria can not only prevent the underperformance of citizen science from a volunteer point of view, but it can also affect the performance of the MCS as well.																	0733-9437	1943-4774				MAR	2017	143	3			SI				B6016001	10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0001043								WOS:000395516600003

Bioremediation and biocontrol of commercial probiotic in marine shrimp culture with biofloc	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The use of probiotics within shrimp farms has increased as an alternative to antibiotic use because of an increasing demand for more environment- friendly aquaculture. This has improved growth performance and health of shrimp, and improved pathogen control as well as water and soil quality in culture systems. However, efficacy of probiotics in intensive systems using biofloc remains uncertain. Here, bioremediation and biocontrol of a commercial probiotic was investigated through analysis of water quality and main bacterial groups that influence a Litopenaeus vannamei culture using biofloc. Furthermore, additional knowledge was gained on phytoplankton and shrimp performance. Treatments consisted of four different probiotic concentrations (Bacillus subtilis and B. licheniformis): 0.5 g m(-3) (P0.5), 1 g m(-3) (P1.0), 2 g m(-3) (P2.0), 3 g m(-3) (P3.0), and a control without probiotic (CTL). All variables were shown to be balanced and within the recommended limits for shrimp farming. Under the culture conditions adopted in this study, the commercial probiotic did not result in a significant effect (P >= 0.05) on water quality, bacteria, phytoplankton, or shrimp performance. Bacteria naturally present in biofloc were sufficient for maintaining the balance of culture and continued to exert excellent bioremediation and biocontrol when management was conducted properly.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				MAR	2017	45	1					167	176		10.3856/vol45-issue1-fulltext-16								WOS:000398127700016

Monthly measurements of oyster height were taken on 30 oysters randomly collected from each study site. Only oysters raised at Punta Pargo and Enfermeria reached the mean commercial size (> 40 mm) within the study period; these oysters were significantly larger than oysters raised at Canete and Jorobado. No significant differences in survival between the sites were observed. Punta Pargo and Enfermeria showed the best potential for oyster farming in the Bahia de Sagua area. Despite human impact on runoff caused by damming of the adjacent river, water quality remains acceptable for oyster cultivation. With proper stock management and production of selected fast-growing oysters in hatcheries, oyster farming can become an important aquaculture industry in Cuba.																	0718-560X	0717-7178				MAR	2017	45	1					218	222		10.3856/vol45-issue1-fulltext-24								WOS:000398127700024						
J	Perez-Santos, I				Perez-Santos, Ivan			Deep ventilation event during fall and winter 2015 in the Puyuhuapi Fjord (44.6 degrees S)	LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC RESEARCH												The Puyuhuapi Fjord has previously been reported as one of the hypoxic fjords in Patagonia (dissolved oxygen -DO below 2 mL L-1). Hydrographic sampling between 1995-2015 confirmed hypoxia below 100 m depth, down to the bottom (250 m). A line of sensors at an oceanographic mooring in Puyuhuapi were deployed to continuously record the temporal-vertical behaviour of water column temperature and salinity from the surface down to. 120 m, from February to July 2015. A Multi-parameter water quality sonde was deployed at the bottom of the line, with a DO optical sensor. From February to mid-May, hypoxia was sustained (1.4-1.6 mL L-1). However, from May until the end of June, DO values increased (2.8 mL L-1), exceeding the hypoxia threshold. This was the first event of deep ventilation reported in a Patagonian fjord. During this time period, deep water temperatures increased by similar to 1.3 degrees C, coinciding with the decreased in salinity from 33.6 to 32.8. The main cause of this event was attributed to the arrival of a new volume of mixed oceanic water into the Fjord, transported by Modified Subantartic Water, with warm temperatures and slightly higher DO values, given its origin in the surface layer of the outer region of the Patagonian fjords and channels.

Here, we examined the impact of the Geum River estuary barrage, completed in 1990, on fish assemblages by using a literature search and fresh surveys of fishways in the barrage. We found that fish assemblages upstream and downstream of the barrage were altered following its completion. After construction, more species were found in the freshwater area, with a particularly great increase in freshwater species. Conversely, estuarine and marine species were only consistently caught in the downstream salt-water area, although the number of species increased. In total, 15,829 fish from 47 species and 20 families were identified at the three types (pool and weir, rubble type, and boat passage) of fishways in the barrage. The dominant species were Chelon haematocheilus, an estuarine species, Coilia nasus, a diadromous species, and Erythroculter erythropterus, a freshwater species. The mean total length of fish (101.9 +/- 76.0 mm) in the boat passage fishway was approximately 100 mm lesser than those in the pool and weir (207.2 +/- 112.8 mm) and rubble type (205.8 +/- 112.7 mm) fishways. The boat passage fishway was the most efficient for fish movements. The current fishway system is not sufficient for fish migration, and thus additional ways are required to improve the system such as the boat passage. Few estuarine or diadromous species were found in both freshwater and salt-water areas, but freshwater fishes that accidently moved to salt-water area actively used fishways. Therefore, fishway management in the Geum River estuary barrage has to focus on freshwater fish; however, this may need to change to a focus on migratory fishes depending on ecological life cycles of migratory fish.																	1738-5261	2005-7172				MAR	2017	52	1					147	164		10.1007/s12601-017-0015-6								WOS:000397134300013

First record of Prestauroneis tumida Levkov and accompanying species in Poland	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The paper presents morphological and ecological characteristics of Prestauroneis tumida Levkov recorded for the first time in Poland. The diatom Prestauroneis tumida Levkov was found in the microbenthos of the Czarna Staszowska River (left tributary of the Vistula River, south-eastern Poland). This diatom species was present in the upper section of the river (sampling sites: 1-Drogowle, 2-Rakow) where saprobic state varied from oligosaprobic to beta-mesosaprobic. Dimensions of the valve were as follows: length 30-44 mu m, width 8-11 mu m and 13-16 striae in 10 mu m. Our research updates the morphological diversity data such as measurements of valves in terms of width and the number of striae. The accompanying species of Prestauroneis tumida belonged to the group of good water quality indicators, from oligo-to mesosaprobic ones. Some of the identified species were indicators of alkaline, calcium-rich waters.

We assess the current understanding of the costs and benefits of organic agriculture across multiple production, environmental, producer, and consumer dimensions. Organic agriculture shows many potential benefits (including higher biodiversity and improved soil and water quality per unit area, enhanced profitability, and higher nutritional value) as well as many potential costs including lower yields and higher consumer prices. However, numerous important dimensions have high uncertainty, particularly the environmental performance when controlling for lower organic yields, but also yield stability, soil erosion, water use, and labor conditions. We identify conditions that influence the relative performance of organic systems, highlighting areas for increased research and policy support.

Comparing Two Multi-Criteria Methods for Prioritizing Wetland Restoration and Creation Sites Based on Ecological, Biophysical and Socio-Economic Factors	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Wetland restoration has been recognized as a useful tool for improving water quality. Many studies have focused on developing strategies and models to optimize wetland performance. However, some important wetland placement characteristics have not been taken into account. In this research and unlike other studies, we included the social aspect (availability of public lands) as a fundamental factor to locate wetlands. Thus, environmental, biophysical and socio-economic factors were integrated through the comparison of two multi-criteria methods (a suitability model and a greedy algorithm). With nitrate removal as the main goal, the suitability model was applied considering the ''terrain slope'', ''proximity to watercourses'' and ''soil permeability''. The greedy algorithm was executed based on the ''availability of public lands'' and the ''wetland restoration project costs''. These factors were chosen based on the Eu Life-CREAMAgua Flumen River project, which was carried out previously in the study area. Both the suitability model and the greedy algorithm provided critical information for siting a wetland and demonstrated the effectiveness of both approaches. By means of this study, we present highly applicable results as they are based on a real project (Eu Life-CREAMAgua Flumen River project), besides proposing and using the social factor as an innovative approach for the wetlands siting. This research and its possible adaptations can be used by decision makers to improve water quality using social and economic criteria, resulting in the efficient implementation of ecological-restoration projects.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2017	31	4					1227	1241		10.1007/s11269-017-1572-2								WOS:000397923700009

In order to improve water quality in downstream waterbodies, the Manitoba government is currently investigating the relationship between hydrological standard of agricultural drainage network and nutrient retention in the drainage systems. Briefly, oversized drains have more capacity to transport nutrients, which can increase nutrient loading to downstream waterbodies, especially during rainfall events. Currently, the hydrological standards of agricultural drainage design in Manitoba were mainly developed according to cost-benefit analysis without considering nutrient retention. The purpose of this study was to use computer modelling techniques to simulate the impact of drain size (based on different hydrological standards) on nutrient retention within an agricultural drainage network. The site chosen was the Tobacco Creek Watershed, an agricultural area which drains into the Red River, and thence into Lake Winnipeg. Suspended sediment, nutrient and flow data, from several locations along the Brown drain within this watershed, were used to calibrate a water quality model. Scenarios were then simulated with the model to estimate how different drain sizes affect nutrient transport and retention. Sampling took place during the spring and summer of 2013 starting with freshet and ending when the drains dried up near mid-summer. Study results indicated that the amount of nutrients transported was generally greater during freshet and summer rain storms. Occasionally, however, nutrients in summer discharge exceeded those transported during freshet. The water quality model was applied to the Brown drain to investigate the effects of different drain sizes for rainfall amounts under 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 year return periods. Generally the results indicate that as the return periods became larger (in larger channels) lower nutrients concentrations were predicted downstream (higher decay rates). On average, the model predicted a 15%-20% decline in nutrient concentration with a 20-year return channel design compared to a 2-year return. The research from this study may provide an impetus to the policy-making process of drainage design.

J	Buyukyildiz, M; Kumcu, SY				Buyukyildiz, Meral; Kumcu, Serife Yurdagul			An Estimation of the Suspended Sediment Load Using Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural Network Models	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Sediment transport in streams and rivers takes two forms as suspended load and bed load. Suspended load comprises sand + silt + clay-sized particles that are held in suspension due to the turbulence and will only settle when the stream velocity decreases, such as when the streambed becomes flatter, or the streamflow into a pond or lake. The sources of the suspended sediments are the sediments transported from the river basin by runoff or wind and the eroded sediments of the river bed and banks. Suspended-sediment load is a key indicator for assessing the effect of land use changes, water quality studies and engineering practices in watercourses. Measuring suspended sediment in streams is real sampling and the collection process is both complex and expensive. In recent years, artificial intelligence methods have been used as a predictor for hydrological phenomenon namely to estimate the amount of suspended sediment. In this paper the abilities of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) models among the artificial intelligence methods have been investigated to estimate the suspended sediment load (SSL) in Ispir Bridge gauging station on Coruh River (station number: 2316). Coruh River is located in the northern east part of Turkey and it is one of the world"s the fastest, the deepest and the largest rivers of the Coruh Basin. In this study, in order to estimate the suspended sediment load, different combinations of the streamflow and the SSL were used as the model inputs. Its results accuracy was compared with the results of conventional correlation coefficient analysis between input and output variables and the best combination was identified. Finally, in order to predict SSL, the SVM, ANFIS and various ANNs models were used. The reliability of SVM, ANFIS and ANN models were determined based on performance criteria such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Efficiency Coefficient (EC) and Determination Coefficient (R-2).																	0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2017	31	4					1343	1359		10.1007/s11269-017-1581-1								WOS:000397923700016

The problem to be solved consists of determining the infrastructure that should be built and/or rehabilitated at a specific time. This decision should be taken in a long-term planning perspective. It should consider how the operation will be performed to satisfy demand and water quality requirements by using multiple sources with different water quality at the source, take into account the temporal and spatial distribution of the water resources available and remain aware of the environmental impacts. In addition, decision processes which do not appropriately consider inherent uncertainties (e.g., hydrological, demographic, and technological uncertainties) can lead to suboptimal solutions. Here, uncertainty is handled using scenario planning with the aim of finding expansion solutions that can be expected to perform well under a set of possible future situations (or scenarios). The solution method combines simulated annealing with nonlinear programming to determine the solution to the nested optimization problem.

In this paper, a water bloom precursor analysis method, based on two direction singular rough set, was proposed. This approach was produced on the basis of the different sections and pre-water bloom of water bloom precursor anomalies and characteristic of elements transferred in singular rough set. For testing the validity of two direction singular rough set application in water bloom precursor analysis, Xiangxi River, which is one of the typical tributaries of Three Gorges Reservoir in China, was selected as study area. The result showed that compared with other indexes, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) are the most valuable indicators of water bloom in the precursory anomalies. Furthermore, regarding with water bloom precursory anomalies in Xiangxi River, most of the nutrient loading and biological community are the key indicators. Hence, this method can determine the main precursory anomaly for water bloom in the study area, which provides powerful knowledge support to water quality specialists for them to comprehensively analyze precursory anomaly so as to find out its relationship with occurrence law of water bloom.					, Huyong/0000-0002-2800-4930												0920-4741	1573-1650				MAR	2017	31	5					1435	1456		10.1007/s11269-017-1579-8								WOS:000398042800002

Ensemble Decision Tree Models Using RUSBoost for Estimating Risk of Iron Failure in Drinking Water Distribution Systems	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Safe, trusted drinking water is fundamental to society. Discolouration is a key aesthetic indicator visible to customers. Investigations to understand discolouration and iron failures in water supply systems require assessment of large quantities of disparate, inconsistent, multidimensional data from multiple corporate systems. A comprehensive data matrix was assembled for a seven year period across the whole of a UK water company (serving three million people). From this a novel data driven tool for assessment of iron risk was developed based on a yearly update and ranking procedure, for a subset of the best quality data. To avoid a 'black box' output, and provide an element of explanatory (human readable) interpretation, classification decision trees were utilised. Due to the very limited number of iron failures, results from many weak learners were melded into one high-quality ensemble predictor using the RUSBoost algorithm which is designed for class imbalance. Results, exploring simplicity vs predictive power, indicate enough discrimination between variable relationships in the matrix to produce ensemble decision tree classification models with good accuracy for iron failure estimation at District Management Area (DMA) scale. Two model variants were explored: 'Nowcast' (situation at end of calendar year) and 'Futurecast' (predict end of next year situation from this year's data). The Nowcast 2014 model achieved 100% True Positive Rate (TPR) and 95.3% True Negative Rate (TNR), with 3.3% of DMAs classified High Risk for un-sampled instances. The Futurecast 2014 achieved 60.5% TPR and 75.9% TNR, with 25.7% of DMAs classified High Risk for un-sampled instances. The output can be used to focus preventive measures to improve iron compliance.

The Use of NARX Neural Networks to Forecast Daily Groundwater Levels	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												The lack of information to manage groundwater for irrigation is one of the biggest concerns for farmers and stakeholders in agricultural areas of Mississippi. In this study, we present a novel implementation of a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) network to simulate daily groundwater levels at a local scale in the Mississippi River Valley Alluvial (MRVA) aquifer, located in the southeastern United States. The NARX network was trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Bayesian Regularization (BR) algorithms, and the results were compared to identify an optimal architecture for the forecasting of daily groundwater levels over time. The training algorithms were implemented using different hidden node combinations and delays (5, 25, 50, 75, and 100) until the optimal network was found. Eight years of daily historical input time series including precipitation and groundwater levels were used to forecast groundwater levels up to three months ahead. The comparison between LM and BR showed that NARX-BR is superior in forecasting daily levels based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency. The results showed that BR with two hidden nodes and 100 time delays provided the most accurate prediction of groundwater levels with an error of +/- 0.00119 m. This innovative study is the first of its kind and will provide significant contributions for the implementation of data-based models (DBMs) in the prediction and management of groundwater for agricultural use.

ENDOGENOUS RISK AND POINT-NONPOINT UNCERTAINTY TRADING RATIOS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS												Point-nonpoint trading enables highly uncertain nonpoint pollution abatement to be substituted for relatively certain point source pollution abatement. Market designers use uncertainty trade ratios to address imperfect substitution between these commodities. Guidance from government agencies and other entities recommends large ratios that penalize trades for nonpoint abatement, and extant programs universally implement this guidance. Previous research has shown that the standard guidance is based on an inappropriate framing of the risk effects of substituting nonpoint for point source pollution abatement, and has demonstrated that the trade ratios should be set to encourage or discourage substitution, depending on whether the substitution is risk-reducing or risk-increasing. However, the Pigouvian pricing approach used to develop this result obscures the underlying economic calculus because it does not recognize or characterize the tradeoffs between abatement costs savings and environmental risk that must be considered in an economic evaluation of alternative ratios, and that would be key to explaining why ratios recommended by economic analysis would be preferred to received wisdom. We develop a new approach that explicitly identifies and characterizes the tradeoffs associated with the choice of ratio. The approach is examined both in first-best settings where trade ratios and initial permit allocations are jointly determined, and in second-best settings where permit allocations are taken as given. We provide a numerical analysis of trading in the Susquehanna River Basin in Pennsylvania to illustrate theory. We find theoretical and numerical support suggesting that smaller ratios may be optimal.																	0002-9092	1467-8276				MAR	2017	99	2					427	446		10.1093/ajae/aaw088								WOS:000398036400007

Silt is the main soil component of it. The Nile is one of the international rivers; it passes through ten countries in Africa and is divided into two branches, Rosetta and Damietta at the end of the River. A hydrochemical facies study of the Rosetta branch was done. The geochemical processes which control the water quality and its suitability for drinking, fishing, and irrigation purposes were evaluated. Thus, the hydro-environmental status is studied. Fifteen water samples were collected for determining the physical and chemical parameters. The results show that several parameters are above the desired limits. High concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity, total alkalinity, ammonia (NH3), electrical conductivity (EC), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chloride (Cl-), and sulfate (SO42-) were found. While a reduction in dissolved oxygen (DO) in the drains, especially Tala and El Rahawy drains, were noticed. In addition, residual sodium carbonate (RSC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), sodium percent (Na %), and magnesium hazard (MH) were measured. The results show that the salinity values for the selected samples minimized their utilization for irrigation. The results indicate that the main geochemical process in the study area is cation exchange and evaporation which control the main ion distribution.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				MAR	2017	10	5							97	10.1007/s12517-017-2870-y								WOS:000396886700002

Weather whiplash in agricultural regions drives deterioration of water quality	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Excess nitrogen (N) impairs inland water quality and creates hypoxia in coastal ecosystems. Agriculture is the primary source of N; agricultural management and hydrology together control aquatic ecosystem N loading. Future N loading will be determined by how agriculture and hydrology intersect with climate change, yet the interactions between changing climate and water quality remain poorly understood. Here, we show that changing precipitation patterns, resulting from climate change, interact with agricultural land use to deteriorate water quality. We focus on the 2012-2013 Midwestern U.S. drought as a "natural experiment''. The transition from drought conditions in 2012 to a wet spring in 2013 was abrupt; the media dubbed this "weather whiplash''. We use recent (2010-2015) and historical data (1950-2015) to connect weather whiplash (drought-to-flood transitions) to increases in riverine N loads and concentrations. The drought likely created highly N-enriched soils; this excess N mobilized during heavy spring rains (2013), resulting in a 34% increase (10.5 vs. 7.8 mg N L-1) in the flow-weighted mean annual nitrate concentration compared to recent years. Furthermore, we show that climate change will likely intensify weather whiplash. Increased weather whiplash will, in part, increase the frequency of riverine N exceeding E.P.A. drinking water standards. Thus, our observations suggest increased climatic variation will amplify negative trends in water quality in a region already grappling with severe impairments.

Eight heavy metals including chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg) were determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). Among the tested heavy metals, Cd and Hg were detected in all surface water samples. The concentrations of Cr, Cd, Ni, and Pb were relatively lower than those of other metals in the four lakes. Results of Kohonen self-organizing map indicated that all the sampling sites in four lakes of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya could be classified into three different groups based on the heavy metal pollution. Lake Naivasha and Nakuru had characteristics of low concentrations of Cr, Ni, Cu, As, and Hg. Lake Bogoria was characterized by high levels of Ni, Cu, Cd, and Hg, and low levels of Pb, Cr, Zn, and As. Lake Elementaita showed characteristics of high concentrations of As and Hg and low concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cu, and Cd. Source identification using principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that anthropogenic factor played an increasingly important role in the heavy metal pollution of four lakes of the Great Rift Valley in Kenya, East Africa. Analysis of non-carcinogenic health risks of heavy metals indicated Hg and As in Lake Elementaita and Hg in Lake Bogoria may pose adverse health effects to local residents via ingestion route.

Comparing the response of a catchment-lake model chain to climate predictions	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We constructed a model chain into which regional climate-related variables (air temperature, precipitation) and a lake's main tributary hydrological indicators (river flow, dissolved inorganic carbon) were employed for predicting the evolution of planktonic blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) and zooplankton (rotifer) biomass in that lake for the mid-21st century. Simulations were based on the future climate predicted under both the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios which, combined with three realistic policy-making and basin land-use evolution lead to six scenarios for future water quality. Model outputs revealed that mean annual river flow is expected to decline between 3 and 20%, depending on the scenario. Concentration of river dissolved inorganic carbon is predicted to follow the opposite trend and might soar up to twice the 2005-2014 average concentration. Lake planktonic primary producers will display quantitative changes in the future decades whereas zooplankters will not. A 2 to 10% increase in mean cyanobacteria biomass is accompanied by a stagnation (-3 to +2%) of rotifer biomass. Changes in cyanobacteria and rotifer phenology are expected: a surge of cyanobacteria biomass in winter and a shortening of the rotifer biomass spring peak. The expected quantitative changes on the biota were magnified in those scenarios where forested area conversions to cropland and water abstraction were the greatest.

Forty-eight surfers enrolled in the study and completed an initial health background survey and weekly health surveys online using Survey Monkey. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation, a regression technique, were used to identify longitudinal and correlated results. The surfers were predominately Caucasian, male, and physically active. They surfed approximately 4 h a week. Their average age was 34 years. The data indicated that the surfers were generally "healthy,'' with a low prevalence of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension. Their most common health problems were allergies and asthma. During the study, 10% of the surfers reported gastrointestinal symptoms and 29% reported upper respiratory symptoms. This study suggests surfers were significantly more likely to report upper respiratory symptoms when they had a history of allergies, housemates with upper respiratory symptoms, and/or a history of previous adverse health symptoms while surfing during a "red tide'' (an event often associated with the presence of phytoplankton toxins). Additionally, female surfers reported upper respiratory symptoms more than males.

Samples were collected in fluviometric station at Turcato basin (19.5 km(2)), located in the South region of Brazil. The collected material underwent screening and pipetting processes for fractionation in sand and silt grain size. For each diameter were separated fractions with different sediment concentration ranging between 0.01 and 5.00 g.L-1. The results demonstrate great influence of CSS and particle size on turbidity readings. The increase in turbidity is opposite to particle size and directly related to CSS. Variations in turbidity, expressed in CSS function (sensor sensitivity), are higher for smaller diameters, reaching almost constant values for sand particles. Turbidity readings of the three sensors showed no significant difference in the level of 5% by the Mann-Whitney rank sum test. For a given CSS, the turbidity reading may be different, depending on the granulometric class analyzed. Turbidity recorded by the sensor to the silt-class is equivalent to a sensor response observed for a CSS ten times lower for the sand class.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					213	219		10.1590/S1413-41522016144228								WOS:000397875300001

The physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the water at points upstream and downstream of each water body were evaluated, comparing the results with the CONAMA Resolution 357/2005 and the water quality index (WQI). In the period from May to August 2012, monthly samples of the following physical and chemical parameters of water were made: temperature, turbidity, pH, total solids, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and fecal coliforms. The results showed significant differences in the parameters between upstream and downstream points, only for the parameters total solids and turbidity, especially for the Precua creek. The principal component analysis revealed a moderate correlation between the parameters. The data indicated that water from most of the points can be classified in the class 3, followed by the class 2 of the CONAMA Resolution 357/2005. The WQI showed slight spatial and temporal differences between the water bodies investigated: Rabo de Porco creek registered the best WQI, while the worst one occurred in sampling at the downstream Precua point in May. The information registered will be used as a basis for changes evaluation in characteristics and quality of water bodies studied during the deployment and operation of the enterprise.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					251	259		10.1590/S1413-41522016131212								WOS:000397875300004

Thus, this work aimed at studying the formation and distribution of phytoplankton in stretches of the Piranhas-Acu River Basin, in the semiarid region of Northeastern Brazil, from 2010 to 2011, with 13 sampling points in river and reservoirs. We identified 81 infrageneric taxa, distributed into 9 classes: Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Coscinodiscophyceae, Zygnematophyceae, Mediophyceae, and Klebsormidiophyceae. The Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta divisions were the most representative, with 30 (37%) and 24 (30%) taxa, respectively. However, the cyanobacteria were more seen throughout the study period. In some sampling points, they had limits above 20.000 cells/mL, requiring weekly monitoring as provided by Decree 2914 from December 12, 2011, of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The species with high abundance are those producing toxins, represented by Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, Pseudanabaena limnetic, Microcystis sp. Dolichospermum sp., and Oscillatoria sp. The data indicate a potential health risk to the population served by these waters.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					261	269		10.1590/S1413-41522016146707								WOS:000397875300005

Thus, the European Union published the Directive 2007/60/CE to mitigate costs related with this phenomenon and to impose limits on the concentration of pollutants in pluvial water. The purpose of this study was to present the modelling of drainage systems in flood situations, based on the software of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), in which the study case is to analyze a unitary urban drainage system of Zona Central catchment in Coimbra, Portugal. By using the Automatic Overland Flow Delineation (AOFD) methodology for the generation of a superficial drainage network and implementing it in the SWMM, it was obtained a dual drainage model that allows the flow analysis in flood conditions, including flow control between the surface and collectors network and also modeling of water quality at the surface. This model allows quantifying the pollution load at the surface, relatively to the parameter of total suspended solids, for any extreme rainfall event.

Analysis of the quality of water intended for recreation as well as being an important action in terms of public health, is also justified in view of the importance of tourism in Ubatuba, having also great importance to environmental planning. In modeling, the modules Delft3D system were used. In the water quality module, the pollutants dispersal mechanisms were studied, from the association of pollution data with the results of the hydrodynamic module, in two bays in Ubatuba: Flamengo and Palmas. The results allow us to state that the system of currents, determined by the geomorphology of the area, does not provide high capacity for dilution and dispersion of effluents in the study area. However, the marine circulation and the processes involved in the decay of bacteria are enough to spread and reduce their concentrations along the bays. It was concluded that environmental modeling reproduced satisfactorily the processes involved in the transport and diffusion of microbiological indicators, contributing to the studies on the effects of human activities on the coastal system of Ubatuba.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					403	414		10.1590/S1413-41522016158594								WOS:000397875300021

Flow-directed PCA for monitoring networks	ENVIRONMETRICS												Measurements recorded over monitoring networks often possess spatial and temporal correlation inducing redundancies in the information provided. For river water quality monitoring in particular, flow-connected sites may likely provide similar information. This paper proposes a novel approach to principal components analysis to investigate reducing dimensionality for spatiotemporal flow-connected network data in order to identify common spatiotemporal patterns. The method is illustrated using monthly observations of total oxidized nitrogen for the Trent catchment area in England. Common patterns are revealed that are hidden when the river network structure and temporal correlation are not accounted for. Such patterns provide valuable information for the design of future sampling strategies.																	1180-4009	1099-095X				MAR	2017	28	2							e2434	10.1002/env.2434								WOS:000397270000001	28344443

However, existing LC products, derived primarily from satellite spectral imagery, each have different temporal and spatial resolutions and different LC classes. Most effort is focused on either fusing a pair of LC products over a small space-time region or on interpolating missing values in an individual LC product. Here, we review the complexities of LC identification and propose a method for fusing multiple existing LC products to produce a single LC record for a large spatial-temporal grid, referred to as spatio-temporal categorical map fusion. We first reconcile the LC classes of different LC products and then present a probabilistic weighted nearest neighbor estimator of LC class. This estimator depends on three unknown parameters that are estimated using numerical optimization to maximize an agreement criterion that we define. We illustrate the method using six LC products over the Rocky Mountains and show the improvement gained by supplying the optimization with data-driven information describing the spatial-temporal behavior of each LC class. Given the massive size of the LC products, we show how the optimal parameters for a given year are often optimal for other years, leading to shorter computing times.																	1180-4009	1099-095X				MAR	2017	28	2							e2429	10.1002/env.2429								WOS:000397270000004						
J	Sievers, M; Hale, R; Morrongiello, JR				Sievers, Michael; Hale, Robin; Morrongiello, John R.			Do trout respond to riparian change? A meta-analysis with implications for restoration and management	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in riparian zones. 2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead), fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified where and with which species current research is being undertaken and examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location, focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to changes in riparian zones. 3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific trout responses to eight key 'drivers' of change in riparian condition. 4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and +66.6% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation (-67.4 and -88.2% respectively). We found some evidence that positive riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e. individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on the 'production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial. 5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically, socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish species.

Understanding spatial and environmental drivers of undisturbed stream assemblages is important for separating natural and human-induced changes, but has rarely been attempted for an entire tropical bioregion. 2. We sampled riffle macroinvertebrate assemblages and measured associated biophysical variables in post-wet and dry seasons from 68 streams of orders 1-5 across the Australian Wet Tropics, a small bioregion (18 497 km 2) defined by its warm moist climate and closed-forest vegetation. 3. As climate and landscape were relatively uniform across the bioregion, we predicted that assemblages would be similar, with turnover (beta diversity) unrelated to distance, and with composition determined mainly by habitat. 4. We identified 93 higher taxa. Density and richness of macroinvertebrates were greatest in the dry season because of habitat contraction and minimal flow disturbance. Richness was greatest in higher order streams. 5. Relative abundance and richness of functional groups showed minor effects of catchment, lithology and stream order, and a positive relationship with altitude for richness of collectors, predators and shredders, and for abundance of shredders. 6. Distance-based linear modelling showed that among-assemblage differences were explained by landscape-scale variables (9.5% of the variation), stream size (13.0%), riparian characteristics (9.6%), water quality (4.6%), substratum (21.1%) and organic resources (22.4%); for models of individual taxa and functional groups, habitat and organic-resource variables also predominated. 7. Similarities among site assemblages differed little among catchments and there was no relationship between pairwise similarities of catchments and their geographical distances. Nestedness analysis confirmed that samples and catchment groupings were nested subsets of the total set of samples. 8. Across the Australian Wet Tropics, uniformity of assemblages (identified to family or above) conformed to the bioregional classification, probably as a result of the great age of the region. The habitat variables that most influenced macroinvertebrate assemblages support the idea that a suite of biophysical influences is common to stream macroinvertebrate assemblages globally.

This study attempts to model a small-scale BIOECODS using InfoWorks SD. New modelling techniques are used to fully integrate the surface and on-line subsurface conveyance system, in which overland flow routing is described by a storm water management model that uses a nonlinear reservoir method and the kinematic wave approximation of the St Venant equation, and subsurface flow is described by the Horton method in conjunction with the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number (CN) method. The observed water levels at primary outlets are compared with those obtained from model simulation. The modelling approach has been proven successful as the hydrographs (predicted and observed) match each other closely, with a mean error in the range of 4.58-7.32%. Results from the model showed that the BIOECODS is able to attenuate peak flow by 60-75%, and increase the lag time by 20min within an area of <28300m(2) when compared with a traditional drainage system.

Based on measurements at 46 sampling points in the study's coastal area in May, August, and October 2011, the seasonal and spatial characteristics of the chemical indicators and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) were analyzed. The chemical indicators for pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and reactive silicate (SiO3-Si) showed higher concentrations in the summer than in the spring and fall, whereas the nutrients of reactive phosphate (PO4-P) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) presented complex seasonal characteristics under the combined influence of abundant nutrients from rivers and nutrient consumption by large algal bloom in August. Subsequently, two methods a fuzzy, integrated assessment and an organic pollution index were used to characterize the organic pollution. The trophic status of most coastal waters were oligotrophic and mesotrophic, and most coastal waters were clean in spring and summer, except in the vicinity of the harbor and estuaries, where the organic pollution index was generally high. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficients of various variables were analyzed, which demonstrated that, commonly, there was a significant positive correlation between COD and Chl-a. Because algal blooms in August changed the nutrients structure of the coastal waters, Chl-a, in a remarkably high concentration, had significant correlation with NO2-N, the atomic N/P ratio, and the atomic N/Si ratio. The algal bloom aggravated the current P limitation, and the atomic N/P ratio, the PO4-P concentration, and the COD can be selected as the three most-sensitive indicators of algal bloom in Qinhuangdao coastal water. These findings have provided scientific supports for local authorities who are taking measures to control pollution emissions and to prevent the recurrence of algal blooms.

Conventional treatment processes such as neutralization, clariflocculation, and biological processes are used to clean the effluent before feeding to the PAC and UF combined RO system. The efficiency of the combined system was evaluated using the chemical oxygen demand Mn (CODMn), color, pH, turbidity, total nitrogen, total phosphate, and conductivity. The PAC was effective in greatly reducing the CODMn and color. The turbidity and silt density index of the UF permeate satisfied the water quality indices required for the RO feed. The RO system was constantly maintained at approximately 75% RO recovery, and the RO permeate satisfied the water quality requirements for reusing the processed water. Therefore, the PAC-UF combined RO system can be used to process effluent discharged from tannery wastewater treatment plants for reuse.																	2220-1319					MAR	2017	7	1					97	102		10.2166/wrd.2016.001								WOS:000398026700011

A rare Uroglena bloom in Beaver Lake, Arkansas, spring 2015. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:8-13.A combination of factors triggered a Uroglena volvox bloom and taste and odor event in Beaver Lake, a water-supply reservoir in northwest Arkansas, in late April 2015. Factors contributing to the bloom included increased rainfall and runoff containing increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, followed by a stable pool, low nutrient concentrations, and an expansion of lake surface area and littoral zone. This was the first time U. volvox was identified in Beaver Lake and the first time it was recognized as a source of taste and odor. Routine water quality samples happened to be collected by the US Geological Survey and the Beaver Water District throughout the reservoir during the bloom. Higher than normal rainfall in March 2015 increased the pool elevation in Beaver Lake by 2.3m (by early April), increased the surface area by 10%, and increased the littoral zone by 1214 ha; these conditions persisted for 38days, resulting from flood water being retained behind the dam. Monitoring programs that cover a wide range of reservoir features, including dissolved organic carbon, zooplankton, and phytoplankton, are valuable in explaining unusual events such as this Uroglena bloom.																	1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					8	13		10.1080/10402381.2016.1238427								WOS:000396042900002

There have been numerous attempts to create models that predict cyanobacteria and their secondary metabolites, most using linear models; however, linear models are limited by assumptions about the data and have had limited success as predictive tools. Thus, lake and reservoir managers need improved modeling techniques that can accurately predict large bloom events that have the highest impact on recreational activities and drinking-water treatment processes. In this study, we compared 12 unique linear and nonlinear regression modeling techniques to predict cyanobacterial abundance and the cyanobacterial secondary metabolites microcystin and geosmin using 14years of physiochemical water quality data collected from Cheney Reservoir, Kansas. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), boosted tree (BT), and Cubist modeling techniques were the most predictive of the compared modeling approaches. SVM, RF, and BT modeling techniques were able to successfully predict cyanobacterial abundance, microcystin, and geosmin concentrations <60,000 cells/mL, 2.5 mu g/L, and 20ng/L, respectively. Only Cubist modeling predicted maxima concentrations of cyanobacteria and geosmin; no modeling technique was able to predict maxima microcystin concentrations. Because maxima concentrations are a primary concern for lake and reservoir managers, Cubist modeling may help predict the largest and most noxious concentrations of cyanobacteria and their secondary metabolites.																	1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					32	48		10.1080/10402381.2016.1263694								WOS:000396042900005

Seventeen years of grass carp: an examination of vegetation management and collateral impacts in Ball Pond, New Fairfield, Connecticut. Lake Reserve Manage. 33:84-100.Ball Pond is a 32ha meso-eutrophic lake located in the Marble Valley of Connecticut. The local bedrock geology and watershed influences have resulted in a hardwater system with limited plant community diversity and an assemblage dominated by the nonnative species Myriophyllum spicatum. By 1996, M. spicatum dominated 32% of the waterbody, and residents were concerned their property values would fall as the recreational value of the lake diminished. In an attempt to remedy this issue, 400 grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella; approximate to 30cm length) were released in 1997 at a rate of 38 per vegetated hectare. As a requirement of the state permit, the plant community, water quality, and the fish community were monitored throughout the initiative (1997-2014) to examine the impact of grass carp at multiple ecological levels of the lentic system. M. spicatum was significantly reduced in biomass and cover between 1997 and 2014, with no change in plant community richness. Concordant with the decrease in M. spicatum, the cover of Ceratophyllum demersum increased significantly and became more dominant in the plant community as M. spicatum was reduced. Our results also suggest there was no change in water quality or fish community density/diversity during the study period; however, fish community richness was reduced. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) density and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) size distribution both increased during this study. We assert that grass carp can be an effective approach to nonnative plant management in a northern meso-eutrophic lake.																	1040-2381	2151-5530				MAR	2017	33	1					84	100		10.1080/10402381.2017.1284966								WOS:000396042900009

Through sampling of dated sediment cores, we identified indicators of historical land use change (past 150 yr) in a microtidal northern Gulf of Mexico tidal creek system in the early stages of urbanization. We found that tidal creeks differed from open water sites, and urbanized sites differed from less altered sites, primarily due to changes in carbon sources indicated by differences in sediment stable carbon isotope (delta C-13) values, and concentrations of fecal indicator bacterium Clostridium perfringens. Total organic carbon (%TOC) and carbon : nitrogen (C : N) increased twofold in tidal creeks during upstream urbanization in the early 20th century, which led to elevated mid-century sediment TOC accumulation rates (5-10 mg C cm(-2) yr(-1)), followed by decreases in TOC accumulation in tidal creeks and open waters since the 1960s (0.4-1.8 mg C cm(-2) yr(-1)). C. perfringens and nitrogen stable isotope values (delta N-15) were, respectively, 1.8 and 1.5 times higher at wastewater-influenced sites than at other sites, increasing through time or remaining high at wastewater-influenced sites from approximately the 1950s-present, when human populations quadrupled. Hence, urbanization altered estuarine inputs from upland C sources and increased inputs from human-derived N and microbes. These findings suggest that tidal creeks are more sensitive archives of land-use change than open water systems due to their proximity and greater connectivity to the watershed.

We hypothesized that measured changes in lake temperature, and the resulting physical changes to water columns, were affecting diatom communities in the Great Lakes. A paleolimnological analysis of 10 sediment cores collected from deep locations throughout the Great Lakes basin indicates a recent (30-50 yr) reorganization of the diatom community to one characterized by elevated abundances of several species from the group Cyclotella sensu lato, coinciding with rising atmospheric and water temperatures. These Cyclotella increases are a probable mechanistic result of new physical regimes such as changing stratification depths and longer ice-free periods, and possibly water quality shifts. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of these changes are ongoing, but this compositional reorganization in primary producers could have important implications to Great Lakes food webs.

Estimation of the phosphorus loading with consideration for the planetary boundaries (for the Russian Federation as an example)	PURE AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY					21st International Conference on Phosphorus Chemistry (ICPC)	JUN 05-10, 2016	Kazan, RUSSIA					Some scientists believe today that problems related to phosphorus entry into fresh-water bodies may be more important for setting the planetary boundary. Excessive entry of biogenic elements (especially phosphorus) into water bodies and water streams causes their eutrophication. This process may cause a decrease in the light transmittance of surface water layers and other consequences for ecosystem and humans. In this paper the results of model application for the estimation of the phosphorus content in fresh waters of the Russian Federation regions are presented. The method for the estimation of the phosphorus amount in fresh water was developed on the basis of the dynamic model. Phosphorus loading is most characteristic of regions that have developed types of agriculture which cause increases the rate of mineral phosphorus entry into erodible soil.

THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND FILAMENTOUS ALGAE MAT FORMATION IN TWO AGRICULTURAL INFLUENCED SOUTH AFRICAN RIVERS	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The regulation of nutrient inputs into rivers dominated by agriculture land use activities is an important aspect of ecological resilience of aquatic systems and the management of river eutrophication. The overabundance of benthic filamentous algae mats in river systems due to nutrient enrichment can modify the habitats of macroinvertebrate and fish communities as well as clogging irrigation crop sprayers of downstream water users. The current study examined over a period of 2 years (2013-2014) the interplay between physical and chemical river characteristics and epilithic filamentous algae biomass in two South African agricultural influenced rivers. The study area consisted of the Touw and Duiwe Rivers, which run into a proclaimed Ramsar site, namely, the Wilderness Lake System. A strong positive correlation was observed between the maximum filamentous algae biomass (97 chl-a mgm(-2)) observed during the dry season and the average water column alkalinity > 30 mg l(-1). The benthic trophic status of the nine sampling sites during the dry seasons indicated the highest benthic algae biomass with mesotrophic (1.7-21 chl-a mgm(-2)) to hypertrophic (> 84 chl-a mgm(-2)) conditions. During the dry season, only three sampling sites were below the suggested guideline value (35 mu g l(-1)) for total phosphorus (TP), while four sampling sites were below the total nitrogen guideline of 252 mu g l(-1). In the wet season, two sites were below TP values with five sites below total nitrogen guideline values. From the data gathered, it was evident that water column alkalinity and hardness were the main drivers for the formation or absence of benthic filamentous algae mats in the two river systems and that nitrogen and/or phosphorus concentrations was overshadowed by the physical and chemical characteristics of the river systems at certain sites. Nutrient results for the river bottom sediments revealed that the sediment qualities were variable at the different sampling sites, but more specifically along the longitudinal paths of flow. It was apparent that the high TP concentrations in the water column and bottom sediment, which were lowest during the dry season, were associated with the highest epilithic filamentous algae mat formation. The outcome of the current study shows that a more holistic approach must be followed for the development of future eutrophication guidelines and nutrient thresholds in South African rivers influenced by agriculture land use activities.

However, large numbers of experiments always have to be undertaken to get the appropriate optical path length, which is difficult to meet the demand of real-time, accurate, sensitive and stable online monitoring system. In this paper, an optimized spectra fusion algorithm was developed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of fused spectra from two independent spectra that were acquired using two different optical path lengths. In the fusion algorithm, the sliding-pane method was applied to obtain the distribution of noise variance of the spectra, so the region of strong noise in the spectra could be determined. Due to different signal intensity of spectra with long and short optical path length, genetic algorithm was used to calculate the optimal gain matching rate of fusion. Finally, according to the distribution of noise variance, piecewise weighted method is applied to achieve a fusion spectrum with higher signal-to-noise ratio. The experimental results showed that the fusion algorithm could effectively enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the fused spectra for each sample without altering the optical path length; the noise within 200 similar to 250 nm was suppressed and the low-noise and high-sensitivity spectra in the visible band were preserved; Zero interference was moved to the left of 220 nm of the spectrum. This means the fusion algorithm not only shows improvements in both signal-to-noise ratio and the detailed characteristics of the spectrum, but also reduces the excessive number of experiments in order to optimize optical path length and minimize noise in spectra. It has important practical significance to broaden the application range of the ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy based water quality monitoring system.																	1000-0593					MAR	2017	37	3					799	805		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2017)03-0799-07								WOS:000397352600024

Specifically, we develop a possible probabilistic model of sensor measurement error and the measurement error model is embedded into a simulation model of a river system. An optimization algorithm is used to find the optimal sensor locations that minimize the expected time until a spill detection in the presence of a constraint on the probability of detecting a spill. The experimental results show that the optimal sensor locations are highly sensitive to the variability of measurement error and false alarm rates are often unacceptably high. An SPC method is useful in finding thresholds that guarantee a false alarm rate no more than a pre-specified target level, and an optimization algorithm combined with the thresholds finds a robust sensor network.

Water reconditioning and reuse in the food processing industry: Current situation and challenges	TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Background: While the demand for food and water is growing, water shortages are already occurring in many of the world's major food production areas. Irrigation is unarguably the most water demanding operation among the food supply chain, however, efforts from different sectors will collectively secure food for the world's population. Food processing is a key component of the food supply chain and its water footprint is of great consideration, not only because of the high-quality water used in the manufacturing of products but also for the significant volumes of pollutant wastewater generated. Different food sectors produce wastewater of different qualities, but for all cases water reconditioning and reuse offer opportunities to reduce water consumption and to contribute to a better water management in the food processing industry. Scope and approach: The factors converging to implement such initiatives including, regulations in place, available technologies, food safety considerations, risk perceptions, water quality, environmental impacts and research needs are discussed herein. The goal of this review paper was to bring to the forefront of the debate the challenges and opportunities that water conservation initiatives offer, in order to produce more food with less water. Key findings: Water reconditioning and reuse are technologically-feasible alternatives for the food processing industry to incorporate better water management and sustainability in food processing operations that are lacking. Successful implementation of conservation strategies is associated with the holistic evaluation of the intervention, providing information related to cost, risk, and environmental performance.

Biomarkers such as oxidase enzymes are especially useful indicators because they represent a direct biological response to environmental toxicity. A luminometer was used to quantify oxidase enzyme production in watercress (Nasturtium officinale) due to toxic chemical exposure of E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline blend), gasoline, and 99% pure ethanol over a 72-h period in aquatic root exposure and volatile leaf exposure experiments. Aquatic exposure to E85 caused an increase in oxidative enzyme production while gasoline and ethanol caused no significant changes in oxidase concentrations. Aquatic root exposure results were compared to volatile leaf exposures where effects of E85, gasoline, and ethanol caused increases in oxidase production. Morphometric measurements were also conducted as plant stress comparisons to oxidative enzyme analyses. Measurements of root length showed increases in root growth at some concentrations of fuels with only the highest concentration of E85 resulting in a decrease in root growth when compared to the control.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				MAR	2017	228	3							117	10.1007/s11270-017-3302-z								WOS:000397821100032

The Impact of Climate Change on Metal Transport in a Lowland Catchment	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This study investigates the impact of future climate change on heavy metal (i.e., Cd and Zn) transport from soils to surface waters in a contaminated lowland catchment. The WALRUS hydrological model is employed in a semi-distributed manner to simulate current and future hydrological fluxes in the Dommel catchment in the Netherlands. The model is forced with climate change projections and the simulated fluxes are used as input to a metal transport model that simulates heavy metal concentrations and loads in quickflow and baseflow pathways. Metal transport is simulated under baseline climate ("2000-2010") and future climate ("2090-2099") conditions including scenarios for no climate change and climate change. The outcomes show an increase in Cd and Zn loads and the mean flux-weighted Cd and Zn concentrations in the discharged runoff, which is attributed to breakthrough of heavy metals from the soil system. Due to climate change, runoff enhances and leaching is accelerated, resulting in enhanced Cd and Zn loads. Mean flux-weighted concentrations in the discharged runoff increase during early summer and decrease during late summer and early autumn under the most extreme scenario of climate change. The results of this study provide improved understanding on the processes responsible for future changes in heavy metal contamination in lowland catchments.

Coal Mine Water Pollution and Ecological Impairment of One of Australia's Most 'Protected' High Conservation-Value Rivers	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The environmental regulation of a coal mine in the greater Sydney area has failed to recognise the importance of and protect a high conservation-value river located in a World Heritage listed area. This study measured the water quality and ecological health (using macroinvertebrates) of the Wollangambe River and its tributaries near the point of the waste water discharge of a coal mine and assessed the longitudinal impact for 22 km downstream. The investigation revealed two important aspects. The first is the significant impact of the waste water discharge when compared to the otherwise near-pristine condition of the high conservation-value river system. The second is the spatial extent of the pollution from the mine that extends at least 22 km downstream from the outflow of coal mine wastes. The resulting water pollution is causing major impairment of the aquatic ecosystem, with reduced abundance, taxonomic richness and loss of pollution-sensitive macroin-vertebrate groups. Water pollution from the mine includes thermal pollution, increased salinity and increased concentrations of zinc and nickel. The mine's waste discharge also strongly modified the river's ionic composition. The study also highlights the failure of the regulatory and governance systems that enable the mine to operate in a manner that causes major environmental impacts.

A commonly used water quality simulation model, Qual2K, was linked to a Genetic Algorithm optimization model for exploration of relevant fuzzy objective-function formulations for addressing imprecision and conflicting goals of pollution control agencies and various dischargers. Results showed a dynamic flow dependence of optimal wastewater loading with good convergence to near global optimum. Explicit considerations of real-world technological limitations, which were developed here in a new S-O framework, led to better compromise solutions between conflicting goals than those identified within traditional S-O frameworks. The newly developed framework, in addition to being more technologically realistic, is also less complicated and converges on solutions more rapidly than traditional frameworks. This technique marks a significant step forward for development of holistic, riverscape-based approaches that balance the conflicting needs of the stakeholders.				jaafarzadeh, neemat/M-1190-2017	jaafarzadeh, neemat/0000-0003-2516-2340; Destouni, Georgia/0000-0001-9408-4425												1061-4303	1554-7531				MAR 1	2017	89	3					211	220		10.2175/106143017X14839994523866								WOS:000397300200002	28236817

Water quality and antifungal susceptibility of opportunistic yeast pathogens from rivers	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Yeasts from water sources have been associated with diseases ranging from superficial mucosal infections to life threatening diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the water quality as well as diversity and antifungal susceptibility of yeasts from two rivers. Yeast levels and physicochemical parameter data were analyzed by principal component analysis to determine correlations between physico-chemical data and yeast levels. Yeast morphotypes were identified by biochemical tests and 26S rRNA gene sequencing. Disk diffusion antifungal susceptibility tests were conducted. Physico-chemical parameters of the water were within target water quality range (TWQR) for livestock farming. For irrigational use, total dissolved solids and nitrates were not within the TWQR. Yeast levels ranged between 27 +/- 10 and 2,573 +/- 306 cfu/L. Only non-pigmented, ascomycetous yeasts were isolated. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata were most frequently isolated. Several other opportunistic pathogens were also isolated. A large number of isolates were resistant to azoles, especially fluconazole, but also to other antifungal classes. Candida species were resistant to almost all the antifungal classes. These water sources are used for recreation and religious as well as for watering livestock and irrigation. Of particular concern is the direct contact of individuals with opportunistic yeast, especially the immune-compromised. Resistance of these yeast species to antifungal agents is a further health concern.

J	Saberi, L; Niksokhan, MH				Saberi, Leila; Niksokhan, Mohammad Hossein			Optimal waste load allocation using graph model for conflict resolution	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In this paper, a new methodology is proposed for waste load allocation in river systems using the decision support system (DSS) for the graph model for conflict resolution II (GMCRII), multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) analysis and the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. Minimization of total treatment and penalty costs and minimization of biological oxygen demand violation of standards at the check point are considered as the main objectives of this study. At first, the water quality along the river was simulated using the Streeter-Phelps (S-P) equation coupled with the MOPSO model. Thereby a trade-off curve between the objectives is obtained and a set of non-dominated solutions is selected. In the next step, the best alternative is chosen using MCDM techniques and the GMCRII DSS package and non-cooperative stability definitions. The applicability and efficiency of the methodology are examined in a real-world case study of the Sefidrud River in the northern part of Iran.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				MAR	2017	75	6					1512	1522		10.2166/wst.2016.429								WOS:000397590800025	28333067

Investigation and control of seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering climate change	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Seawater intrusion is considered one of the main processes that degrade water quality by raising salinity. Over-pumping and decreasing recharge are considered the main causes of saltwater intrusion. Moreover, climate change and sea-level rise accelerate saltwater intrusion. In this paper SEAWAT code was used to study groundwater flow and seawater intrusion in the Eastern Nile Delta aquifer considering four scenarios of climate change including sea-level rise, increasing abstraction, decreasing recharge and the combination of these scenarios. The results showed that decreasing recharge has a significant effect on seawater intrusion. However, the combinations of these scenarios resulted in harmful intrusion and loss of groundwater. The soil salinity increased, which decreased agricultural production. The control of seawater intrusion and protection of groundwater resources and soil is very important. Different scenarios were implemented to protect the aquifer from seawater intrusion including decreasing abstraction, increasing recharge, abstracting brackish water and the combination of these three scenarios. The abstraction of brackish water gave a higher reduction of seawater intrusion and decreased groundwater table in the aquifer near the shore line, which protected the soil from salinity and increased agricultural production. However, the combination of these three scenarios gave the highest reduction of seawater intrusion.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					311	323		10.2166/ws.2016.129								WOS:000398000000001						
J	Eliamringi, L; Kazumba, S				Eliamringi, Lightness; Kazumba, Shija			Assessment of sustainability of rural water supply services in Tanzania: the case study of Dodoma region	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Rural water supply services in Tanzania are still inadequate. Despite the substantial resources invested to provide safe water, there is a significant number of water points that are non-functional. Knowledge of the degree of sustainability and the contributing factors for rural water supply projects is limited. This study employs the fuzzy set concept to assess the degree of sustainability of water points in seven Local Government Authorities (LGAs) of Dodoma region in Tanzania. Dodoma region lies in the semi-arid area of Tanzania where boreholes are the major sources of water supply. Due to limited information, four dimensions of sustainability of water projects were used in this study. These include water quantity from the water sources, water quality, institution setting with regard to community participation in meetings, and financing of the projects for operation and maintenance. The multidimensional sustainability indices of water points were determined. The results indicate that only two LGAs, of Bahi and Kondoa, have sustainable water points with sustainability indices of 0.86 and 0.83, respectively. Kongwa has the lowest sustainability index of 0.17 due to poor water quality and inadequate quantity of water from the boreholes.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					372	380		10.2166/ws.2016.141								WOS:000398000000006

Implementing tactical plans to improve water-energy loss management	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Water utilities are aware of the water-energy loss relevance in supply systems. However, they still mainly focus on daily water loss control (real and apparent losses), without considering the impact on embedded energy. Moreover, they are mostly concerned with the economic dimension and, in most cases, tend to disregard the impact that water-energy loss may have on the quality of service, communication with the consumers, social awareness, water quality and environment. This paper focuses on the application of the developed and tested AWARE-P infrastructure asset management (IAM) methodology to improve water-energy loss management in water supply systems, while demonstrating the main benefits from implementing an integrated approach for water losses and related energy assessment. Results show that indeed the participating iPerdas utilities were able to define tactical measures leading to a more efficient and sustainable service.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					381	388		10.2166/ws.2016.092								WOS:000398000000007						
J	Li, FY; Wang, JY; Cao, TT; Cui, CW				Li, Fangyuan; Wang, Jingyao; Cao, Tingting; Cui, Chongwei			Spatial and seasonal variability of water quality in the Mopanshan Reservoir (Harbin, Northern China)	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The purpose of this work is to evaluate the spatial and seasonal variability of water quality from the Mopanshan Reservoir, which is a typical reservoir in the northern cold regions of China. The results indicate that preventive or remediation actions are necessary to improve its water quality. Water samples were collected between 2012 and 2013 at five sampling stations at the Mopanshan Reservoir, and analyzed for CODMn and total nitrogen (TN). SPSS software was used to carry out analysis of variance and correlation analysis. Spatially, CODMn and TN exhibited a rather small distinction in the horizontal direction, but there was a significant difference regarding TN in the vertical orientation. The concentration of TN also increased with the increase in sampling depth. Seasonally, the concentration of CODMn and TN showed a pronounced seasonal pattern and was divided into four periods. CODMn reached a maximum in September and was at a minimum in June. And TN reached a maximum in June and was at a minimum in November or December. The use of correlation analysis shows that the regular variations of TN were primarily affected by temperature. The main form of nitrogen in the Mopanshan Reservoir is NO3-N, and the change of TN is consistent with that of NO3-N. By Pearson correlation coefficient, the seasonal variability of CODMn correlated to changes in the reservoir's water level. The results showed that the concentration of TN exceeded the guideline values in most months and CODMn was slightly over the standard limit. Thus, it is urgent that preventive actions and remediation processes are developed to improve the water quality in this reservoir.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					389	398		10.2166/ws.2016.118								WOS:000398000000008

Islamabad is the capital city, located at the foot of the Margallah Hills, whereas Rawalpindi lies in the Potohar Plateau. Both cities are located in the semi-arid region of Pakistan, where the residents meet their basic need of water through groundwater resources. For the lastmany years, the quantity and quality of groundwater in these cities has been deteriorating very rapidly. In this study, the foremost recharge source for these cities was identified using tritium and major ion chemistry, and different physiochemical parameters were studied to find out the facts behind the quality deterioration of the groundwater. Tritiumvalues and chemical data suggested that aquifers located in the territory of Islamabad were mainly recharged by upland areas (theMargalla Hills), which accounts for their low electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids contents. A higher sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) suggested an alteration in recharge patterns through soil compaction and cementation (from increased construction activity) that reduced the recharge inputs. The high SAR also disturbs the recharge pattern and had disturbed the natural equilibrium of the groundwater system, deteriorating the quality of the water.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					433	451		10.2166/ws.2016.149								WOS:000398000000012

A serious shortcoming of the debate is that there are differences in the design and management of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems. This study is based on the performance of two RWH systems that are used for drinking purposes at a kindergarten and a primary school in Cu Khe, Vietnam. Each system comprised a painted galvanized iron roof, a first-flush diverter, two stainless steel tanks connected in series, a calmed inlet, mosquito screens on open holes, PVC pipelines, filter cartridges, and a UV sterilizer. During 18 months, stored rainwater was sampled five times, and treated rainwater was sampled four times. Twenty-three water quality parameters were analyzed, including pH, total dissolved solids, turbidity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, hardness, arsenic, iron, cadmium, nickel, chromium, manganese, mercury, selenium, lead, zinc, Escherichia coli, and total coliform. It was found that all the physicochemical qualities of the stored rainwater, prior to treatment, satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guidelines. After physical filtration and UV sterilization, all parameters, including microbiological indicators, satisfied the WHO drinking water guidelines. Further management strategies to stabilize water quality were discussed.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					452	460		10.2166/ws.2016.154								WOS:000398000000013

A case assessment in China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The overall purpose was to assess the feasibilities of recycling filter backwash water (FBWW) and combined filter backwash water (CFBWW) in a drinking water treatment plant in south China. The variations of regular water-quality indexes, metal indexes (Al, Mn and Cd), polyacrylamide and disinfection by-product indexes (trihalomethanes and their formation potentials) along with the treatment and the recycling processes were monitored. Results showed the recycling procedure caused increases of turbidity, total solids, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), permanganate index (CODMn), and dissolved organic carbon, Al, Mn and Cd concentrations in a mixture of raw water and FBWW or CFBWW compared to those in raw water. However, the recycling procedure had negligible impacts on the qualities of settled water and filtered water because most of the contaminants could be effectively removed by the conventional water treatment process. Although recycling did cause slight increases of NH3-N and CODMn levels in settled water and filtered water, the quality of finished water always conformed to Chinese standards for drinking water quality according to the surveyed indexes in the present study. Thus, it is appropriate to recycle waste streams in water-stressed areas if the source water is well managed and the water treatment processes are carefully conducted.

J	Boroumand, A; Rajaee, T				Boroumand, Amir; Rajaee, Taher			Discrete entropy theory for optimal redesigning of salinity monitoring network in San Francisco bay	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												The paper presents an entropy-based method for designing an optimum bay water salinity monitoring network in San Francisco bay (S. F. bay) considering maximum-monitoring-information and minimum-data-lost criteria. Due to cost concerns, it is necessary to design the optimal salinity monitoring network with a minimal number of sampling stations to provide reliable data. The monthly data recorded from January 1995 to December 2014 were obtained over 37 active stations located in S. F. bay and is applied in the research. Transinformation entropy in discrete mode is used to calculate the stations' optimum distance. The discrete approach uses the frequency table to calculate transinformation measures. After calculating these measures, a transinformation-distance (T-D) curve is developed. Then, the optimum distance between salinity monitoring stations is elicited from the curve. The study shows that the S. F. bay salinity monitoring stations provide redundant information and the existing stations can be reduced to 21 with an approximate distance of 7.5 km. The coverage of the proposed monitoring network by using the optimum distance is complete and the system does not generate redundant data. The results of this research indicate that transinformation entropy is a promising method for the design of monitoring networks in bays such as those found in San Francisco bay.																	1606-9749					MAR	2017	17	2					606	612		10.2166/ws.2016.110								WOS:000398000000029

Maximum yield approximation and size distribution patterns of stocker size largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides reared in a semi-closed indoor system	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												The main objectives of this study were to approximate the maximum yield and evaluate size dispersion of stocker size largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides reared in a semi-closed recirculating system for 60days. Fingerlings with an average body weight of 36.7g were utilized for the study. An experimental system consisting of 18 square plastic tanks (165L) equipped with a radial flow settler, a sump, a moving bed filter, a centrifugal pump, a rapid sand filter, a down-flow oxygen saturator and a UV sterilizer was utilized for the trial. The system was operated semi-closed, accounting for a daily exchange rate of 30-50% of total system water volume. Experimental stocking densities were 4.5, 9.1, 18.8, 36.5, 54.6 and 73kgm(-3) with three replicates per treatment. At the end of the experimental trial, largemouth bass showed acceptable feed conversion (1.00-1.48), specific growth rate (1.16-1.45% day(-1)) and survival rate (81.8-96.6%) in all treatments, displaying the highest performance at an initial stocking density range of 18-36kgm(-3). Based on a piecewise regression model with breakpoint analysis, maximum yield of largemouth bass fingerlings should not exceed 70kgm(-3). As stocking densityincreased, relatively more underweight fingerlings were produced with a higher uniformity of fatness.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAR	2017	48	3					780	791		10.1111/are.12922								WOS:000395095300006

(1758), reared in cages of different volumes	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												The effects of rearing volume on on-growing European sea bass performance and stress parameters were investigated for the first time in a pilot aquaculture farm. Fish were held under the same initial stocking densities in triplicate net-pen cages of different sizes (1.4, 45 and 252m(3)) for a period of 8months. Results showed significant differences among the experimental groups in most parameters tested, with better performance in the two larger rearing volumes. In particular, growth rate showed a linear association with rearing volume, being 0.68gday(-1) for the large cage group, 0.56gday(-1) and 0.32gday(-1) for the medium and the small groups respectively. The feed conversion ratio and per cent survival (%) were also better in the large cage group. Fish reared in the small and medium-sized cages showed higher plasma cortisol concentrations than those reared in large cages, which showed low basal cortisol concentrations. Additionally, after an acute chasing stress challenge, fish in the large and small groups, but not the medium group, showed increased cortisol concentrations. Differences also occurred in the ratio of the expression of cortisol receptors, namely the mineralocorticoid (mr) and glucocorticoid receptors (gr). In specific, the ratio of mr to grmRNA expression in the liver was higher in fish reared in the small cages. These findings verify that experimental scale significantly affects experimental results and is a critical factor for the interpretation of results.

This study aimed to analyse during biofloc formation the effect of different total suspended solids (TSS) levels on water quality and the growth performance of Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp in a BFT system. A 42-day trial was conducted with treatments of three ranges of TSS: 100-300mgL(-1) as low (TL), 300-600 as medium (TM) and 600-1000 as high (TH). The initial concentrations of 100 (TL), 300 (TM) and 600mgL(-1) (TH) were achieved by fertilization before starting the experiment. Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles with an average weight of 4.54 +/- 1.19g were stocked at a density of 372 shrimp m(-3). Physical and chemical water parameters and shrimp growth performance were analysed. After 6weeks, TSS mean concentrations were 306.37, 532.43 and 745.2mgL(-1) for, respectively, TL, TM and TH treatments. Significant differences (P<0.05) were observed in TSS, settleable solids, pH, alkalinity and nitrite, especially between the TL and TH treatments. Similarly, differences (P<0.05) were observed in the growth performance parameters, specifically final weight, survival, feed conversion and productivity. The water quality parameters at lower range of total suspended solids concentration (TL) treatment resulted in a better performance of L.vannamei in the BFT system. The maintenance at range of 100-300mgL(-1) TSS is thus important to the success of shrimp culture.

Biofloc volume and total suspended solid were higher in molasses added groups (32+M and 40+M) followed by rice flour (32+R and 40+R) and controls (32C and 40C). Molasses and rice flour addition significantly reduced (P<0.01) the total ammonia-N compared to controls. The highest Vibrio, Bacillus and Lactobacillus counts were recorded in 40+M, 32+M and 32+R respectively. Among the treatments, significantly higher (P<0.01) final body weight was recorded in 40+R (8.5 +/- 0.3g), 40+M (7.8 +/- 0.3g) and 32+R (7.5 +/- 0.4g) compared to control groups, 32C (6.1 +/- 0.3g), 40C (6.4 +/- 0.3g) and molasses added group, 32+M (5.7 +/- 0.4g). Rice flour supplementation significantly increased (P<0.01) the total haemocyte count (x10(6) cellsmL(-1)) in 32+R (45.7 +/- 3.7) and 40+R (44.3 +/- 3.1) compared to controls, 32C (27.3 +/- 3.4) and 40C (25.8 +/- 0.9). Similarly, higher superoxide dismutase, catalase, serum protein and glucose were recorded in the rice flour added groups, 40+R followed by 32+R. Among the treatments, the highest level of prophenoloxidase (OD 490nm, 0.3 +/- 0.0) and survival after challenge with Vibrio harveyi (55.6%) was observed in 32+R. The study elucidates that rice flour addition produces optimum level of biofloc with better growth and immune responses compared to molasses and control. Furthermore, rice flour addition at 32% protein level could replace 40% protein feed.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAR	2017	48	3					1168	1182		10.1111/are.12958								WOS:000395095300040

However, the pH and alkalinity may decrease due to the biofloc formation process and Nitrification. A 48-day experiment was performed to investigate the effects of different pH (7.1-7.6; 7.6-8.1) conditions on water quality, the growth and the health status of shrimp in biofloc technology (BFT) through using sodium bicarbonate to adjust pH respectively. Two pH treatments and one control were compared: T0 control, T1 pH 7.6 NaHCO3, T2 pH 8.1 NaHCO3, each treatment consisted of three replicate tanks (90L water volume) and each replicate stocked with 30 shrimp (equivalent to 333 shrimpm(-3)). Significant physical, chemical and biological differences (P<0.05) were detected among treatments. At the end of the experiment, water quality, the growth and the immune response of shrimp in control were significantly lower (P<0.05) than the other treatments. Moreover, the T2 treatment had a better performance in these three aspects. The results indicated that it was necessary to adjust the pH and alkalinity in the BFT, and a higher pH as well as alkalinity for shrimp growth and the stability of the BFT were more favourable.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAR	2017	48	3					1194	1208		10.1111/are.12961								WOS:000395095300042

In Experiment I, different carbon sources including molasses, glucose, sucrose and corn flour were given to supplement suboptimal feeding with the microalgae Dunaliella viridis, whereas the control was fed only D.viridis. In Experiment II, molasses was supplemented to the culture medium, as well as the bacteria Alkalibacterium sp. or the archaea Halobacterium sp., isolated from the brine in the local saltponds. The control groups were fed only with D.viridis or with D.viridis and molasses. Our study shows that in laboratory culture biofloc development can be stimulated under hypersaline conditions. Supplementation of carbon sources, bacteria and archaea benefited biofloc development, water quality in terms of nitrogen load and enhanced Artemia production. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis on the bioflocs also indicates an increased biodiversity and richness of the microbial community in the culture medium. These results need to be confirmed for large scale Artemia pond production, in which case, we recommend molasses as carbon source.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAR	2017	48	3					1240	1250		10.1111/are.12965								WOS:000395095300046

Quantifying tillage dynamics from time ordered spatially aggregated data	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Understanding and documenting historical agricultural land use and farming practices is important for assessment of environmental benefits of no-till (NT). To address the need for quantitative estimates of time patterns of tillage practices, this study proposes modeling the time patterns using the Markov chains framework and estimating the probabilities of transition from one tillage-crop combination to another tillage-crop combination from time-ordered spatially aggregated data. We developed a first-order, four-state Markov chain model of tillage-crop dynamics in corn (Zea mays L.) soybean (Glycine max L.) production systems and estimated the transition probabilities for the state of Iowa using the 1992 to 1997 data collected by the Conservation Technology Information Center. The transition probabilities strongly suggest that the "majority of NT acreage is not in continuous but rather in rotational NT, i.e., NT crop production in rotation with conventional or other tillage systems. We find that the probability of two-year continuous NT is 8%, and that 70% of Iowa cropland has never used NT over two consecutive years. When three-year tillage history is considered on corn acreage, 3% is in continuous NT, 62% has never used NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. When three-year tillage history is considered on soybean acreage, 4% is in continuous NT, 56% has never used, NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. The methodology presented is applicable to corn soybean,production systems in other regions and is generalizable to other cropping systems. Regional estimates of the use of rotational and continuous NT are likely to benefit simulation Modeling for the assessment of the environmental effects of alternative tillage practices.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAR-APR	2017	72	2					131	138		10.2489/jswc.72.2.131								WOS:000395957900009

Nutrient biofilters in the Virginia Coastal Plain: Nitrogen removal, cost, and potential adoption pathways	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Excess nonpoint source nutrient loss presents one of the most vexing water management challenges for water quality managers: Agriculture is the single largest contributor of nutrients to the Chesapeake Bay, and achieving nutrient reduction targets for agriculture will be costly. Biofilters offer new opportunities to reduce nutrient loads from artificially drained agricultural land. Nutrient biofilters consist of organic carbon (C) medium, typically wood chips, that when saturated with nitrogen (N)-enriched waters supports the activity of naturally occurring soil microorganisms that convert bioavailable N into N gases via denitrification.This study estimates the cost and N removal effectiveness for a biochar-amended woodchip biofilter draining a 10 ha (25 ac) field planted in a corn (Zea mays L.)-soy (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) rotation in eastern Virginia as well as for alternative design scenarios for biofilters ranging 25 to 150 m(3) (883 to 5,297 ft(3)) with either woodchips alone or biochar-amended woodchip C substrates. Nitrogen removal effectiveness is estimated using modeled site-specific influent loads and N removal effectiveness estimates derived from experimental trials in a pilot scale system on the Delmarva Peninsula. This analysis estimates N removal costs as a function of biofilter size, which directly relates to residence time, per unit of N removed. Modeled N removal estimates over a five-year period (2009 to 2013) for five bed volumes range from 88 to 391 kg (194 to 862 lb) for the woodchip biofilters (21% to 95% removal) and 132 to 412 kg (291 to 908 lb) for the biochar-amended woodchip biofilters (32% to 100% removal) of the 412 kg total N load exported to the biofilters during the five-year period.The N removal costs range from US$15 to US$48 kg' y-1 (US$6.82 to US$21.82 lb(-1)yr(-1)) for the woodchip biofilter and US$15 to US$33 kg(-1) y(-1) (US$6.82 to US$15 lb(-1) yr(-1)) for biochar-amended woodchip filters. While biofilters are determined to be cost-effective for N removal compared to conventional agricultural best management practices, agricultural producers may be reluctant to voluntarily adopt biofilters because of the relatively high initial installation costs and the lack of direct incentive payments for pollutant removal effectiveness. Nutrient trading programs offer some potential to enhance adoption, but not in the immediate future.

Riparian proper functioning condition assessment to improve watershed management for water quality	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Pollutants can be reduced, ameliorated or assimilated when riparian ecosystems have the vegetation, water, and soil/landform needed for riparian functions. Loss of physical form and ecological function unravels assimilation processes, increasing supply and transport of pollutants. Water quality and aquatic organisms are response measures of accumulated upstream discharges, and ultimately of changes in riparian functions. Thus, water quality monitoring often fails to identify or lags behind many causes of pollution or remediation from riparian degradation. This paper reviews the interagency riparian proper functioning condition (PFC) assessment for lotic (running water) riparian ecosystems and outlines connections between PFC and water quality attributes (sediment, nutrients, temperature, and dissolved oxygen [DO]). The PFC interaction of hydrology, vegetation, and soils/landforms influences water quality by dissipating energy associated with high waterflow, thereby reducing vertical instability and lateral erosion while developing floodplains with captured sediment and nutrients. Slowing flood water enables aquifer recharge, deposition, and plant nutrient uptake. Water-loving, densely rooted streambank stabilizing vegetation and/or wood helps integrate riparian functions to maintain channel pattern, profile, and dimension with characteristics for a diversity of habitats. A complex food web helps slow the nutrient spiral with uptake and storage. Temperature fluctuations are dampened by delayed discharges, narrower and deeper active channels, coarser substrates that enhance hyporheic interchange, and shade from riparian vegetation. After assessment and implementation, monitoring recovery of impaired riparian function attributes (e.g., streambank plant species) naturally focuses on persistent drivers of water quality and aquatic habitat. This provides timely environmental indicators of stream ecological health and water quality remediation projects or land management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAR-APR	2017	72	2					168	182		10.2489/jSWC.72.2.168								WOS:000395957900013

Competing goals of water quality management authorities and TN load dischargers at nonpoint sources such as paddy field, upland crop field, and residential area are described with linear imprecise membership functions including interval numbers. TN load discharged from each cell of the nonpoint sources is assumed to be transported along with surface, subsurface, and river flow under the conventional first-order kinetic removal with respect to distance. The travel length of the load is estimated with a digital elevation model in a geographic information system (GIS). Uncertainty of river discharge and self-purification coefficients appearing in the TN transport model is also expressed with interval numbers. The GIS-aided grey fuzzy optimization model developed here is applied to the Seimei River watershed, Japan. By solving the optimization model, the allowable load represented by an interval number at each cell is procured, which would be a scientific base for effluent control regarding nonpoint sources in the area.																	1611-2490	1611-2504				MAR	2017	15	2					263	276		10.1007/s10333-016-0545-z								WOS:000395172800004

However, it is not easy to reduce fertilization or to decrease agricultural land area while maintaining crop yields as an effort of water quality conservation. We investigated the total nitrogen (T-N) and the total phosphorus (T-P) concentrations and the N:P ratio (atomic and mass) in the Tokachi River basin during 2007-2011 under base flow conditions. The proportion of agricultural land and the Spatial Continuity (SC) of agricultural land were analyzed to examine effective land use management for water quality conservation. T-P showed comparatively low concentrations (0.03-0.26 mg/L) because Andosols in the agricultural land, which have high phosphate absorption coefficients. While the T-N concentrations (0.4-6.6 mg/L) and the N:P mass ratio (6.3-39) tended to high values. T-N concentration and the N:P ratio had positive correlations with the proportion and the SC of agricultural land. In particular, the correlation coefficients of the relationships with the SC of agricultural land were higher than those of the proportion of agricultural land. In watersheds having more than 40 % of agricultural land, it was confirmed that there were some tributaries which had a high proportion of agricultural land but had low SC of agricultural land. Besides, the results suggested that the nitrogen runoff could be suppressed by setting the connectivity of agricultural land with certain scale without reducing the proportion of agricultural land in the Tokachi River basin significantly.																	1611-2490	1611-2504				MAR	2017	15	2					277	290		10.1007/s10333-016-0546-y								WOS:000395172800005						
J	Navabian, M; Ghane, E; Hosseinzade, M				Navabian, Maryam; Ghane, Ehsan; Hosseinzade, Mohammad			Investigating the reduction of sodium adsorption ratio from agricultural waste by rice husk in batch scale and physical model of drain envelop	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) is one of the water quality indexes that whose is important due to reuse or depletion to environment. Solutes in drain water can be controlled by adsorption, chemical or biological reaction, organic envelope of drainage. Rice husk is the common option of drainage envelops in paddy fields. In this study, the ability of reduction of SAR by rice husk was evaluated in batch scale and physical model of drain envelops. In the batch experiments, the adsorption of SAR parameters was investigated by adding 2 g of rice husk into a 100 ml of sodium chloride solution. The results indicated that rice husk absorbed calcium, magnesium and sodium, respectively. By increasing the temperature, contact time and pH, adsorption of calcium, magnesium and sodium was increased; however, the higher concentration of sodium in soil solution reduced the percentage of adsorption. In a more realistic state, physical models of subsurface drainage in the paddy fields were made. Drainage envelope treatments included of rice husk (H), combination of 20 and 60 % of husk with gravel (H(20)G(80) and H(60)G(40)) and a pipe without envelope (NE). Due to higher drain discharge and more sodium removal (lower SAR in drain water), treatment H with the discharge of 16.2 ml/min and SAR of 1.27 (meq/l)(0.5) was better in comparison with other treatments.																	1611-2490	1611-2504				MAR	2017	15	2					299	306		10.1007/s10333-016-0549-8								WOS:000395172800007

Pyrethroids levels in paddy field water under Mediterranean conditions: measurements and distribution modelling	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												The cultivation of rice (Oriza sativa L.) under Mediterranean conditions regularly requires the use of treated wastewater due to shortage of freshwater. As a consequence, the intensification of rice production to supply the uprising demand of grain could break the stability between agriculture and environment. In this work, we studied the occurrence and distribution of pyrethroids in surface water and groundwater collected during two periods (flooding and dry soil conditions) in paddy fields located in the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Pyrethroids were detected at concentrations ranging from 14 to 1450 ng L-1 in surface water and from 6 to 833 ng L-1 in groundwater. The results obtained were evaluated statistically using principal component analysis, and differences between both sampling campaigns were found, with lower concentrations of the target compounds during the flooding sampling event. Moreover, a geographic information system program was used to represent a model distribution of the obtained results, showing wastewater treatment plants as the main sources of contamination and the decrease of pyrethroids during flooding condition when water flows over the paddy fields. The impact of these compounds on water quality was discussed.

J	Liu, HS; Yoshikawa, N; Tamaki, S				Liu, Haisheng; Yoshikawa, Natsuki; Tamaki, Shohei			Effective method of removing saltwater wedge for preserving agricultural water quality	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												Saltwater wedge intrusion often renders the quality of water from the Shinkawa River in the city of Niigata (Japan) unsuitable for agricultural use. To determine an effective and economic strategy to limit this intrusion and prevent irrigation water from contamination by seawater, we propose a countermeasure, pushing the saltwater layer outside the river through submerged flow generated by sluice gates near the river mouth. To demonstrate this effect, an in situ experiment was conducted. During that experiment, longitudinal and vertical distributions of the saltwater wedge were observed by an acoustic profiling system and electrical conductivity meters. As a result, elevation of the density interface between freshwater and saltwater was reduced by 1.04 m on average and the longitudinal extent of the saltwater wedge was withdrawn by 1.08 km seawards over about 4 h. With the intrusion extent shortened and the density interface lowered, three of five intake pumping stations could operate without risk of saltwater mixture into irrigation water, and the risk to two other intake pumping stations was reduced. We conclude that the use of the sluice gates to generate submerged flow underneath them is an effective countermeasure to limit the saltwater wedge intrusion along the Shinkawa River and preserve the agricultural water quality during irrigation season. This method may be used in other estuaries suffering from saltwater wedge intrusion.																	1611-2490	1611-2504				MAR	2017	15	2					331	341		10.1007/s10333-016-0552-0								WOS:000395172800010

Designing constructed wetlands for reclamation of pretreated wastewater and stormwater	REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY												Wastewater reclamation is getting greater attention as an alternative to conventional approaches to wastewater treatment and water supply due to increasing water stress coupled with more stringent water quality limitation for discharge of treated wastewater. Among the few technologies adopted in the field for wastewater reclamation, constructed wetlands have been used to reclaim both primary and secondary treated wastewater in regions with arid and humid climates. This paper summarizes the widely adopted guidelines that need to be considered when designing constructed wetlands for wastewater reclamation, discusses the capacity of wetland treatment systems for water reuse while assessing the status of full-scale constructed wetlands designed for wastewater reclamation, and develops contaminant loading charts as a design tool based on the performance of existing full-scale constructed wetlands deployed for wastewater reclamation. It is evident that constructed wetland systems provide a viable means to treat wastewater to the levels required for low-quality reuses such as restricted irrigation and impoundment. It is challenging for constructed wetlands to consistently meet microbiological guidelines for high-quality reuses such as unrestricted agricultural and urban reuses. Wastewater reclaimed through constructed wetlands is used mainly for agricultural and landscape irrigation, groundwater recharge, indirect potable reuse, and environmental reuse. Surface area and hydraulic loading rate of constructed wetlands to be deployed for wastewater reclamation can be estimated with contaminant loading charts derived from monitoring data of existing full-scale operations.

Effects of omnivorous tilapia on water turbidity and primary production dynamics in shallow lakes: implications for ecosystem management	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												The introduction of omnivorous tilapia into a variety of aquatic systems worldwide has led to a number of serious ecological problems. One of the main issues is an increase in water turbidity, which affects not only light penetration but also primary production and the distribution of phytoplankton and benthic algae in shallow lakes. These changes cause deterioration of water quality in these lakes. A 12-week mesocosm experiment was set up to test the hypotheses that omnivorous Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) introduced to a shallow water system will increase turbidity and nutrient levels in the water column and thereby boost growth of phytoplankton and depress benthic algae. Relative to the control treatments, the presence of tilapia led to higher concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the water column, greater biomass of phytoplankton as measured by chlorophyll a (Chl a), greater concentrations of total suspended solids and inorganic suspended solids, lower light intensity, and lower biomass of benthic algae at the sediment surface. A tube-microcosm experiment using P-32 radio tracer indicated that the presence of tilapia accelerated the release of sediment phosphorus (P) into the water column. We conclude that these invasive omnivorous fish not only stimulate growth of phytoplankton in shallow lakes by increasing nutrients in water column, but also depress benthic algal growth by promoting sediment resuspension, leading to increased turbidity of the water. Thus the removal of tilapia could be a useful practice for managers of shallow aquatic ecosystems, promoting benthic primary production and improving water clarity.

Numerical simulations were validated using large column tests set up in the laboratory and monitored during 19 wetting and drying cycles, over approximately two years. Results indicate that a monolayer cover made of either non acid-generating tailings or a till was not able to prevent sulfide oxidation in the underlying reactive tailings, both for the conditions applied in the laboratory and under conditions more representative of field observations. The efficiency of the simulated monolayer cover was highly dependent on the position of the water table. Despite improved water quality, the reactive tailings nonetheless continued to oxidize and generate AMD, even when the water table was close to the surface of the tailings (1 in depth). The results from this study indicate that the efficiency criteria for cover systems on fresh unoxidized tailings may not be directly applicable for pre-oxidized tailings. The paper also presents a few modifications to the MIN3P code that were successfully applied to simulate the hydrogeological and geochemical response of pre-oxidized, already acidic and highly contaminated tailings.

J	Dayton, EA; Whitacre, S; Holloman, C				Dayton, Elizabeth Ann; Whitacre, Shane; Holloman, Christopher			Comparison of three persulfate digestion methods for total phosphorus analysis and estimation of suspended sediments	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												As a result of impairments to fresh surface water quality due to phosphorus enrichment, substantial research effort has been put forth to quantify agricultural runoff phosphorus as related to on-field practices. While the analysis of runoff dissolved phosphorus is well prescribed and leaves little room for variability in methodology, there are several methods and variations of sample preparation reagents as well as analysis procedures for determining runoff total phosphorus. Due to the variation in methodology for determination of total phosphorus and an additional laboratory procedure required to measure suspended solids, the objectives of the current study are to i. compare the performace of three persulfate digestion methods (Acid Persulfate, USGS, and Alkaline Persulfate) for total phosphorus percent recovery across a wide range of suspended sediments (SS), and ii. evaluate the ability of using Al and/or Fe in digestion solution to predict SS as a surrogate to the traditional gravimetric method. Percent recovery of total phosphorus was determined using suspensions prepared from soils collected from 21 agricultural fields in Ohio. The Acid Persulfate method was most effective, with an average total phosphorus percent recovery of 96.6%. The second most effective method was the USGS with an average total phosphorus recovery of 76.1%. However, the Alkaline Persulfate method performed poorly with an average 24.5% total phosphorus recovery. As a result application of Alkaline Persulfate digestion to edge of field monitoring may drastically underestimated runoff total phosphorus. In addition to excellent recovery of total phosphorus, the Acid Persulfate method combined with analysis of Al and Fe by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry provides a robust estimate of total SS. Due to the large quantity of samples that can result from Water quality monitoring, an indirect measure of total SS could be very valuable when time and budget constraints limit the number of procedures that can be run on a single water sample.

Influence of the colonizing substrate on diatom assemblages and implications for bioassessment: a mesocosm experiment	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Although diatoms are important bioindicators of ecological quality, their ecological traits are still not well understood. A major issue is that of substrate preferences, which may result in differences in production, and assemblage structure and composition, and which should therefore be taken into account for ecological quality assessment studies. Thus, in this work, the periphyton grown on sand and ceramic tiles in indoor controlled channels were compared to understand whether substrate differences lead to differences in: periphyton production (chlorophyll-a), chlorophyll-b and c concentrations, diatom assemblages (diversity-Shannon-Wiener, cell density, taxonomic composition, trait proportions), and ecological quality assessments (IPS-'Indice de Polluosensibilit, Sp,cifique'). A combined inoculum of periphyton from four Portuguese streams was introduced to the running channels (six sand and six tile) and left to colonize for 35 days. Epilithic (tiles) and epipsammic (sand) assemblages were sampled at days 14 and 35. We verified that there were no differences in chlorophyll-a concentration over time and between substrates. On both sampling occasions, the epipsammic assemblages had higher concentration of chlorophyll-c and diatom density but without significant differences over time in each substrate. The taxonomic composition was different between substrates and over time. However, these differences were not reflected in ecological quality assessment. The diversity was also similar between substrates in both sampling occasions, but it was higher at day 14. Mobile and stalked species were more abundant over the entire study and differed significantly between substrates, with the epipsammic assemblages presenting higher abundances of both traits. We concluded that the colonizing substrate influences diatom assemblages but not the ecological quality assessment.

Although our understanding of how wastewater effluent impacts fish reproduction is growing, we know very little about how effluent affects non-reproductive physiology and behaviours associated with fitness (such as aggression and activity). To better understand how fish cope with chronic exposure to wastewater effluent in the wild, we caged round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) for three weeks at different distances from a wastewater outflow. We evaluated the effects of this exposure on fish survival, behaviour, metabolism, and respiratory traits. Fish caged inside the WWTP and close to the outfall experienced higher mortality than fish from the reference site. Interestingly, those fish that survived the exposure performed similarly to fish caged at the reference site in tests of aggressive behaviour, startle-responses, and dispersal. Moreover, the fish near WWTP outflow displayed similar resting metabolism (O-2 consumption rates), hypoxia tolerance, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, and blood-oxygen binding affinities as the fish from the more distant reference site. We discuss our findings in relation to exposure site water quality, concentrations of pharmaceutical and personal care product pollutants, and our test species tolerance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Tracking the relative concentration between Bacteroidales DNA markers and culturable Escherichia coli in fecally polluted subtropical seawater: potential use in differentiating fresh and aged pollution	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Routine water quality monitoring practices based on the enumeration of culturable Escherichia coli provides no information about the source or age of fecal pollution. An emerging strategy is to use culturable E.coli and the DNA markers of Bacteroidales complementarily for microbial source tracking. In this study, we consistently observed in seawater microcosms of 3 different conditions that culturable E.coli decayed faster (T-99=1.14 - 4.29 days) than Bacteroidales DNA markers did (T-99=1.81-200.23 days). Concomitantly, the relative concentration between Bacteroidales DNA markers and culturable E.coli increased over time in all treatments. Particularly, the increase during the early stage of the experiments (before T 99 of E.coli was reached) was faster than during the later stage (after T 99 of E.coli was attained). We propose that the tracking of the relative concentration between Bacteroidales DNA markers and culturable E.coli provides an opportunity to differentiate a pollution that is relatively fresh from one that has aged. This method, upon further investigation and validation, could be useful in episodic pollution events where the surge of E.coli concentration causes noncompliance to the single sample maximum criterion that mandates high frequency follow-up monitoring.																	0008-4166	1480-3275				MAR	2017	63	3					252	259		10.1139/cjm-2016-0241								WOS:000395538400008	28177801					
J	Wei, HK; Zhang, Y				Wei, Houkai; Zhang, Yan			Analysis of Impact of Urbanization on Environmental Quality in China	CHINA & WORLD ECONOMY												As a developing country with great regional disparities, China's rapid urbanization has had important impacts on environmental quality. In this study, the drivers-mechanisms-effects (DME) model is built, which shows how element agglomeration, scale growth, knowledge accumulation and industry evolution drive the environmental system to change during the urbanization process. An econometric regression model using provincial panel data is further constructed to empirically analyze the impacts of urbanization on environmental quality. It is shown that during the process of urbanization in China, element agglomeration and knowledge accumulation help to improve environmental quality but with weak positive effect, while growing urban scale and industrial structure have obvious negative effects on environmental quality. The inverted-U shape (up first and then down) change in the environmental quality during China's urbanization process is obvious. It is critical that China concentrates on the transformations of both city development paths and urbanization models to reduce resource and environmental costs as much as possible.																	1671-2234	1749-124X				MAR-APR	2017	25	2					85	106		10.1111/cwe.12195								WOS:000397469900005						
J	Callaghan, NI; MacCormack, TJ				Callaghan, Neal Ingraham; MacCormack, Tyson James			Ecophysiological perspectives on engineered nanomaterial toxicity in fish and crustaceans	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are incorporated into numerous industrial, clinical, food, and consumer products and a significant body of evidence is now available on their toxicity to aquatic organisms. Environmental ENM concentrations are difficult to quantify, but production and release estimates suggest wastewater treatment plant effluent levels ranging from 10(-4) to > 10(1) mu g L-1 for the most common formulations by production volume. Bioavailability and ENM toxicity are heavily influenced by water quality parameters and the physicochemical properties and resulting colloidal behaviour of the particular ENM formulation. ENMs generally induce only mild acute toxicity to most adult fish and crustaceans under environmentally relevant exposure scenarios; however, sensitivity may be considerably higher for certain species and life stages. In adult animals, aquatic ENM exposure often irritates respiratory and digestive epithelia and causes oxidative stress, which can be associated with cardiovascular dysfunction and the activation of immune responses. Direct interactions between ENMs (or their dissolution products) and proteins can also lead to ionoregulatory stress and/or developmental toxicity. Chronic and developmental toxicity have been noted for several common ENMs (e.g. TiO2, Ag), however more data is necessary to accurately characterize long term ecological risks. The bioavailability of ENMs should be limited in saline waters but toxicity has been observed in marine animals, highlighting a need for more study on possible impacts in estuarine and coastal systems. Nano-enabled advancements in industrial processes like water treatment and remediation could provide significant net benefits to the environment and will likely temper the relatively modest impacts of incidental ENM release and exposure.

In this work, we used a 2-year survey data in 25 wetlands distributed throughout Morocco to model duck spatial distribution and to assess the relevance of a set of environmental and anthropogenic factors in predicting site occupancy, by means of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). Mallards and Ferruginous ducks were the most commonly detected species, whereas White-Headed Ducks and Common Pochards were the least detected ones. An inter-annual variation in site occupancy was recorded for Ruddy Shelducks, Red-Crested Pochards and White-Headed Ducks. Geographical location (measured mainly as distance to the coastline and altitude) was the major predictor of the occurrence probability of Ruddy Shelducks, Marbled Teals and Red-Crested Pochards, while human presence and habitat features were the most relevant factors in shaping Mallard's distribution. However, none of the considered environmental and anthropogenic factors explained the distribution patterns of the Ferruginous Duck, Common Pochard and Gadwall. The results of this study clearly show that there are still gaps in our knowledge on factors driving wetland occupancy by breeding Anatidae in Morocco. The pursuit of the investigations, while considering other explanatory factors such as water quality (limnological data), diet, predation, and conservation status, is of great importance to more profoundly understand the dynamics of Moroccan duck populations.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				MAR	2017	32	2					259	269		10.1007/s11284-017-1436-5								WOS:000394982300017						
J	Ding, TD; Zhang, JY; Ni, WM; Li, JY				Ding, Tengda; Zhang, Jianying; Ni, Wanmin; Li, Juying			Combined toxicity of arsenite and dimethylarsenic acid on the freshwater diatom Nitzschia palea	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The toxicity and bioavailability of single arsenic species have been widely investigated, however, the biological effects of mixed arsenic species co-existing in natural waters still remain unknown. The objective of this work was to discern the adverse effects of combined arsenite (As(III)) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) on diatom Nitzschia palea. The combined ecotoxicity of As(III) and DMA on N. palea was observed to be time-dependent and showed dose-effect relation. The toxicity of DMA and As(III) mixture was higher than individual DMA or As(III) when the As(III) concentration was in the range of 0.085-0.316 mg L-1. As the As(III) concentration increased from 0.487 to 0.858 mg L-1, the antagonistic effect was found, which could be due to the higher thiols contents in the thiol-containing proteins (e.g., frustulins, silaffins and other glycoproteins). The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the treatment of mixed arsenic species was found to be at the same level compared to the As-free control after 72 h of exposure, indicating that the co-toxicity of As(III) and DMA on diatom frustules was not significant. Furthermore, the increase of frustule formation rate in the mixture of EC50 As(III)-EC10 DMA at 72 h exposure time indicated that the damaged diatom cell walls was likely repaired gradually. The results from this study suggested that the effects of co-existed arsenic species were concentration-specific and should be considered in the risk assessment of arsenic and development of water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic ecosystems.

Mining activities and the resulting high loads of heavy metals interact with intensive acid rain, and often have great consequences for biodiversity. However, considering the frequently episodic nature of these heavy acid rains, there is little detailed evidence of direct impacts. In 2011 we observed a massive mortality of noble crayfish and stone crayfish in PadrA<yen>sko Special Area of Conservation (SAC) in the Brdy Mountain region of the Czech Republic. Based on concentrations of metals (Al, Fe, As, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn and Hg) in various tissues (gills, hepatopancreas, muscle) of both dead and live crayfish in this locality compared to reference populations, these crayfish had experienced long-term exposure to increased levels of these metals. Here we give detailed documentation of crayfish mortality associated with high metal concentrations in the gills and other tissues of these endangered invertebrates.

J	Proia, L; Romani, A; Sabater, S				Proia, Lorenzo; Romani, Anna; Sabater, Sergi			Biofilm phosphorus uptake capacity as a tool for the assessment of pollutant effects in river ecosystems	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Biofilms are a key component in the nutrient removal from the water column. However, nutrient uptake by biofilms may be hampered by the occurrence of pollutants or other stressors. This study aimed: (i) to investigate the biofilm phosphorus (P) uptake capacity as a relevant process for the maintenance of fluvial water quality and (ii) to explore the sensitivity of this process to different chemical and environmental stressors. We conducted chamber experiments to test for the relevance of biofilm P uptake capacity (PUC) as a tool to detect effects of pollutants on river self-depuration. PUC was calculated by measuring P temporal decay after performing controlled P-spikes in chambers with biofilm-colonized tiles. Four different experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of PUC to: (a) several river waters from increasing polluted sites; (b) the effect of the bactericide triclosan (TCS); (c) the combined effect of TCS and grazers; and (d) the effect of TCS after a drought episode that affected the biofilms. These experiments showed that biofilms decreased their PUC along the pollution gradient. The biofilm PUC was significantly reduced after receiving high TCS concentrations, though lower TCS concentrations also affected the biofilm when this was submitted to grazing pressure. PUC decrease was induced by flow interruption which further enhanced the TCS negative effects. Overall, PUC was sensitive to the effects of pollutants like TCS as well as to the action of biological (grazing) and environmental (drought) factors. The study also showed that multiple stressors enhance the negative effects of pollutants on the PUC of biofilms. Our study values the use of biofilms' PUC as a sensitive ecological-based tool to assess the effects of chemicals on freshwater communities and their derived functioning in river ecosystems.

Two hundred and ninety-two drinking water samples were randomly collected in the study area. These samples were chemically analyzed for three key toxic (in excess) elements such as pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and calcium. Geostatistical techniques such as variogram and kriging were used to investigate the spatial variations of these minerals across the city. The spatial structure for each element was found to be anisotropic, and thus, anisotropic variograms were used. The kriging predictions revealed significant concentrations of the above stated elements at some locations in the study area. While comparing with the World Health Organization, United States Environmental Protection Agency, and Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency standards, the water samples were found to be unsatisfactory for drinking. We conclude that the drinking water in this region is of poor quality and needs proper treatment to make it palatable.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2017	189	3							119	10.1007/s10661-017-5822-9								WOS:000395000800026	28220444

Aquatic monitoring programs conducted during environmental impact assessments in Canada: preliminary assessment before and after weakened environmental regulation	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Aquatic monitoring programs are imperative for the functioning of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process and a cornerstone for industrial compliance in Canada. However, in 2012, several leading pieces of federal environmental legislation (e.g., Canadian Environmental Assessment Act c. 19, s. 52, 2012) were drastically altered, effectively weakening levels of environmental protection for aquatic ecosystems during project developments. This paper assesses the impact of CEAA 2012 on aquatic monitoring programs (and subsequent monitoring data reporting) across Canada for ten projects (five completed preCEAA 2012 and five completed post-CEAA 2012). Projects included four energy and six mining projects and were selected based on the following criteria: (i) representative of Canada's resource economy; (ii) project information was publicly available; and (iii) strong public interest. Projects pre-and post-CEAA 2012 exhibited few apparent differences before and after environmental regulatory changes. However, wide discrepancies exist in numbers and types of parameters reported, along with a lack of consistency in reporting. Projects pre-CEAA 2012 provided more follow-up monitoring commitments. Although qualitative differences remain inconclusive, this paper highlights requirements for further assessment of aquatic monitoring and follow-up programs in Canada. Recommendations for the government to consider during reviews of the federal environmental assessment processes include (i) improved transparency on the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency website (https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/); (ii) creation of a legally binding standardized aquatic monitoring program framework to ensure that all Canadian aquatic ecosystems are monitored with equal rigour; and (iii) commitments and justification related to frequency of aquatic monitoring of water quality.

Hydrochemical characterization and pollution assessment of groundwater in Jammu Siwaliks, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Physico-chemical groundwater (GW) parameters were evaluated to understand the hydrogeochemical processes in the Siwalik plains of Jammu and Kashmir, India. During the 2012-2013 post-monsoon (POM) and pre-monsoon (PRM) seasons, GW samples (n = 207) from deep bore wells and shallow open wells were chemically analysed. Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+ and Fe2+) and anions (HCO3, Cl-, SO4 (2)-and F-) showed a wide spatio-temporal variation. Results suggest that weathering and dissolution of carbonates and silicate rocks is the main source of water mineralization. The major hydrochemical facies is characterized by CaMg- HCO3 and Ca-HCO3 during the PRM and POM seasons respectively. The presence of sulphate-bearing water in a large number of the samples indicates a significant role of gypsum dissolution and anthropogenic contamination of the GW. Factor analysis (FA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) revealed that the variability of hydrochemistry is mainly related to rockwater interaction, dissolution of carbonates and other lithological units as well as the influence of anthropogenic activities in the area. Overall, it was found that the GW quality is within the limits of human consumption. The higher concentration of a few chemicals indicates an increasing trend of industrial contamination of the GW. For sustainable development of the portableGWin Siwaliks, it is necessary to minimize the adverse impacts of the anthropogenic and industrial contamination on the GW resources through best management practices and prevent its further contamination to a level that could make GW unsuitable for human uses.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Long-term data from a network of intensively monitored research catchments in Finland was analysed. We studied temporal (1981-2010) and spatial variability in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), from 1987 losses, both from agricultural and forestry land. Based on trend analysis, total nitrogen (TN) concentrations increased in two of the four agricultural sites and in most of the forested sites. In agricultural catchments, the total phosphorus (TP) trends were decreasing in two of the four catchments studied. Dissolved P (DRP) concentrations increased in two catchments and decreased in one. The increase in DRP concentration can be a result of reducing erosion by increased non-plough cultivation and direct sowing. In forested catchments, the TP trends in 1987-2011 were significantly decreasing in three of the six catchments, while DRP concentrations decreased significantly in all sites. At the same time, P fertilisation in Finnish forests has decreased significantly, thus contributing to these changes. The mean annual specific loss for agricultural land was on average 15.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for N and 1.1 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for P. In the national scale, total TN loading from agriculture varied between 34,000-37,000 t year(-1) and total P loading 2400-2700 t year(-1) These new load estimates are of the same order than those reported earlier, emphasising the need for more efforts with wide-ranging and carefully targeted implementation of water protection measures.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAR	2017	189	3							95	10.1007/s10661-017-5791-z								WOS:000395000800002	28161881

This paper summarized available data in the published literature (2008-2016) on water fluoride from the EFAs in China before and after water quality was improved. Based on these obtained data, health risk assessment of Chinese residents' exposure to fluoride in improved drinking water was performed by means of a probabilistic approach. The uncertainties in the risk estimates were quantified using Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis. Our results showed that in general, the average fluoride levels (0.10-2.24 mg/L) in the improved drinking water in the EFAs of China were lower than the pre-intervention levels (0.30-15.24 mg/L). The highest fluoride levels were detected in North and Southwest China. The mean non-carcinogenic risks associated with consumption of the improved drinking water for Chinese residents were mostly accepted (hazard quotient < 1), but the non carcinogenic risk of children in most of the EFAs at the 95th percentile exceeded the safe level of 1, indicating the potential non-cancer-causing health effects on this fluoride-exposed population. Sensitivity analyses indicated that fluoride concentration in drinking water, ingestion rate of water, and the exposure time in the shower were the most relevant variables in the model, therefore, efforts should focus mainly on the definition of their probability distributions for a more accurate risk assessment.

In this study, several online real-time sensors were utilized to monitor effluent from a wastewater fed laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) under natural and simulated failure conditions. These simulated failures included adding reactor mixed liquor to emulate a membrane breach, and spiking MS2 bacteriophage into the reactor to create a high viral load, which might be observed during an outbreak. The CANARY event detection software was used to analyze sensor data and report changes in water quality that might be indicative of poor system behavior. During simulated failure conditions, CANARY reported 20 alarms, accurately detecting each failure. During natural operating conditions, 219 alarms were produced and 189 were attributed to known events (e.g., system and sensor maintenance). The remaining alarms (23) during natural operating conditions were considered to have an unknown cause. However, 13 of those had signal deviations similar to known events, but could not be definitively linked to a source. The results of this study suggest that real-time monitoring in conjunction with CANARY analysis may be useful as an early warning system for monitoring the effluent of water reuse systems, and may help to quickly identify treatment malfunctions or other abnormal conditions.

Lessons and guidance for the management of safe drinking water during extreme weather events	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Extreme weather events have presented significant challenges to drinking water quality managers in Australia and elsewhere. Examples of extreme weather events include droughts, floods, cyclones, and wildfires. With global climate change, an increased frequency and severity of diverse extreme weather events is projected for many parts of the world. As such, the need to effectively prepare for and manage these types of extreme events is increasing. Previous experience with managing water supplies before, during and after extreme weather events can provide valuable lessons to aid planning for future events. By surveying Australian water utilities, detailed experiences and lessons from ten case studies of the management of extreme weather events was compiled. The weather events and their impacts to water quality management are described. The lessons learned from these events were used to establish a series of recommendations intended to be used as guidance for future management of extreme events. An important finding was the need to lead change and coordinate effort by the development of a formal whole-of-organisation strategy for building resilience to extreme events. Effective components of such a strategy include the implementation of a water quality management system and the development of specific incident response plans. The development and maintenance of inter-agency relationships was also found to be important and the use of inter-agency hypothetical scenario testing was identified as an effective way to support this. Strategies identified to assist in maintaining operations during and immediately following extreme weather events include the enactment of incident response plans, effective communication and, where possible, the implementation of short-term risk management controls. Post-event activities were also identified, including event recovery, learning from experiences and knowledge dissemination. The guidance presented in this paper will be of value to water quality managers throughout the world as they plan to enhance resilience within their organisations and services.

Water treatment process evaluation of wildfire-affected sediment leachates	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												The recent increase in wildfire activity has raised concerns among many water utilities that rely on forested watersheds susceptible to wildfire for drinking water supplies. An understanding of post-fire treatment challenges, and guidance on how water providers can prepare is needed. In this study, dark, charred, river-bank sediment deposits were collected from the High Park fire burn area in northern Colorado, USA and leached in the laboratory to simulate the impact of post-fire runoff on source water quality. A comparison of the sediment leachates to post-fire river samples collected during flow events indicated the turbidity, phosphorus, nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon concentrations were similar, although the leachates do not reflect extreme concentrations observed in the field. The treatability of the leachates was evaluated with conventional coagulation and additional unit processes (pre-oxidation, powdered activated carbon, biofiltration), and samples were analyzed for disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation. Material leached from the sediments was enriched in haloacetonitrile (HAN) and chloropicrin precursors compared to baseline organic material of source waters, whereas total trihalomethane and haloacetic acid precursor reactivity were not statistically different from baseline source waters. Sediment leachates were amenable to conventional coagulation (25 mg L-1 aluminum sulfate), but may require additional treatment to meet DBP maximum contaminant levels. Enhanced coagulation (50 mg L-1) or pre-ozonation followed by conventional treatment are recommended as the best options for reducing carbonaceous DBP formation. Pre-ozonation/coagulation/biofiltration resulted in the lowest HAN and chloropicrin formation of the sediment leachates.

Between 1967 and 2011, this bay was a highly enclosed area by a bay-mouth breakwater, and while the breakwater provided calm conditions suitable for aquaculture, there was concern about water quality deterioration. The Tohoku Earthquake off the Pacific coast and the subsequent major tsunami on 11 March 2011 caused extensive damage to the Sanriku Coast, resulting in the collapse of the breakwater of Ofunato Bay. We analyzed the monthly hydrographic observational data that were collected between 1996 and 2015, supplemented with hydrographic observations and direct current measurements that were carried out after the earthquake. The historical hydrographic observational data showed the lowest dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were observed near the bottom in the bay. The average and standard deviation of the lowest DO concentrations of each monthly observation during the period before and after the earthquake were 5.81 +/- 3.72 and 7.22 +/- 1.49mgL(-1), respectively, and are significantly different. The oceanic water inflow and water exchange rate estimated by a box model based on the salt budget under the steady-state estuarine circulation were also significantly different before and after the earthquake. An increase in the inflow of oceanic water and the more rapid water exchange in the bay after the earthquake induced marked improvements in the bottom DO concentration. These changes are considered to be attributable to the improved circulation of oceanic water in the bay that resulted from the collapse of the bay-mouth breakwater.																	1054-6006	1365-2419				MAR	2017	26	2			SI		114	127		10.1111/fog.12184								WOS:000394999800003

We evaluated PO43-, as soluble reactive P (SRP), and NH4+ uptake in 2 chronically enriched Pampean streams with different macrophytic abundance. We performed short-term nutrient additions to quantify SRP and NH4+ uptake metrics throughout the year, and we investigated which hydrological and biological factors influenced nutrient uptake. The results showed that SRP and NH4+ uptakes were high in relation to pristine and impaired streams elsewhere, and they did not saturate despite elevated background nutrient levels. NH4+ areal uptake rate fit in a 1st-order uptake model, but an exponential model described the relationship between SRP areal uptake rate and SRP concentration. Consistent with this finding, SRP uptake velocity tended to increase linearly, and SRP uptake length decreased linearly with SRP concentration. The analysis of factors influencing uptake metrics suggested that SRP uptake mainly depended on heterotrophic demand, whereas NH4+ uptake was enhanced under more autotrophic conditions. Our results showed that nutrient uptake metrics of enriched Pampean streams were similar to those observed in streams with low nutrient levels.

The effects of urbanization on trophic relationships in constructed wetlands	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Constructed stormwater wetlands are one strategy for mitigating the negative effects of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems. However, the biotic community in these wetlands generally is dominated by organisms able to tolerate poor water quality. Reduced macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance in comparison to natural wetlands, and prevalence of invasive species, such as Gambusia, can influence the flow of energy through food webs. We used stable -isotope analysis (813C and 8'5N) of food webs to assess whether the amount of catchment urbanization (total imperviousness [imperviousness] = % catchment covered in impervious surfaces) influenced basal resources and trophic relationships in constructed wetlands in Melbourne, Australia. As imperviousness increased, the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates decreased significantly and the values of 813C and 815N recorded for fishes and macroinvertebrates increased significantly. An increase in imperviousness was associated with a decrease in the mean trophic position of fishes and an increase in the mean trophic position of macroinvertebrates. Our results suggest that sources of C differed between sites of low and high imperviousness and that N sources increased with increasing imperviousness. Our study provides an understanding of the likely consequences of disturbance associated with urbanization on the foodweb structure of constructed wetlands.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				MAR	2017	36	1					138	150		10.1086/690674								WOS:000394633500012

FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Current freshwater biomonitoring with diatoms is based on microscopic examination of the morphology of their silica skeleton. This standardized approach is time consuming and requires a high degree of taxonomic expertise. Metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has great potential for next-generation biomonitoring applications but requires standardization. Molecular inventories are strongly influenced by the DNA extraction method used, but the effect of extraction protocols has not been tested to enable selection of the best DNA extraction method for HTS metabarcoding. We used 5 DNA extraction methods combining various types of cell lysis and DNA purification to extract DNA from 8 pure diatom cultures and 8 samples from streams and lakes with differing water quality. We compared the methods based on: 1) quality and purity of the extracted DNA, 2) community inventories obtained from HTS targeting the ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) barcode, and 3) similarity between molecular and microscopy-based inventories of community composition and the Specific Pollution sensitivity Index [SPI]. A method based on GenEluteTM-LPA had higher extraction efficiency than the 4 commercial kits but had the highest polymerase chain reaction inhibition level. All 5 methods were efficient for HTS, and method did not affect operational taxonomic unit richness. We observed variations in the relative abundance of some taxa within Nitzschia, Amphora, Encyonerna, Gomphonema, and Navicula between 2 of the 5 methods, but method did not affect global diatom community composition or SPI values.

An Integrated Vegetated Ditch System Reduces Chlorpyrifos Loading in Agricultural Runoff	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												Agricultural runoff containing toxic concentrations of the organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos has led to impaired water body listings and total maximum daily load restrictions in California's central coast watersheds. Chlorpyrifos use is now tightly regulated by the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board. This study evaluated treatments designed to reduce chlorpyrifos in agricultural runoff. Initial trials evaluated the efficacy of 3 different drainage ditch installations individually: compost filters, granulated activated carbon (GAC) filters, and native grasses in a vegetated ditch. Treatments were compared to bare ditch controls, and experiments were conducted with simulated runoff spiked with chlorpyrifos at a 1.9 L/s flow rate. Chlorpyrifos concentrations and toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia were measured at the input and output of the system. Input concentrations of chlorpyrifos ranged from 858ng/L to 2840ng/L. Carbon filters and vegetation provided the greatest load reduction of chlorpyrifos (99% and 90%, respectively). Toxicity was completely removed in only one of the carbon filter trials. A second set of trials evaluated an integrated approach combining all 3 treatments. Three trials were conducted each at 3.2 L/s and 6.3 L/s flow rates at input concentrations ranging from 282ng/L to 973ng/L. Chlorpyrifos loadings were reduced by an average of 98% at the low flow rate and 94% at the high flow rate. Final chlorpyrifos concentrations ranged from nondetect (< 50ng/L) to 82ng/L. Toxicity to C. dubia was eliminated in 3 of 6 integrated trials. Modeling of the ditch and its components informed design alterations that are intended to eventually remove up to 100% of pesticides and sediment. Future work includes investigating the adsorption capacity of GAC, costs associated with GAC disposal, and real-world field trials to further reduce model uncertainties and confirm design optimization. Trials with more water-soluble pesticides such as neonicotinoids are also recommended. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:423-430.

The objective of this study was to assess the bacterial composition of the edible oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae in urban and preserved estuaries. Particularly, we assessed the presence of pathogenic bacteria, investigated antibiotic susceptibility in bacterial isolates, and quantified beta-lactam antibiotic resistance genes (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and bla(KPC)) via quantitative PCR of oyster DNA. Our results detected total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and enterobacteria in the oysters from urban estuaries, which is indicative of poor water quality. In addition, our detection of the eaeA and stxA2 virulence genes in 16.7% of E. coli isolates from oysters from this region suggests the presence of multiantibiotic-resistant enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic E. coli strains. During periods of low precipitation, increased contamination by E. coli (in winter) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus (in autumn) was observed. In contrast, cultivated oysters inhabiting monitored farms in preserved areas had low levels of bacterial contamination, emphasizing that oyster culture monitoring enhances food quality and makes oysters fit for human consumption. Distinct antibiotic resistance profiles were observed in bacteria isolated from oysters collected from different areas, including resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. The presence of the bla(TEM) gene in 91.3% of oyster samples indicated that microorganisms in estuarine water conferred the capability to produce beta-lactamase. To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly quantify and detect beta-lactam antibiotic resistance genes in oysters. We believe our study provides baseline data for bacterial dynamics in estuarine oysters; such knowledge contributes to developing risk assessments to determine the associated hazards and consequences of consuming oysters from aquatic environments containing pathogenic bacteria that may possess antibiotic resistance genes.

To date, no attempts have been made to study the effects of BC in combination with PAM on the decomposition of soil SOM and plant residues. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of BC, PAM, and their combination on the decomposition of SOM and alfalfa residues. An 80-day incubation experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of oak wood biochar (BC; 10 Mg ha(-1)), PAM (80 kg ha(-1)), and their combination (BC + PAM) on decomposition of SOM and C-14-labeled alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) residues by measuring CO2 efflux, microbial biomass, and specific respiration activity. No conditioner exerted a significant effect on SOM decomposition over the 80 days of incubation. PAM increased cumulative CO2 efflux at 55-80 days of incubation on average of 6.7 % compared to the soil with plant residue. This was confirmed by the increased MBN and (MBC)-C-14 at 80 days of incubation in PAM-treated soil with plant residue compared to the control. In contrast, BC and BC + PAM decreased plant residue decomposition compared to that in PAM-treated soil and the respective control soil during the 80 days. BC and BC + PAM decreased MBC in soil at 2 days of incubation indicated that BC suppressed soil microorganisms and, therefore, decreased the decomposition of plant residue. The addition of oak wood BC alone or in combination with PAM to soil decreased the decomposition of plant residue.

J	Chopin, P; Blazy, JM; Guinde, L; Tournebize, R; Dore, T				Chopin, Pierre; Blazy, Jean-Marc; Guinde, Loic; Tournebize, Regis; Dore, Thierry			A novel approach for assessing the contribution of agricultural systems to the sustainable development of regions with multi-scale indicators: Application to Guadeloupe	LAND USE POLICY												The assessment of agriculture at a regional scale is necessary to better guide regional agricultural planning. To improve the contribution of agriculture to sustainable regional development, assessments must take account of the locations and diversity of cropping systems. We have therefore developed a method based on a set of multi-scale indicators to assess the contribution of agriculture to the sustainable development of regions, and its evolution over time. This method can identify: i) sustainability issues, ii) relevant indicators that will provide information on impacts at the field scale, iii) a method to aggregate indicators, iv) data on cropping systems, and v) a database containing spatial units to analyse the whole region. Application of this method to Guadeloupe (2004-2010) enabled the definition of ten issues and 16 indicators, with three procedures to aggregate information from 36 cropping systems allocated to 11,908 fields between 2004 and 2010. Economic, social and environmental sustainability was poor in 2004, with high dependency on subsidies (47.3 M(sic)yr(-1)), low agricultural added value (48.5 M(sic)yr(-1)), low employment (only 1799 workers), significant risks of crop contamination and pressure on water quality. The total value of subsidies and the risks of river pollution tended to decrease between 2004 and 2010 because of a reduction in intensive banana cropping systems. In parallel, we were able to see that sugar cane, the most widespread crop in Guadeloupe, made only a small contribution to employment and food self-sufficiency during the studied period. The spatial representation revealed that improvements have been seen in southern Guadeloupe due to reductions in banana cultivation. This method was therefore helpful in identifying the most critical agricultural development issues and helping to highlight areas where relevant agricultural land use policies could be formulated.

J	Thorsoe, MH; Graversgaard, M; Noe, E				Thorsoe, Martin Hvarregaard; Graversgaard, Morten; Noe, Egon			The challenge of legitimizing spatially differentiated regulation: Experiences from the implementation of the Danish Buffer zone act	LAND USE POLICY												Differentiating regulation is a promising approach to agri-environmental regulation that may potentially reduce the environmental impact of agriculture at the lowest possible costs for the farmers and society, but also possesses a number of challenges. In this article, we explore the challenges to the legitimacy of agri-environmental regulation that occurs when the regulatory regime changes from general regulation to differentiated regulation. The analysis is based on a case study of the implementation of the Buffer zone act in Denmark - a regulation that prevents agricultural production in a 10 (later 9) meter fringe around selected waterbodies. We distinguish between two different ways of legitimizing: Producing knowledge and participation. We conclude that to harvest some of the obvious benefits of differentiated regulation a number of challenges must be resolved, 1) ensuring legitimacy of differentiated regulation is crucial, 2) differentiated regulation imply that farmers are also differentiated,3) differentiated regulation implies new uncertainties, 4) the current knowledge regime need to be reconfigured, 5) stakeholders feel that they are unevenly treated and 6) it is difficult to establish a win-win solution for all farmers on an individual level.

In this paper we analyse the phytoplankton assemblages in three sectors of the Adriatic Sea, the northernmost part of the Mediterranean, characterized by different trophic conditions and by variables highly correlated. Our main aim is to assess the environmental status of coastal waters by analysing the dependence of the Fp-ratio (index of trophic status by pigment signatures, Claustre in Limnol Oceanogr 39(5):1206-1210, 1994), from the total biomass and the cell size structure of the phytoplankton communities (Chlorophyll a), the salinity and the temperature of the Adriatic Sea via some variants of the partial least squares regression model (Durand in Chemometr Intell Lab Syst 58:235-246, 2001; Lombardo et al. in J Chemometr 23(12):605-617, 2009). The findings of the analysis confirm the utility of the Fp-ratio as indicator of the trophic status of the coastal waters.																	0033-5177	1573-7845				MAR	2017	51	2			SI		799	812		10.1007/s11135-016-0440-0								WOS:000395001500020

Vegetation cover and rainfall seasonality impact nutrient loss via runoff and erosion in the Colombian Andes	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												Mountain ecosystems provide key services to a large portion of the population in the tropics. However, they are particularly vulnerable to regional environmental changes such as soil degradation, via soil erosion and associated nutrient loss, both dissolved in runoff and suspended in sediment. Current trends in land use conversion combined with projections of intensified hydrological extremes potentially amplify these threats. We analyze the interactive effects of rainfall characteristics (at three time scales) and vegetation cover on the runoff-erosion-nutrient loss progression for a group of vegetation cover types that represent different land use conversion stages. After a year of observations we found, as expected, that natural forests have the highest potential for regulating precipitationrunoff- erosion-nutrient loss. The highest amounts of runoff occurred in pasturelands, and croplands had the highest erosion losses. Croplands showed the highest concentrations of soluble nutrients in runoff and in sediment. However, due to higher runoff amounts, pasturelands had the greatest loss of dissolved nutrients. Precipitation seasonality significantly influenced both erosion and nutrient loss. This is particularly critical in managed agricultural and pasture systems where increased runoff and erosion rates, combined with unsustainable management practices, may lead to alterations in soil and water quality. Our results indicate how agricultural practices need to adapt fertilization scheduling to rainfall seasonality to minimize potential environmental impacts. Collectively, our results highlight a fundamental management need in tropical mountains where the combination of rapid land use change and altered climate threatens ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				MAR	2017	17	3					827	839		10.1007/s10113-016-1071-7								WOS:000394991000017

The role and value of diverse sward mixtures in dairy farm systems of New Zealand: An exploratory assessment	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												New Zealand dairy farm systems mostly rely on ryegrass-white clover pastures. The inclusion of diverse sward mixtures within these systems offers a novel strategy to improve economic and environmental outcomes. However, the degree to which these mixtures offer advantages over traditional pastures is unknown. This analysis seeks to explore the role and value of diverse mixtures to New Zealand dairy farms, through integrating the results of recent experimental research involving diverse sward mixtures with an existing whole-farm model. An exploratory assessment is required to determine further investment in these species, guide further data collection and experimental design, and understand traits of high value to farming systems. Model output suggests that the economic incentives associated with the use of diverse swards are too weak on their own to motivate wide-scale adoption under standard conditions. This finding is highly robust to changes in the milk price. However, given societal concern pertaining to water-quality deterioration, reductions in the levels of nitrogen lost from dairy farms are found to add substantially to the value proposition offered by alternative sward species. Reductions in nitrogen leaching of about 40% were predicted here when all the sward area on the farm is sown to diverse sward mixtures, compared with standard mixtures. This is mainly derived from a reduction in the concentration of nitrogen present in urine, and to a much lesser extent by a reduction in the total amount of urinary nitrogen excreted by cows. Overall, diverse swards appear to be a cost-effective way to reduce nitrogen leaching, which is relevant for a dairy sector facing regulatory constraints. Nevertheless, the need to understand and improve the persistence of diverse swards is important to reduce the cost of pasture establishment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Chemometrics such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Cluster analysis (CA) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) were employed to identify anthropogenic and natural influences on estuary water quality. The scores of stations in the surface layer in the first principal component (PC1) were related to NH4-N, PO4-P, NO2-N, NO3-N, TP, and Chlorophyll a while salinity, turbidity, and SiO3-Si in the second principal component (PC2). Similarly, the scores of stations in the bottom layers in PC1 were related to PO4-P, NO2-N, NO3-N, and TP, while salinity, Chlorophyll a, NH4-N, and SiO3-Si in PC2. Results of the PCA identified the spatial distribution of the surface and bottom water quality, namely the Guangzhou urban reach, Middle reach, and Lower reach of the estuary. Both cluster analysis and PCA produced the similar results. Self-organizing map delineated the Guangzhou urban reach of the Pearl River that was mainly influenced by human activities. The middle and lower reaches of the PRE were mainly influenced by the waters in the South China Sea. The information extracted by PCA, CA, and SOM would be very useful to regional agencies in developing a strategy to carry out scientific plans for resource use based on marine system functions.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				MAR	2017	11	1					114	126		10.1007/s11707-016-0585-0								WOS:000394181200010

Population Structure, Status, and Conservation of Two Graptemys Species from the Pearl River, Mississippi	JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY												Graptemys is one of the least studied turtle genera in North America. Graptemys oculifera (Ringed Sawback) and Graptemys pearlensis (Pearl Map Turtle) are endemic to the Pearl River system of Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana. We studied both species near Columbia, Mississippi, on the Pearl River via a trapping and basking surveys over two years. Additionally, five sites including Columbia were trapped for 27 years to determine long-term trends in capture success and relative abundance (RA). At the Columbia site, body size distribution was bimodal for G. oculifera and atypically unimodal for G. pearlensis; G. pearlensis body lengths were smaller than museum specimens. Population estimates for G. oculifera at the Columbia site indicate a stable population over 25 years. Long-term RA trends indicated that G. pearlensis was less common than G. oculifera in all periods and at all sites from 1988 to 2013. Trends in long-term capture success for G. oculifera and G. pearlensis were negative at all sites, with significant declines at three sites for both G. oculifera and G. pearlensis. Declines occurred both upstream and downstream of a major reservoir. Therefore, a combination of factors (including altered hydrology, human disturbance, lack of recruitment, excessive sedimentation, impaired water quality, and/or the pet trade) appear to be contributing to declines. Additional conservation and protection is warranted for G. pearlensis, and current protections for G. oculifera should be extended. Future studies should continue at our long-term sites to determine whether population declines persist or whether populations stabilize.																	0022-1511	1937-2418				MAR	2017	51	1					27	36		10.1670/15-082								WOS:000393797600005

In this context, drinking water sources are severely affected, including adverse effects on agriculture, health, fisheries and the ecosystem. This research investigates i) selected water quality parameters ii) local people's perception on drinking water scarcity iii) how local people's cope with safe drinking water scarcity. This research was conducted using local water samples, questionnaire survey of 200 households and 4 focus group discussions (FDGs) in Shyamnagar and Tala subdistrict of Satkhira district. The study of the water quality parameters exposed the extreme conditions of the drinking water sources in the area. The average values of total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC) and Chloride concentration (Cl-) were found respectively 4044.12 mg/L, 7186.7 mu S/cm, and 3143.6 mg/L in Shyamnagar and 2313.60 mg/L, 43903 mu S/cm, and 1402.1 mg/L in Tala. The result of community perception reveals that local people are aware of the safe water scarcity and nearly all of them perceive that salinity is the main reason behind it. Even though there are a number of socioeconomic factors, communities have their own adaptation technologies to cope with the problem. The study concludes with the development of a community based model defining the key responsibilities of the stakeholders, including local and central government, NGOs and community people to work in a well coordinated manner which will be effective for reducing the scarcity of the safe drinking water.

J	Goovaerts, P				Goovaerts, Pierre			The drinking water contamination crisis in Flint: Modeling temporal trends of lead level since returning to Detroit water system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Since Flint returned to its pre-crisis source of drinking water close to 25,000 water samples have been collected and tested for lead and copper in >10,000 residences. This paper presents the first analysis and time trend modeling of lead data, providing new insights about the impact of this intervention. The analysis started with geocoding all water lead levels (WLL) measured during an 11-month period following the return to the Detroit water supply. Each data was allocated to the corresponding tax parcel unit and linked to secondary datasets, such as the composition of service lines, year built, or census tract poverty level. Only data collected on residential parcels within the City limits were used in the analysis. One key feature of Flint data is their collection through two different sampling initiatives: (i) voluntary or homeowner-driven sampling whereby concerned citizens decided to acquire a testing kit and conduct sampling on their own (non-sentinel sites), and (ii) State-controlled sampling where data were collected bi-weekly at selected sites after training of residents by technical teams (sentinel sites). Temporal trends modeled from these two datasets were found to be statistically different with fewer sentinel data exceeding WLL thresholds ranging from 10 to 50 mu g/L. Even after adjusting for housing characteristics the odds ratio (OR) of measuring WLL above 15 mu g/L at non-sentinel sites is significantly >1 (OR = 1.480) and it increases with the threshold (OR = 2.055 for 50 mu g/L)Joinpoint regression showed that the city-wide percdntage of WLL data above 15 mu g/L displayed four successive trends since the return to Detroit Water System. Despite the recent improvement in water quality, the culprit for differences between sampling programs needs to be identified as it impacts exposure assessment and might influence whether there is compliance or not with the Lead and Copper Rule.

Finding clean water habitats in urban landscapes: professional researcher vs citizen science approaches	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study investigated patterns of nutrient pollution in waterbody types across Greater London. Nitrate and phosphate data were collected by both citizen scientists and professional ecologists and their results were compared. The professional survey comprised 495 randomly selected pond, lake, river, stream and ditch sites. Citizen science survey sites were self-selected and comprised 76 ponds, lakes, rivers and streams. At each site, nutrient concentrations were assessed using field chemistry kits to measure nitrate-N and phosphate-P. The professional and the citizen science datasets both showed that standing waterbodies had significantly lower average nutrient concentrations than running waters. In the professional datasets 46% of ponds and lakes had nutrient levels below the threshold at which biological impairment is likely, whereas only 3% of running waters were unimpaired by nutrients. The citizen science dataset showed the same broad pattern, but there was a trend towards selection of higher quality waterbodies with 77% standing waters and 14% of rivers and streams unimpaired. Waterbody nutrient levels in the professional dataset were broadly correlated with landuse intensity. Rivers and streams had a significantly higher proportion of urban and suburban land cover than other waterbody types. Ponds had higher percentage of semi-natural vegetation within their much smaller catchments. Relationships with land cover and water quality were less apparent in the citizen-collected dataset probably because the areas visited by citizens were less representative of the landscape as whole. The results suggest that standing waterbodies, especially ponds, may represent an important clean water resource within urban areas. Small waterbodies, including ponds, small lakes < 50 ha and ditches, are rarely part of the statutory water quality monitoring programmes and are frequently overlooked. Citizen scientist data have the potential to partly fill this gap if they are co-ordinated to reduce bias in the type and location of the waterbodies selected.																	0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 1	2017	581						105	116		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.11.215								WOS:000394635300011	28069307

Effect of cyclic redox oscillations on water quality in freshwater acid sulfate soil wetlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Restoration of add sulfate soil (ASS) wetlands by freshwater re-flooding can lead to the reformation of various Fe(II) and reduced inorganic sulfur (RIS) species in surface soil layers. However, in many locations, wetland water levels undergo large seasonal fluctuations that drive extreme redox oscillations. Newly formed RIS species [e.g. greigite, mackinawite, nano-pyrite and S(0)1 and Fe(II) are vulnerable to rapid oxidation during dry periods and may generate substantial acidity. Rainfall following a dry period may then mobilise acidity and metal cations in surface waters prior to eventual recovery in pH by re-establishment of reducing conditions. We explore this dry-wet transition by subjecting soil samples from two freshwater re-flooded ASS Wetlands to oxidative incubation for up to 130 days followed by re-flooding simulation for 84 days. During very early stages of re-flooding (up to 7 days) there was an initial pulse-release of aridity, and trace metals/metalloids (Al, Mn, Zn and As). This was followed by a rapid reversion to anoxia, and Fe(III) and SO4 reducing conditions which generated alkalinity, ameliorated acidity and sequestered Fe, S, Zn, Mn and As. Field-observations of surface water quality in an ASS wetland at a sub-catchment scale also confirms re-establishment of SO4 reducing conditions and recovery of pH within similar to 4-8 weeks of re-flooding after dry periods. These observations suggest that retaining surface water in ASS wetlands for similar to 8 weeks after a dry-wet transition will allow sufficient time for alkalinity producing reductive processes to ameliorate most surface water acidity. Although management of freshwater re-flooded ASS wetlands in a highly dynamic climate will remain challenging over the long term and the post-remediation effectiveness of the method depends on initial soil characteristics, knowledge of the timing of redox oscillations and the associated changes in water geochemistry can be helpful for mitigating the risks to downstream estuarine water quality.

For chemical analysis, little or no sample enrichment is often sufficient, while bioanalysis often requires larger sample volumes at a certain enrichment factor for conducting comprehensive bioassays on different endpoints or furthereffect-directed analysis (EDA). To avoid logistic and technical issues related to the storage and transport of large volumes of water, sampling would benefit greatly from onsite extraction. This study presents a novel onsite large volume solid phase extraction (LVSPE) device tailored to fulfill the requirements for the successful effect-based and chemical screening of water resources and complies with available international standards for automated sampling devices. Laboratory recovery experiments using 251 organic compounds in the log D range from -3.6 to 9.4 (at pH 7.0) spiked into pristine water resulted in acceptable recoveries and from 60 to 123% for 159 out of 251 substances. Within a European-wide demonstration program, the LVSPE was able to enrich compounds in concentration ranges over three orders of magnitude (1 ng L-1 to 2400 ng L-1). It was possible to discriminate responsive samples from samples with no or only low effects in a set of six different bioassays "( i.e. acetylcholinesterase and algal growth inhibition, androgenicity, estrogenicity, fish embryo toxicity, glucocorticoid activity). The LVSPE thus proved applicable for onsite extraction of sufficient amounts of water to investigate water quality thoroughly by means of chemical analysis and effect-based tools without the common limitations due to small sample volumes.

Characterizing nutrient distributions and fluxes in a eutrophic reservoir, Midwestern United States	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Harmful algal blooms are increasingly common in aquatic ecosystems and have been linked to runoff from agricultural land. This study investigated the internal nutrient (i.e., phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N)) dynamics of a eutrophic reservoir in the Midwestern United States to constrain the potential for sedimentary nutrients to stimulate harmful algal blooms. The spatial distribution of nutrients in the water column (soluble reactive P (SRP), nitrate/nitrite-N (NOx-N), and ammonium -N (NH4+-N)) and sediments (total P, total carbon (C), total N, and organic matter (OM)) were quantified and mapped. Water column nutrients varied spatially and teniporally, with generally higher concentrations near the dam Wall during normal lake levels. The upper portion of the lake, near the inlet, was sampled during a flood event and had overall higher nutrient ccincentrations and lower chlorophyll levels compared to normal lake level samples. Mean sedimentary total P (936 mg/kg) was similar to 30% higher in the reservoir than the surrounding upland soils, with the highest concentrations near the dam wall (1661 mg/kg) and a significant positive correlation found between sedimentary total P, total C, and OM. Additionally, 15 intact sediment cores were manipulated ex situ to examine mechanisms of nutrient flux across the sediment-Water interface (SWI) that may trigger algal blooms. Core treatment conditions included advection (i.e., simulating potential nutrient fluxes during wind events through sediment resuspension) and diffusion. Core experiments indicated both advective and diffusive conditions at the SWI may trigger the flux of nutrients important for algal growth from lake sediments, with diffusion contributing both N and P to the water column, while intense advection increased water column N, but decreased P. Release of P to the water column may be more diffusion-driven than advection-driven, whereas N release to the water column appears to be both diffusion-and advection-driven. (C) 2017 ElseVier B.V.

Quantifying loading, toxic concentrations, and systemic persistence of chloride in a contemporary mixed-land-use watershed using an experimental watershed approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A nested-scale experimental watershed study was implemented to quantify loading and persistence of chloride in an urbanizing, mixed-land-use watershed. A Midwest USA (Missouri) watershed Was partitioned into five sub basins with contrasting dominant land use. Streamwater was tested for chloride concentration four days per week from October 2009 through May 2014 at each site. Monitoring sites included co-located gauging and climate stations recording variables at 30-minute intervals. Results indicate significant (p < 0.01) differences in chloride concentrations and loading between sites. Loading consistently increased from the forested headwaters (average = 507 kg day(-1)) to primarily Urban watershed terminus (average = 7501 kg day (-1)). Chloride concentrations were highest( average = 83.9 mg L-1) with the greatest frequency of acutely toxic conditions (i.e. 860 mg L-1) mid-watershed. This finding is in-part attributable to the ratio of chloride application to streamflow volume (i.e. increasing flow volume with stream distance resulted in chloride dilution, offsetting increased percent urban land use with stream distance). Results highlight the important, yet often confounding, interactions between pollutant loading and flow dynamics. Chloride peaks occurred during late winter/early spring melting periods, implicating road salt application as the primary contributor to the chloride regime. Floodplain ground water analysis indicated seasonal sink/source relationships between the stream and floodplain, which could con-important implications for resource managers wishing to mitigate water quality and aquatic habitat degradation, and suggest important water quality limitations to stream restoration success in complex urban aquatic ecosystems.

A long-term field experiment, implementing nanotechnology in the form of UltraFiltration (UF) and Reverse Osmosis (RO) for salt removal from treated wastewater, was conducted with secondary effluents, aiming to prove the sustainability of agricultural production using irrigation with treated wastewater. Six outdoor field treatments, each under four replications, were conducted for examining the salt accumulation effects on the soil and the crops. The field experiments proved that crop development is correlated with the water quality as achieved from the wastewater filtration capability of the hybrid nanotechnology system. The key goal was to maintain sustainable food production, despite the low quality of the waters. Of the six treatment methods tested, irrigation with RO-treated effluent produced the best results in terms of its effect on soil salinity and crop yield. Nevertheless, it must be kept in mind that this process is not only costly, but it also removes all organic matter content from the irrigation water, requiring the addition of fertilizers to the effluent.

Samuel; von Gunten, Urs			Formation and reactivity of inorganic and organic chloramines and bromamines during oxidative water treatment	WATER RESEARCH												The formation and further reactions of halamines during oxidative water treatment can be relevant for water quality. In this study, we investigated the formation and reactivity of several inorganic and organic halamines (monochloramine, N-chloromethylamine, N-chlorodimethylamine, monobromamine, dibromamine, N-bromomethylamine, N,N-dibromomethylamine, and N-bromodimethylamine) by kinetic experiments, transformation product analysis, and quantum chemical computations. Kinetic model simulations were conducted to evaluate the relevance of halamines for various water treatment scenarios. Halamines were quickly formed from the reaction of chlorine and bromine with ammonia or organic amines. Species-specific second-order rate constants for the reaction of chlorine and bromine with ammonia, methyl- and dimethylamine were in the order of 10(6)-10(8) M(-1)s(-1). The formed halamines were found to be reactive towards phenolic compounds, forming halogenated phenols via electrophilic aromatic substitution (phenol and resorcinol) or quinones via electron transfer (catechol and hydroquinone). At near neutral pH, apparent second-order rate constants for these reactions were in the order of 10(-4)-10(-1) M(-1)s(-1) for chloramines and 10(1)-10(2) M(-1)s(-1) for bromamines. Quantum chemical computations were used to determine previously unknown aqueous pK(a) values, gas phase bond dissociation energies (BDE) and partial atomic charges of the halamines, allowing a better understanding of their reactivities. Kinetic model simulations, based on the results of this study, showed that during zhlorination inorganic and organic chloramines are the main halamines formed. However, their further reactions with organic matter are outcompeted kinetically by chlorine. During ozonation, mainly inorganic bromamines are formed, since ozone quickly oxidizes organic amines. The further reactions of bromamine are typically outcompeted by ozone and thus generally of minor importance. The use of peracetic acid for saline ballast water treatment can result in the formation of substantial amounts of bromamines, which can react with dissolved organic matter and contribute to the formation of brominated products.

J	Housh, M; Ohar, Z				Housh, Mashor; Ohar, Ziv			Integrating physically based simulators with Event Detection Systems: Multi-site detection approach	WATER RESEARCH												The Fault Detection (FD) Problem in control theory concerns of monitoring a system to identify when a fault has occurred. Two approaches can be distinguished for the FD: Signal processing based FD and Model-based FD. The former concerns of developing algorithms to directly infer faults from sensors' readings, while the latter uses a simulation model of the real-system to analyze the discrepancy between sensors' readings and expected values from the simulation model. Most contamination Event Detection Systems (EDSs) for water distribution systems have followed the signal processing based FD, which relies on analyzing the signals from monitoring stations independently of each other, rather than evaluating all stations simultaneously within an integrated network. In this study, we show that a model-based EDS which utilizes a physically based water quality and hydraulics simulation models, can outperform the signal processing based EDS. We also show that the model-based EDS can facilitate the development of a Multi-Site EDS (MSEDS), which analyzes the data from all the monitoring stations simultaneously within an integrated network. The advantage of the joint analysis in the MSEDS is expressed by increased detection accuracy (higher true positive alarms and fewer false alarms) and shorter detection time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Challenges with secondary use of multi-source water-quality data in the United States	WATER RESEARCH												Combining water-quality data from multiple sources can help counterbalance diminishing resources for stream monitoring in the United States and lead to important regional and national insights that would not otherwise be possible. Individual monitoring organizations understand their own data very well, but issues can arise when their data are combined with data from other organizations that have used different methods for reporting the same common metadata elements. Such use of multi-source data is termed "secondary use"-the use of data beyond the original intent determined by the organization that collected the data. In this study, we surveyed more than 25 million nutrient records collected by 488 organizations in the United States since 1899 to identify major inconsistencies in metadata elements that limit the secondary use of multi-source data. Nearly 14.5 million of these records had missing or ambiguous information for one or more key metadata elements, including (in decreasing order of records affected) sample fraction, chemical form, parameter name, units of measurement, precise numerical value, and remark codes. As a result, metadata harmonization to make secondary use of these multi source data will be time consuming, expensive, and inexact. Different data users may make different assumptions about the same ambiguous data, potentially resulting in different conclusions about important environmental issues. The value of these ambiguous data is estimated at $US12 billion, a substantial collective investment by water-resource organizations in the United States. By comparison, the value of unambiguous data is estimated at $US8.2 billion. The ambiguous data could be preserved for uses beyond the original intent by developing and implementing standardized metadata practices for future and legacy water-quality data throughout the United States.

Effects of nitrate addition on water column methylmercury in Occoquan Reservoir, Virginia, USA	WATER RESEARCH												Mercury bioaccumulation in aquatic biota poses a widespread threat to human and environmental health. Methylmercury (MeHg), the toxic form of mercury, tends to build up under anaerobic conditions in the profundal zones of lakes. In this study we performed a two-year assessment of spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, MeHg, manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) in Occoquan Reservoir, a large run-of-the-river drinking water reservoir in Virginia, USA. A tributary to the reservoir receives input of nitrate-rich tertiary-treated wastewater that enhances the oxidant capacity of bottom water. Multiple lines of evidence supported the hypothesis that the presences of nitrate and/or oxygen in bottom water correlated with low MeHg in bottom water. Bottom water MeHg was significantly lower in a nitrate-rich tributary (annual mean of 0.05 ng/L in both 2012 and 2013) compared to a nitrate-poor tributary (annual mean of 0.58 ng/L in 2012 and 0.21 ng/L in 2013). The presence of nitrate and oxygen in bottom water corresponded with significantly lower bottom water MeHg at an upstream station in the main reservoir (0.05 versus 0.11 ng/L in 2013). In 2012 the reservoir exhibited a longitudinal gradient with nitrate and oxygen decreasing and MeHg and Mn increasing downstream. In both study years, there was a clear threshold of oxygen equivalent (3-5 mg/L), a metric that combines the oxidant capacity of nitrate and oxygen, above which MeHg (<0.05 ng/L), Mn (<0.3 mg/L) and Fe (<0.5 mg/L) were low. Results indicated that the addition of nitrate-rich tertiary-treated wastewater to the bottom of anaerobic reservoirs can reduce MeHg concentrations, and potentially decrease mercury bioaccumulation, while increasing the safe water yield for potable use.

Significant water quality challenges are related to nutrients, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, pathogens, sediments and habitat alteration. To facilitate the challenges posed, there is a need for predictive, spatially distributed models to be developed that encompass the key aspects of agriculture and water management in order to inform future policy and organizations with an interest in land management. Additionally, there needs to be recognition from policy makers that different solutions are needed in different agri-water systems and that it often takes many years or decades for policies to have a sustained water quality impact. Long-term support for research infrastructure and the scientific skills base is required to enable measurement and data analysis necessary to inform decision making. Farmers need clearly articulated information on the issues and potential solutions on which to make informed management decisions regarding water. There are existing solutions to some problems and this knowledge needs to be effectively disseminated with appropriate incentives for implementation to have maximum impact. Greater collaboration between researchers, industry, and policy makers, with the necessary framework to deliver effective joint working, is urgently needed. There is also a need for a wider societal understanding of the land-water system and the various ways in which society pays (and might pay in the future) for the real value of water.

With this increase, there has been a proliferation of studies that assess the physical and ecological responses of rivers to these removals. As more dams are considered for removal, scientific information from these dam-removal studies will increasingly be called upon to inform decisions about whether, and how best, to bring down dams. This raises a critical question: what is the current state of dam-removal science in the United States? To explore the status, trends, and characteristics of dam-removal research in the U.S., we searched the scientific literature and extracted basic information from studies on dam removal. Our literature review illustrates that although over 1200 dams have been removed in the U.S., fewer than 10% have been scientifically evaluated, and most of these studies were short in duration (<4 years) and had limited ( 1-2 years) or no pre-removal monitoring. The majority of studies focused on hydrologic and geomorphic responses to removal rather than biological and water-quality responses, and few studies were published on linkages between physical and ecological components. Our review illustrates the need for long-term, multidisciplinary case studies, with robust study designs, in order to anticipate the effects of dam removal and inform future decision making.

In this work, a remote sensing algorithm was developed to estimate the concentrations of the total suspended sediments (TSS) in large lakes and reservoirs over the MLY basin and was based on a band ratio between 555 nm and 645 nm of the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In situ samples used to calibrate the algorithm were collected from 58 lakes and reservoirs with a TSS range of 1 to 300 mg L-1, and the uncertainty of this algorithm was 30-40%. The algorithm was subsequently applied to a total of 102 lakes and reservoirs located in the MLY basin to derive TSS maps from 2000 to 2014 at a 250 m spatial resolution, and the first comprehensive document of the TSS distributions and dynamics of large inland waters of the MLY basin was created. The seasonal patterns among the selected water bodies were similar, with the largest TSS concentrations occurring in the first and fourth quarters in a year and the lowest values occurring in the third quarter. In contrast, spatial heterogeneities were revealed by the 15-year long-term mean TSS climatology information. Although most lakes downstream of Poyang Lake were turbid with 15-year TSS climatology values of 45-100 mg L-1, waters between Poyang and Doting Lake were relatively clearer with TSS climatology values of 15-45 mg L-1, and the clearest waters (<15 mg L-1) were found in reservoirs. The turbidity of 64.5% (e.g., 49/76) for lakes in Class II exhibited a decreasing trend over the 15-year period, and the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and Dongting Lake in Class I also showed significant TSS declines. Analysis with meteorological data shows that the intra-annual variations appear to be significantly correlated with local precipitation, with a time lag of two months for TSS. The prominent TSS decreasing trend of the lakes in Class,II was probably linked to the significant NDVI increase in the MLY basin, whereas the TSS decrease in the TGR and Dongting Lake is likely to be attributed to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. The TSS environmental data record (EDR) of large inland waters presented in this study serves as an important reference for future water quality monitoring and evaluation in the MLY and in China.

Density-dependent water use in carp polyculture: Impacts on production performance and water productivity	AQUACULTURE												The total water use (TWU) and consumptive water use index (CWUI) in carp polyculture under varying intensity levels [T-1: 6000 fingerlings ha(-1), T-2: 8000 fingerlings ha(-1), T-3: 10,000 fingerlings ha(-1)] were quantified. Treatment-wise estimated TWU was 3.71 x 10(4), 3.92 x 10(4) and 4.34 x 10(4) m(3) hat 180 d(-1) while, the CWUI was 6.38, 5.61 and 5.89 m(3) kg(-1) fish production in T-1, T-2 and T-3, respectively. The estimated evaporation and seepage loss ranged between 2.1-3.1 and 1.9-2.8 m(3) water kg(-1) fish production respectively and contributed significantly to consumptive water use (CWU). Treatment-wise sediment load ranged between 57.1 and 61.1 m(3) t(-1) fish biomass. Faster growth rate and biomass contribution (%) to yield was maximum by C. catla followed by C. mrigala and L. rohita in all the treatments. In this study, under best management practice (T-2),1 m(3) of water produced 178 g of carp biomass and its economic value per unit of water used (USD m(-3)) greatly exceeds that of T-1 and T-3. Among the treatments, minimization of total water use (3.92 x 10(4) m(3)), CWU (2.03 x 10(4) m(3)) and water exchange (0.20 x 10(4) m(3)) at stocking density of 8000 fingerlings ha(-1) (T-2), resulted in higher (P < 0.05) yield (3.62 t ha(-1) 180 d(-1)), output value-cost of cultivation ratio (1.88), net consumptive water productivity (USD 0.15 m(-3)) and lower AFCR (1.74). Further, farming systems with low water exchange, serves to keep the water quality suitable for the fish growth, improves water use efficiency and helps in minimizing the quantity of pollutant outputs. Statement of relevance: This paper presents findings and analysis, from a methodologically rigorous investigation and provides insight regarding density-dependent optimum water use, its effect on pond water quality, sedimentation rate, growth performance and water productivity. The knowledge derived from this study may be a basis to optimize pond rearing efforts in carp polyculture and the water management strategies can be tailored to prevent wasteful use of water and enhance water use efficiency and water productivity.

The greatest prevalence and mean intensity was observed in the gills of Gymnocolymbus ternetzi parasitized by D. kabatai, followed by the protozoan parasite I. multifiliis on the body surface of Xiphophorus maculatus. Histopathological analysis showed epithelial interlamellar hyperplasia of the secondary lamellae, partial fusion of the secondary lamellae, telangiectasia, justalamellar edema and eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. The intestine of cestode parasitized fish showed necrosis in the submucosa, intestinal obstruction and lymphoeosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate. It is important to know the parasitic fauna of farmed fish and the pathogenesis caused by the parasites in order to ensure fish production and the health of the hosts. Statement of relevance: Ornamental fish production as a consolidate activity around the world faces problems of parasite infection leading to fish mortality and economic losses. To ensure farming production, it is important to monitor the status of fish health. Parasitic fauna and histopathological analysis are used as important tools for the diagnosis of tissue lesions.

Biofilm Composition and Threshold Concentration for Growth of Legionella pneumophila on Surfaces Exposed to Flowing Warm Tap Water without Disinfectant	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Legionella pneumophila in potable water installations poses a potential health risk, but quantitative information about its replication in biofilms in relation to water quality is scarce. Therefore, biofilm formation on the surfaces of glass and chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) in contact with tap water at 34 to 39 degrees C was investigated under controlled hydraulic conditions in a model system inoculated with biofilm-grown L. pneumophila. The biofilm on glass (average steady-state concentration, 23 +/- 9 pg ATP cm(-2)) exposed to treated aerobic groundwater (0.3 mg C liter(-1); 1 mu g assimilable organic carbon [AOC] liter(-1)) did not support growth of the organism, which also disappeared from the biofilm on CPVC (49 +/- 9 pg ATP cm(-2)) after initial growth. L. pneumophila attained a level of 4.3 log CFU cm(-2) in the biofilms on glass (1,055 +/- 225 pg ATP cm(-2)) and CPVC (2,755 +/- 460 pg ATP cm(-2)) exposed to treated anaerobic groundwater (7.9 mg C liter(-1); 10 mu g AOC liter(-1)). An elevated biofilm concentration and growth of L. pneumophila were also observed with tap water from the laboratory. The Betaproteobacteria Piscinibacter and Methyloversatilis and amoeba-resisting Alphaproteobacteria predominated in the clones and isolates retrieved from the biofilms. In the biofilms, the Legionella colony count correlated significantly with the total cell count (TCC), heterotrophic plate count, ATP concentration, and presence of Vermamoeba vermiformis. This amoeba was rarely detected at biofilm concentrations of <100 pg ATP cm(-2). A threshold concentration of approximately 50 pg ATP cm(-2) (TCC = 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) cells cm(-2)) was derived for growth of L. pneumophila in biofilms. IMPORTANCE Legionella pneumophila is the etiologic agent in more than 10,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease that are reported annually worldwide and in most of the drinking water-associated disease outbreaks reported in the United States. The organism proliferates in biofilms on surfaces exposed to warm water in engineered freshwater installations. An investigation with a test system supplied with different types of warm drinking water without disinfectant under controlled hydraulic conditions showed that treated aerobic groundwater (0.3 mg liter(-1) of organic carbon) induced a low biofilm concentration that supported no or very limited growth of L. pneumophila. Elevated biofilm concentrations and L. pneumophila colony counts were observed on surfaces exposed to two types of extensively treated groundwater, containing 1.8 and 7.9 mg C liter(-1) and complying with the microbial water quality criteria during distribution. Control measures in warm tap water installations are therefore essential for preventing growth of L. pneumophila.																	0099-2240	1098-5336				MAR	2017	83	5							UNSP e02737	10.1128/AEM.02737-16								WOS:000393962500011

The unique physicochemical properties of PFAS results in environmental persistency, threatening water quality and making remediation of such sites a necessity. This work investigated the role of sorbent amendment to PFAS contaminated soils in order to immobilise PFAS and reduce mobility and leaching to groundwater. Soil was sampled from a firefighting training facility at a Norwegian airport and total and leachable PFAS concentrations were quantified. Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the most dominant PFAS present in all soil samples (between 9 and 2600 mu g/kg). Leaching was quantified using a one-step batch test with water (L/S 10). PFOS concentrations measured in leachate water ranged between 1.2 mu g/L and 212 mu g/L. Sorbent amendment (3%) was tested by adding activated carbon (AC), compost soil and montmorillonite to selected soils. The extent of immobilisation was quantified by measuring PFAS concentrations in leachate before and after amendment. Leaching was reduced between 94 and 99.9% for AC, between 29 and 34% for compost soil and between 28 and 40% for the montmorillonite amended samples. Sorbent + soil/water partitioning coefficients (K-D) were estimated following amendment and were around 8 L/kg for compost soil and montmorillonite amended soil and ranged from 1960 to 16,940 L/kg for AC amended soil. The remediation of AFFF impacted soil via immobilisation of PFAS following sorbent amendment with AC is promising as part of an overall remediation strategy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jalali, M; Jalali, M				Jalali, Mohsen; Jalali, Mahdi			Assessment risk of phosphorus leaching from calcareous soils using soil test phosphorus	CHEMOSPHERE												Accurate estimation of phosphorus (P) leaching is important because excess P may reduce surface and ground water quality. Little attention has been paid to estimate P leaching from soil tests in calcareous soils. The relation between different soil tests P (STP), P sorption index (PSI) and degree of P saturation (DPS) and leaching of P were examined for assessing the risk of P loss from calcareous soils. Columns leaching repacked with native soils were leached with either distilled water or 10 mM CaCl2 solutions, separately. Four leaching events were performed at four days, and 28.7 mm of distilled water or 10 mM CaCl2 solutions was applied at each leaching events. Compared with distilled water, CaCl2 had a small ability to solubilize P from soils. Concentration of P in leachate in both leaching solutions was exceeding 0.1 mg 1(-1) associated with eutrophication. Cumulative P leached P was ranged from 0.17 to 18.59 mg P kg (-1) and 0.21-8.16 mg P kg -1, when distilled water and 10 mM CaCl2 solutions were applied, respectively and it was higher in sandy clay loam soils compared with clay soils. Among evaluated environmental soil P tests, PcaC12-3h (P extracted by 10 mM CaCl2 for 3 h), P(ca)c12-1h (P extracted by 10 mM CaCl2 for 1 h) were more accurate than other soil P tests for predicting P concentration in the leachates in both leaching solutions and accounting for 83% and 72% of variation of P concentration, respectively. The water extractable P (WEP) (r = 0.771) and Olsen-P (Pois)(r = 0.739) were significantly related to the leached P concentration using distilled water solution in a split line model, with a change point of 27.4 mg P kg -1 and 61.5 mg P kg -1, respectively. Various DPS were calculated and related to the leached P concentration. Based on P extracted by Mehlich-3 (PM3) and HCI (No) and PSI, the change point of the relationship between leached P concentration and DFSm3-3 (Tdrpgly x 100) and DPSHG-2 ( ",?-01mi:Ppsu x 100) for both leaching solutions was approximately the same, thus a mean value of 49% for DPSm3_3 and 73% for DPSH0_2 was obtained. Soils were grouped into four categories of increasing P leaching potential based on WEP, P-Ols, and DPSM3_3. The results indicated that 8.00%-25.50% of the soil grouped in no risk category whereas 8.00%-13.70% of the soils fell into the high risk category. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, SX; Wang, L; Wang, Z; Fan, DL; Shi, LL; Liu, JN				Zhang, Shengxin; Wang, Lei; Wang, Zhen; Fan, Deling; Shi, Lili; Liu, Jining			Derivation of freshwater water quality criteria for dibutyltin dilaurate from measured data and data predicted using interspecies correlation estimate models	CHEMOSPHERE												Dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTL) is an organotin compound that has been widely detected in aquatic environments. However, the ecological risk assessment for DBTL is hard to perform due to the absence of water quality criteria (WQC) and lack of toxicity data. In this study, toxicity data were obtained from acute and chronic toxicity tests using aquatic species resident in China. Based on the species sensitivity distributions (SSDs) constructed from these test data, the acute water quality criterion (AWQC) and chronic water quality criterion (CWQC) were then derived to be 132 p.g/L and 31.mu g/L for DBTL. In order to valid the predicted data in the application to the protective criteria development and hazard assessment, the web -based interspecies correlation estimation (Web-ICE) system was used to estimate acute toxicities. Here two acute toxicity data groups for surrogate species were chosen from experimental data and QSAR Toolbox-predicted data separately, giving estimated data for prediction species using Web-ICE software. According to Kolmogorov Smirnov test results, Web-ICE -based SSDs and measurement-based SSD were not significantly different. The results showed that the differences between measurement-based (132 mu g/L) and Web-ICE -based AWQCs (39.7 mu g/L and 58.5 mu G/L) were statistically acceptable. Under certain conditions, it is therefore worth considering using the QSAR Toolbox plus Web-ICE method here to provide a beneficial supplement for developing preliminarily screen level toxicities in WQC when little or no relevant information are available. Besides, the geographic distribution of species was demonstrated not to be a significant factor in SSD establishment and WQC derivation.(C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is the first to report the spatiotemporal variability of organotins (OTs) in surface water under dynamic water level conditions in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR). TGRR surface water was collected during three monitoring campaigns to analyze butyltins (BTs) and phenyltins (PTs) using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry system. Our results showed that TGRR surface water was polluted by BTs and PTs, with mono-OTs being the dominant species. A wide range of BTs and PTs concentrations was observed across the study area, but tributyltin (TBT) displayed extensive spatial distribution, and the highest concentrations consistently occurred in the downstream region of the TGRR study area, with a maximum of 393.35 ng Sn/L in Zigui (S27). The total OTs contamination level decreased over time. The diphenyltin concentration exhibited significant seasonal variation, while other OTs showed seasonal changes only during two monitoring campaigns, with the exception of dibutyltin. An ecological risk assessment indicated that both TBT and triphenyltin posed risks to aquatic organisms in TGRR surface water. We urgently recommend continuous monitoring and further measures to prevent and control OTs pollution in the TGRR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present work four rivers affected by effluents from such mines were selected to evaluate the application of aquatic mosses for the bio-indication of 56 elements. Naturally growing F. antipyretica and P. riparioides were compared with transplanted samples of the same species. The results demonstrate serious pollution of the examined rivers, especially with As, Ba, Fe, Mn, Pb, Ti, U and Zn, reaching extremely high concentrations in native moss samples. In the most polluted rivers native F antipyretica and P. riparioides samples showed significantly higher concentrations of As, Ba, Cu, Fe, La, Nd, Ni, Pb, U and Zn than corresponding transplanted samples, whereas at less polluted sites a reverse situation was sometimes observed. Transplanted moss moved from clean to extremely polluted rivers probably protects itself against the accumulation of toxic elements by reducing their uptake. Selection of native or transplanted F antipyretica and P. riparioides depended on the pollution load. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Al-Isawi, R; Ray, S; Scholz, M				Al-Isawi, Rawaa; Ray, Sanak; Scholz, Miklis			Comparative study of domestic wastewater treatment by mature vertical-flow constructed wetlands and artificial ponds	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study compares the performance, design and operation variables of two wetland technologies treating domestic wastewater: an experimental artificial pond system and a mature experimental vertical-flow constructed wetland system. The wetland system planted with Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud. (common reeds) was operated between June 2011 and October 2015, while the pond system was only operated between July 2015 and October 2015. Three different types of ponds were compared: ponds with wastewater; ponds with wastewater and reeds; and ponds with wastewater, reeds and aeration. Findings regarding the performances of mature wetlands showed that the wetland systems improved the water quality except for ortho-phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P), where the treatment performance reduced slightly over time. In general, the aerated pond systems showed better treatment performances in terms of ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N) and PO4-P. Both systems were linked with medium to high levels of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal. The highest COD and SS removals were observed for wetlands in comparison to ponds. Moreover, mature wetlands were better in removing NH4-N and PO4-P than ponds unless the ponds were aerated. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration increased in the aerated ponds reflecting the high oxygen availability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our goal is to make a forecast of this parameter in Central Europe's most important river with the use of other, easily measurable water quality parameters (pH, temperature, electrical conductivity and runoff) with the use of linear and nonlinear models. We adapt four models for forecasting dissolved oxygen concentration, namely a Multivariate Linear Regression model, a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network and a General Regression Neural Network model. Data is available for Hungarian sampling locations on River Danube (Mohacs, Fajsz and Gyorzamoly) for the period of 1998-2003. The analysis was performed with four alternative combinations, the models were formulated using data from the period 1998-2002 and a dissolved oxygen forecast was made for 2003. Evaluating model performance with various statistical measures (root mean square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination, and Willmott's index of agreement), we found that nonlinear models gave better results than linear models. In two cases the General Regression Neural Network provided the best performance, in two other cases the Radial Basis Function Neural Network gave the best results. A further goal was to conduct a sensitivity analysis in order to identify the parameter with the highest influence on the performance of the created models. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the combination of all three sampling locations (4th combination) and it was found that for all three neural network models sensitivity analyses showed that pH has the most important role in estimating dissolved oxygen content.

J	Richards, PJ; Williams, NSG; Fletcher, TD; Farrell, C				Richards, Paul J.; Williams, Nicholas S. G.; Fletcher, Tim D.; Farrell, Claire			Can raingardens produce food and retain stormwater? Effects of substrates and stormwater application method on plant water use, stormwater retention and yield	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Raingardens capture and filter urban stormwater using sandy soils and drought-tolerant plants. An emerging question is whether raingardens can also be used as vegetable gardens, potentially increasing their popularity and implementation. A successful vegetable raingarden Will need to both retain stormwater and produce vegetables, despite potential water deficits between rainfall events. To determine whether raingardens can provide this dual functionality, we undertook a greenhouse pot experiment using two different substrates (loamy sand raingarden substrate and potting mix typical of containerised vegetable growing) and two methods of stormwater application ('sub-surface' and 'surface' watering) with the water quantity at each application determined by average Melbourne summer rainfall. Overall, potting mix produced bigger plants (biomass and leaf area) and greater yield than did the loamy sand. Yield effects were variable: tomato yield was unaffected by treatment, bean yield was greatest in potting mix, beetroot yield was greatest with sub-surface watering and parsley yield was greatest with surface watering. Bigger plants also had greater transpiration, which meant that stormwater retention was greatest for parsley and tomato plants growing in potting mix with surface watering. Although, a raingarden with potting mix and surface application of stormwater was optimal for producing food and retaining stormwater under our rainfall regime, potting mix could be problematic due to higher nutrient leaching and breakdown over time. Therefore, we recommend using a mix of loamy sand and potting mix. However, the choice of substrate and watering treatment require trade-offs between yield, stormwater retention and potential implications for water quality and long-term stability of hydraulic properties.

The experiment was performed for 73 days and two treatments were evaluated: plants and control (without plants), with four replicates. Each experimental unit consisted of an 800 L tank, a 40 L conical bottom settling chamber, and a hydroponic bench with 0.4 m(2) of planting area and a capacity for 40 plants. The water from the shrimp tank was pumped continuously to the settling chamber and the overflow was distributed to the channels to irrigate the plants, then returned to the tank by gravity. Tanks were stocked with 250 shrimp m(-3) (1.4 +/- 0.0 g). Shrimp were fed a commercial diet containing 35% crude protein, four times per day. At the end of the experiment, total nitrogen was determined in the shrimp, the plants and the ration, as well as antioxidant activity and total phenolic compounds in Sarcocornia. The water quality remained within the acceptable limits for the culture of marine shrimp. No significant differences were observed in the performance of L. vannamei. The final biomass of shrimp was 2.1 +/- 0.1 kg m(-3), with a survival rate of 73.5 +/- 1.9%, a final average weight of 11.7 +/- 0.4 g, and a feed conversion ratio of 1.7 +/- 0.1. The production of plants was 8.2 +/- 0.3 kg m(-2). The antioxidant activity in S. ambigua was 38.3 +/- 1.3 mu mol TEAC 100 g(-1) FM, which characterizes this species as a functional food. The recovery of nitrogen supplied to the system through the ration was higher in the plants treatment (39.3%) than in the control (31.4%). In the proposed aquaponic system it was possible to produce 2 kg of plants for each kilogram of shrimp, integrating the production of L. vannamei and S. ambigua, and thus improve the use of nutrients in the culture.

J	Zhou, SB; He, YX; Yuan, XZ; Peng, SC; Yue, JS				Zhou, Shangbo; He, Yixin; Yuan, Xingzhong; Peng, Shuchan; Yue, Junsheng			Greenhouse gas emissions from different land-use areas in the Littoral Zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A series of ecological projects, including forest and dike-pond projects, were constructed in the littoral zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) to maintain the ecological safety of this area. Previous ecological designs mainly focused on the functions of ecological engineering for environmental purification, economic value and increased biodiversity. However, the variations in land-use may alter the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which were ignored in our previous design. In this paper, the carbon sequestration benefits of ecological engineering were evaluated after dynamically monitoring the GHG emissions from different land-use sites during the growing (April-September) and submerged (October-March) seasons. The results showed that CH4 fluxes in the dike-ponds (3.76 CH4-mg m(-2) h(-1)) and rice paddies (6.09 +/- 1.60 mg-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) were significantly higher than those in the natural littoral zone (0.77 +/- 0.27 mg-CH4 m(-2) mg-CH(4)m(-2) h(-1)) and forest project (0.57 +/- 0.31 mg-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) during the growing season. There were no significant differences in the CO2 fluxes from different land-use sites. The emission of N2O from different land-use sites was low and ranged from -0.02 to 0.07 mg-N2O m(-2) h(-1). The growing season contributed to more than 76% of the cumulative annual GHG emissions. Direct GHG emissions and the carbon sequestration ability of species determined the net carbon sinks in the littoral zone. Net carbon sinks in the forest projects with different understory plant communities showed a small variation, with a range of -2.58 to 3.40 t-CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), but the design of the dike-pond projects should favor species that are positive net carbon sinks, e.g., Sagittaria (19.76 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)) and Canna generalis (16.79 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)), rather than those that are negative net carbon sinks, e.g., Trapa natans (-11.79 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)).

Ferdous			Hydrochemical Characteristics and Quality Assessment of Groundwater in Patuakhali District, Southern Coastal Region of Bangladesh	EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												Groundwater quality is important as it is the main factor determining its suitability for drinking, domestic, agricultural, and industrial purposes. Hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater in coastal aquifers of Patuakhali district have been investigated based on different indices for assessing its utility and to evaluate the factors influencing groundwater quality. A total of 18 groundwater samples were collected from tube wells having depth between 244 and 365 m and were analyzed for physicochemical parameters, including temperature, pH, electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity; major ion concentrations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO4 (2-), NO3 (-), HCO3 (-), Br-; and trace element concentrations such as As, Pb, Li, Rb, Ba, Be, Co, Mn, Ti, Cd, and Se. The results revealed that the groundwater is slightly alkaline and brackish in nature. The trends of dominant cations and anions are Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and HCO3 (-) > Cl- > SO4 (2-) > NO3 (-) > Br-, respectively and Na-Cl-HCO3 is the dominant groundwater type. Ion exchange and seawater plays a significant role in the geochemistry of the groundwater and signatures of Br-/Cl- ratio showed evidence of mixing of seawater in the southern part of study area.

One-year Surveillance of Human Enteric Viruses in Raw and Treated Wastewaters, Downstream River Waters, and Drinking Waters	FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL VIROLOGY												Human enteric viruses are a major cause of waterborne diseases, and can be transmitted by contaminated water of all kinds, including drinking and recreational water. The objectives of the present study were to assess the occurrence of enteric viruses (enterovirus, norovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis A and E virus) in raw and treated wastewaters, in rivers receiving wastewater discharges, and in drinking waters. Wastewater treatment plants' (WWTP) pathogen removal efficiencies by adenovirus quantitative real-time PCR and the presence of infectious enterovirus, by cell culture assays, in treated wastewaters and in surface waters were also evaluated. A total of 90 water samples were collected: raw and treated wastewaters (treated effluents and ultrafiltered water reused for industrial purposes), water from two rivers receiving treated discharges, and drinking water. Nested PCR assays were used for the identification of viral DNA/RNA, followed by direct amplicon sequencing. All raw sewage samples (21/21), 61.9 % of treated wastewater samples (13/21), and 25 % of ultrafiltered water samples (3/12) were contaminated with at least one viral family. Multiple virus families and genera were frequently detected. Mean positive PCRs per sample decreased significantly from raw to treated sewage and to ultrafiltered waters. Moreover, quantitative adenovirus data showed a reduction in excess of 99 % in viral genome copies following wastewater treatment. In surface waters, 78.6 % (22/28) of samples tested positive for one or more viruses by molecular methods, but enterovirus-specific infectivity assays did not reveal infectious particles in these samples. All drinking water samples tested negative for all viruses, demonstrating the effectiveness of treatment in removing viral pathogens from drinking water. Integrated strategies to manage water from all sources are crucial to ensure water quality.

However, little information is available on the in situ transport and spread of viruses in surface water. In this study, an original in situ experimental approach using the residence time of the river water mass was developed to accurately follow the propagation of F-specific RNA bacteriophages (FRNAPHs) along a 3-km studied river. Surface water and sediment of 9 sampling campaigns were collected and analyzed using both infectivity and RT-qPCR assays. In parallel, some physico-chemical variables such as flow rate, water temperature, conductivity and total suspended solids were measured to investigate the impact of environmental conditions on phage propagation. For campaigns with low flow rate and high temperature, the results highlight a decrease of infectious phage concentration along the river, which was successfully modelled according to a first-order negative exponential decay. The monitoring of infectious FRNAPHs belonging mainly to the genogroup II was confirmed with direct phage genotyping and total phage particle quantification. Reported k decay coefficients according to exponential models allowed for the determination of the actual in situ distance and time necessary for removing 90 % of infectious phage particles. This present work provides a new way to assess the true in situ viral propagation along a small river. These findings can be highly useful in water quality and risk assessment studies to determine the viral contamination spread from a point contamination source to the nearest recreational areas.

J	Migheli, M				Migheli, Matteo			Land ownership and use of pesticides. Evidence from the Mekong Delta	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Massive use of pesticides is one of the major environmental problems in developing countries. I analyse the correlation between land ownership and use of pesticides in the Mekong Delta. Landowners may either use more or less pesticides than renters do. Indeed, pesticides increase land productivity in the short run, while decrease it in the long run. Therefore landowners trade-off immediate and future profits, which include also the value of the land that depends on its productivity. Differently from the extant literature this paper does not consider simply land ownership, but the share of the total land cultivated by the household that the household itself owns. Using data from the World Bank covering 603 farmer households in the Mekong Delta, this paper shows that as the share of cultivated land owned increases, so does the quantity of pesticides used. Policy recommendations may be derived: the governments of developing countries should strengthen their efforts to sensitise and to educate the owners of small farms to use agrochemicals correctly.

While Cs bioaccumulates in biota and slowly depurates, the Cs concentrated in biota constitutes a source of Cs for animals feeding on each other. The marine biota therefore serves as a pool that recycles Cs, and this recycling process delays depuration in the fish feeding on this biota pool. Because the continental shelf is squeezed between the coast and very deep sea, the demersal marine species are confined to a narrow strip along the coast, close to the source of the radioactive input. Unlike demersal species, however, pelagic species are not restricted to the most contaminated area but instead spend some, if not most, of their time and feeding off-shore, far from the input source. We suggest that the feeding pathway for fish is a box whose size depends on their mobility, and that this feeding box is much larger and less contaminated (because of dilution through distance) for pelagic fish than for demersal fish. The aim of this paper is to test this hypothesis and to propose a simple operational model implementing two transfer routes: from seawater and from feeding. The model is then used to match the observational data in the aftermath of the FDNPP accident.																	1932-6203					MAR 1	2017	12	3							e0172442	10.1371/journal.pone.0172442								WOS:000395983500042	28248982

We used spatially explicit biophysical models to create scenarios with targeted places where the greatest water quality and supply benefits could be realized. We quantified how these scenarios would impact the sediment load, nitrogen load, phosphorous load, and annual water yield with hydrologic models. The scenarios included a "Business as usual" based on existing conservation plans (2015-2020) and four additional model generated scenarios: a "Targeted" scenario using the "Business as usual" budget, two targeted "Increased budget" scenarios, and a "Targeted-climate smart" scenario adjusted based on climate change. We expected the model-generated scenarios to have a greater impact on biophysical factors than "Business as Usual," and that the "Increased budget" scenarios would reach water quality regulatory goals. The "Targeted" scenario produced a small improvement in water quality over "Business as usual," but did not meet regulatory goals. The "Increased budget" scenarios could meet water quality goals in one additional subwatershed if the budget is allocated to the most cost-effective activities to reduce sediment. Incorporating climate change caused the targeted locations of activities to shift in space, but the overall impact on biophysical factors was similar. This study demonstrates how science-based planning with stakeholder input can inform conservation investments across existing boundaries and lead to greater water quality improvements. By identifying where to implement different types of conservation activities and how much to invest, as well as revealing shortcomings in current assumptions about which activities to implement, this study can enable smarter and more effective land management investments.

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) with a TGR specific database was utilized to evaluate the hydrology and water quality processes of the Pengxi River Basin. The flow and its nutrient content were assessed by the model, and the largest pollutant load generation areas of this basin were identified. The Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) method was used to conduct sensitivity analysis, model calibration and validation. Results of sensitivity analysis showed that CN2 (initial SCS runoff curve number for moisture condition II) was most sensitive for runoff, while RCN (concentration of nitrogen in rainfall) and FILTERW (width of edge of field filter strip) were most sensitive for nitrogen and phosphorus loadings respectively. Determination of the most sensitive parameters on the rate of change of SWAT outputs was identified. The coefficient of determination (R-2) in the validation ranged from 0.66-0.85 for daily stream flow and 0.70-0.86 for nutrient yield. Average annual water yield for the entire basin was found to be 3.93 billion m(3) from 2010 to 2013, while average annual total nitrogen yield was 9406 t, and average annual total phosphorus yield was 984t. The simulation results indicate that runoff appeared to vary significantly throughout the year and from year to year, and was correlated with precipitation. Higher pollutant load generation areas were mainly concentrated in the central and southern part of the Pengxi River basin. This study is expected to have major implications for identifying non-point source (NPS) and water quality management policies and approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The imbalance between the resources and the demand has been caused by the expansion of irrigated areas, the emergence of illegal new irrigated lands and pumping wells, the increase in energy cost and the bad management of water use rights by the public water administration. In addition, climate change and frequent drought in this semi-arid region aggravate the situation. As a consequence, many aquifers are overexploited. The region of Murcia has well-developed agri-food sector, Which is a key factor in, the regional economy. This sector accounts for 21.4% of the regional GDP, and Murcia also has an important tourism sector, so the overexploitation of the aquifers would concern production, exportation and agricultural development as well as the decline in the water level, environmental damage and water quality impairment. On the other hand, the fulfilment of the "good ecological status" objectives set by the Water Framework Directive, with a deadline of 2027, will be a difficult task for water managers. This study proposed a hydroeconomic model to obtain the cost of the overexploited aquifers in the Segura basin in order to decide on the feasibility of using groundwater for agriculture in situations of overexploitation. The results showed that the price paid by farmers for irrigation water in the year 2027 would be 0.53(sic)/m(3) (i.e., annual spending of 180(sic)), which will involve 10% of the final agricultural crop production in the Region of Murcia. Alternative water sources are proposed to increase water supply security for farmers and to ensure the socio-economic and environmental sustainability of the basin. Finally, the methodology proposed would help to manage water use in other European Mediterranean basins under similar climatic, hydrological and agricultural conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Alrajhi, A; Beecham, S; Hassanli, A				Alrajhi, Abdullah; Beecham, Simon; Hassanli, Ali			Effects of partial root-zone drying irrigation and water quality on soil physical and chemical properties	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Using recycled wastewater (RW) is considered to be a strategic choice for overcoming water scarcity worldwide, so there is a pressing need to improve irrigation and nutrient uptake to sustain crop yields and at the same time to reduce the negative impacts of RW. In the present Study, tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. var. "Azmier") were exposed to three different water qualities: recycled wastewater (RW); fresh municipal tap water (FW); and a blend of RW and stormwater (BW), in combination with five irrigation scenarios: full irrigation (FI) full plant water requirement; deficit irrigation (DI), with 75% and 50% of FI as DI75 and DI50, respectively; and partial root-zone drying (PRD), with 75% and 50% as PRD75 and PRD50, respectively. The effects of these treatments on soil hydraulic conductivity (K-s), soil pH, root growth, leaf area (LA) as well as the residual phosphorus (P), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) in the soil were investigated. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the soil K-s. However, different types of irrigation waters significantly affected the soil pH, while irrigation scenarios had no effect on soil pH. Also, irrigation scenarios influenced root growth and LA, while PRD scenarios lowered soil P, K+, and Mg2+ concentration compared to DI. The results also showed that water quality influenced canopy coverage 107 days after planting (DAP). It is clear that PRD is a promising scenario for sustaining agriculture in areas with high water scarcity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The acute toxicity of K2Cr2O7 to D. magna was comparatively examined in one very hard (M4 medium for D. magna assay), four hard, one moderately hard and one soft dilution water samples. The 48-h EC50 (50% effective concentration) of K2Cr2O7 to D. magna was reproducible (coefficient of variation [CV]: 13%) in tests using the same dilution water sample, but reproducibility was poor (CV: 62%) in tests using seven different dilution water samples. The observed 48-h EC50 value increased with increasing water hardness (28-250 mg CaCO3/L) and Na+ concentration (4.3-19.7 mg Na/L). The effect of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on K2Cr2O7 toxicity was equivalent in terms of molar concentration. The 48-h EC50 for K2Cr2O7 was determined according to OECD TG 202 by six contract laboratories using M4 medium and were shown to be reproducible (CV: 15%), indicating that the toxicity level can be determined with high accuracy if holding and dilution water samples are standardized. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the 48-h EC50 was strongly correlated (r(2) = 0.927) with the Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ concentration, and alkalinity of the dilution water samples. Detailed monitoring of water quality characteristics thus facilitates intra- and inter-laboratory comparisons of toxicity data and enables predictions of changes in the susceptibility of test animals.

In many developing communities, shortages often force households to depend on water tankers amongst other potential sources for the delivery of water for domestic and/or potable use. While water tankers have become an integral part of the water supply system in many countries, the sector is often unregulated and operates with little governmental supervision. Users are invariably unaware of the origin or the quality of purchased water. In an effort to better assess this sector, a field survey of water vending wells and tankers coupled with a water quality sampling and analysis program was implemented in a pilot semi -arid urban area (Beirut, Lebanon) to shed light on the environmental and socio-economic impacts of the water tanker sector. Total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride (Cr), and microbial loads exceeded drinking water quality standards. While TDS and levels were mostly due to saltwater intrusion in coastal wells, tankers were found to be a significant source of total coliforms. Delivered water costs varied depending on the tanker size, the quality of the distributed water, and pre-treatment used, with a markup of nearly 8-24 folds of the public water supply and an equivalent economic burden of 16% of the average household income excluding environmental externalities of water quality. The study concludes with a management framework towards consumer protection under integrated supply and demand side measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Dvarskas, A				Dvarskas, Anthony			Dynamically linking economic models to ecological condition for coastal zone management: Application to sustainable tourism planning	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												While the development of the tourism industry can bring economic benefits to an area, it is important to consider the long-run impact of the industry on a given location. Particularly when the tourism industry relies upon a certain ecological state, those weighing different development options need to consider the long-run impacts of increased tourist numbers upon measures of ecological condition. This paper presents one approach for linking a model of recreational visitor behavior with an ecological model that estimates the impact of the increased visitors upon the environment. Two simulations were run for the model using initial parameters available from survey data and water quality data for beach locations in Croatia. Results suggest that the resilience of a given tourist location to the changes brought by increasing tourism numbers is important in determining its long-run sustainability. Further work should investigate additional model components, including the tourism industry, refinement of the relationships assumed by the model, and application of the proposed model in additional areas.

The BGQDs were produced by oxidizing graphite in an aqueous borax solution at pH 7; then, the borate solution was filtered with BGQDs, and the borate was dialyzed from the filtrate, leaving a solution of BGQDs in water. The amount of the B in the BGQDs can be adjusted by changing the concentration of borax used for the electrolyte. The excitation wavelength- and B amount-dependent fluorescence characteristics of BQGDs were studied. The fluorescence intensity of the BGQDs is measurable in real time, and its quenching is very sensitive to the concentration of Fe3+ ions in the system but not to other possible coexisting metal ions. The fluorescence quenching mechanism of Fe3+ ions to BGQDs is studied and explained based on electrochemical voltammetry and DFT simulations. The analytical signal, which is defined as F-0/F, where F-0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of the BGQDs before and after interaction with Fe3+ ions, respectively, displays a good linear relationship in the Fe3+ ion concentration range of 0.01-100 mu m with a correlation coefficient of 0.999 and a limit of detection (LOB) of similar to(0.005 +/- 0.001) mu M. The LOD value is much lower than the water quality standards for Fe3+ ions (0.3 ppm, similar to 5.36 mu m) in drinking water suggested by the WHO (World Health Organization) and EPA (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency), implying that this method has great potential for applications in real sample assays. For example, the determination of the Fe3+ ion levels in three water samples (tap water, groundwater, and lake water) gives approximately the same results as those determined by the EPA-recommended AAS (atomic adsorption spectroscopy) method.																	0039-9140	1873-3573				MAR 1	2017	164						100	109		10.1016/j.talanta.2016.11.019								WOS:000393244400015	28107902					
J	Schiffer, S; Liber, K				Schiffer, Stephanie; Liber, Karsten			Toxicity of aqueous vanadium to zooplankton and phytoplankton species of relevance to the athabasca oil sands region	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Vanadium (V) is an abundant trace metal present in bitumen from the Athabasca Oil Sands (AOS) region in Alberta, Canada. The upgrading of bitumen can result in the production of large volumes of a carbonaceous material referred to as petroleum coke that contains V at elevated levels compared to the native bitumen. Previous studies have shown that coke has the capacity to leach ecotoxicologically relevant levels of V into water it contacts, yet limited data are available on the toxicity of aqueous V to planktonic organisms. Therefore, this study set out to evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity of V (as vanadate oxyanions) to freshwater zooplankton and phytoplankton species that are either commonly-used laboratory species, or species more regionally representative of northern Alberta. Four cladoceran (2-d and 21-d tests) and two algal (3-d tests) species were exposed to V to obtain both acute and chronic toxicity estimates. Acute V toxicity (LC50s) ranged from 0.60 mg V/L for Ceriodaphnia quadrangula to 2.17 mg V/L for Daphnia pulex. Chronic toxicity estimates (EC50s) for cladoceran survival and reproduction were nearly identical within species and ranged from a low of 0.13 to a high of 0.46 mg V/L for Daphnia dentifera and D. pulex, respectively. The lack of sublethal V toxicity in daphnia suggests a direct mechanism of toxicity through ion imbalance. Growth inhibition (EC50) of green algae occurred at concentrations of 3.24 and 4.12 mg V/L for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Scenedesmus quadricauda, respectively. Overall, cladocerans were more sensitive to V than green algae, with survival of the field-collected D. dentifera being approximately 2.5 to 3.5 times more sensitive to acute and chronic V exposure than the standard test species D. pulex. However, there were no significant differences in V toxicity between the field-collected cladocerans Simocephalus serrulatus and C. quadrangula, compared to the respective standard species D. pulex and Ceriodaphnia dubia. Similarly, there were no significant differences in sensitivity to V in the two algal species evaluated. Based on V concentrations reported in laboratory-generated coke leachates, zooplankton survival could be adversely impacted under conditions of chronic leachate exposure if V concentrations in the environment exceed 0.1 mg/L. Furthermore, toxicity thresholds from commonly-used planktonic test species would likely have sufficed for derivation of a V water quality guideline (WQG) for protection of local aquatic communities near oil sands operations, but the new data presented here on V toxicity to more regionally-representative species will strengthen the database for WQG derivation.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				MAR	2017	137						1	11		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.10.040								WOS:000392786400001	27871041					
J	Kersten, G; Majestic, B; Quigley, M				Kersten, Gordon; Majestic, Brian; Quigley, Martin			Phytoremediation of cadmium and lead-polluted watersheds	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Abandoned hard rock mines and the resulting acid mine drainage (AMD) are a source of vast, environmental degradation that are toxic threats to plants, animals, and humans. Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are metal contaminants often found in AMD. In our mine outwash water samples, Cd and Pb concentrations were 300 and 40 times greater than EPA Aquatic Life Use water quality standards, respectively. We tested the phytoremediation characteristics, accumulation and tolerance of Cd and Pb contamination, for annual aboveground biomass harvest of three montane willows native to the Rocky Mountains: Salts drummondiana S. monticola, and S. planifolia. We found S. monticola best suited for Pb remediation based on greater growth and tolerance in response to the low Pb treatment compared to the high Pb treatment. Salix monticolo stems also contained higher Pb concentrations in control treatment compared to S. planifolia. We found S. planifolia and S. drummondiana best suited for Cd remediation. Salix drummondiana accumulated higher concentrations of Cd in stems than both S. monticola and S. planifolia. Salix planifolia accumulated nearly 2.5 times greater concentrations of Cd in stems in control treatment than did S. drummondiana. Salts planifolia also contained more total Cd in stems than did S. monticola in Cd treatments. Based on our results, S. drummondiana and S. planifolia could aid in reduction of Cd in watersheds, and S. monticola is better suited than is S. planifolia for aboveground accumulation and tolerance of Pb pollution.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				MAR	2017	137						225	232		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2016.12.001								WOS:000392786400029	27951422

MIX mimics the action of acetylcholine causing uncontrolled muscular contraction eventually leading to insect death. TMX is being found in freshwater ecosystems at concentrations of up to 225 mu g/L. Still, chronic toxicity data for freshwater invertebrates is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the acute and chronic effects (at organismal and biochemical levels) of TMX on the freshwater insect Chironomus riparius. C. riparius life history responses were significantly affected by TMX exposure, namely with a decrease in growth and delay in emergence. Concerning the biochemical responses, after a short exposure (48 h) to TMX, our results showed that low concentrations of TMX significantly reduced CAT activity and LPO levels of C. riparius. No effects were observed in AChE, GST and ETS activities. Effects in terms of survival, development rates and biochemical responses of C. riparius exposed to low concentrations of TMX observed in this study suggest potential deleterious effects of this neonicotinoid on aquatic insects inhabiting freshwaters environments near agricultural areas.

However, ditches may also assist in minimizing off-site nutrient losses via within-ditch nutrient cycling and retention. Drainage has been increasing in the-sub-humid regions of the Prairie Pothole Region, but little work has been done to examine the nutrient dynamics associated with drainage under these climatic conditions. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to characterize within ditch nutrient pools and processes as a function of drainage duration: recent (7-15 years), medium (20-34 years), and long-term (36-50 years). Pools and processes included: 1) soil organic (SOC) and inorganic (SIC) C and water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC); 2) macronutrient (N and P) concentrations by depth, within and adjacent to drainage ditches; and 3) within-ditch nutrient (N and P) storage, cycling, and release. Results indicated greater SOC storage in the ditch-slope (MS) and greater P storage within-ditch (D), and that nutrient storage, cycling, and release varied with the drainage ditch age. In particular, relative to medium (MD) and long-term drained (LD) sites, recently drained sites (RD) had lower potential N mineralization and nitrification, and higher P desorption, which suggested less potential N loss, but greater potential P loss. Overall, these results provide a basis for considering age-specific management practices and essential information to make agricultural drainage more sustainable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jo, B; Baloch, Z				Jo, Byungwan; Baloch, Zafar			Internet of Things-Based Arduino Intelligent Monitoring and Cluster Analysis of Seasonal Variation in Physicochemical Parameters of Jungnangcheon, an Urban Stream	WATER												In the present case study, the use of an advanced, efficient and low-cost technique for monitoring an urban stream was reported. Physicochemical parameters (PcPs) of Jungnangcheon stream (Seoul, South Korea) were assessed using an Internet of Things (IoT) platform. Temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH parameters were monitored for the three summer months and the first fall month at a fixed location. Analysis was performed using clustering techniques (CTs), such as K-means clustering, agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC), and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). An IoT-based Arduino sensor module (ASM) network with a 99.99% efficient communication platform was developed to allow collection of stream data with user-friendly software and hardware and facilitated data analysis by interested individuals using their smartphones. Clustering was used to formulate relationships among physicochemical parameters. K-means clustering was used to identify natural clusters using the silhouette coefficient based on cluster compactness and looseness. AHC grouped all data into two clusters as well as temperature, DO and pH into four, eight, and four clusters, respectively. DBSCAN analysis was also performed to evaluate yearly variations in physicochemical parameters. Noise points (NOISE) of temperature in 2016 were border points (p), whereas in 2014 and 2015 they remained core points (q), indicating a trend toward increasing stream temperature. We found the stream parameters were within the permissible limits set by the Water Quality Standards for River Water, South Korea.

Using multiple watershed models to assess the water quality impacts of alternate land development scenarios for a small community	CATENA												Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in North America, is impaired by excess nutrient discharges, especially from urban and agricultural land. Watershed simulation models have provided key insights to understanding land -to water connections, but rarely are these models applied to guide local land management to explore and communicate uncertainty in the model predictions. In this study, three watershed simulation models; the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), the Generalized Watershed Loading Function (GWLF) model, and the Chesapeake Bay Program's Chesapeake Watershed Model (CBP-CWM) were implemented to predict water, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus discharges from small tributaries in the town of Queenstown, Maryland, USA. Based on our evaluation metrics, none of the models consistently provided better results. In general, there was a good agreement on annual average water flow between the SWAT and CBP-CWM models, and the GWLF and CBP-CWM models predicted similar TN and TP loads. Each model has strengths and weaknesses in flow and nutrient predictions, and predictions differed among models even when models were initialized with the same data. Using multiple models may enhance the quality of model predictions and the decision making process. However, it could also be the case that the complexity of implemented watershed models and resolution of our understanding currently are not yet suited to provide scientifically credible solutions.

J	de Oliveira, LM; Maillard, P; Pinto, EJD				de Oliveira, Lilia Maria; Maillard, Philippe; de Andrade Pinto, Eber Jose			Application of a land cover pollution index to model non-point pollution sources in a Brazilian watershed	CATENA												Non-point and point source pollution are a water quality problem in most parts of the World. Many studies have used the land use and land cover (LULC) to model non-point pollution sources. In this article we evaluate the relationship between LULC and five water quality parameters using different zones of analysis: riparian buffers (B) and exclusive contribution areas (ECA). The five parameters are nitrate, nitrite, total ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorous and dissolved oxygen. Analyses were performed on riparian zones of different widths and ECA5 to verify if the effect of the land cover on the water quality of the stream decreases with the increased distance. The urban and agricultural/pasture categories of LULC were characterized as pollution sources while vegetation (Forest and Riparian Forest) as pollution sink (filter). We proposed a Land Cover Pollution index (LCPI) which is a ratio between source and sink to substitute the individual LULC categories. The source and sink categories were selected considering our knowledge of the LULC relationship and the sign of the Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. The LCPI varied between 0.11 in the 150 m buffer (higher filter effect) and a maximum of 27.99 (largest source effect). Additionally, we transformed the water quality data in incremental loads per unit area so that each station could be considered independent from the others and be compared between themselves independently of the contribution area they represent. Our method also included only data from the rain season, the beginning of which was determined using the hydrograms of discharge data. Results indicate that the index is better than the individual LULC classes to explain this relationship, especially in riparian zones. In 12 out of 15 models the coefficient of determination (R-2) increased by 11 to 155%, when we use the index instead of the LULC classes. We believe that these good results can be attributed to the LCPI but also to the special processing of the water quality data making it more sound for statistical processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Arias, D; Cisternas, LA; Rivas, M				Arias, Dayana; Cisternas, Luis A.; Rivas, Mariella			Biomineralization of calcium and magnesium crystals from seawater by halotolerant bacteria isolated from Atacama Salar (Chile)	DESALINATION												Antofagasta (Chile) is an arid region, and the climate is strongly influenced by the Atacama Desert, with few sources of fresh water. The pressure to use non-conventional water sources has boosted the construction of numerous desalination plants. High concentrations of secondary ions as calcium and magnesium cause problems in reverse osmosis plants and in other industries such as copper mining and cooling system. Biomineralization process based on hydrolysis of urea has been described in a wide variety of bacterial species with diverse applications. The selection of ureolytic halotolerant bacteria from Atacama Salar and their ability to precipitate calcium and magnesium crystals in seawater is described. Besides crystal structure and morphology were determined by electron microscopy analysis and X-ray diffraction. When assessing the mineral precipitate ability, Rhodococcus erythropolis precipitates a similar to 95% soluble calcium and 8% magnesium. The analysis of crystals showed that correspond to similar to 12.69% monohydrocalcite, similar to 30.72% struvite and similar to 56.59% halite. These results demonstrate that the biomineralization by ureolytic bacteria in seawater has great potential for its application as a pretreatment to improve water quality for industrial processes.

Opportunities for green infrastructure under Ecuador's new legal framework	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Ecuador's new constitution recognizes "rights of nature" and peoples' right to benefit from the environment and natural resources that enhance the Buen Vivir (Quality of Life). The national plan for Buen Vivir calls for spatial planning to guarantee territorial and global environmental sustainability, increase people's safety by minimizing the impact of natural hazards such as floods. Within this context, we analyzed opportunities for green infrastructure in Cuenca (Ecuador's third largest city). We mapped existing green areas and linkages, analyzed the roles of implementing institutions with structured input from 33 government, academic, and industry experts. We found that fragmented authorities and often-contradictory mandates of different agencies prevented optimal management of open-space areas within the city. Moreover, planning efforts within the city of Cuenca are completely disconnected from the rapidly urbanizing peri-urban areas outside the city limits, resulting in missed opportunities for connected green space for wildlife, human recreation, and water quality benefits.

J	Broyer, J; Chavas, G; Chazal, R				Broyer, Joel; Chavas, Gilles; Chazal, Romain			The effects of cessation of fish farming on duck breeding in French fishpond systems	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fishponds are man-made aquatic systems subjected to more or less active management by fish farmers. They also are an important habitat category for waterbirds. In this study, we attempted to assess the consequences for duck breeding of fish farming interruption in a typical French fishpond region, the Forez, where fish production has declined strongly since the 1990s. Duck pair density, a brood: pair ratio and mean brood size were studied in two successive periods, 2010-2012 and 2013-2015, in 19 ponds abandoned for fish farming between 2008 and 2010, and in 34 ponds still stocked with fish among which 17 were harvested every 2 or 3 years and 17 harvested annually. Between the two study periods, a decrease in abandoned ponds was observed in diving duck (Aythya species) and red-crested pochard Netta rufina pair density and for dabbling duck (Anas species) and red-crested pochard brood: pair ratio. A possible explanation is that fish influenced the nutrient level within the aquatic ecosystem through bioresuspension of phosphorus when stirring the sediment for feeding and through nitrogen production by excretions. Decreased brood sizes in ponds still used for traditional fish farming are suggested to be the result of density-dependent predation rates.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2017	788	1					47	53		10.1007/s10750-016-2985-2								WOS:000392386500004						
J	Al Jawaheri, R; Sahlen, G				Al Jawaheri, Raad; Sahlen, Goran			Negative impact of lake liming programmes on the species richness of dragonflies (Odonata): a study from southern Sweden	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Liming programmes aiming to restore fish populations are being implemented in many acidified aquatic systems in northern Europe. We studied Odonata communities in 47 forest lakes in SW Sweden, 13 that are currently being limed, and 8 that have previously been limed. Thirty-one species were recorded, with the highest mean number in untreated lakes, followed by previously treated lakes and currently treated lakes. Species communities differed between untreated and limed lakes, but only few rare species found in the untreated lakes were absent in the treated lakes. Likewise, species known to thrive in acid environments were either rare or showed no preferences. Comparing the number of records of odonate species within a large regional area to the proportion of lakes inhabited in our study, we found that seven of the most commonly observed species occurred less frequently in limed lakes than in the untreated ones, including two of the three most common taxa. Reduced species numbers in limed lakes might be due to conditions on other trophic levels, including fish predation. We argue that Odonata should be considered when developing new biological indices of water quality, although the causes of the observed occurrence patterns need to be studied further.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2017	788	1					99	113		10.1007/s10750-016-2990-5								WOS:000392386500009

In this work, a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropene) (PVDF-HFP) electrospun (E-PH) membrane was fabricated by hybridizing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymeric microspheres with super hydrophobicity onto the E-PH membrane via electrospinning. The resulting hybrid PDMS with E-PH (E-PDMS) membrane showed a significant enhancement in surface hydrophobicity (contact angle, CA=155.4 degrees) and roughness (R-a=1285 nm). The zeta potential of E-PDMS membrane surface showed a higher negative value than that of a commercial PVDF (C-PVDF) membrane. These properties of E-PDMS membrane provided an antifouling in treating of differently-charged dyes and generated a flake-like dye dye (loosely bound foulant) structure on the membrane surface rather than in the membrane pores. This also led to a high productivity of EPDMS membrane (34 L m(-2) h(-1), 50% higher than that of C-PVDF membrane) without fouling or wetting. In addition, complete color removal and pure water production were achieved during a long-term operation. An application of intermittent water flushing (WF) in direct contact MD (DCMD) operation led to a 99% CA recovery of E-PDMS membrane indicating its sustainability. Therefore, the E-PDMS membrane is a promising candidate for MD application in dyeing wastewater treatment.

In this study normal Raman spectrocopy was explored as a novel online tool for monitoring membrane fouling. Raman spectra were measured during cross-flow experiments in which vanillin was used with different concentrations as a model compound for organic foulants. The measured Raman spectra were analyzed and interpreted by using principal component analysis and external calibration in order to determine the adsorbed amount of vanillin during the fouling process. Fouling induced changes in pure water permeabilities and off-line measured MR spectra were also analyzed in order to confirm the results of the real-time monitoring system. It was found that an increase in the solution concentration increased the degree of vanillin adsorption and led to better water permeabilities. The procedure used is able to provide results that describe well the accumulation of foulants in a straightforward and semi-quantitative way. The results demonstrate that the introduced monitoring tool has potential for gaining new knowledge about fouling layer formation.

A continuous search for improved immobilization and sensing strategies of aptamers on transducer surfaces resulted in the strategy presented in this article. The strategy is based on the covalent attachment of gold nanoparticles on the surface of glassy carbon electrodes through sulfhydryl-terminated monolayer, acting as a glue to connect AuNPs on the electrode. The covalently attached gold nanoparticles modified glassy carbon electrodes have been applied for the efficient immobilization of thiolated ssDNA probes, with a surface coverage of about 8.54 x 10(13) molecules cm(-2) which was 7-fold higher than that on the electrochemically deposited gold nanoparticles. Consequently, improved sensitivity, good reproducibility and stability are achieved for electrochemical aptasensor. Combined with the high affinity and specificity of an aptamer, a simple, novel, rapid, sensitive and label-free electrochemical aptasensor was successfully fabricated for ofloxacin (OFL) detection. The linear dynamic range of the sensor varies between 5 x 10(-8) to 2 x 10(-5) M OFL with a detection limit of 1 x 10(-9) M OFL. A potential application in environmental monitoring was demonstrated by using this sensing strategy for the determination of OFL in (experimentally spiked) real samples such as tap water and effluent of sewage treatment plant. The proposed nanoaptasensor combines the advantages of the covalent attachment of neatly arranged AuNPs (enlarged active surface area and strengthened electrochemical signal) and the elimination of labels for the amplified detection of OFL, with the covalent attachment of highly specific aptamers to the surface of the modified electrode.

Based on a set of comprehensive indicators of water system, a decision making approach of multi-objects is developed and applied to quantify water adaptive management for the demands of water sustainable use, water environmental protection and eco-water requirement under the climate change. For this study in China, two key indicators are proposed, namely (1) the water resources vulnerability (V) that was represented by integrated sensitivity (S) and resilience (C) of climate change impact on water resources, and (2) the sustainability of socio-economy and water environment, marked by DD, that is integrated scaler of socio-economic development (EG) based on the amount of GDP and the water environment and relative eco-system quality (LI). To find a reasonable solution for adaptive water management, a multi-objective decision making model of adaptive water management is further developed and the multi-objective model was transformed into an integrated single optimization model through developing an integrated measure function, called as VDD=DD/V. This approach has been applied to adaptive water resources planning and management for case study of China with new policy, called as the strict management of water resources based on three red line controls, i.e., the control of total water use by the total water resources allocation, the control of lower water use efficiency by the water demand management and the control of the total waste water load by water quality management in the Eastern China Monsoon Region that covers major eight big river basins including Yangtze River, Yellow River, Haihe River and Huaihe River. It is shown that the synthetic representation of water resource vulnerability and socio-economic sustainability by the integrated objective function (VDD) and integrated decision making model are workable and practicable. Adaptive management effect of the criterion compliance rate and water use efficiency are more appreciable through new water policy of the three red line controls, which can reduce 21.3% of the water resources vulnerability (V) and increase 18.4% of the sustainability of socioeconomy and water environment (DD) for the unfavorable scenario of climate change in 2030.																	1009-637X	1861-9568				MAR	2017	27	3					259	274		10.1007/s11442-017-1375-7								WOS:000390093600001

Additionally, the study estimated the relative weight for Barbus tyberinits, Squalius lucumonis and Sarmarutilus rubilio to investigate the presence of competitive interactions between Carassius spp. and these native species that characterize the middle and lowland reaches of the Umbrian watercourses. Currently, Carassius spp. is widely distributed in both the stagnant and the slow-running waters of the entire basin. The presence of these species was recorded in 34.81% of the total sampling sites; the results showed that the presence of Carassius spp. was associated with the presence of other non-native species and with poor water quality. In total, 4520 specimens of Carassius spp. were collected and the age composition ranged from 0+ to 9+. The equation for the length-weight relationship (TL-W) was determined as W = 0.010TL3"18u. For the Etruscan chub Squalius lucumonis, an endemic species of central Italy, the mean value of the relative weight was significantly higher when Carassius spp. was absent. The results of the research suggest the need to establish effective management conservation strategies for this endemic species.				lorenzoni, massimo/G-7610-2014													0399-0974					FEB 28	2017	41	1					11	23										WOS:000398011500002

Analyses of the carbon content in stream waters and the catchment carbon yield were based on 4-year monthly in situ data and statistical modeling using the United States Geological Survey load estimator model. We also estimated pCO(2) and degas fluxes using carbonate equilibrium and gas-exchange formulas. Our results indicated that the water was consistently pCO2 saturated (similar to 90% of the cases) and that the steep terrain favors high gas evasion rates. The mean calculated fluvial export was 5.4 tC.km(-2).year(-1) with inorganic carbon dominating (dissolved inorganic carbon: dissolved organic carbon ratio >4), and degas rates (similar to 40 tC.km(-2).year(-1)) were nearly sevenfold higher than the downstream export. The homogeneous land use in this nested catchment system results in similar water-quality characteristics, and therefore, export rates are expected to be closely related to the rainfall-runoff relationships at each scale. Although the sampling campaigns did not fully reproduce storm-event conditions and related effects such as flushing or dilution of in-stream carbon, our results indicated a potential link between dissolved inorganic carbon and slower hydrological pathways related to subsurface water storage and movement.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				FEB 28	2017	31	5					995	1006		10.1002/hyp.11076								WOS:000394901800003

Silver deposition on stainless steel container surfaces in contact with disinfectant silver aqueous solutions	APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE												Silver is the preservative used on the Russian segment of the International Space Station ( ISS) to prevent microbial proliferation within potable water supplies. Yet, in the frame of the European Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV) missions to ISS, silver depletion from water has been detected during ground transportation of this water to launch site, thereby indicating a degradation of water quality. This study investigates the silver loss from water when in contact with stainless steel surfaces. Experiments are conducted with several types of stainless steel surfaces being exposed to water containing 10 or 0.5 mg/L silver ions. Results show that silver deposits on stainless steel surfaces even when a passivation layer protects the metallic surface. The highest protection to silver deposition is offered by acid passivated and electropolished SS 316L. SEM and XPS experiments were carried out at several locations of the sample area that was in contact with the Ag solution and found similar morphological ( SEM) and compositional ( sputter-etch XPS) results. The results reveal that silver deposits uniformly across the wetted surface to a thickness larger than 3 nm. Moreover, evidence is provided that silver deposits in its metallic form on all stainless steel surfaces, in line with a galvanic deposition mechanism. Combination of ICP-MS and XPS results suggests a mechanism for Ag deposition/ reduction with simultaneous substrate oxidation resulting in oxide growth at the exposed stainless steel surface.

An Assessment of Source Water Quality in Karoi, Mashonaland West Province, Zimbabwe	JOURNAL OF WATER MANAGEMENT MODELING												The aim of this study was to assess the quality of source water used for domestic purposes in the town of Karoi. The objectives were: to determine the quality of surface water in the study area; and to characterize point and non-point sources of pollution. The study examined physical and chemical surface water quality parameters that may indicate pollution and so help to identify surface water pollution. The results showed that most of the measured parameters in surface water examined in Karoi were within the acceptable range of WHO drinking water guidelines. When compared with the guidelines, electrical conductivity was slightly higher; turbidity and total suspended solids were significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season due to water flowing, which carries particles with it; and the changing seasons resulted in slight changes in surface water temperature. The results suggest that some human activities, like agriculture and poor sewage disposal in Karoi, can reduce surface water quality in Karoi.																	2292-6062					FEB 24	2017	25								UNSP C426	10.14796/JWMM.C426								WOS:000408028100001

Nutrient concentrations were above growth-rate-saturating concentrations throughout the bay, with the possible exception of phosphate at some stations. The presence of the patches therefore appeared to reflect the distribution of water temperature and variation of light penetration restricted by water turbidity. There was no patch of high phytoplankton biomass or production in a third, linear patch of water with characteristics suitable for rapid phytoplankton growth; the absence of a bloom in that patch likely reflected the fact that the width of the patch was less than the critical size required to overcome losses of phytoplankton to turbulent diffusion. The bottom waters of virtually all of the eastern half of the bay were below the depth of the mixed layer, and the lowest bottom water oxygen concentrations, 3-5 mg L-1, were found in that part of the bay. The water column in much of the remainder of the bay was within the mixed layer, and oxygen concentrations in both surface and bottom waters exceeded 5 mg L-1.

J	Heliweger, FL				Heliweger, Ferdi L.			75 years since Monod: It is time to increase the complexity of our predictive ecosystem models (opinion)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The complexity of our mechanistic ecosystem (biogeochemical, eutrophication, phytoplankton, water quality) models has not changed substantially since they were developed in the 1970s. Consequently, there is now a large disconnect with contemporary problems (e.g., toxin production), knowledge of biological and ecological processes (e.g., intracellular mechanisms, sediment bed overwintering) and environmental observational technologies (e.g., metatransciptomics). This limits the utility of models for making predictions and supporting management. There are several reasons against increasing complexity, including (a) number of required assumptions, (b) risk of overfitting, (c) higher uncertainty, (d) missing knowledge, (e) lack of observations for calibration and validation and (f) difficulty of developing, running, analyzing and communicating the model. Here I review those arguments and conclude that, for mechanistic, predictive ecosystem modeling, they either do not apply, are not a significant problem in practice or can readily be solved by providing more resources to modelers. Further, a review of these issues leads to the conclusion that more complexity generally increases the predictive skill of a model, because more information is used to constrain it. This can be formulated as a new rule: more in, more out (MIMO). MIMO suggests that more complex models make better predictions, but this should not be adopted as a universal modeling strategy, because in practice, the difficulty associated with developing, understanding and communicating complex models has to be considered. However, those are problems readily solved by more resources and I argue that more funding needs to be made available to develop complex ecosystem models.																	0304-3800	1872-7026				FEB 24	2017	346						77	87		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.12.001								WOS:000393248900008

Self-reported Effects of Water on Health in First Nations Communities in Saskatchewan, Canada: Results From Community-Based Participatory Research	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH INSIGHTS												Water-related health challenges on First Nations reserves in Canada have been previously documented. Our objective was to describe factors associated with self- reported health effects from tap water in 8 First Nations reserve communities in Saskatchewan, Canada. Community- based participatory approaches were used in designing and implementing cross- sectional household surveys. Individual, household, community, and contextual effects were considered in multilevel analysis. Negative health effects from tap water were reported by 28% of households (n = 579). Concerns about environmental factors affecting water quality (odds ratio [OR] = 3.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8-6.7), rarely or never drinking tap water (OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 1.3-6.6), insufficient tap water (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.4-6.3), paying for bottled water (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.2-8.7), and dissatisfaction with tap water were associated with self- reported health effects (n = 393); however, the effect of dissatisfaction was modified by respondent age (P =.03). Quality and availability were associated with perceptions of health effects from drinking water, providing additional information on how ongoing concerns about drinking water influence self- reported health in some First Nations.																	1178-6302					FEB 23	2017	11						1	13		10.1177/1178630217690193								WOS:000401184300001

River water quality changes in New Zealand over 26 years: response to land use intensity	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Relationships between land use and water quality are complex with interdependencies, feedbacks, and legacy effects. Most river water quality studies have assessed catchment land use as areal coverage, but here, we hypothesize and test whether land use intensity - the inputs (fertilizer, livestock) and activities (vegetation removal) of land use is a better predictor of environmental impact. We use New Zealand (NZ) as a case study because it has had one of the highest rates of agricultural land intensification globally over recent decades. We interpreted water quality state and trends for the 26 years from 1989 to 2014 in the National Rivers Water Quality Network (NRWQN) - consisting of 77 sites on 35 mostly large river systems. To characterize land use intensity, we analyzed spatial and temporal changes in livestock density and land disturbance (i.e., bare soil resulting from vegetation loss by either grazing or forest harvesting) at the catchment scale, as well as fertilizer inputs at the national scale. Using simple multivariate statistical analyses across the 77 catchments, we found that median visual water clarity was best predicted inversely by areal coverage of intensively managed pastures. The primary predictor for all four nutrient variables (TN, NOx, TP, DRP), however, was cattle density, with plantation forest coverage as the secondary predictor variable. While land disturbance was not itself a strong predictor of water quality, it did help explain outliers of land use-water quality relationships. From 1990 to 2014, visual clarity significantly improved in 35 out of 77 (34 = 77) catchments, which we attribute mainly to increased dairy cattle exclusion from rivers (despite dairy expansion) and the considerable decrease in sheep numbers across the NZ landscape, from 58 million sheep in 1990 to 31 million in 2012. Nutrient concentrations increased in many of NZ's rivers with dissolved oxidized nitrogen significantly increasing in 27/77 catchments, which we largely attribute to increased cattle density and legacy nutrients that have built up on intensively managed grasslands and plantation forests since the 1950s and are slowly leaking to the rivers. Despite recent improvements in water quality for some NZ rivers, these legacy nutrients and continued agricultural intensification are expected to pose broad-scale environmental problems for decades to come.

Without treatment, pollution control relies on a combination of natural degradation and dilution by natural runoff to reduce downstream effects. We quantify here for the first time the global sanitation crisis through its impact on organic river pollution from the threats of (1) increasing wastewater discharge due to urbanization and intensification of livestock farming, and (2) reductions in river dilution capacity due to climate change and water extractions. Using in-stream Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) as an overall indicator of organic river pollution, we calculate historical (2000) and future (2050) BOD concentrations in global river networks. Despite significant self-cleaning capacities of rivers, the number of people affected by organic pollution (BOD > 5 mg/l) is projected to increase from 1.1 billion in 2000 to 2.5 billion in 2050. With developing countries disproportionately affected, our results point to a growing need for affordable wastewater solutions.				van de Giesen, Nick/B-5010-2008	van de Giesen, Nick/0000-0002-7200-3353												2045-2322					FEB 23	2017	7								43289	10.1038/srep43289								WOS:000394751900001	28230079

Spatially resolved air-water emissions tradeoffs improve regulatory impact analyses for electricity generation	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) generate air, water, and solids emissions that impose substantial human health, environmental, and climate change (HEC) damages. This work demonstrates the importance of accounting for cross-media emissions tradeoffs, plant and regional emissions factors, and spatially variation in the marginal damages of air emissions when performing regulatory impact analyses for electric power generation. As a case study, we assess the benefits and costs of treating wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastewater at US CFPPs using the two best available treatment technology options specified in the 2015 Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs). We perform a life-cycle inventory of electricity and chemical inputs to FGD wastewater treatment processes and quantify the marginal HEC damages of associated air emissions. We combine these spatially resolved damage estimates with Environmental Protection Agency estimates of water quality benefits, fuel-switching benefits, and regulatory compliance costs. We estimate that the ELGs will impose average net costs of $3.01 per cubic meter for chemical precipitation and biological wastewater treatment and $11.26 per cubic meter for zero-liquid discharge wastewater treatment (expected cost-benefit ratios of 1.8 and 1.7, respectively), with damages concentrated in regions containing a high fraction of coal generation or a large chemical manufacturing industry. Findings of net cost for FGD wastewater treatment are robust to uncertainty in auxiliary power source, location of chemical manufacturing, and binding air emissions limits in noncompliant regions, among other variables. Future regulatory design will minimize compliance costs and HEC tradeoffs by regulating air, water, and solids emissions simultaneously and performing regulatory assessments that account for spatial variation in emissions impacts.

New Insights on the Nitrogen Footprint of a Coastal Megalopolis from Coral-Hosted Symbiodinium delta N-15	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The development of megalopolises in coastal areas is often linked with severe eutrophication, requiring mitigation of anthropogenic dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) pollution. Yet, identifying the DIN-sources responsible for eutrophication is challenging, hampering mitigation efforts. Here, we utilize the stable nitrogen isotope ratio of endosymbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium spp. (delta N-15(sym)) associated with the hard coral Porites to trace DIN sources in one of the most urbanized areas of the planet: the Pearl River Delta (PRD). The mean delta N-15(sym) value found in the coastal waters of Hong Kong (HK), located on the eastern edge of the PRD, (7.4 parts per thousand +/- 1.2 parts per thousand) was +2.7 parts per thousand higher than at Dongsha Atoll, a reference site unaffected by anthropogenic-DIN (4.7 parts per thousand +/- 0.4 parts per thousand). The isotopic enrichment suggested a consistent dominance of DIN deriving from local and regional sewage discharges on the eastern edge of HK. Furthermore, the strong depletion of the summer delta N-15(sym) value (-1.6 parts per thousand) observed in southern HK revealed that the Pearl River plume strongly modulates the coastal DIN pool. Our results revealed the value of benthic marine organisms' delta N-15 for deciphering the complex dynamics of coastal eutrophication and highlighted the pivotal role of transboundary coordination in DIN-pollution mitigation.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 21	2017	51	4					1981	1987		10.1021/acs.est.6b03407								WOS:000394724300010	28085273

Newly isolated Enterococci faecalis bacterial strains AIM06 (DSM100702) and SR14 (DSM100701) demonstrated 100% specificity and 90% sensitivity to human sewage without detecting 68 animal manure pooled samples of cats, chickens, cows, dogs, ducks, pigs, and pigeons. AIM06 and SR14 bacteriophages were present in human sewage at 2-4 orders of magnitude. A principal component analysis confirmed the importance of both phages as main water quality parameters. The phages presented only in the polluted water, as classified by a cluster analysis, and at median concentrations of 1.71 X 10(2) and 4.27 X 10(2) PFU/100 mL, respectively, higher than nonhost specific RYC2056 phages and sewage-specific KS148 phages (p < 0.05). Interestingly, AIM06 and SR14 phages exhibited significant correlations with each other and with total coliforms, E. coli, enterococci, biochemical oxygen demand (Kendall's tau = 0.348 to 0.605, p < 0.05), a result supporting their roles as water quality indicators. This research demonstrates the multiregional applicability of enterococci hosts in MST application and highlights the significance of multivariate analysis with nondetects in evaluating the performance of new MST host strains.

David			Photochemical release of sediment bound brevetoxin (PbTx-2) from resuspended sediments	MARINE CHEMISTRY												Marine sediments from coastal Florida, USA impacted by Karenia brevis blooms were resuspended in seawater and irradiated in a solar simulator to determine if sedimentary bound PbTx-2 is photolytically released into the aqueous phase. All bulk and size-fractionated (<10-20 pm) sediments exhibited photorelease of PbTx-2 after a six-hour full spectrum irradiation. The magnitude of photorelease of a size-fractionated sediment (250 +/- 20 pmol g(-1)) was greater on a per gram basis compared to an analogous bulk sediment (1.66 +/- 0.89 pmol g(-1)). Experiments conducted with photosynthetically active radiation (lambda = 400-700 nm) indicated that these less energetic wavelengths are also capable of releasing toxin from sediments. Two of three sediments autoclaved prior to irradiation with full spectrum sunlight exhibited a statistically significant photorelease of PbTx-2 into the aqueous phase suggesting abiotic processes are important in photoproduction of the toxin. The importance of PbTx-2 production from exposure of resuspended sediments to sunlight was estimated using photorelease data from the current study and previously reported total suspended solid concentrations for this region. The PbTx-2 produced from this process could account for 0.5-13% of extracellular brevetoxin concentration previously reported during a low level Karenia brevis bloom. Results of this study have significant implications for water quality management because they suggest a potentially important vector of toxin to overlying waters and ecosystems even in the absence of a Karenia brevis bloom.

Seagrass meadows are the most widespread coastal ecosystem on the planet. Although these plants are known to be associated with natural biocide production, they have not been evaluated for their ability to remove microbiological contamination. Using amplicon sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, we found that when seagrass meadows are present, there was a 50% reduction in the relative abundance of potential bacterial pathogens capable of causing disease in humans and marine organisms. Moreover, field surveys of more than 8000 reef-building corals located adjacent to seagrass meadows showed twofold reductions in disease levels compared to corals at paired sites without adjacent seagrass meadows. These results highlight the importance of seagrass ecosystems to the health of humans and other organisms.

The aquatic environment revealed a high occurrence of free-living amoebae ( FLA) due to its suitable condition and availability of food source, which subsequently causes infection to humans. A total of 94 water samples consisted of both treated and untreated from Laos ( 31), Myanmar ( 42), and Singapore ( 21) were investigated for the presence of pathogenic FLA. Each water sample was filtered and cultured onto non-nutrient agar seeded with live suspension of Escherichia coli and incubated at room temperature. Morphological identification was conducted for both trophozoites and cysts via microscopic stains ( Giemsa and immunofluorescence). The presence of Naegleria-like structures was the most frequently encountered in both treated and untreated water samples, followed by Acanthamoeba-like and Vermamoeba-like features. To identify the pathogenic isolates, species-specific primer sets were applied for molecular identification of Acanthamoeba, Naegleria, and Vermamoeba. The pathogenic species of Acanthamoeba lenticulata and A. triangularis were detected from untreated water samples, while Vermamoeba vermiformis was found in both treated and untreated water samples. Our results suggested that poor water quality as well as inadequate maintenance and treatment might be the cause of this alarming problem since chlorine disinfection is ineffective in eradicating these amoebas in treated water samples. Regular monitoring and examination of water qualities are necessary in order to control the growth, hence, further preventing the widespread of FLA infections among the public.

Effect of boron rejection and recovery rate on a single-pass design of SWRO using hybrid membrane inter-stage design (HID) concept	DESALINATION												Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) has been applied as a desalination method to provide potable water to regions under the stress of water shortages and is more effective than other desalination processes. However, specific energy consumption (SEC) must be considered in SWRO process design because of its energy intensive features. Hybrid membrane inter-stage design (HID) was examined to enhance the SEC efficiency of the reverse osmosis process. The additional removal of boron may improve the Water quality by adding a second pass. However, this additional factor may increase costs. This study investigated a potential HID that satisfies water quality standards with single pass SWRO only. The element configuration for the HID was evaluated by changes in SEC, salt rejection, and boron rejection under general seawater quality conditions. Case studies were also conducted to estimate the energy efficiency of the HID under three feed conditions: high concentration and high temperature (Case 1); low concentration and high temperature (Case 2); and low concentration and low temperature (Case 3). The results showed HID application can save up to 0.41 kWh/m(3) of SEC. Temperature is a more important design factor than recovery rate for HID application. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These thin film nanocomposite (TEN) membranes boast many advantages over their TFC counterparts such as increased water flux without compromising salt rejection and bacterial resistance. However, the stability of TFN membranes is unknown in industrial, long-term applications. Via interfacial polymerization, we synthesized a series of polyamide TFC and TFN membranes with different nanoparticle content, 0 wt%, 0.15 wt%, 0.30 wt%, in the casting solutions. At the United States Bureau of Reclamation's Water Quality Improvement Center in Yuma, AZ, the membranes were tested for similar to 3000 h in a lab-scale testing system. We characterized the physico-chemical nature and morphology of the membranes before and after the testing. All membranes exhibited relatively stable long-term separation performances. At the highest zeolite loading tested, in comparison with the TFC membrane, water permeance increased from 3.7 +/- 0.6 mu m MPa-1 s(-1) to 5.3 +/- 0.5 mu m MPa-1 s(-1) and solute rejection slightly increased from 97.4 +/- 0.3% to 97.9 +/- 0.1%. In this study, TFN membranes exhibited long-term desalination stability and improved separation performance compared to TFC membranes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Jack; Rains, Christine			Satellite detection of wastewater diversion plumes in Southern California	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Multi-sensor satellite observations proved useful in detecting surfacing wastewater plumes during the 2006 Hyperion Treatment Plant (HTP) and 2012 Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) wastewater diversion events in Southern California. Satellite sensors were capable of detecting biophysical signatures associated with the wastewater, compared to ambient ocean waters, enabling monitoring of environmental impacts over a greater spatial extent than in situ sampling alone. Thermal satellite sensors measured decreased sea surface temperatures (SSTs) associated with the surfacing plumes. Ocean color satellite sensors did not measure a distinguishable biological response in terms of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations during the short lived, three-day long, 2006 HTP diversion. A period of decreased chl-a concentration was observed during the three-week long 2012 OCSD diversion, likely in association with enhanced chlorination of the discharged wastewater that suppressed the phytoplankton response and/or significant uptake by heterotrophic bacteria. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data were able to identify and track the 2006 HTP wastewater plume through changes in surface roughness related to the oily components of the treated surfacing wastewater. Overall, it was found that chl-a and SST values must have differences of at least 1 mg m(-3) and 0.5 degrees C, respectively, in comparison with adjacent waters for wastewater plumes and their biophysical impact to be detectable from satellite. For a wastewater plume to be identifiable in SAR imagery, wind speeds must range between similar to 3 and 8 m s(-1).

Soil phosphorus loss in tile drainage water from long-term conventional and non-tillage soils of Ontario with and without compost addition	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Recent ascertainment of tile drainage a predominant pathway of soil phosphorus (P) loss, along with the rise in concentration of soluble Pin the Lake Erie, has led to a need to re-examine the impacts of agricultural practices. A three-year on-farm study was conducted to assess P loss in tile drainage water under long-term conventional (CT) and non-tillage (NT) as influenced by yard waste leaf compost (LC) application in a Brookston clay loam soil. The effects of LC addition on soil P loss in tile drainage water varied depending on P forms and tillage systems. Under CT, dissolved reactive P (DRP) loss with LC addition over the study period was 765 g P ha (-1), 2.9 times higher than CT without LC application, due to both a 50% increase in tile drainage flow volume and a 165% increase in DRP concentration. Under NT, DRP loss in tile drainage water with LC addition was 1447 g P ha-1, 53 times greater than that for NT without LC application; this was solely caused by a 564% increase in DRP concentration. However, particulate P loads in tile drainage water with LC application remained unchanged, relative to non-LC application, regardless of tillage systems. Consequently, LC addition led to an increase in total P loads in tile drainage water by 57 and 69% under CT and NT, respectively. The results indicate that LC application may become an environmental concern due to increased DRP loss, particularly under NT. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Factors controlling groundwater salinization and hydrogeochemical processes in coastal aquifers from southern Spain	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In detrital coastal aquifers, seawater and surface water may interact with groundwater in multiple ways. Understanding the interference of water fluxes in this type of environment is essential to effectively manage the groundwater resources in water-stressed regions, such as the Mediterranean coastal fringe. In this research, the characterization of the main hydrogeochemical processes and the interaction between surface water and groundwater in the Marbella-Estepona coastal aquifers (southern Spain) have been carried out by means of the combined use of different hydrogeochemical indicators along with isotope data. The results show that the diversity of source lithologies (peridotite, carbonate and/or metapelitic) substantially conditions the groundwater geochemistry. The analysis of ionic deltas made it possible a preliminary screening of the geochemical reactions that occur in the Marbella-Estepona aquifers, while the Discriminant Analysis allowed for a consistent classification of sampled groundwater types. The dissolution of calcite and dolomite determines the chemical composition of the groundwater from the eastern sector that are more conditioned by the rainwater infiltration. The dissolution of magnesium-bearing minerals (predominantly forming peridotite rocks) is observed in grodndwater samples from the western and central sectors, whose chemical composition showed a greater influence of surface water. The spatial analysis of rC1(-)/Br- in groundwater has permitted to corroborate that saline intrusion is negligible, hardly affecting to its original water quality. The irregularly distributed recharge by precipitation (seasonal effect) and the atmospheric circulation of cloud fronts (coastal/continental effect) explains why most of groundwater sampled is isotopically impoverished with respect to the rainfall signature. The isotope approach also suggests the hydraulic relationship between surface water and groundwater in the study site. A deeper knowledge of spatial hydrogeochemical variations in coastal groundwater and the influence of water sources over them are crucial for a sustainable groundwater management and global change adaptation in equivalent Mediterranean water -stressed regions.

In NYC, a citizen science campaign is monitoring waterways impacted by inputs of storm water and untreated sewage during periods of rainfall. However, the spatial and temporal scales over which the monitoring program can sample are constrained by cost and time, thus hindering the construction of databases that benefit both scientists and citizens. In this study, we first illustrate the scientific value of a citizen scientist monitoring campaign by using the data collected through the Campaign to characterize the seasonal variability of sampled bacterial concentration as well as its response to antecedent rainfall. Second, we examine the efficacy of the HyServe Compact Dry ETC method, a lower cost and time-efficient alternative to the EPA-approved IDEXX Enterolert method for fecal indicator monitoring, through a paired sample comparison of IDEXX and HyServe (total of 424 paired samples). The HyServe and IDEXX methods return the same result for over 80% of the samples with regard to whether a water sample is above or below the EPA's recreational water quality criteria for a single sample of 110 enterococci per 100 m.L. The HyServe method classified as unsafe 90% of the 119 water samples that were classified as having unsafe enterococci concentrations by the more established IDEXX method. This study seeks to encourage other scientists to engage with citizen scientist communities and to also pursue the development of cost-and time-efficient methodologies to sample environmental variables that are not easily collected or analyzed in an automated manner.

Public health implications of environmental noise associated with unconventional oil and gas development	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Modern oil and gas development frequently occurs in close proximity to human populations and increased levels of ambient noise have been documented throughout some phases of development. Numerous studies have evaluated air and water quality degradation and human exposure pathways, but few have evaluated potential health risks and impacts from environmental noise exposure. We reviewed the scientific literature on environmental noise exposure to determine the potential concerns, if any, that noise from oil and gas development activities present to public health. Data on noise levels associated with oil and gas development are limited, but measurements can be evaluated amidst the large body of epidemiology assessing the non-auditory effects of environmental noise exposure and established public health guidelines for community noise. There are a large number of noise dependent and subjective factors that make the determination of a dose response relationship between noise and health outcomes difficult. However, the literature Indicates that oil and gas activities produce noise at levels that may increase the risk of adverse health outcomes, including annoyance, sleep disturbance, and cardiovascular disease. More studies that investigate the relationships between noise exposure and human health risks from unconventional oil and gas development are warranted. Finally, policies and mitigation techniques that limit human exposure to noise from oil and gas operations should be considered to reduce health risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Off-site transport of nitrogen fertilizer with runoff from golf course fairway turf: A comparison of creeping bentgrass with a fine fescue mixture	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Maintaining quality golf course turf often requires irrigation and application of fertilizer. The transport of excess nutrients with runoff water from highly managed and fertilized biological systems to surrounding surface waters has been shown to result in enhanced algal blooms and promotion of eutrophication. Environmental stewardship includes looking for new approaches to reduce adverse environfmental impacts of current practices. One strategy is to replace traditional turfgrass with low-maintenance turfgrass species. Fescue grasses have been shown to provide characteristics desirable for golf course fairways. Thus side-by-side studies comparing runoff from plots planted in creeping bentgrass (CGB) or fine fescue mixture (FFM), similarly managed as a golf course fairway, were conducted to measure runoff volumes and the amount of ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) transported off-site with runoff. Greater runoff volumes and mass of applied nutrients were measured in the runoff from the FFM, representing a 38% and 56% median increase in the off-site mass transport of NH4-N and NO3-N with surface flow. Shoot density, thatch depth and soil moisture were the most important factors related to runoff volume. Results of this research will be useful to grounds superintendents and researchers for selecting and developing management strategies to improve environmental stewardship of managed turf while providing desired turf quality.

Analysis of the contaminants released from municipal solid waste landfill site: A case study	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Release and transport of leachate from municipal solid waste landfills pose a potential hazard to both surrounding ecosystems and human populations. In the present study, soil, groundwater, and surface water samples were collected from the periphery of a municipal solid waste landfill (located at Ranital of Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India) for laboratory analysis to understand the release of contaminants. The landfill does not receive any solid wastes for dumping now as the same is under a landfill closure plan. Groundwater and soil samples were collected from the bore holes of 15 m deep drilled along the periphery of the landfill and the surface water samples were collected from the existing surface water courses near the landfill. The landfill had neither any bottom liner nor any leachate collection and treatment system. Thus the leachate generated from the landfills finds paths into the groundwater and surrounding surface water courses. Concentrations of various physico-chemical parameters including some toxic metals (in collected groundwater, soil, and surface water samples) and microbiological parameters (in surface water samples) were determined. The analyzed data were integrated into ArcGIS environment and the spatial distribution of the metals and other physic-chemical parameter across the landfill was extrapolated to observe the distribution. The statistical analysis and spatial variations indicated the leaching of metals from the landfill to the groundwater aquifer system. The study will help the readers and the municipal engineers to understand the release of contaminants from landfills for better management of municipal solid wastes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Han, DM; Currell, MJ				Han, Dongmei; Currell, Matthew J.			Persistent organic pollutants in China's surface water systems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Following recent rapid industrialization, China is now one of the largest producers and consumers of organic chemicals in the world. This is compounded by variable regulatory oversight with respect to storage, use and waste management of these chemicals and their byproducts. This review synthesizes the data on the distribution of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in waters in China. Surface water heavily polluted with POPs is distributed in the Yangtze River Estuary, Pearl River Delta, Minjiang River Estuary, Jiulongjiang Estuary, Daya Bay, Taihu Lake, and the waterways of Zhejiang Province, where concentrations of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) frequently exceed both international and Chinese guideline values. These areas are mainly distributed along the southeast coast of China, within or downstream of major manufacturing districts, intensive agricultural basins, and other industrial centers. A comparison of the levels of OCPs in the aquatic environment of China with other indicative regions worldwide shows comparable levels of pollution (overall range from below detection limit (BDL) to 5104.8 ng/L and regional means from 2.9-929.6 ng/L). PAHs and PCBs pollution appear to be particularly serious in China (PAHs overall ranging from BDL to 474,000 ng/L with regional means from 15.1-72,400 ng/L; PCBs from BDL to 3161 ng/L with regional means ranging from 0.2-985.2 ng/L). There is as yet limited evidence of serious perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) pollution. We discuss major sources and processes responsible for high POP occurrence using a range of measures (including diagnostic ratios of different compounds), regulatory oversight and policy gaps in the control of POPs in China, and potential long-term health and ecological effects. We argue that water quality guidelines, pollution control measures and cleanup strategies for POPs in China should be urgently improved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Starting upstream of Fort McMurray and proceeding downstream ca. 100 km, waters were collected in duplicate at 13 locations on the main stem of the river, as well as 5 tributary streams, using ultraclean sampling protocols developed for polar snow and ice. To estimate potential bioaccessibility, trace elements of concern (Ag, Cd, Pb, Sb, TI) were determined in the dissolved fraction (<0.45 mu m) along with metals known for their enrichments in bitumen (V, Ni, Mo, Re) and those found mainly in ionic (Li, Sr) or colloidal forms (Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Ga, Mn, Th, Y). Analyses were performed in the metal-free, ultraclean SWAMP lab using quadrupole and sector-field ICP-MS. Concentrations of Ag, Cd, Pb, Sb and TI were extremely low, not significantly more abundant downstream of industry and probably reflect "background" values. In contrast, V, Ni, Mo and Re concentrations were all significantly (p < 0.05) greater downstream of industry. However, chloride also increased downstream, due to natural inputs of saline groundwaters and it is undear whether the increases in V, Ni, Mo and Re are due to natural or anthropbgenic inputs to the river. Although it had been claimed that the industrial development of the Athabasca Bituminous Sands (ABS) is a significant source of Ag, Cd, Pb, Sb and TI to the river, our study failed to find any evidence to support this. Here we provide a first, robust (accurate and precise) description of baseline values for these trace elements in the AR, and suggest that V, Ni, Mo and Re are more valuable tracers for environmental monitoring and source assessment.

The high variability of water quality requires rapid assays, but the conventional cultivation-based analysis of fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichict coil (E. coli), is very timeconsuming. In this respect, the measurement of the enzymatic activity of E. coil could prove to be a valuable tool for water quality monitoring. A mobile automated prototype device was used for the investigation ofp-Dglucuronidase (GLUC) activity at a remote karst spring, connected to a sinking surface stream, in Northern Vietnam. To assess the relationship between GLUC activity, discharge dynamics and contamination patterns, multiple hydrological, hydrochemical, physicochemical and microbiological parameters, including discharge, turbidity, particle-size distributions, and E. coli, were measured with high temporal resolution during ten days of on-site monitoring. A complex contamination pattern due to anthropogenic and agricultural activities led to high E. coil concentrations (270 to >24,200 MPN/100 ml) and a GLUC activity between 3.1 and 102.2 mMFU/100 ml. A strong daily fluctuation pattern of GLUC activity and particle concentrations within small size classes (<10 pm) could be observed, as demonstrated by autocorrelations. A Spearman's rank correlation analysis resulted in correlation coefficients of rs = 0.56 for E. coil and GLUC activity and rs = 0.54 for GLUC activity and the concentration of 2-3 mu m particles. On an event scale, correlations were found to be higher (rs = 0.69 and 0.87, respectively). GLUC activity and E. coli displayed a general contamination pattern, but with significant differences in detail, which may be explained by interferences of e.g. viable but non-culturable cells. Although further evaluations are recommended, GLUC activity is a promising, complementary parameter for on-site and near real-time water quality monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Licensing plays a crucial role in the regulation of municipal wastewater effluents by setting standards or limits designed to protect the economic, environmental and societal values of waterbodies. Traditionally these standards have focused on physical and chemical water quality parameters within the discharge itself, however these approaches do not adequately account for emerging contaminants, potential effects of chemical mixtures, or variations in the sensitivity and resilience of receiving environments. In this review we focus on a number of industrialised countries and their approach to licensing. We consider how we can ensure licensing is effective, particularly when considering the rapid changes in our understanding of the impacts of discharges, the technical advances in our ability to detect chemicals at low concentrations and the progress in wastewater treatment technology. In order to meet the challenges required to protect the values of our waterways, licensing of effluents will need to ensure that there is no disconnect between the core values to be protected and the monitoring system designed to scrutinise performance of the WWTP. In many cases this may mean an expansion in the monitoring approaches used for both the effluent itself and the receiving waterbody. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study established a manipulative experiment using different biomass fragments of Potamogeton crispus. This approach was adapted to study the reproductive capacity, nutrient removal efficiency, and algae inhibitory effect of fragments. Results showed that fragments could grow throughout a 49 day experiment by maintaining the stable photosynthesis efficiency of leaves and lengthening the stems. These floating fragments could regenerate by producing turions for the maintenance of their species. Moreover, the increasing removal efficiency of TP, TN, Nat-N, and NO3-N in water with the increase of fragment biomass indicates that the fragments could effectively purify water quality. Floating fragments competed with algae for nutrients, occupied a favorable ecological niche, and reduced algae biomass. They altered the structure of algae community and shifted the dominated green algae to cyanobacteria, the green algae of phytoplankton, and benthic algae. Findings imply that the postponable regulation of fragments is necessary for the ecological restoration of eutrophic lakes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Elledge, A; Thornton, C				Elledge, Amanda; Thornton, Craig			Effect of changing land use from virgin brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland to a crop or pasture system on sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff over 25 years in subtropical Australia	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Native vegetation has been extensively cleared for agricultural systems worldwide, resulting in increased pollutant loads that often have adverse impacts downstream. This study uses 25 years of flow data and 10 years of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus (total and dissolved) event mean concentrations from paired catchments to quantify the effect of changing land use from virgin brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland in a semi-arid subtropical region of Australia into an unfertilised crop or conservatively grazed pasture system. Both the cropped and grazed catchments exported higher loads of sediment and phosphorus than the virgin brigalow catchment; however, the grazed catchment exported less total, oxidised and dissolved nitrogen than the virgin brigalow catchment. The cropped catchment exported higher loads of all water quality parameters compared to the grazed catchment. The simple hydrology and water quality model presented was effective for measuring the effect of land use change on runoff water quality. Variations in water quality between the three catchments are likely due to the presence of native legumes, ground cover, tillage practices and pasture rundown.

Sequential fractionation was used to investigate accumulation and distribution of phosphorus in the soil profile to 100 cm (0-7.5, 7.5-15,1525, 25-50, 50-75, 75-100 cm) under fertilized and grazed pasture. The trial site had received annual superphosphate fertilizer inputs at different rates (0, 188 and 376 kg superphosphate ha(-1) year control, 188PA and 376PA, respectively) for 57 years. While there was significant accumulation of total phosphorus in the topsoil (0-7.5 cm), no corresponding differences were observed in organic or residual (non-extracted) phosphorus between treatments. However, fractionation data showed that inorganic forms of phosphorus were significantly higher in the 376PA treatment for all soil depths to 50 cm compared with the other treatments. Furthermore, the relative magnitude and significance of differences between the 376PA and other treatments in soil to 50 cm were greater for readily-soluble inorganic phosphorus (NaHCO3 and NaOH I extractable) compared with more recalcitrant inorganic phosphorus (HCl and NaOH II extractable). As such, phosphorus applied in excess of agronomic requirements and soil retention capacity was transferred below the topsoil and root zone by leacing, and most of the transfer of phosphorus was in readily-soluble inorganic forms. This presents an enhanced risk of elevated phosphorus transfer to groundwater with associated adverse impacts on water quality under fertilized and irrigated pastures. Our findings highlight the need to carefully assess and manage fertilizer phosphorus inputs in accordance with agronomic demand and soil retention capacity to minimize downward phosphorus movement and phosphorus transfer to water bodies.

Integrated assessment of agricultural nutrient pressures and legacies in karst landscapes	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Landscapes typically deemed at risk from leached losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are those with short subsurface hydrologic time lags. Due to the short time it takes nutrients to move from a source to an area of concern, such sites are deemed perfect to test the efficacy of programmes of measures as management changes. However, a small subset of these sites can retain nutrients in soil/subsoil layers, which in turn are leached and can be either attenuated (e.g. nitrate converted to gaseous forms or immobilised in soil and P can be mineralised) or mobilised over time. This biogeochemical time lag can have long lasting effects on water quality. In an intensive agricultural karst oxidised aquifer setting, the aim of this study was to improve understanding of P and N inputs, retention, attenuation and subsurface pathway distribution and to inform how similar sites can be managed in the future. This was undertaken for the present site by integrating existing secondary and new primary datasets for both N and P. Results showed that in the years pre-2000 slurry from an on-site integrated pig production unit had been applied at rates of 33 t ha(-1) annually, which supplied approximately 136 kg ha(-1) total N and approximately 26 kg ha(-1) total P annually. This practice contributed to large quantities of N (Total N and NH4-N) and elevated soil test P (Morgan extractable P), present to a depth of 1 m. This store was augmented by recent surpluses of 263 kg N ha(-1), with leached N to groundwater of 82.5 kg N ha(-1) with only 2.5 kg N ha(-1) denitrified in the aquifer thereafter. High resolution spring data showed greatest percentage loss in terms of N load from small (54-88%) and medium fissure pathways (7-21%) with longer hydrologic time lags, with smallest loads from either large fissure (1-13%) or conduit (1-10%) pathways with short hydrologic time lags (reaction time at the spring from onset of a rainfall event is within hours). Although soils were saturated in P and in mobile forms to 0.5 m, dissolved reactive P concentrations in groundwater remained low due to Ca and Mg limestone chemistry. Depletion of the legacy store with no further inputs (taking 25% of available mass of soil organic N as available in 1 m of soil/subsoil to be 75 kg N ha(-1)) would take approximately 50 years, with NO3-N concentrations in the source area dropping to levels that could sustain groundwater NO3-N concentrations below admissible levels within 9 years. Biogeochemical time lags (decades) are longer than hydrologic time lags on this site (months to years). Future management should target farm surpluses that maintain a legacy store at or below a soil organic N mass of 20 kg N ha(-1). Incorporation of biogeochemical and hydrologic time lag principles into future water quality regulations will provide regulators with realistic expectations when implementing policies.

However, SWQM is costly and limited in terms of equipment and sites. The global popularity of social media and intelligent mobile devices with GPS and photography functions allows citizens to monitor surface water quality. This study aims to propose a method for SWQM using social media platforms. Specifically, a WeChat-based application platform is built to collect water quality reports from volunteers, which have been proven valuable for water quality monitoring. The methods for data screening and volunteer recruitment are discussed based on the collected reports. The proposed methods provide a framework for collecting water quality data from citizens and offer a primary foundation for big data analysis in future research.

A total 155 phytoplankton species were detected and 6 taxa (Amphisolenia laticincta, Archaeperidinium minutum, Cochlodinium sp., Gynogonadinium aequatoriale, Heterocapsa rotundata and Metaphalacroma sp.) were new records for the Turkish Seas. The lowest and highest total phytoplankton abundance among the sampling units (depths) was recorded in April 2011 (7.4 x 10(3) cells L-1) and July 2010 (251.8 x 10(3) cells L-1). Local small patches of visible red tide events were detected especially in the gulf, although a phytoplankton bloom was not observed. The water column was well stratified in the early autumn and well mixed in the early spring according to stratification index values. Surface nutrient concentrations increased especially at stations located inside of the gulf. The limiting effect of silicate was observed in early, midsummer and early winter periods while the nitrogen was the limiting nutrient in the gulf during the whole sampling period. In the Gulf, low water quality-high mesotrophic and bad water quality-eutrophic status, high quality and low trophic level were generally detected according to Chl a, dissolved oxygen and trophic index. However, indices developed to determine the trophic level and water quality of the Mediterranean Sea can give unexpected results about the current environmental quality status when it is applied to the Marmara Sea which has limited photic zone by the halocline-pycnocline and thermocline.

MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Occurrence of algal blooms in coastal waters is predicted to be more prevalent in future. To minimize their occurrence, manipulating the grazing pressure by suspension feeders is a potential management strategy, but its effectiveness may depend on their feeding preference. Therefore, we assessed the clearance rate of a widespread serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans in larval and adult stages on various coastal phytoplankton. Additionally, the growth and development of H. elegans after consuming these phytoplankton were determined to reflect its sustainability to counter algal blooms. Results showed that H. elegans can consume and utilize different phytoplankton, except diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, for growth and development in both life stages. Given the fast-colonizing ability which allows easy manipulation of abundance, H. elegans is considered practically and biologically ideal for tackling algal blooms. Other suspension feeders with different feeding niches could be used in combination to maximize the versatility of the top-down control. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Differences in the structure of copepod assemblages in four tropical estuaries: Importance of pollution and the estuary hydrodynamics	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												We examined the relationship between pollution and structure of copepod assemblages in estuaries, using sampling standardization of salinity range to reduce the effects of "Estuarine Quality Paradox". Copepod assemblages were analyzed in four Southeast Brazilian estuaries with different water quality levels and different hydrodynamic characteristics. The pollution negatively impacted the descriptors of the assemblage structure. The distribution of structure of copepod assemblages also showed a main separation trend between the most polluted estuaries and those less polluted. Temperature was the main factor affecting the assemblage structuring in the four estuaries. This factor acted in synergism with the effects of pollution impact and physical characteristics of the estuaries on the structure of copepod assemblages, supporting the potential vulnerability of coastal environments due to nutrient enrichment associated with climate change. Our study demonstrated the importance of sampling standardization of the salinity range in estuaries for reliable analysis of pollution effects on biota. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

At the densely inhabited Port Blair Bay, the dominance of mixotrophs in water and Protoperidinoids in sediments was attributed to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and prey availability. A significant decrease in dinoflagellate abundance from inner to outer bay emphasize the variation in nutrient availability. The dominance of autotrophs and Gonyaulacoid cysts at the North Bay highlight low nutrient conditions with less anthropogenic pressure. The occurrence of oceanic Omithocercus steinii and Diplopsalis sp. could evince the oceanic water intrusion into the North Bay. Nine potentially harmful and red-tide-forming species including Alexandrium tamarense complex, A. minutum were identified in this study. Although there are no harmful algal bloom (HABs) incidences in this region so far, increasing coastal pollution could support their candidature towards the future HABs initiation and development.

These basins, situated between about 35 degrees S and 55 degrees S palaeolatitude, formed part of the East Gondwana interior rift, a precursor to the rift that 100 my later formed the Indian Ocean in this region. Timor lay near the main axis of the East Gondwana interior rift, whereas the Western Australian basins were marginal splays from the rift axis. The main depocentres developed as a result of faulting that was initiated during the Late Pennsylvanian. Detailed lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic analyses have been made on the newly recognized Bua-bai limestone and the type Cribas Group in Timor, the Noonkanbah Formation in the Canning Basin, the Byro Group in the Merlinleigh Sub-basin of the Southern Camarvon Basin, and the Carynginia Formation in the northern Perth Basin. In Timor the succession, which is highly disrupted by faulting, was deposited under open-marine conditions probably in a shelf-basin setting. Restricted, very shallow-water seas flooded the Canning Basin and the Merlinleigh-Byro-Irwin sub-basins of the Southern Carnarvon and northern Perth basins and had highly variable oxygen levels and salinities typical of estuarine environments. A similar pattern of warming and bathymetric change is recognized in all studied basins. During the early part of the late Artinskian cool conditions prevailed, with water temperatures 0-4 degrees C forming sea ice in the Merlinleigh-Byro-Irwin rift. Rapid warming during the latter part of the late Artinskian was accompanied by maximum marine flooding close to the Artinskian-Kungurian boundary. Climatic and bathymetric conditions then allowed carbonate mounds, with larger fusulines and a variety of algae, to develop in the northern part of the rift system, and Tubiphytes, conodonts, and brachiopods with Tethyan affinities to migrate into the marginal-rift basins despite the generally adverse water quality at these depositional sites. Comparison between the stratigraphic record from the East Gondwana interior rift and coeval records from Lhasa and Sibumasu indicate a similar pattern of climate change during the Carboniferous to end Cisuralian. Similar trends probably are present in Eastern Australia although there is confusion over the correlation of some units. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Three ponds replenished with RW in three cities in China were chosen to investigate 22 indexes of water quality in five categories. This was achieved by comparing three pairs of ponds in the three different cities, where one pond in each pair was replenished with RW and the other with surface water (SW). The nutrients condition, heavy metal concentration and ecotoxicity did not differ significantly between RW- and SW-replenished ponds. By contrast, significant differences were observed in algal growth and pathogen risk. RW ponds presented a Cyanophyta-Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyta type with high algal diversity while SW ponds presented a Cyanophyta type with low diversity. Regrowth of bacterial pathogens and especially survival of viral pathogens in RW, was the main driver behind the higher risk for RW ponds compared with SW ones. The duration of RW replenishment was proved to have a marked impact on the algal growth and pathogen risk. With continued RW replenishment, non dominant algal species subjected to decrease while dominant species were enhanced resulting in the biomass increasing but diversity declining, and the risk posed by viral pathogens might become greater.

It is known that the prolong exposure to contaminated water has major impact on public health. The effect of chemical contaminations in drinking water on human being is found to be chronic rather than acute and hence can be defined "consumption of contaminated drinking water could be a silent killer". As the WHO recommended water quality standards are only for individual element and synergic effects of trace metals and anions have not been considered, investigation of synergic effects of trace metals and anions and their effect on human being is of prime important research. By an animal trial, we investigated the synergic effect(s) of heavy metals, aluminium, arsenic, fluoride and hardness in drinking water on kidney tissues of mice. Our investigation strongly suggests existing of a synergic effect especially among Cd, F and hardness of water which could lead to severe kidney damage in mice, even at WHO maximum recommended levels. Hence, the synergic effect(s) of trace metals, fluoride and hardness present in drinking water should be investigated meticulously when stipulating the water quality at WHO maximum recommended levels.																	2045-2322					FEB 14	2017	7								42516	10.1038/srep42516								WOS:000393866200001	28195172

Cha-Am uses an aerated lagoon system consisting of three ponds and a natural wetland to treat the municipal wastewater. A personal computer version of the storm water management model, PCSWMM, was used to simulate the effluent quality of the treatment system. Water quality samplings for total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), Escherichia coli (E. coli), chemical oxygen demand (COD), as well as evaporation measurements, were conducted on a bi-weekly basis for three months to calibrate the model. The four ponds were considered as four storage zones in the model. Based on the observed water quality data distribution, Monte Carlo simulation was used (1 000 iterations, 20 times) to get the most probable input concentration for each pond to determine the appropriate treatment fractions for the model. Data on daily inflow rates, pump operation and bathymetric survey also were obtained from the system operator as model input. The dynamic wave method was used with observed inflow rates to generate a continuous water quality simulation from 2015-07-19 to 2015-09-12. Observed mean treatment efficiency was 51.9%, 77.3%, 99.6% and 9.4% for TSS, TKN, E. coli and COD respectively. Observed concentrations at the outlet ranged between, 10 mg/L to 25.5 mg/L, 0.98 mg/L to 3.92 mg/L, 0.1 CFU/100 mL to 260 CFU/100 ml and 48 mg/L to 119 mg/L for TSS, TKN, E. coli and COD respectively. The treatment fraction approach in PCSWWM was able to accurately represent the outlet concentrations of TSS, TKN, E. coli and COD.																	2292-6062					FEB 13	2017	25								UNSP C423	10.14796/JWMM.C423								WOS:000408027200001

While fixed-width riparian buffer zones are relatively simple to be designed and implemented, variable-width buffer zones have the benefit to protect biogeochemical and ecological functions of riparian zones. With the variation of width, vegetation type, and topography, the filtering function of the riparian buffers could be varied from segment to segment along a stream. The developed REMM-SWAT interface could be used to assess riparian buffer zones at a segment level. This interface could obtain characteristics of each buffer segment and generate upland water and pollutants input, simulated with SWAT model, for each segment. From the modelling, the contribution of each segment in reducing sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus varied drastically from one to another. The maximum reduction of runoff, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus for unit riparian buffer length was 3.83 mm m-1 yr-1, 202.4 kg m-1 yr-1, 1.01 kg m-1 yr-1, and 132.49g m-1 yr-1, respectively. The minimum reduction of these pollutants was zero as there was no buffer drainage area for some buffer segments. As riparian buffers have numerous functions, the design of the buffers should comprehensively consider each of its function. This developed software could be applied as an assistant tool with other riparian buffer tools for varied-species and width riparian buffer zones design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	McLaughlin, DB; Reckhow, KH				McLaughlin, Douglas B.; Reckhow, Kenneth H.			A Bayesian network assessment of macroinvertebrate responses to nutrients and other factors in streams of the Eastern Corn Belt Plains, Ohio, USA	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Over the past several years, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has urged states to adopt numeric nutrient criteria to protect water quality. In a number of states, new numeric nutrient criteria have incorporated both a nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) criterion and a biological endpoint (e.g., chlorophyll a in lakes or benthic macroinvertebrates in streams). While the causal relationship between nutrient levels and chlorophyll in lakes is well-established, quantifying causal relationships between nutrients, chlorophyll a, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities in rivers and streams has been more elusive. This is especially true in highly agricultural ecoregions of the upper midwest United States where a number of confounding factors may be present. Predictive relationships derived from field collected data can provide important support for setting numeric criteria and identifying management alternatives that can achieve and sustain water quality goals. In this paper, we examine the empirical basis for a causal relationship between nutrients, chlorophyll, and benthic macroinvertebrates in the context of other potential macroinvertebrate stressors in a highly agricultural region. We developed a Bayesian network (BN) model for the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT) present in streams of the Eastern Corn Belt Plains Ecoregion of Ohio using Ohio Environmental Protection Agency data collected over roughly a decade (2005-2013). For the data evaluated in this study, useful relationships between nutrients, chlorophyll a, and EPT were not found. An alternative BN model including total Kjeldahl nitrogen with habitat quality and dissolved oxygen appeared to reflect stronger causal influences on this indicator of stream macroinvertebrate quality. However, the predictive power of the BN was relatively low, suggesting that other factors not accounted for in the model may contribute significantly to EPT taxa abundance in these streams.

To investigate the causes and to examine the underlying mechanisms, a two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model was developed. The model reflected the interactions between nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, it can be utilized to describe seasonal and regional water quality changes. The two-dimensional hydraulic model was set up using Navier-Stokes equations and was calculated by applying the finite volume method. The Bayesian method was employed to calibrate the model parameters and obtain the parameter posterior distribution. The two-dimensional hydraulic information and the parameter posterior distribution were utilized to calculate a two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model, for which the 95% confidence interval (uncertainty bounds which can provide the trend and range for water quality changes) and mean value of every water quality index (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, Chl. a and dissolved oxygen) were simulated. Comparisons between the model simulations and the field data indicated that the models were able to calculate the hydrodynamic information and the eutrophication dynamics with reasonable accuracy (all the relative errors lower than 11%). The simulated concentrations of water quality indexes (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate and Chl. a.) in the vicinity of the lake were higher than that in the middle of the lake during the simulation period, indicating that the nutrient load of the rainwater runoff had significant impacts on algal blooms and water quality. Therefore, the urban lake was vulnerable to the influence of rainwater runoff. To reduce the eutrophication risk, rainwater runoff needs to be controlled. Two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication models, such as those used in this study, can provide a powerful management tool that will continue to improve prediction reliability.

However, how the quality of DOM itself changes spatially is not well understood. In this study, to examine how the diversity of DOM molecules varies in water moving through a boreal forest, the number of DOM molecules in different water samples, i.e., rainwater, throughfall, soil water, groundwater, and stream water was determined using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) in Norway spruce and Scots pine stands in eastern Finland during May and June 2010. The number of molecular compounds identified by FT-ICR MS (molecular diversity) ranged from 865 to 2,194, revealing large DOM molecular diversity in the water samples. Additionally, some of the molecular compounds were shared between different water samples. The DOM molecular diversity linearly correlated with the number of low-biodegradable molecules, such as, lignin-like molecules (lignins), but not with dissolved organic carbon concentration. The number of lignins shared between different sampling locations was larger than that of any other biomolecular class. Our results suggest that low-biodegradable molecules, especially lignins, regulate spatial variations in DOM molecular diversity in boreal forests.

HSPEXP+: An Enhanced Expert System for HSPF Model Calibration-A Case Study of the Snake River Watershed in Minnesota	JOURNAL OF WATER MANAGEMENT MODELING												The U.S. Geological Survey developed the Expert System (HSPExp) in 1994 to assist modelers in the calibration of Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) models by calculating statistics, displaying graphs, and recommending parameter adjustments, based on model-data comparisons and several sets of rules. HSPExp has been used extensively since its release; however, HSPExp support was recently discontinued, and the software does not operate reliably on most modern computers. Many organizations have developed software to calculate calibration statistics, but these programs are neither freely available nor open source, which limits their usability by a wide user community. Using the existing open source codebase of Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS), RESPEC developed HSPEXP+and released it in February 2015. HSPEXP+replicates most of the functionality of HSPExp, and provides several additional reports and an advanced graphing functionality to assist a modeler in obtaining meaningful insights about the model on an overall basis, as well as on an operation-by-operation basis. This paper presents a case study of the calibration of the Snake River watershed situated in the eastern part of Minnesota. Snake River is a tributary to the St. Croix River at the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin, and drains a watershed of > 2 500 km(2), with multiple lakes. HSPEXP+was used to assist in hydrologic and water quality calibration in the watershed. The hydrologic model resulted in a model fit efficiency of > 0.9 for monthly flow and > 0.8 for daily flow with a mean error < 10% in total volume.

The Snake River watershed model was satisfactory based on quantitative and graphical comparisons, and the model can be used for TMDL development.																	2292-6062					FEB 9	2017	25								UNSP C422	10.14796/JWMM.C422								WOS:000408026800001

How does the cladoceran Daphnia pulex affect the fate of Escherichia coli in water?	PLOS ONE												The faecal indicator Escherichia coli plays a central role in water quality assessment and monitoring. It is therefore essential to understand its fate under various environmental constraints such as predation by bacterivorous zooplankton. Whereas most studies have examined how protozooplankton communities (heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates) affect the fate of E. coli in water, the capacity of metazooplankton to control the faecal indicator remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how the common filter-feeding cladoceran, Daphnia pulex, affects the fate of E. coli under different experimental conditions. Daphnia ingested E. coli and increased its loss rates in water, but the latter rates decreased from 1.65 d(-1) to 0.62 d(-1) after a 1,000-fold reduction in E. coli initial concentrations, due to lower probability of encounter between Daphnia and E. coli. The combined use of culture and PMA qPCR (viability-qPCR) demonstrated that exposure to Daphnia did not result into the formation of viable but non-culturable E. coli cells. In lake water, a significant part of E. coli population loss was associated with matrix-related factors, most likely due to predation by other bacterivorous biota and/or bacterial competition. However, when exposing E. coli to a D. pulex gradient (from 0 to 65 ind. L-1), we observed an increasing impact of Daphnia on E. coli loss rates, which reached 0.47 d(-1) in presence of 65 ind. L-1. Our results suggest that the filter-feeder can exert a non-negligible predation pressure on E. coli, especially during seasonal Daphnia population peaks. Similar trials using other Daphnia species as well as stressed E. coli cells will increase our knowledge on the capacity of this widespread zooplankter to control E. coli in freshwater resources. Based on our results, we strongly advocate the use of natural matrices to study these biotic interactions in order to avoid overestimation of Daphnia impact.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Climate change has a strong impact on phytoplankton communities and water quality. However, the development of robust techniques to assess phytoplankton growth is still in progress. In this study, the growth rate of phytoplankton cells grown at different temperatures was modelled based on conventional physiological traits (e.g. chlorophyll, carbon and photosynthetic parameters) using the partial least square regression (PLSR) algorithm and compared with a new approach combining Fourier transform infrared-spectroscopy and PLSR. In this second model, it is assumed that the macromolecular composition of phytoplankton cells represents an intracellular marker for growth. The models have comparable high predictive power (R-2 > 0.8) and low error in predicting new observations. Interestingly, not all of the predictors present the same weight in the modelling of growth rate. A set of specific parameters, such as non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) and the quantum yield of carbon production in the first model, and lipid, protein and carbohydrate contents for the second one, strongly covary with cell growth rate regardless of the taxonomic position of the phytoplankton species investigated. This reflects a set of specific physiological adjustments covarying with growth rate, conserved among taxonomically distant algal species that might be used as guidelines for the improvement of modern primary production models. The high predictive power of both sets of cellular traits for growth rate is of great importance for applied phycological studies. Our approach may find application as a quality control tool for the monitoring of phytoplankton populations in natural communities or in photobioreactors.																	0962-8452	1471-2954				FEB 8	2017	284	1848							20161956	10.1098/rspb.2016.1956								WOS:000393750000003

Many of these microorganisms may contain plasmid and transfer them to other bacteria. This genetic material may confer selective advantages, among them resistance to antibiotics. The objectives of this study were to analyze the presence of fecal coliforms in water and at drinker surface, to identify the existence of plasmid, conducting studies of resistance to antibiotics, plasmid stability and capacity of bacterial conjugation. Were collected microorganisms in water of drinker surface and were used specific culture media and biochemical tests for identification of organisms, tests were performed by checking the resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin 10 mu g,tetracycline 30 mu g, and ciprofloxacin 5 mu g), was performed extraction of plasmid DNA, plasmid stability and bacterial conjugation. Was obtained results of 31% of Salmonella spp. and 51% for other coliforms. Among the samples positive for coliforms, 27 had plasmid stable and with the ability to perform conjugation. The plasmids had similar forms, suggesting that the resistance in some bacteria may be linked to those genes extra chromosomal.																	1476-0711					FEB 8	2017	16								5	10.1186/s12941-016-0176-7								WOS:000394188000001

As of now, there is no globally consistent information available on concentrations of dissolved POPs in water bodies. The advance of passive sampling techniques has made it possible to establish a global monitoring program for these compounds in the waters of the world, which we call the Aquatic Global Passive Sampling (AQUA-GAPS) network. A recent expert meeting discussed the background, motivations, and strategic approaches of AQUA-GAPS, and its implementation as a network of networks for monitoring organic contaminants (e.g., POPs and others contaminants of concern). Initially, AQUA-GAPS will demonstrate its operating principle via two proof-of-concept studies focused on the detection of legacy and emerging POPs in freshwater and coastal marine sites using both polyethylene and silicone passive samplers. AQUA-GAPS is set up as a decentralized network, which is open to other participants from around the world to participate in deployments and to initiate new studies. In particular, participants are sought to initiate deployments and studies investigating the presence of legacy and emerging POPs in Africa, Central, and South America.

Source Apportionment of Atmospheric Polychlorinated Biphenyls in New Jersey 1997-2011	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the Delaware River currently exceed the Water Quality Criteria of 16 pg/L for the sum of PCBs due in part to atmospheric deposition. The purpose of this work was to use a source apportionment tool called Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to identify the sources of PCBs to the atmosphere in this area and determine whether their concentrations are declining over time. The data set was compiled by the Delaware Atmospheric Deposition Network (DADN) from samples taken in Camden, NJ from 1999 to 2011 and New Brunswick, NJ from 1997 to 2011. The PMF analysis revealed four resolved factors at each site. The factors that dominate the PCB burden in the atmosphere at both Camden and New Brunswick resemble Aroclor 1242. These factors declined in concentration during some portions of the monitoring period, but this decline slowed or stopped during 2003-2011. None of the factors displayed consistent declines in concentration throughout the monitoring periods, and some factors actually increased in concentration during some periods. This suggests natural attenuation alone will not control atmospheric PCB concentrations, and additional efforts are needed to control PCB atmospheric emissions as well as the numerous other sources of PCBs to the estuary.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 7	2017	51	3					1195	1202		10.1021/acs.est.6b04572								WOS:000393738700024	28051297

Spatial Models of Sewer Pipe Leakage Predict the Occurrence of Wastewater Indicators in Shallow Urban Groundwater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Twentieth century municipal wastewater infrastructure greatly improved U.S. urban public health and water quality. However, sewer pipes deteriorate, and their accumulated structural defects may release untreated wastewater to the environment via acute breaks or insidious exfiltration. Exfiltrated wastewater constitutes a loss of potentially reusable water and delivers a complex and variable mix of contaminants to urban shallow groundwater. Yet, predicting where deteriorated sewers impinge on shallow groundwater has been challenging. Here we develop and test a spatially explicit model of exfiltration probability based on pipe attributes and groundwater elevation without prior knowledge of exfiltrating defect locations. We find that models of exfiltration probability can predict the probable occurrence in underlying shallow groundwater of established wastewater indicators including the artificial sweetener acesulfame, tryptophan-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter, nitrate, and a stable isotope of water (delta O-18). The strength of the association between exfiltration probability and indicators of wastewater increased when multiple pipe attributes, distance weighting, and groundwater flow direction were considered in the model. The results prove that available sanitary sewer databases and groundwater digital elevation data can be analyzed to predict where pipes are likely leaking and contaminating groundwater. Such understanding could direct sewer infrastructure reinvestment toward water resource protection.

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Systemic neonicotinoid insecticides are increasingly used as a crop protection measure to suppress insect pests on trees. However, senescent foliage falling from treated trees represents a rarely studied pathway through which neonicotinoids may enter nontarget environments, e.g., surface waters. To estimate risk posed by this pathway, neonicotinoid residues were analyzed in foliage from black alder trees treated with one of three neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid, thiacloprid, or acetamiprid) at five concentrations, each ranging from 0.0375-9.6 g active ingredient/cm trunk diameter at breast height (n = 3). Foliar residues measured at the time of leaf fall were used as input parameters for a model predicting imidacloprid water concentrations over a 100-m-long stream stretch as a consequence of remobilization from introduced foliage (input: 600 g foliage/m(2) containing 80 mu g imidacloprid/g). The water concentration (up to,similar to 250 mu g/L) predicted by the model exceeded the recently proposed Maximum Permissible Concentration of 8.3 mu g/L for 15.5 days. Moreover, dietary uptake was identified as an additional exposure route for aquatic organisms. The alternative pathway (i.e., introduction via leaf fall) and exposure route (i.e., dietary uptake) associated with the systemic nature of neonicotinoids should be accounted for during their registration process in order to safeguard ecosystem integrity.

Evidence of Sulfate-Dependent Anaerobic Methane Oxidation within an Area Impacted by Coalbed Methane-Related Gas Migration	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We evaluated water quality characteristics in the northern Raton Basin of Colorado and documented the response of the Poison Canyon aquifer system several years after upward migration of methane gas occurred from the deeper Vermejo Formation coalbed production zone. Results show persistent secondary water quality impacts related to the biodegradation of methane. We identify four distinct characteristics of groundwater- methane attenuation in the Poison Canyon aquifer: (i) consumption of methane and sulfate and production of sulfide and bicarbonate, (ii) methane loss coupled to production of higher molecular weight (C2+) gaseous hydrocarbons, (iii) patterns of C-13 enrichment and depletion in methane an\d dissolved inorganic carbon, and (iv) a systematic shift in sulfur and oxygen isotope ratios of sulfate, indicative of microbial sulfate reduction. We also show that the biogeochemical response of the aquifer system has not mobilized naturally occurring trace metals, including arsenic, chromium, cobalt, nickel, and lead, likely due to the microbial production of hydrogen sulfide which favors stabilization of metals in aquifer solids.

These extreme events can alter typical biogeochemical patterns in coastal systems. The extreme Elbe River flood in June 2013 not only caused major damages in several European countries but also generated large-scale biogeochemical changes in the Elbe estuary and the adjacent German Bight. The high-frequency monitoring network within the Coastal Observing System for Northern and Arctic Seas (COSYNA) captured the flood influence on the German Bight. Data from a FerryBox station in the Elbe estuary (Cuxhaven) and from a FerryBox platform aboard the M/V Funny Girl ferry (traveling between Busum and Helgoland) documented the salinity changes in the German Bight, which persisted for about 2 months after the peak discharge. The Elbe flood generated a large influx of nutrients and dissolved and particulate organic carbon on the coast. These conditions subsequently led to the onset of a phytoplankton bloom, observed by dissolved oxygen supersaturation, and higher than usual pH in surface coastal waters. The prolonged stratification also led to widespread bottom water dissolved oxygen depletion, unusual for the southeastern German Bight in the summer.

Using long-term monthly to seasonally data (1997-2014), we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in nitrogen in Dongting Lake, the second largest freshwater lake in China. The average concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) in the eastern, southern, and western parts of the lake were 1.77, 1.56, and 1.35 mg/L, respectively, in 2014. TN pollution was generally worse in the southern area than in the western area. Concentrations showed temporal variation, and were significantly higher during the dry season than during the wet season. Based on the concentration and growth rate of TN, three different stages were identified in the long term lake data, from 1997 to 2002, from 2003 to 2008, and from 2009 to 2014, during which the concentrations and the growth rate ranged from 1.09-1.51 mg/L and 22.09%-40.03%, 1.05-1.57 mg/L and -9.05%-7.74%, and 1.68-2.02 mg/L and 57.99%-60.41%, respectively. The main controls on the lake water TN concentrations were the quality and quantity of the lake inflows, spatial and temporal variations in hydrodynamic conditions within the lake (flow velocity, flow direction), and point and nonpoint inputs from human activities. Diffuse nutrient losses from agricultural land are a significant contributor. As a priority, the local government should aim to control the pollutant inputs from upstream and non-point nutrient losses from land.																	1932-6203					FEB 6	2017	12	2							e0170993	10.1371/journal.pone.0170993								WOS:000393700100018	28166245

The biotic ligand model (BLM) for copper is an approach to generate the water quality criteria (WQC) with water chemistry in the ambient environment. However, few studies were carried out on the WQCs for copper based on the BLM approach in China. In the present study, the toxicity for copper to native Chinese aquatic organisms was conducted and the published toxicity data with water quality parameters to Chinese aquatic species were collected to derive the WQCs for copper by the BLM approach. The BLM-based WQCs (the criterion maximum criteria (CMC) and the criterion continuous concentration (CCC)) for copper in the freshwater for the nation and in the Taihu Lake were obtained. The CMC and CCC values for copper in China were derived to be 1.391 mu g/L and 0.495 mu g/L, respectively, and the CMC and CCC in the Taihu Lake were 32.194 mu g/L and 9.697 mu g/L. The high concentration of dissolved organic carbon might be a main reason which resulted in the higher WQC values in the Taihu Lake. The WQC of copper in the freshwater would provide a scientific foundation for water quality standards and the environment risk assessment in China.																	1932-6203					FEB 6	2017	12	2							e0170105	10.1371/journal.pone.0170105								WOS:000393700100005	28166229

Specific features, such as constricted areas, can potentially affect and energize the hydrodynamics of these types of systems. Particularly, tidal range and tidal currents can be significantly amplified where the incoming tidal wave becomes constricted. In this work, the impact of a narrow constriction on a mesotidal estuary was analysed at tidal and subtidal time scales. Tidal hydrodynamics, energy fluxes and energy dissipation were determined for the entire Cadiz Bay (southwestern Spain) using the Delft3D numerical model. Field observations were used to analyse tidal propagation and energy dissipation along the bay constriction and to calibrate and test the numerical model. The results indicate that the presence of the constriction transformed and distorted the tide and increased the tidal range and flow velocities along the channel, with implications on energy dissipation. The tidal currents were oriented along-channel at the central part of the constriction, although abrupt bathymetric changes at the channel inner boundary provoked a sudden rotation of the flow. Although the energy fluxes were higher for spring tides and were strongly influenced by winds, the energy dissipation was controlled by bed shear stresses and vertical dispersion. The significance of this energy dissipation was that it destabilized the water column, which resulted in a weakly stratified system with implications on water quality. At a subtidal scale, the residual water volume exchange was the result of the combined effects of the neap/spring tides, wind and waves, whereas tides were dominant at the tidal scale.

J	Corcoran, AA; Wolny, J; Leone, E; Ivey, J; Murasko, S				Corcoran, Alina A.; Wolny, Jennifer; Leone, Erin; Ivey, James; Murasko, Susan			Drivers of phytoplankton dynamics in old Tampa Bay, FL (USA), a subestuary lagging in ecosystem recovery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												In the past four decades, consistent and coordinated management actions led to the recovery of Tampa Bay, FL (USA) an estuary that was declared dead in the 1970s. An exception to this success story is Old Tampa Bay, the northernmost subestuary of the system. Compared to the other bay segments, Old Tampa Bay is characterized by poorer water quality and spring and summer blooms of cyanobacteria, pico-plankton, diatoms, and the saxitoxin-producing dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense. Together, these blooms contribute to light attenuation and lagging recovery of seagrass beds. Yet, studies of phytoplankton dynamics within Old Tampa Bay have been limited both in number and in their spatiotemporal resolution. In this, study, we used field sampling and continuous monitoring to (1) characterize temporal and spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass and community composition and (2) identify key drivers of the different phytoplankton blooms in Old Tampa Bay. Overall, temporal variability in phytoplankton biomass (using chlorophyll a as a proxy) and community composition surpassed spatial variability of these parameters. We found a base community of small diatoms and flagellates, as well as certain dinoflagellates, that persisted year round in the system. Seasonally, freshwater runoff stimulated phytoplankton growth, specifically that of chlorophytes, cyanobacteria and other dinoflagellates consistent with predictions based on ecological theory. On shorter time scales, salinity, visibility, and freshwater inflows were important predictors of phytoplankton biomass. With respect to P. bahamense, environmental drivers including salinity, temperature and dissolved nutrient concentrations explained 24% of the variability in cell abundance, indicating missing explanatory parameters in our study for this taxon, such as cyst density and location of cyst beds. Spatially, we found differences in community trajectories across north south and west east gradients, with the northernmost sampling station being the most unique in the region. This work contributes to the knowledge of phytoplankton biomass and community composition in Tampa Bay by generating spatially and temporally rich phytoplankton community and environmental data for the Old Tampa Bay subestuary. Moreover, it enhances our understanding of bloom drivers and provides recommendations for ecosystem management. Specifically, our findings support continued nutrient reduction measures as a way to mitigate seasonal blooms of diatoms, cyanobacteria and chlorophytes, but not necessarily blooms of P. bahamense. Prediction and mitigation of P. bahamnese blooms should incorporate first order drivers such as cyst location and abundance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Occurrence of UV filters, fragrances and organophosphate flame retardants in municipal WWTP effluents and their removal during membrane post-treatment	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS					14th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology (CEST)	SEP 03-05, 2015	Rhodes, GREECE					Membrane filtration using ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF) or reverse osmosis (RO) membranes was evaluated as an efficient effluent polishing step at municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for the removal of selected contaminants of emerging concern and for improvement of water quality according to water reuse requirements. In samples collected at two largest WWTPs in Norway, 12 out of 14 selected personal care products and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) were found above analytical detection limit. The highest concentrations were observed for BP3, OC (UV filters), HHCB, AHTN (fragrances), TCPP and TBP (OPFRs), exceeding the predicted no-effect concentration for BP3 in one sample and AHTN in five samples. Independently of the membrane type used, membrane filtration effectively (>60%) removed BP3, UV-329, OC, HHCB, AHTN and DBPP. However, UF was insufficient (<20%) for removal of DEET, TCPP and TCEP. UF was sufficient to remove 30-50% of COD, 80-95% of TP, up to 30% of TN and NH4, and a min of 2 log reduction of E. coli. Water quality improved further with application of NF and RO. The results indicate that membrane filtration can be effective post-treatment to improve overall water quality and a measure to reduce potential risk in the receiving aquatic environment.

MnO4-, ClO2-, ClO2, ClO-, CH3COOO-, HSO5- or S2O5-2 with NH4+ were tested as pre-treatments to ozonation of ground water. Each oxidant and NH4+ were added in a single stage or separately prior to zonation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has tested all the above-mentioned oxidants for the same water matrix. Based on our results, the most promising pre-treatments were MnO4- NH4+, ClO2- NH4+ and ClO2 NH4+. MnO4- NH4+ was the only pretreatment that did not inhibit atrazine removal. When compared with the previously proposed Cl-2/NH4+ pre-treatment, MnO4- + NH4+ was found as effective for preventing BrO3- formation, while atrazine removal was higher. In addition, MnO4- +NH4+ can be added in a single stage (compared to the 2 stage addition of Cl-2/NH4+) without causing the formation of potentially harmful chlorination-by-products.

Feeding competition between the native oyster Crassostrea virginica and the invasive mussel Mytella charruana	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The sub-tropical mussel Mytella charruana has been reported as invasive along the southeast coast of the USA since 1986. This mussel has been found to negatively impact the keystone species in its invaded range, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To date, however, no mechanism for this negative impact has been determined. To elucidate the role of the invasive mussel on economically important oyster reefs, we compared the feeding of both species in a lagoon along the east coast of Florida (USA). Three different methodologies were used: (1) in situ filter-feeding experiments using the biodeposition method to estimate feeding behavior; (2) laboratory assays to estimate the depletion of bacterial particles using a flow cytometer; and (3) stable isotope analysis in conjunction with ellipse-based metrics to investigate the niche size and overlap of these 2 species. The in situ filter-feeding experiments revealed that, compared to C. virginica, M. charruana had significantly higher clearance, filtration, rejection, organic ingestion, and ab sorption rates, as well as higher rejection percentage and absorption efficiency, but rejected the same amount of inorganic particles. Flow cytometry data suggested that bacteria were a food source for both bivalve species. Stable isotope values confirmed that M. charruana and C. virginica filled similar functional niches in this ecosystem. These results suggest that M. charruana can out-compete native oysters; the findings also demonstrate that an invasion of M. charruana might significantly alter plankton abundance, potentially limiting food sources available to other less efficient native filter-feeders such as clams.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 3	2017	564						57	66		10.3354/meps11976								WOS:000400661400005

Cover crops support ecological intensification of arable cropping systems	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												A major challenge for agriculture is to enhance productivity with minimum impact on the environment. Several studies indicate that cover crops could replace anthropogenic inputs and enhance crop productivity. However, so far, it is unclear if cover crop effects vary between different cropping systems, and direct comparisons among major arable production systems are rare. Here we compared the short-term effects of various cover crops on crop yield, nitrogen uptake, and weed infestation in four arable production systems (conventional cropping with intensive tillage and no-tillage; organic cropping with intensive tillage and reduced tillage). We hypothesized that cover cropping effects increase with decreasing management intensity. Our study demonstrated that cover crop effects on crop yield were highest in the organic system with reduced tillage (+24%), intermediate in the organic system with tillage (+13%) and in the conventional system with no tillage (+8%) and lowest in the conventional system with tillage (+2%). Our results indicate that cover crops are essential to maintaining a certain yield level when soil tillage intensity is reduced (e.g. under conservation agriculture), or when production is converted to organic agriculture. Thus, the inclusion of cover crops provides additional opportunities to increase the yield of lower intensity production systems and contribute to ecological intensification.				van der Heijden, Marcel/H-5243-2011													2045-2322					FEB 3	2017	7								41911	10.1038/srep41911								WOS:000393371800001	28157197

Effects of organic pollution on environmental conditions and the phytoplankton community in the central Lebanese coastal waters with special attention to toxic algae	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Organic pollution is a major global environmental issue for coastal ecosystems. In order to assess the effects of this pollution, environmental parameters and phytoplankton community were monitored during a two-year period (from April 2010 till March 2012) in the central coast of Lebanon in the Levantine Sub-basin. Data were collected for temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton community. Temperature followed its normal seasonal and annual cycles, usually noted in the Lebanese coastal waters, whereas salinity varied spatially and temporally presenting sometimes low values due to continental inputs (19.07-39.6). Significant fluctuations of nutrients (N-NO2 = 0.004-4.28 mu M L-1; N-NO3 = 0.25-39.15 mu M L-1; P-PO4 = 0.014-5.77 mu M L-1), Chl-a concentrations (0.03-8.9 mg/m(3)) and density of total phytoplanktonic cells (40383-22.10(6) cells/L) were observed between the sites and through the years (P < 0.05). Environmental conditions were largely influenced by continental inputs. A perturbation of the natural phytoplanktonic succession and an occurrence of toxic or potentially harmful algae were noticed in the polluted sites, reflecting the influence of wastewater effluents on the coastal seawater equilibrium and thus on the Lebanese marine biodiversity. The overall study provides a good outline on the prevailing condition of few coastal areas which could facilitate the management of their pollution sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we examined three sandy disturbed beaches (including two artificial beaches) on three different sides of the island (artificial Ginowan Tropical Beach on the west coast, artificial Azama San-san Beach on the east coast, public Odo John Man Beach on the south coast) to investigate if differences exist in the environment and crustacean biota between paired disturbed and natural beaches. We conducted seasonal surveys (n = 4 surveys) by placing quadrats at three paired locations (artificial/disturbed and natural beaches at each location, to collect and record the diversity of infaunal crustacean (isopods and amphipods) taxa. Amphipods and isopods are basal parts of the food chain and therefore many marine creatures' diets contain them directly or indirectly, and they have been used in many studies as bioindicators. As well, environmental parameters including sand grain size, water temperature, and seawater quality (salinity, dissolved oxygen content, particulate organic matter, turbidity, conductivity, pH, phosphate, nitrite, nitrate, ammonium levels) were obtained from each site during each survey. The results showed that while water nutrients, sand composition, and water quality were very similar between paired disturbed and natural beaches, disturbed beaches had significantly less biodiversity. These results show that despite no obvious effects on water nutrients or quality, disturbed and artificial beaches influence the infaunal crustacean biodiversity/community in the classic manner of a disturbance. Furthermore, our results indicate that amphipods may be better indicators of disturbance compared to isopods, as the numbers of isopods were too low to be used in statistically robust analyses. With increasing tourism and corresponding development of artificial beaches in Okinawa Island, it is clear more research needs to be done on this subject. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Mahanadi basin has been identified as critical basin from climate change point of view. The study presents an analysis to identify the possible reasons of groundwater depletion and water quality values with the help of land use and land cover (LULC) change detection methods. An analytic hierarchy process based novel water quality index (WQI) model is utilized. Eight water quality parameters are considered in WQI calculation process. Unsupervised classification, Discriminant function (pixel-based) and Image differencing (pixel-based) change detection methods are used for accurate mapping of spatial and temporal changes in LULC. The change detection analysis have been performed based on satellite data, e. g., Landsat MSS (1975), Landsat TM (1989), Landsat ETM? (2000), LISS III (2009) and Google Earth (2014). Analyses show a significant increase in built-up area compared to increase in the agricultural land over last decade. Overall analyses of groundwater levels reveal the water stress scenario in the command area. The Agricultural activities are the main reason for groundwater table fluctuation during 1995-2014. This analysis is useful for land management strategies framework helpful for decision makers.

The most suitable band ratio was identified by performing Pearson correlation analysis between Chla concentrations and possible OLI band and band ratios from the study points. The results showed highest correlation coefficient from the band ratio OLI5/OLI4 with an R value of 0.85. The prediction model was then developed by applying regression analysis between the band ratio OLI5/OLI4 and Chl-a concentration of the study points. The reflectance ratios of the validation points were given as input on the prediction model and the model output was considered as predicted Chl-a values of the validation points to check the efficiency of the prediction model. The regression model between laboratory-derived Chl-a value and model-fitted Chl-a value of the validation points revealed a high correlation with an R 2 value of 0.78. Trophic State Index (TSI) of the lake was also calculated from laboratory-derived Chl-a value and model-fitted Chla value of the validation points. The study presented a high correlation of TSI determined from predicted data with TSI from laboratory reference data (R = 0.88). The TSI values of the lake ranged from 65 to 75 which indicate that the lake is appeared to be eutrophic to hypereutrophic conditions. This empirical study showed that Landsat 8 OLI imagery can be effectively applied to estimate Chla levels and trophic states for inland lakes.

The aim of this review was to analyze the response of physical, chemical and biological parameters on water quality in the systems that involve BFT and shrimp culture. Results showed that within systems to improve water quality, plastic materials have been tested to increase the surface area, sedimentation tanks to reduce total suspended solids (TSS) and to enhance denitrification technology ex-situ to remove solids and nitrates of effluents, multi-trophic systems to reduce nitrites and ammonium system, and co-cultures with macroalgae to reduce most nutrients and Vibrio density, among others. Overall, it was found that the biofloc system has an effect on water quality of shrimp culture, which depends on environmental conditions, light intensity, type of carbon source, level of TSS, salinity, alkalinity, pH, type of phytoplankton and bacteria, among other factors.																	2007-3380					FEB-MAY	2017	4	4							UNSP 04.04.01	10.15741/revbio.04.04.01								WOS:000411066200001

During the bloom, some species produce toxic secondary metabolites (cyanotoxins) that are dangerous for humans and animals. Here, a multidisciplinary strategy for an early detection and constant monitoring is proposed. This strategy combines remote/proximal sensing technology with analytical/biotechnological analyses. To demonstrate the applicability of this strategy, four anthropogenically-impacted sites were selected along the Campania coast of southwestern Italy, in the so called 'Land of Fires'. The sites were observed using satellite and aircraft images during summer, 2015. Algal community composition was determined using spectrophotometric analysis for the detection of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin (PC). Complementary metagenomic analysis revealed the taxonomic presence of cyanobacteria belonging to genera associated with strong eutrophic conditions. Key elements of this strategy are the combination and integration of applying different methodological approaches such as the parallel and combined use of satellite, aerial and in-situ data, the simplified multispectral image indexing and classification for a truly efficient method in detecting early blooms of cyanobacteria. The effectiveness of the strategy has been validated also by the specific taxa of cyanobacteria found in the examined areas that confirm the assumption that cyanobacterial blooms may serve as useful bioindicators of degraded water quality in coastal ecosystems. To our knowledge this is the first time that the presence of cyanobacteria has been observed in water bodies along the Campania coast.

The HR-CS-GFAAS calibration curves were linear up to 200 mu g/L As, but using second order polynomial fitting, accurate calibration could be performed up to 500 mu g/L. It has been demonstrated that sample pH should not be higher than 8 for an accurate speciation of As(V) with a recovery of approximate to 95%. Geothermal water had fairly high salt content (approximate to 2200 mg/L) due to the presence of chlorides and sulfates at mg/L levels. Therefore, a two-fold dilution of these types of samples before SPE is recommended, especially, for total As determinations, when the As concentration is as high as 400 mu g/L For drinking water, sampled from public wells with records of As concentrations higher than the 10 mu g/L in the past, the reduction of As contamination below the WHO's health limit value could be observed. However, the electrical conductivity was close to 2500 mu S/cm, i.e., the guideline limit for drinking water, which was due to their higher chloride content. The proposed fit-for-purpose SPE-HR-CS-GFAAS method could be a candidate for screening drinking water quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The system consisted of a vertical subsurface flow (VSF) CW, a free water surface (FWS) CW, and a horizontal subsurface flow (HSF) CW in series. Results from six-year operation showed that the system resulted in average removal efficiencies of 70%, 70%, 34%, 52%, 45%, 74%, 21%, 43%, and 98% for COD, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, TP, TSS, F-, Ni, and E. coli, respectively. Especially, NH4-N was effectively removed by the VSF CW. With relatively high hydraulic loading rates (18.0-43.6 cm d(-1)) and short hydraulic retention times (1.04-2.51 d), the removal efficiencies of the system were quite stable for most of the water quality parameters, while the removal efficiency of TN increased from 49% to 60% during the six years. The removal efficiencies of the system were generally stable with the change of seasons. This study demonstrates that the VSF + FWS + HSF CW system can be a valuable approach for advanced wastewater treatment to meet the more stringent discharge requirement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the overlying water, the total phosphorus (TP) concentrations ranged from 0.024 to 0.306 mg/L with an average value of 0.064 mg/L. The lake was divided into four zones, and the spatial distribution trends of TP and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) levels in the overlying water were both as follows: Zone A < Zone < B < Zone C < Zone D. The spatial distribution trends of dissolved total phosphorus (DTP) and inorganic phosphorus levels in the interstitial water were consistent with those of TP and DIP levels in the overlying water. The average DTP concentration of the interstitial water (0.134 mg/L) was evidently higher than that of the overlying water (0.025 mg/L), indicating the potential release of the bio-available phosphorus. The TP concentrations in the surface sediments were at the range of 321.77-1,062.08 mg/kg. The DTP levels in the interstitial water had a positive correlation with TP levels in the surface sediments. Changes of environmental conditions could make the sediments continue to release phosphorus to the overlying water. The TP levels of the overlying water showed a decreasing trend from 2002 to 2012. The results showed that the artificial ecological projects and environmental treatment projects for endogenous pollution sources had effectively improved the water quality since 2003.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	65						252	258		10.5004/dwt.2017.20259								WOS:000403569200028

The model uses the clustering fusion method to process the data collected by the sensors, and the processed data are used as the original input data of the grey forecasting control. At the same time, the output data of the grey forecasting control are compared with the sensor data after fusion to determine the forecast value. Finally, accurate forecast values of water quality in the system are obtained. Many data were obtained after running the system; grey forecasting control model based on clustering and fusion provides system parameters. The mean absolute percentage error of water quality characteristics of conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity was 0.38%, 9.91% and 9.16%, respectively. The results highlight that the proposed method is better than the single grey forecasting method; thus, it can guarantee the different water quality parameters remain stable and meet the water quality requirements.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	64						48	53		10.5004/dwt.2017.20186								WOS:000403568100006

Synthesis of halogenated nanodendrimer as novel antimicrobial agents in water treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Microbiological quality of drinking water is an important aspect of water quality. The aim of this research work was to fabricate and modify G2 and G4 dendrimers as novel antibacterial agent for local application. Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) (G(2) and G(4)) dendrimers were fabricated and modified into quaternary ammonium salts using halogens groups (Cl, Br, I), and characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis. The results of these analysis proved that nanostructure dendrimer and their quaternary ammonium salts are well fabricated. For evaluation of the antimicrobial property, the water samples were collected from rural drinking water resources, and the bacteria isolated and identified from these samples were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antimicrobial activities of PAMAM dendrimers (G(2) and G(4)) and modified PAMAM dendrimers (G(2)Cl, G(2)Br, G(2)I, G(4)Cl, G(4)Br, and G(4)I) against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria were examined by calculating minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and disc diffusion methods. Quaternary ammonium salts exhibited more antimicrobial efficacy against bacteria compared with unmodified ones. The most antibacterial effect was obtained by G(4)I with MIC: 52, 50, 55, and 57 mu g/ml, and MBC: 64, 67, 71, and 75 mu g/ml for Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Escherichia coli, respectively. The disc diffusion test of G(4)I (60 mu M) on different bacteria showed inhibition zone diameters of 31, 28, 26, and 25 ml for Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Escherichia coli, respectively.

The removal -efficiencies of phenol were determined, and their relationships with the initial phenol concentration, absorbed dose, and electron-beam energy were investigated. The EBI was conducted in air with absorbed doses from 40 to 120 kGy under 0.3, 1, and 2 MeV electron beams. G-values were introduced to evaluate the removal of phenol quantitatively and were higher at an absorbed dose of 40 kGy than at 80 or 120 kGy. Dose constants (K) were found to depend on the absorbed dose and initial phenol concentration and used to calculate the optimum doses required for 90% (D-0.9) and 50% (D-0.5) removal of phenol. The reduction of the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), and total organic carbon (TOC) via EBI indicated organic degradation upon irradiation. The EBI process was combined with activated carbon fiber (ACF) adsorption to improve the CODCr removal efficiency. The optimum ACF doses were 0.5, 1.0, and 1.33 g L-1 with 3, 6, and 6 h contact times for the 20, 50, and 100 mg L-1 phenol solutions, respectively. The combination of EBI with ACF improved the CODCr removal efficiency, even in the more concentrated phenol solution. EBI may be a promising pretreatment process for purifying highly concentrated wastewater.

The results elaborated by chemometric methods revealed sensitivity to CO2 content in drinking water, suggesting that this sensing system could be used as a taste sensor. The ability of taste sensor to perform quantitative analysis of minerals content (Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, K+, F-, Cl-, HCO3-, SiO2) concentration in water was also demonstrated. The developed sensing system seems to be promising solution for the analysis of treated drinking water.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	64						345	349		10.5004/dwt.2017.11404								WOS:000403568100048

Analysis of water environment changing trend in Bhagirathi tributary of Ganges in India	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												While determining the quality of water for any water body, low, medium and high values of a parameter stand out to be a very important reference. Moreover, these values are used to decide various design parameters based on scientific aspects and its real applications around the world. In this research, determination of trend of water quality (WQ) status for Bhagirathi River was carried out at two sites, Uttarkashi and Tehri station (Tehri Zero point), for 18 WQ parameters and discharges. Preliminary analysis reveals that all parameter concentrations are below the standard permissible limit. No significant correlation was observed between any parameter with respect to discharge; however, out of 18 parameters, 14 were showing negative correlation indicating groundwater source and geological origin. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between 11 parameters at both sites. Seasonal MannKendall test and Sen's slope method have been used to detect trend and to quantify its magnitude. Increasing trend in the concentration of 7 WQ parameters (Q, EC, K+, Na+, SO42-, BOD and Na%) was observed while decreasing trend was observed for 8 parameters (TA, Ca2+, HCO3-, Mg2+, NO2 + NO3, o-PO43-, DO and TH). Overall, WQ of Bhagirathi River was found to be good and hence is suitable for drinking and life-supporting activities.

J	Jeon, JC; Kim, LH; Min, KS				Jeon, Je-Chan; Kim, Lee-Hyung; Min, Kyung-Sok			Determination on the optimum design factors of BMP for nonpoint pollutant treatment through long-term monitoring	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Despite huge investments about point source pollution in South Korea over the past 30 years, there is no improvement in the restoration of water quality in rivers and lakes since the 1990s. The reason for this was because of the nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. Therefore, the Korean government prepared a variety of policies and systems to control NPS. The 1st comprehensive measures for NPS management were established to provide policies on the installations of test beds for NPS reduction facilities, determination of treatment efficiency through monitoring, and guidelines for planning and maintenance. The study provided a method for proper installation of the inlet screen and weir in the NPS reduction facility. In addition, the study has identified the optimal linear velocity and depth of media in a filtration facility. In the case of screens installed in closed channels, due to clogging caused by wastes, it was found out that installation of a 3-dimensional structure will be convenient for maintenance. Earth and sediment were not controlled when the weir was installed near the inlet of the facility. However, installation of the weir farther from the inlet of the facility had made improvement for the facility's removal efficiency and maintenance. Therefore, the weir should be installed 1-2 m away from the inlet of the facility to improve efficiency and to provide easier maintenance. Meanwhile, results show that a linear velocity of 25-30 m(3)/h in the filtration facility is most effective for the treatment of contaminants. Also, the facility is most efficient when replacement of media takes place once a year during March. On the other hand, the media does not function normally due to blockage by particulate matters after the rainy season. Therefore, there should be surface dredging of the media once a year after heavy rainfalls. It was also found out the optimal thickness of the media in the filtration facility is more than 0.7 m according to the Total suspended solids (TSS) and Total Phosphorus (TP) treatment efficiency analysis.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	63						389	396		10.5004/dwt.2017.11442								WOS:000403567200043						
J	Lee, S; Maniquiz-Redillas, MC; Choi, J; Kim, LH				Lee, Soyoung; Maniquiz-Redillas, Marla C.; Choi, Jiyeon; Kim, Lee-Hyung			Causes and control measures for algae occurrence in a constructed wetland treating stream runoff from agricultural land use	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The constructed wetland (CW) was designed to treat impacted runoff stream water coming from a 221 ha agricultural watershed. The CW was composed of 7 cells in series including a sedimentation zone, deep marsh and shallow marsh. Water quality, sediment and plant monitoring on the CW was conducted since October 2009 and additional analyses were performed to recognize the causes of algae occurrence since 2012. Large amounts of Haematococcus pluvialis species was observed in the first five cells of the CW but no algae was seen at the last 2 cells prior to the outlet. Results indicated that the proportion of plant coverage to surface area in Cells 1 to 5 was very low (less than 6%). Findings revealed that nutrients were being transported into the CW from the catchment area with the soluble nutrients degraded by microbial activities in the sediments and released to the water table. Relatively high potassium content was found in Cell 1 of the CW which originated from the chemical fertilizers used in the paddy field. Algal bloom control and better design methods in the CW were suggested to prevent and regulate the algal bloom in CWs.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	63						404	411		10.5004/dwt.2017.11445								WOS:000403567200045						
J	Jeon, JC; Kwon, KH; Min, KS				Jeon, Je Chan; Kwon, Koo Ho; Min, Kyung Sok			The study on first flush effect of stormwater runoff generated from rural area	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Nonpoint pollutant source have influenced more strong than point pollutant source on the water quality of river. Therefore, the government to control nonpoint pollutant source should try to the effort. Long term monitoring is demanded at research on nonpoint pollutant source because the results of nonpoint pollutant source monitoring is very different through meteorological and geography characteristics such as rainfall, rainfall intensity, catchment area, slope of catchment, soil class and so on. Although, many researches on stormwater runoff characteristics of nonpoint pollutant source at the urban and rural area have been conducted, the research which focused on monitoring of vinyl greenhouse area has been insufficiency. This paper reported results of research that finds out stormwater runoff characteristics. At the first stage of stormwater runoff, the concentration of TSS was the highest because of first flush effect. And then the concentration of BOD and COD was increasing. After discharging stormwater runoff 1 and 2 h later, the concentration of TN and TP was increasing. Rainfall intensity has a great effect on outflow of pollutants. At the vinyl greenhouse, after about 15 mm of rainfall, stormwater runoff was observed. Average runoff ratio of monitoring was 0.53.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	63						425	432		10.5004/dwt.2017.11451								WOS:000403567200048						
J	Jeon, JC; Jung, YJ; Kwon, KH; Min, KS				Jeon, Je Chan; Jung, Yong Jun; Kwon, Koo Ho; Min, Kyung Sok			Enhanced water quality of CSOs with different coagulant treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The present-day construction projects on sewer management in Korea use both combined and separated sewer systems. Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) generated from combined sewer systems (CSS) have a large impact on the water bodies. Today, many researches to treat CSOs are being conducted. In this study, the jar test was conducted to determine the applicability of the coagulation-sedimentation process using chemicals to treat CSOs. Stormwater runoff (mixed with sewer) from a catchment area of 998 ha was used as raw water sample for the experiment. Alum, polyaluminum chloride (PAC), and FeCl3 were used as coagulants and the optimum dose was determined. Moreover, the optimum dose of the weighted coagulant additives (WCA) and polymer coagulant were also determined. Based on the TSS removal efficiency, 30 mg/L, 20 mg/L and 38 mg/L of Alum, PAC and FeCl3, respectively, were determined as the optimum dose. The optimum dosage of polymer coagulant was at 4 mg/L, 5 mg/L and 10 mg/L of Alum, PAC and FeCl3, respectively. Proper coagulants, when injected along with WCA and polymer coagulant, were estimated to be 92.2% (alum), 92.7% (PAC), and 87.6% (FeCl3) based on the TSS removal efficiency.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				FEB	2017	63						469	477		10.5004/dwt.2017.11453								WOS:000403567200054

Comparison of three solid phase extraction sorbents for the isolation of THM precursors from manitoban surface waters	CHEMOSPHERE												Three prepackaged solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges: two modified styrene divinylbenzene, Bond Elut ENV and Bond Elut PPL (Varian), and one N-vinylpyrrolidone (Strata-X, Phenomenex), were assessed for isolation of THM precursors from three surface waters in Manitoba, Canada. The dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the La Salle River (LR), Lake Winnipegosis (LW) and the Waterhen River (WR) were fractionated into hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) parts. ENV isolated less DOM (LR = 46.6 +/- 1.5%; LW = 36.2 +/- 1.4%; WR = 28.6 +/- 2.2%) compared to PPL (LR = 50.2 +/- 4.4%; LW = 47.9 +/- 2.2%; WR = 37.3 +/- 2.8%) and Strata (LR = 46.4% +/- 1.0; LW = 51.6 +/- 03%; WR = 31.9 +/- 3.9%). The HPO fraction isolated by each SPE was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FUR) spectrochemical imaging. The FTIR spectra confirmed the HPO fractions were typical of humic-material and largely resembled fulvic acids; however, the PPL and Strata HPO isolates contained slightly more polysaccharides. The THM formation potential (THMFP) confirmed that the HPO fraction formed more THMs than the HP!. The HPO fraction isolated using ENV was found to have the lowest THMFP of all three SPEs in each waterbody; however, the specific THMFP (mu gTHM/mgDOM) results indicated that ENV isolated THM precursors more effectively, as the Strata and PPL isolated a greater amount of non THM forming material. All three SPE showed significant potential for implementation at water treatment plants as a simple tool to monitor THM precursors in source waters, enabling operators to adapt processes to improve drinking water quality.
