Its catchment area is dominated by high density urban area with moderate to high imperviousness. Some of riparian buffers surrounds six ponds are also occupied by high imperviousness that may lead some ecohydrological problems i.e. water quality degradation, declining freshwater biodiversity and food web changes. The aim of this study is assessing the current state of cascade pond system health. The assessment of macroinvertebrate indices is based on SingScore that have been developed by Public Utilities Board of Singapore for macroinvertebrate biotic index. Impervious cover data is obtained from high-resolution imageries and processed using ArcGIS 10.5. Qualitative statistics methods, Chi-squared test describes the relationship of macroinvertebrate indices with catchment area imperviousness and aquatic buffer zone. The health assessment based on macroinvertebrates indices shows that the lower ponds are relatively healthier than the upper one. There is also any significant relationship between macroinvertebrate indices with impervious cover based on chi square test and cross tabulation analysis.																	2261-236X						2017	138								UNSP 06008	10.1051/matecconf/201713806008								WOS:000426810700091

We proposed a novel data visualization algorithm for water quality monitoring network to process water quality data in real time. Our algorithm can analyze vast water quality data as well as dynamically visualize the pollution diffusion process. We achieved this algorithm based on a MVC web application. Longitudes and latitudes of all the monitoring locations are converted to screen coordinates and visualize the monitoring network. When a pollution event occurs, we use different colors to indicate different pollution levels. The color of river segments can be automatically changed in real time to represent the pollution diffusion processing as well as the pollution level in different river segments.																	2352-5401		978-94-6252-381-4				2017	141						1576	1579										WOS:000426708900277

The current practice requires regular manual intervention. In smaller WTPs, often serving remote communities, regular intervention by experienced operators is not feasible and, hence, coagulant overdosing and underdosing can occur regularly negatively affecting the cost of water production and the health of communities. We present an autonomous system that includes a learning based control, regulating the process during abrupt changes in water quality, and a model predictive control, responsible to compensate for the slow to moderate changes during regular operations. The conformity of the system to the cognitive dynamic framework is discussed. Results based on a laboratory scale implementation show that the system can start without the knowledge input-output mapping and can successfully address changes in observed and unobserved intake water quality parameters.																	0840-7789		978-1-5090-5538-8				2017																		WOS:000424192700171

This method is time consuming, wastage of man power, and not economical. The water quality measuring system that we have implemented checks the quality of water in real time through various sensors (one for each parameter: pH, conductivity, temperature) to measure the quality of water. The ZigBee module in the system transfers data collected by the sensors to the microcontroller wirelessly, and a GSM module transfers wirelessly the data further from the microcontroller to the smart phone/PC. The system also has proximity sensors to alert the officials by sending a message to them via the GSM module in case someone tries to pollute the water body. This system can keep a strict check on the pollution of the water resources and be able to provide an environment for safe drinking water.																			978-1-5090-4708-6				2017							78	82										WOS:000426812500016

However, the information on sanitary quality of these products and their effect on human health are nonexistent. In this paper the sanitary quality of 20 commercial brands of packaged water expended in the Maracaibo city, with respect to existing national legislation was analyzed. The samples were obtained from shops, supermarkets and street vendors, considering their city distribution and occurrence frequency in commercial establishments. The parameters analyzed were: pH, real color, turbidity, fluoride, total hardness, total dissolved solids (TDS), total and fecal coliform bacteria, according to standardized methods. The packaged water expended in the Maracaibo city represents a risk to consumer health due to breaches of national standards for pH (30%), real color (45%), fluoride (100%), total (60%) and faecal (24%) coliform bacteria. The presentations in canisters of 18.9 L represent the highest risk of consumption, exceeding the permissible limits of total and fecal coliform bacteria in 100 and 91%, respectively. It requires effective vigilance and quality control of packaged water expended in the Maracaibo city by competent authorities, in order to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases.																	1690-4648					JAN-JUL	2017	58	1					26	35										WOS:000426806900003

State monitoring system of quality of water was discussed and critically reviewed. Mobile measurements technique to collect vast number of measuring points across the large water body during one day cruise to make maps of pollutants distributions was described. Maps of water quality parameters show dynamic changes of spatial distributions of pollutants both in time and along the length of the lake which proves that one point measurements cannot be representative for the large water body. Critical evaluation of calibration principles and accuracy of the most frequently used water quality models, WASP and GEMSS are presented. On the basis of CFD calculations, close correlation between water quality and hydrodynamics in large water bodies regarding the physicochemical aspects and biological production was proved. Neglecting the effect of hydrodynamic on eutrophication process introduce large element of uncertainty in determination of nutrients flow in the large water bodies.

The aim of the studies was to obtain initial data to assess the current ambient conditions of the study area, as well as to develop the project of cleaning the upper stretch of the Tikhomandritsa riverbed and spillway structure construction. Water, bottom sediments and soil contamination levels were identified. It is found that the water quality in the studied water bodies belongs to the contaminated category. Bottom sediments at the upper stretch of the river up to a distance of 2.5 km from its source are pure and can be used in agriculture without restrictions. Bottom sediments samples taken at a distance of 5.5 km from the river source and its mouth contain dangerous level of coliform bacteria. Basing on the territory survey a tree and shurberry felling plan was drawn up and the volume of works of the river purification was determined. The project implementation will help to increase the river flow in dry water years, increase its self-cleaning velocity and environmental improvement of the area. In addition, the increase of water flow into Udomlya lake will provide Kalinin NPP with additional water resources for its process water supply. The conceptual scheme of this study is largely applicable for the basins of other small rivers.																	2261-236X						2017	106								07009	10.1051/matecconf/201710607009								WOS:000426426600171

It is used, among other purposes, to forecast the pollutant concentration and its impact on the water quality. The algorithm to compute the watershed can be hard to parallelize and with the increasingly data growth, the need for parallel computation increases. In this paper we propose a new method to parallelize the watershed computation. Our algorithm is decomposed into two tasks, the parallel watershed segmentation into a hierarchy that allows in a second task to retrieve randomly large watersheds at run-time in interactive time.																			978-1-5386-3250-5				2017							86	92		10.1109/HPCS.2017.24								WOS:000425930800014

Real Time Monitoring of the Environmental parameters of an Aquaponic System Based on Internet of Things	2017 THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT (ICONSTEM)					3rd IEEE International Conference on Science Technology Engineering & Management (ICONSTEM)	MAR 23-24, 2017	Chennai, INDIA	Jeppiaar Engn Coll, IEEE				Aquaponics is a system which is a junction of aquaculture and hydroponics, in which the waste produced by the aquatic creatures are passed as nutrients to grow plants hydroponically, which in turn purifies the water. This system can be made use of to produce organic food to match the ever-growing demand for food in the world. Since, the system continuouslyrecycles the water used, the quality of water must be constantly monitored at regular intervals. Manuallydoing this task can be very tiring. Hence, Internet of Things(IoT) can be used as an effective application for this purpose. This will considerably reduce the human intervention in the system and also improve the efficiency of the system. The latest technologies such as Internet of Things can help in implementing this system in urban areas like smart cities where traditional farming is not feasible and produce locally grown organic food. The system proposed here consists of continuous monitoring of the water quality and the plant's environment by using different sensors. The information collected by the sensors are accessed remotely by using the Internet of things.																			978-1-5090-4855-7				2017							943	947										WOS:000425882000116

In modern aquaculture management, a remote water quality monitoring and computer-controlled intensive culture is the future trend in aquaculture. The objective of this research is to design and develop a real-time mobile-based water temperature monitoring system capable of decreasing the reliance on manpower at the monitoring site to reduce the cost and to assess fish production cycle and fish grow-out system. The system implementation resulted in a monitoring system that collects the current water temperature from the core-controller in real-time. Also, the system provides and displays information that includes normal range, maximum, minimum, average and findings of the collected temperatures. The results obtained in this study has shown the ability of data acquisition in the remote and real-time detection of water temperature accurately and efficiently. It provides decision support to help and guide fisher folks in avoiding distress to fish and obtaining the optimum water temperature range. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Currently, there are many types of membranes which have been introduced to remove contaminants from an aqueous solution. Hence, the water quality could be maintained and safe to consume. The objective of this paper is to apply and investigate the effectiveness of a selective membrane in detecting nitrate, phosphate, zinc, and nickel ions by means of planar electromagnetic sensors array (PESA). The samples have four different concentration levels, 5 ppm, 25 ppm, 75 ppm, and 100 ppm. The selective membrane's performance is evaluated based on absolute average sensitivity (vertical bar Z%vertical bar). This performance is compared with conventional coating such as incralac. The developed membrane consists of two elements which are polymer and solvent. Modified silica is selected as a polymer material while N-(2-Aminoethyl)-3 Aminipropyltrimethoxysilane is selected as a solvent. The selection of these materials is based on their ability to attract the contaminants in the aqueous solution and hence increased the selectivity. The proposed sensor with a membrane shows its higher sensitivity compared to incralac. The highest sensitivity is 338 % which observed in the presence of membrane for the nickel detection. Meanwhile, the lowest sensitivity using membrane is 12 % for zinc detection.																	0128-7680					JAN	2017	25				SI		267	274										WOS:000426365200030

In this paper, the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm was optimized with the Dolphin Swarm Algorithm. Optimal weight and threshold of Extreme Learning Machine algorithm was searched by the process of creating a virtual team and seeking the best position of Dolphin Swarm. Four parameters of Ph, dissolved oxygen (DO), Potassium permanganate index CODMn) and ammonia-nitrogen(NH3-N) were chosen to evaluate the level of the water and the Extreme Learning Machine algorithm optimized by Dolphin Swarm Algorithm (DSA-ELM) was used as the evaluation model of the water quality. In this paper, the water quality of 18 monitoring sites of Huai river was evaluated by DSA-ELM and ELM method. Compared the ELM algorithm model, the DSA-ELM model has the advantage of high accuracy and good stability.																	2330-7986		978-1-5386-3273-4				2017																		WOS:000425859500105

Automated Aquaculture System that Regulates Ph, Temperature and Ammonia	2017 IEEE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMANOID, NANOTECHNOLOGY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION AND CONTROL, ENVIRONMENT AND MANAGEMENT (IEEE HNICEM)	IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Nanotechnology Information Technology Communication and Control Environment and Management				9th IEEE International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management (IEEE HNICEM)	NOV 29-DEC 03, 2017	Pasay, PHILIPPINES	IEEE, IEEE Philippines				The current method of raising tilapia in the Philippines is through fish ponds exposed to the weather. Methods for measuring pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia are limited to manually using a chemical test kit. The current system relies on manually regulating the water quality so the fish are at risk of harmful situations resulting from unsafe levels of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, or ammonia. This study aims to solve that problem by creating a system that automatically measures and regulates the pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia. This study takes advantage of electronic sensors for pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen, while computing the ammonia factor, to allow the user to measure the levels of the said parameters at any given time, process, send the data to a LabVIEW database, and use the data to automatically take corrective action against harmful levels of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia while notifying the user through SMS. The proponents of this study built the prototype and tested it on two different trials of 50 fingerlings each in a 1 cubic-meter glass aquarium.																	2475-7152		978-1-5386-0912-5				2017																		WOS:000426116300075

The third factor includes the high level of salinity which is a great threat for the mangroves. With that, the researcher of this study came up with a low cost salinity monitoring system with temperature sensors. The said sensor node determines whether the salinity of the water exceeds the acceptable level (10,000 ppm) and upon encountered, the floodgates represented by the water pump will be controlled to open for the freshwater to flow from reservoirs. The flow of freshwater will stop by closing the floodgates as the sensor nodes determine that salinity level is now reduced to the acceptable ppm range. The low cost salinity sensor is based on the magnetic induction concept of the two sets of coils which are in toroidal and solenoid in forms. Zigbee will be the communications network of the sensors, the Arduino microcontroller and the water pump control system. System was deployed in two areas: the mangrove forest and non-mangrove located in Barangay Calibuyo, Tanza, Cavite. With the results, it's proven that the created salinity sensor has correlated results with the commercial one. Also, temperature has inverse relationship with the water salinity. Lastly, the control of the motor based on the threshold has proven 100% working as checked with different water samples.																	2475-7152		978-1-5386-0912-5				2017																		WOS:000426116300018

This work presents the effect of water quality parameters with each other in a controlled aquaculture environment, which can be used to ensure data reliability. The water quality parameters that are considered are temperature, pH and flow rate. Experimentations were done using tap water to correlate the effect of change in temperature with pH, and the effect of varying flow rate with pH and temperature. The parameter correlation was computed using linear regression. Raspberry Pi was used as the system microcomputer that integrates all the parameters being investigated. Throughout the study, water level was maintained in a desired level, and was ensured by integrating a water level sensor into the system. The alternative hypothesis stated that pH and temperature have strong negative relationship with each other. Experiment results shown that pH has inversely proportional relationship with temperature. The null hypothesis stated that flow rate has no effect on water pH and temperature. External factors like water source also has an effect on parameter values changes.																	2475-7152		978-1-5386-0912-5				2017																		WOS:000426116300010

BIODIVERSITY SUSTAINABILITY USING TELEMETRY FOR THE REMOTE TRANSMISSION OF DATA FROM LAKE BUHI, CAMARINES SUR	2017 IEEE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMANOID, NANOTECHNOLOGY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION AND CONTROL, ENVIRONMENT AND MANAGEMENT (IEEE HNICEM)	IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Nanotechnology Information Technology Communication and Control Environment and Management				9th IEEE International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management (IEEE HNICEM)	NOV 29-DEC 03, 2017	Pasay, PHILIPPINES	IEEE, IEEE Philippines				The biodiversity remediation strategies currently used at Lake Buhi, Camarines Sur shows that new techniques are required to solve the problems of decreasing level of dissolved oxygen, increasing carbon dioxide and varying pH values. One such technique that could be used involved the use of telemetry for the remote transmission of data. This method used reactive media, particularly the sensors, to evaluate contaminated lake water. The aims of this study were to develop a telemetric device for real time monitoring and identification of water quality problems; develop a complementary program using Visual Basic and microchip that could remotely monitor water quality through the use of a GSM module; and perform comparative evaluation of the results derived from the device with the results produced by the conventional methods. The comparative evaluations of the results derived from the device were in congruence with the existing method. Its lower variance proved the greater precision of the proposed device. Hence, the telemetry device could be considered as an alternative to the existing device and can be adopted for use by the different LGUs in the province for a more efficient monitoring of water quality in the province.																	2475-7152		978-1-5386-0912-5				2017																		WOS:000426116300099

Continuous effective online monitoring with user friendly decision support system is one of the essential challenges of water quality monitoring system. To achieve the goal of development of user friendly decision support system for monitoring of potable water in distribution network, this paper introduces soft computing framework, mainly consist of Python programming framework and fuzzy sets. In so far, we have exploited the properties of NumPy and Matplotlib libraries of Python for user interface and fuzzy sets for decision support system. The proposed decision support system collects and utilizes the data points generated from integrated Multi Sensor Array and process the obtained data set through rule based fuzzy sets. Effective user interface and decision making are essential prerequisite of any decision support system. Therefore, we developed Rule Based Decision Support System (RBDSS) strategy to measure the extent of potability of water in distribution network. Based on extensive research, five water quality parameters has been considered to implement decision support system i.e pH, Dissolved Oxygen (D.O.), Electrical Conductivity (E.C.), Oxygen Reduction Potential (O.R.P) and Temperature. The conducted study to test the feasibility of proposed decision support system testify the plausibility of framework in water quality distribution network.																			978-1-5386-2053-3				2017																		WOS:000426528400017

Such critical events threat the human health. Water utilities are concerned by the control of water quality. However, the traditional methods frequently used, are based on laboratory analyses and take several days. To prevent earlier water quality degradation, a real-time monitoring is required. The implementation of the smart technology in the distribution networks ensures a rapid detection of abnormalities. Since the use of this technology is recent, it requires a field application to evaluate its feasibility. This paper presents a field study of the use of this technology in a project conducted at the campus of the University of Lille within the European project "SmartWater4Europe". The campus is equipped with two types of sensors: S::CAN and EventLab. S::CAN measures multiple parameters such as turbidity and free chlorine, while EventLab measures the variation of the refractive index. We present in this paper the feedback of these smart devices, the analysis of water quality signals and finally a comparison with laboratory tests.																			978-1-5090-6011-5				2017																		WOS:000426506500058

Since the 1970s, the city has been supplied with surface water that is collected from 5 small watersheds and treated in a single main plant located in Ntoum, 40 km east of Libreville. There are few additional surface water resources available nearby, and the national water utility is desperately seeking cheap, alternative water resources. From 2007 to 2014, SEURECA and HYDROCONSEIL provided SEEG with hydrogeological expertise to develop groundwater resource near existing facilities. A thick limestone layer (Madiela limestone) had been previously drilled by oil companies. Madiela has very limited outcrops (5 km(2)), but proved to be highly productive (2000-10,000 m3/day per borehole), and we successfully developed a new well field. As (a) the aquifer extension is limited and (b) there is a risk of seawater intrusion, the well field was developed step-by-step and the water levels and water quality were carefully monitored (i.e., conductivity, which can indicate seawater intrusion). The aquifer storage capacity was measured through the long dry season drawdown as being 220,000 m(3) per m. This is sizeable, but insufficient was the aquifer to be mined. For this reason, we proposed a MAR strategy and monitored aquifer recharge during rainfall events. This recharge proved to be highly impressive (>20 million m(3)/year). Such a large recharge is higher than expected from direct infiltration in such a tiny aquifer outcrop. Additional recharge mechanisms have been investigated through geophysical prospecting, and the hydrogeological model has been updated accordingly. Presently, Ntoum well field produces 55,000 m3/day of good quality water without this having any significant impact on resource quality or quantity (i.e., no significant drawdown of the water table has been recorded). In light of the recharge efficiency, we have developed a MAR strategy that includes a new well field further to the north, with 4 additional deep wells.																	2511-2066	2511-2082	978-3-319-45465-8; 978-3-319-45464-1				2017							273	281		10.1007/978-3-319-45465-8_26								WOS:000426347900026

Controlling the flow of water so that it doesn't go to waste is another challenge. Water flow is generally managed through locks and manually controlling these gates often turn out to be a long-winding process. Due to recent technological progress and increased connectivity in rural areas, a system of IoT devices proved to be alternative for managing the water grid. A new Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology called LoRa is explored in our study for the communication of these IoT devices. The LoRa devices can communicate within a range of 2-4 KMs while running on batteries that last for years. As a pilot project, we implemented a smart water grid management system in Mori, a village in the eastern Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh situated near to Bay of Bengal. The water grid management system proposed in this paper involves different sensors deployed at various strategically chosen locations to measure the quality of water by generating real time data. The system also provides an alert mechanism which notifies the different level of authorities through email and SMS in case of any issues. Furthermore, it provides a solution for handling the locks that have been employed in and around the village to control the flow of water in a timely manner. The sensors attached with a micro controller in the LoRa module will communicate to the cloud environment through the LoRa gateway. A web page provides the interface to the residents and to the authorities to gauge the water quality after analyzing the data using the prediction algorithm.																			978-1-5090-5873-0				2017							83	88										WOS:000425861800015

HMI is a device for interaction between a user with e-Shrimp. Periodically Remote Pond Monitoring (RPM) module on e-Shrimp will provide information of water quality condition of the pond on HMI which is then displayed on LCD screen and LED indicator. This research uses a multi-pond system. HMI is able to receive information from four RPM sensors at the same time. HMI can also provide notification to the user in form of alarm and Short Message Service (SMS) when water quality information of the pond is in an abnormal condition. In addition, a user can use the keypad to navigate menus on the e-Shrimp system or send SMS to HMI to perform the desired action. The data sent to the HMI is stored into the SD Card which can be used for the research needs of the user.																			978-1-5386-2778-5				2017							24	29										WOS:000425845200005

Therefore, real-time water quality monitoring is an important part of human activities and water pollution prevention. In this paper, the behavior of zebrafish was monitored by computer vision. Firstly, the moving target was extracted by the method of saliency detection, and tracked by fitting the ellipse model. Then the motion parameters were extracted by optical flow method, and the data were monitored in real time by means of Hinkley warning and threshold warning. We achieved classification warning through a number of dimensions by comprehensive toxicity index. The experimental results show that the system can achieve more accurate real-time monitoring.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1707-0; 978-1-5106-1706-3				2017	10605		1						UNSP 106052J	10.1117/12.2293477								WOS:000426279000086

A hundred year snow event which followed not only hindered the repair work, but also settled the water meter pit by 6". After rebuilding a 42-ft deep manhole on a 4' x6' egg shaped sewer, replacing a few segments of 8" water pipes, point-repair of a 12" sewer, and backfilling the street around the manhole, the street around the manhole continued to settle until dozens of cubic yards of low mobility grouting (LMG) in the impact zone around the manhole were deployed. During this investigation, DC Water engineers were surprised to find that the rest of the street had a very low blow count below a depth of 8 feet, indicating hidden voids in the soil and thus very poor soil condition. Review of the as-built records indicated that this street appeared to have a 42-ft +/-deep built-up fill in 1892 after constructing a 4' x6' egg shaped sewer to contain the spring water. Entry inspection by engineers also confirmed clear live flow in the "abandoned" section of the egg shape sewer. Water quality and low pressure issues in this neighborhood qualified the 8" water line on the list to be replaced with new ductile iron pipes via open-cut, i.e, the conventional rehabilitation method. It came to our engineer's realization that this dirt fill built-up street is in a delicate equilibrium atop of the hidden voids. The DDOT's reinforced concrete underlayment slab and a seven feet+/- of soil arch seems to act as a "land bridge" that supports the street. Any conventional open cut approach to slit the street open will likely remove the bridge effect. This presentation will showcase how DC Water engineers perform internal and external benchmarking to assess the risk associated with the conventional open-cut methodology, and how alternative CIPP for water service pipe rehab is confirmed.																			978-0-7844-8089-2				2017							249	258										WOS:000426213400024

The project was undertaken in 2016 between February and April and involved the replacement of approximately 5,800 L.F. of existing aging and undersized asbestos cement water lines in the vicinity of the downtown core to reduce maintenance and repairs and improve water service levels. Six line segments of existing 2-inch to 6-inch asbestos cement water lines were replaced by 6-inch diameter PVC pipe. The City of Yuma worked together with Stantec Consulting Services to use this project as a means to conduct a head-to-head analysis of various aspects of traditional open-cut construction compared to Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD). The project was intentionally separated into HDD (2,000 L.F.) and open-cut (3,800 L.F.) sections. PVC C900 DR14 was installed using open-cut, while Fusible PVC (FPVC) DR 14 was installed by HDD. Onsite data was collected to analyze and compare environmental impacts, traffic impacts, and productivity. HDD was found to be more advantageous in all three areas when compared to traditional open-cut. Airborne emissions generated during the project by each of the two methods were determined using the eCalc (TM) program. Water samples were taken for each installation method to compare water quality before and after the installation of the new water lines.																			978-0-7844-8089-2				2017							465	474										WOS:000426213400044

The electronic turbidity sensor operates based on the scattered light and absorption intensity with results to light scattering in solids and liquids. Natural environment is applied to this sensor to get the actual behavior of the water sample with NTU reading that is approximately similar to commercial sensor. Our turbidity sensor is created by a simple optical setup, which consists of (1) Infrared LED and (3) photodiode. The turbidity is determined by measuring the scattered Infrared LED light by the particles in the water sample and the absorption of light from the emitter. This project uses basic component and it is cost saving making it convenient for user. Conclusively, this electronic turbidity sensor can be used as part of a low-cost sensor to provide continuous turbidity information about water quality directly to consumers. Laboratory tests are conducted and it is proven that, the proposed device produced a comparable NTU reading as a commercial turbidity sensor. Other than that, electronic acquisition, signal conditioning and computing capabilities are included in the whole system.																			978-1-5386-0380-2				2017							105	109										WOS:000425929400021

These systems convey a large flow along existing open channels. Man fill was brought to create land above for development. This has been the pillar of the urbanization in D.C. More than a century later, these trunk sewers carry even more flow than before. The forthcoming $3.5 billion CSO tunnel system in DC will supplement the trunk sewer system to relieve local flooding, reduce overflow thus improve water quality. The century old trunk sewers present a daunting task for DC Water to optimize its resources to manage the linear asset, a significant part of the goals in the Blue Horizon 2020 Strategic Plan. DC Water engineers synergize our engineering efforts to assess, improve, and protect our mission critical infrastructure. This presentation showcases our engineer's holistic effort, from tooling mindset, sharpening skillsets, to managing our collection system in Washington DC. Updating DC Water infrastructure design guidelines to summarize tried and true lessons learned from the past decades, promoting the best proactive practices in design, and impact assessments to improve risk management. Categorize recent sewer failures in Washington DC, to define the outside factors and inside factors, identify common cause(s): thinking outside the tunnel so as to gauge the sensitivity and vulnerability of the system and thus identify a threshold for open-cut and trenchless methodologies. Besides CCTV inspection, deploying sophisticated entry inspections in mission critical sewer tunnels, with non-destructive scanning and testing tools to perform at-contact inspections from inside the pipe, and to calibrate scanning and testing from outside the pipe as needed. Implementing in-house finite element model analysis of common sizes and shapes of sewer tunnels to reveal the loading conditions and in-situ capabilities so as to gauge the general as-is condition. Strategizing rehabilitation technologies to balance the effectiveness, longevity and cost: promoting a sensible discretionary composite rehabilitation design instead of a new pipe-in-pipe. Such composites appear more sustainable hydraulically and financially. Taking technical stewardship in managing spincast rehabilitation technology when lacking a consistent indirect engineering criteria among vendors, i.e., DC Water engineers do more to establish consistent design approach so that the public work contract can be assessed on equal ground.																			978-0-7844-8087-8				2017							378	388										WOS:000425812300035

The neural network is trained based on the observation data. Upon that the methods of environmental assessment and suitability of water for irrigation as well as for drinking needs can be used for the neural networking. The developed ecosystem model enables to improve significantly the water use and decision making for the purposes of the environmental rehabilitation of the river basin compared to the existing approaches. As an example we considered the Inhulets River. The ecosystem assessment of water quality for irrigation needs along the river bed was made. Using the neural network model a system model for the complex control of the river bed flushing was developed. The model performs a feedback based on the observations data at the water intake point. It enables to evaluate and select better scenarios compared to the existing operational procedure of flushing.

So, chemistry department should use its own language, knowledge and experience to express their thoughts and what they have seen during the engineering commissioning period. As the first commercial operation nuclear power plant after Fukushima nuclear accident, during the four units commissioning period, chemical researchers accumulated a lot of good experience and feedbacks in the aspect of construction and commissioning for new nuclear power plant. For example, in order to ensure the personnel skill level, we must make special plans which include staff training,laboratory construction, instrument and on-line system commissioning, and all of these should be timely adjusted and changed in order to be consistent with the engineering progress. In order to ensure the water quality of pipe flushing in different stages, such as cold functional test, hot functional test, we should set a strictly water chemical standard which based on the HAF103, and the standard should have some differences in different stage for one unit. In order to ensure the water chemistry in good performance especially after the unit going into commercial operation, the maintenance plan for equipment and system must be formulated, and then, a detailed monitoring plan must be executed. At the same time, a strict system flushing controlling mode can also provide a great benefits for water chemistry quality, especially in the period of start-up. In addition to these above experiences, chemistry researchers of Ningde nuclear power plant also accumulated a lot of good practices and feedbacks about dealing with some abnormal water quality activities, which can't be founded in commercial operation unit. For example, the aluminum (Al) content in the primary increased rapidly and beyond the specification limits in hot functional test and so on. This article will share the good practices and feedbacks of the first phase of Fujian Ningde nuclear power plant. We hope these good practices and experience feedbacks can provide good reference for the other new nuclear plants in the stage of design, construction, operation and maintenance in the future.																			978-0-7918-5779-3				2017									V001T01A029									WOS:000426019800029

The scope of the analyses are water quality monitoring data of the Tisa River at tree measuring points along its flow through Serbia: Martonos, Novi Becej and Titel in period 2004-2014. The analyses encompassed conductivity, dissolved oxygen, BOD5, COD, nitrates and total phosphorus. Assessment of water quality has been conducted by the application of contemporary classifications and criteria of the Republic of Serbia. Reference conditions for achieving excellent ecological status, I class of water quality are achieved for conductivity, dissolved oxygen, along investigated section (measuring points: Martonos, Novi Becej and Titel) and BOD5 at the measuring point Martonos. Downstream at measuring points Novi Becej and Titel for BOD5 water quality belongs to class II. According to concentrations of COD, nitrates and total phosphorus water quality belongs exclusively to class II. Linear regression analyses was applied for determining trend lines of parameters, while Mann-Kendell test in most cases (14/18), i.e. 78%, has confirmed nonexistence of significant trend. Water quality during the past decade is stable. A statistically significant trend was confirmed in 4 cases: nitrates (measuring point Martonos, descending trend), BOD5 and total phosphorus (measuring point Novi Becej, descending trend), and dissolved oxygen (measuring point Titel, increasing trend). Signs of these trends speak in favor of future improvement of water quality of the Tisa River in Serbia.

During the years 2011-2013, samples of treated wastewater and water from the river were collected (upstream and downstream of the wastewater discharge point) and subjected to physicochemical analysis and, in 2013, also to microbiological analysis. The study showed that the treated wastewater outflowing from the treatment plant did not have any negative influence on the quality of the water in the receiver. Water from the Urzedowka River met clarity standards for class I waters; only the concentrations of total phosphorus and nitrate nitrogen exceeded the limit values for water clarity class II. The studies have shown that waters from the Urzedowka River upstream of the treatment plant contained a huge concentration of E. coli bacteria, fecal coliform bacteria and fecal enterococci, which indicates the impact of other sources of microbiological pollution.																	1506-218X						2017	19						370	393										WOS:000423417800020

Samples of water for physicochemical analyses were taken twice a year. Water was sampled from piezometers, wells, drainage ditches and from the river Swinka. The following parameters were analyzed: pH, conductivity, dissolved substances, general hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, nitrates, sulphates and chlorides. The examined indicators were subjected to Friedman's nonparametric univariate analysis (ANOVA) for measurements repeated using the Statistica software. The tests and analysis of water and sewage management make it possible to evaluate the physicochemical parameters of waters within the mining area in the Lublin Coal Basin. The best measure of the intensity of parameter changes can be the response of the surface water environment to contact with mining waters. Underground waters featured low values of chemical indicators. Drinking water drawn from wells in all cases was classified as quality class I. Ground waters sampled from piezometers were most often classified as quality class II. The value of maximum conductivity did not exceed 2500 mu S.cm(-1), while that of dissolved substances, 1500 mg.dm(-3). Only with regard to the content of calcium and chlorides were some cases of water quality class III recorded. The maximum value for calcium was 2500 mg Ca+.dm(-3), while for chlorides this was 300 mg Cl.dm(3). Water in the river featured parameter values similar to those recorded for underground water. Therefore, it could be included in quality class II (the limit value for conductivity is 2000 mu S.cm(-1), for dissolved substances 1000 mg.dm(-3)). The situation was different for water sampled from ditches. Here, water quality indicators were even three times higher than in the river. In this case the limit values for quality class II were exceeded. Such limit values are not determined for other classes. Can observe changes in the examined parameters describing the quality of river Swinka waters, it must be stressed that the significant increase in mining activity had no effect whatsoever on its water quality. The increase in chemical concentrations in mine waters drained to the river are not that high so as to cause irreversible changes in this ecosystem. This is proved by a fast return of water quality in the river to the pre-drainage condition. Comparing their current state to the beginning of mining activity, the majority of mine water indicators show stability. The observed single increases in concentrations do not remain fixed. Waters taken from the piezometers, the well and the river were classified as second water quality, while the waters from the land improvement ditches did not meet these criteria. The highest quality was observed for groundwater which is often classified as Type I water quality. This means that the aquifers provide good insulation and are not affected by the Bogdanka mine's activity.																	1506-218X						2017	19						411	422										WOS:000423417800022						
J	Grzywna, A; Sender, J; Bronowicka-Mielniczuk, U				Grzywna, Antoni; Sender, Joanna; Bronowicka-Mielniczuk, Urszula			Analysis of the Ecological Status of Surface Waters in the Region of the Lublin Conurbation	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												The paper presents the results of surveys into the ecological status of rivers in the region of Lublin. Biological and chemical elements were analysed between 2012-2014. Analyses were carried out at the following 8 checkpoints on the rivers. The following chemical and biological indicators were determined in water samples. The obtained results were processed by statistical methods including determining the differentiation of water quality indicators as regards the checkpoint (measuring site) and the year of measurement. To this end, methods of descriptive statistics were used, including box-plots. The data was analysed using Statistica software. The analysed river waters were characterised by very low content of ammonia nitrogen below 0.4 mg N-NH4/1, total nitrogen below 5 mg N.dm(-3) and conductivity below 600 uS/cm. These values are characteristic of class I water purity. The content of Kjeldahl nitrogen within the range of 1-2 mg N.dm(-3), phosphates within the range 0.2-0.4 mg PO4.m(-3), nitrate nitrogen 2-5 mg N-NO3.dm(-3) and phosphorus 0.2-0.4 mg P.dm(-3) makes the analysed waters eligible for purity class II. Sometimes the content of phosphates in the region of Lublin exceeds the limit value for class II 0.4 mg PO4.dm(-3). BOD5 in lake Zalew Zemborzycki continuously exceeded the limit value for class II 6 mg O-2.dm(-3). The results were considerably worse for biological indicators. For MIR the index was 37-41, which made the waters eligible for purity class II. At some checkpoints located within the limits of Lublin city the value of the index lower than 37 made the water eligible for purity class III. For IO the index most often ranged from 0.3 to 0.4, which corresponds to class III water purity. A decrease in the index below 0.3 in Ciemicga and Czechowka rivers made the water eligible for purity class IV. The main reason for the poor ecological status of water was a high content of phosphates and a low diatom index. The largest variability in the value of the index was characteristic of the analysed watercourses for nitrate nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen and oxygen level. The watercourses are not very wide (1-3 m) and not very deep (0.2-1.0 m), they have a low flow and their beds are modified (profiled bed, concrete slabs). Watercourses located outside the city are characterised by moderate ecological potential (quality class III), whereas watercourses in Lublin are characterised by insufficient ecological potential (quality class IV). Anova analysis showed a significant variability in values between checkpoints, which is not applicable to MIR only. In most cases, no significant variability in the values of indicators was recorded between years at respective checkpoints, which is not applicable to phosphates and total phosphorus.																	1506-218X						2017	19						439	450										WOS:000423417800024

However, that the new deposit found its place in water technology, should start research to determine its usefulness in the process of filtration. The aim of this study was to analyzed and evaluated the effectiveness of filtration two unknown, porous filter masses. Therefore, it was examined the behavior of filter bed by filtration in the laboratory, to assess the efficiency of removal of particular contaminants from the water. Chemical indicators were examined in the model water flowing through the mass, such as: pH, electrolytic conductivity, CODMn, dry residue, chloride concentration, ammonium concentration, nitrate (V) concentration, total hardness, iron and manganese concentration. It has been proved that the bed X-1, which has an less equivalent particle diameter, efficiently removed contaminants from the water compared to filter bed X-2. Filter beds X-1 and X-2 does not purify the water to the value of the regulation of the minister of health.

At many streams the outlets of urban drainage systems are also located, contributing to the pollution discharged with the runoff directly to the streams. In retention tanks built on urban streams for flooding protection needs, sedimentation of total suspended solids takes place. Along with the suspended solid also the pollutants adsorbed on solid particle surfaces, including heavy metals, accumulate in the sediments. The main source of heavy metals is urban traffic (spills fuel and automotive fluids, tire wear, brake pads, attrition of the road surface), but metals are also washed out from the roofs surfaces, deposited with dust etc. Assessment of heavy metals concentration is important for future methods of sediments disposal. Sediments deposited in the reservoirs are a very good indicrato of water quality, aquatic ecosystem and also a proper track record of antropogenic. In the article concentrations of four heavy metals: zinc, copper, lead and cadmium was analysed in water and sediment samples collected from five retention tanks along Oliwski Stream. Oliwski Stream is one of the longests streams in gdansk. It flows through the Valley of Joy, Oliwa Park, Zabianka and outflows directly to the Gulf of Gdansk near the popular beach and bathing place in Jelitkowo. Concentrations of zinc, copper and cadmium in water samples were low. In case of lead the admissible mean annual concentrations were exceeded in three locations. Metals concentrations in collected sediment samples were on different levels depending on retention tank and some characteristics of its watershed. Concentrations of zinc varied from 27 to 130 mg/kg d.m., copper from 2,3 do 89 mg/kg d.m, and lead from 7 to 50 mg/kg d.m. The highest concentrations of copper were measured in the bottom sediments from retention tank Grunwaldzka situated in the district old Oliwa, whith relatively high numer of copper roofs. In order to facilitate the quality assessment, concentrations of heavy metals were compared to the geochemical criteria proposed by Polish Geological Insitute and to the German sediment classification LAWA (Lander- Arbeitsge-meinschaft Wasser) from 1998. The concentrations of zinc, lead and cadmium-were on low level, comparing with both classifications. The concentrations of cadmium did not exceed the level of geochemical background, according to Polish Geological Insitute. In case of copper the moderate level of pollution was observed.

With the development of industrialization, the phenomenon of water pollution is becoming more and more frequent, which directly affects the survival and development of human. Water quality detection is one of the necessary measures to protect water resources. Ultraviolet (UV) spectral analysis is an important research method in the field of water quality detection, which partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis method is becoming predominant technology, however, in some special cases, PLSR's analysis produce considerable errors. In order to solve this problem, the traditional principal component regression (PCR) analysis method was improved by using the principle of PLSR in this paper. The experimental results show that for some special experimental data set, improved PCR analysis method performance is better than PLSR. The PCR and PLSR is the focus of this paper. Firstly, the principal component analysis (PCA) is performed by MATLAB to reduce the dimensionality of the spectral data; on the basis of a large number of experiments, the optimized principal component is extracted by using the principle of PLSR, which carries most of the original data information. Secondly, the linear regression analysis of the principal component is carried out with statistic package for social science (SPSS), which the coefficients and relations of principal components can be obtained. Finally, calculating a same water spectral data set by PLSR and improved PCR, analyzing and comparing two results, improved PCR and PLSR is similar for most data, but improved PCR is better than PLSR for data near the detection limit. Both PLSR and improved PCR can be used in Ultraviolet spectral analysis of water, but for data near the detection limit, improved PCR's result better than PLSR.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1752-0; 978-1-5106-1751-3				2017	10620								UNSP 106200V	10.1117/12.2285011								WOS:000425529900030

A Real-time Anomaly Detection Algorithm for Water Quality Data Using Dual Time-moving Windows	2017 SEVENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INNOVATIVE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY (INTECH 2017)					7th International Conference on Innovative Computing Technology (INTECH)	AUG 16-18, 2017	Luton, ENGLAND					Anomaly data in real-time water quality monitoring systems can cause false alarms and significantly decrease system stability and reliability. We propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm for water quality data using dual time-moving windows, which can identify anomaly data from historical patterns in real-time. The algorithm is based on an autoregressive linear combination model, a prediction interval with dual time-moving windows and a backtracking verification strategy. We have tested the algorithm using 3-month water quality data of PH from a real water quality monitoring station in a river system. Experimental results show that our novel anomaly detection algorithm can significantly decrease the rate of false positive and has better anomaly detection performance than AD and ADAM algorithms.																			978-1-5090-3989-0				2017							36	41										WOS:000425919500009

Return of Harbor Porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) to San Francisco Bay	AQUATIC MAMMALS												Harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) were rarely seen in San Francisco Bay prior to 2008 despite numerous marine mammal search efforts beginning in the 1970s. The species inhabited the bay historically before they were functionally extirpated by the early 1940s. Their disappearance correlated with increased anthropogenic disturbances such as dredging, shoreline construction, World War II military defenses, and environmental impacts from industrialization. After observing porpoises throughout the central San Francisco Bay from 2008 to 2010, we documented the porpoises' occurrence by means of a visual count from the Golden Gate Bridge. From 2011 to 2014, we spent 288 h counting porpoises from that unique platform, resulting in 2,698 porpoise group sightings recorded in all months of the year. Group size averaged 2.15, and the maximum group size was 16 animals. Calves comprised 10% of all porpoises sighted and were also seen throughout the year. Porpoises were observed on 96% of 169 survey days, and an average of 34.37 +/- 29.19 were seen per day. Porpoises can now be seen in the central bay daily throughout the year. Stranding records for the bay reflected the general pattern of the porpoises' decades-long absence and their reappearance. Potential reasons for the porpoises' return include decreased water and noise pollution, improved water quality, and increased marine productivity that created conditions in the bay that were favorable for porpoises.																	0167-5427						2017	43	6					691	702		10.1578/AM.43.6.2017.691								WOS:000426041000013

We carried out a detailed study on observed and modelled future changes of total organic carbon (TOC) in this large lake catchment (26 459 km(2)), and assessed the implications for current water treatment processes. Concentrations of TOC/CODMn in the lake and its sub-catchments increased during the period 2000-2014 (CODMn was used as a TOC proxy in the statistical analysis because of long-term data availability). Stepwise multiple regression analysis on the relationships between CODMn, water quality parameters, air temperature and runoff in selected 18 catchments indicated that the explaining variables are site-specific and that the observed recent changes are mainly due to a combination of the simultaneously interacting factors of climate and atmospheric deposition. Linear regression analysis revealed no relationships between CODMn increases and land-use related factors or specific catchment characteristics. A catchment-scale dynamic model system (VEMALA) was used to predict future concentrations and fluxes of TOC, using three different climate change scenarios. TOC concentrations were predicted to decrease by 19% in the Dry scenario and increase by 13% in the Wet scenario by the end of the century. The current treatment processes in the city of Helsinki can likely meet the challenges set by climate change in form of changed raw water TOC and quality. Integrated carbon (C) balance calculations indicated large changes in future C fluxes and lake retention time. These changes would markedly affect several key ecosystem processes such as transport of organically bound nutrients to sea areas and the importance of surface waters in the overall landscape C budgets.																	1239-6095	1797-2469					2017	22						317	336										WOS:000425997300001

However, so far not much has been known about the climatic characteristics of thunderstorm distribution and intensity in the country, and how these have changed with changing climate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyse the spatial and temporal distribution of thunderstorms in Latvia during the period 1960-2015 by using surface observation data from 14 major weather stations. To assess the severity of thunderstorms and suitability of the existing warning system, the frequency and distribution of thunderstorm intensities according to the national warning and hazard criteria was analysed. The results of our analysis show significant decrease in thunderstorm frequency in Latvia since 1960, however indicators of an increase in thunderstorm severity were also found, which reveals and emphasizes the complex nature of convective atmospheric phenomena also on climatic scales.																	1239-6095	1797-2469					2017	22						415	430										WOS:000425997300007

Pollutants, released into the ponds, mineralize during complex natural biochemical processes in the aquatic environment. The paper presents the long-term observation data (2004 - 2016 m.) on the purification of surface wastewater, formed in the company's production territory, in retention ponds. The aim of this work is to identify surface wastewater purification efficiency in retention ponds. Wastewater samples were taken before and after biological treatment. The samples were investigated in the Chemical Analysis Laboratory of the Water Research institute of Lithuania University of Agriculture. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD7) was determined with titrometric method, suspended solids (SS) - with gravimetric method, having filtered the substance through a mid-thickness filter. Concentrations of oil pollutants were determined with the help of a spectrophotometric device of infrared rays IKAN-1 in the Analytical Department of Agrochemical Study Center of Lithuanian Agricultural Institute. Although the suspended solids, BOD 7, and oil hydrocarbon concentrations, released into the natural environment, were below the MAC when they are collected from the company's production areas, they are often contaminated; therefore, it is necessary to treat them. The purification efficiency of researched materials was satisfactory and reached 61, 64 and 91%.																	1691-4031						2017							133	138		10.22616/rrd.23.2017.020								WOS:000425532600020

Poor water quality might be caused by many natural and anthropogenic factors. The most common anthropogenic factors are water pollution caused by intensive agriculture (e.g. intensive fertilizer use, high density of livestock) and discharges from municipal waste water treatment plants (WWTP). In this study, nutrient load from WWTP to the river Berze basin in time period from the year 2005 to the year 2015 was described. In total, 23 WWTPs of the study area were analysed using descriptive statistics to calculate average values of nutrient amount and concentrations discharged to river Berze basin. From 2005 to 2015 average N and P load from WWTP to the river Berze basin have been reduced, but concentration of N and P in treated wastewater (WW) have increased. The largest WWTP of the study area - Krigeri (WWTP of city Dobele) is subject to the regulations of treated WW quality set by Republic of Latvia Cabinet Regulation No. 34. The WWTP Krigeri meets the regulations, but overall situation in the study area suggests that strict control of smaller WWTP should be made.																	1691-4031						2017							153	159		10.22616/rrd.23.2017.022								WOS:000425532600023

The examined water treatment system consists of a sedimentation pond as a pretreatment plant, a water pump, a water distribution well, and a horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland with the surface area of 160 m(2). During the observation period of 27 months (2014 -2016) water quality parameters such as total suspended solids (TSS), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total nitrogen (TN), orthophosphate phosphorus (PO4-P), and total phosphorus (TP) were monitored and nutrient removal efficiency of the system was examined. Water samples collected at the inlet and outlet were compared. Monitoring results obtained during this study show that on average concentrations of TN and TP were reduced by 22% and 80%, respectively. However, nitrate - nitrogen concentrations on average increased by 10%, as during the time period from June, 2015 to March, 2016 reduction in NO3-N concentrations was not observed.																	1691-4031						2017							160	165		10.22616/rrd.23.2017.024								WOS:000425532600024

Compact Spectrometers for Earth Observation	3RD INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM OF SPACE OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS AND APPLICATIONS	Springer Proceedings in Physics				3rd International Symposium of Space Optical Instruments and Applications	JUN 26-29, 2016	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA					Driven by technology developments triggering end user's attention, the market for nano-and microsatellites is developing rapidly. At present there is a strong focus on 2D imaging of the Earth's surface, with limited possibilities to obtain high resolution spectral information. More demanding applications, such as monitoring trace gases, aerosols or water quality still require advanced imaging instruments, which tend to be large, heavy and expensive. In recent years TNO has investigated and developed several innovative concepts to realize advanced spectrometers for space applications in a more compact and cost-effective manner. This offers multiple advantages: a compact instrument can be flown on a much smaller platform (nano-or microsatellite); a low-cost instrument opens up the possibility to fly multiple instruments in a satellite constellation, improving both global coverage and temporal sampling; a constellation of low-cost instruments can provide added value to the larger scientific and operational satellite missions. Application of new technologies allowed us to reduce the instrument size significantly, while keeping the performance at a sufficient level. Low-cost instruments may allow to break through the 'cost spiral': lower cost will allow to take more development risk and thus progress more quickly. This may lead to a much faster development cycle than customary for current Earth Observation instruments. This new development approach is demonstrated using the most advanced design of a hyperspectral imaging spectrometer (named 'Spectrolite') as an example. Several different novel design and manufacturing techniques were used to realize this compact and low-cost design. Laboratory tests as well as the first preliminary results of airborne measurements with the Spectrolite breadboard will be presented. The design of Spectrolite offers the flexibility to tune its performance (spectral range, spectral resolution) to a specific application. Thus, based on the same basic system design, Spectrolite offers a range of applications to different clients. To illustrate this, we present a mission concept to monitor NO2 concentrations over urban areas at high spatial resolution, based on a constellation of small satellites.																	0930-8989	1867-4941	978-3-319-49184-4; 978-3-319-49183-7				2017	192						481	492		10.1007/978-3-319-49184-4_47								WOS:000425350200047

"WATER-GRANITE" SYSTEM: TIME OF FORMATION OF FRESHWATER COMPOSITION	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the research is caused by the necessity to evaluate the changes in groundwater chemical composition due to water-rock interaction. Usually the source of water, the H2O molecules namely, and the source of dissolved components are considered separately. In the study the atmosphere precipitates is the source of H2O. As water is used for different purposes (potable water supply, industrial water supply), it must correspond to the specified water use standards. Water quality depends on it features and composition. Water chemical composition depends, on its turn, on the structure of rock at interaction, interaction time and contact with atmosphere. The main aim of the study is to determine granite alteration and age of potable water chemical composition formation due to granite meteoritic water interaction. Methods of research: thermodynamic simulation of water-rock interaction using HCh code developed by Yu.V. Shvarov. The equilibrium state algorithm is based on Gibbs free energy minimization and on chemical reactions system solution. The results. It is shown that in the "water-granite" system, open in respect to O-2 and CO2, the Na-HCO3 composition of potable water forms during 3000 years. The aqueous solution pH value, which resulted from water-rock interaction, increases up to 7,8 but aqueous solution Eh value decreases from 0,79 to 0,62 V. The aqueous calcium concentration is limited by secondary minerals formation and deposition: dolomite and apatite.																	2500-1019	2413-1830					2017	328	4					108	115										WOS:000425622800011

CONCENTRATIONS OF METALS IN WATER OF THE YENISEI RIVER BETWEEN KRASNOYARSK AND THE ANGARA RIVER OUTFALL IN 2010-2015	BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING												The relevance of the study is determined by the necessity to obtain the data on concentrations of chemical elements in water of the Yenisei River, which is continuously affected by human activities. The aim of the study is to determine concentrations of such chemical elements as Na, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, Ba, Al, Mn, U, Mo, Cr, Ni, As, Co, Sr, Fe, Pb, Cd, and Bi in water of the Yenisei River between the city of Krasnoyarsk and the out fall of the Angara River. The methods used in the study. Total contents of the elements were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, using an Agilent 7500a instrument. The results. The study showed the changes in average concentrations of 20 chemical elements in water of the Yenisei River between the city of Krasnoyarsk and the out fall of the Angara River (the village Strelka), for 2070-2015. Comparison of the data obtained with the levels of maximum permissible concentrations showed that the examined part of the Yenisei River contained the increased concentrations of Fe, Cu, Mn, Al, and Zn. For the study period, the magnitudes of average concentrations of Fe reached 1 ... 2 maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) and Cu concentrations reached 1 ... 5 MPC. The average concentrations of Mn amounted to 7 ... 3 MPC in the parts of the river over 90 km downstream of Krasnoyarsk (at the villages Atamanovo and Strelka). Cu, Fe, and Zn concentrations tend to increase somewhat in the parts of the river over 90 km downstream of Krasnoyarsk, which may be caused by the influence of the industrial complex of the town Zheleznogorsk and the outfall of the Kan River, with the large industrial facilities located along its banks, in Zelenogorsk, in particular.

Utilized agricultural area in European countries is slightly diminishing, however the consumption of mineral fertilisers is steadily increasing. The consumption in Europe in the years 2015-2030 is projected to increase by 10%, and in the world by 20%. Both climate changes leading to the increase of temperature even of ca. 6 degrees C (in comparison to the pre-industrial period) and accelerated soil erosion due to high intensity rainfall cause increased productivity of water ecosystems. Those aspects have to be taken into consideration in water management. Due to legal regulations introduced in the last twenty years, wastewater treatment has been made more effective and population connected to wastewater treatment systems has increased. The improvement has been seen mainly in eastern and southern parts of Europe. After the implementation of Water Framework Directive theories regarding modem water management have been developed, with the aim to increase the ecosystem's capacity and its resilience to climate changes and anthropopressure.

Not only solids but also other pollutants are trapped in reservoirs, mainly heavy metals and phosphate compounds. Trapping is more efficient in case of wet detention ponds than dry detention ponds. In order to ensure expected functions of detention ponds, regular maintenance and inspections are required. A conceptual model is considered as a tool, which can be used to estimate trap efficiency of a detention pond. It treats a reservoir as if it was a single continuous stirred tank reactor. The model can be characterized with a low number of parameters and a simple structure, which is useful in case of ungauged catchment.

Biomass was expressed in terms of chlorophyll a ranging from 0.17 to 0.21 mu g L-1. Phytoplankton was composed of 95 species belonging to 42 genera and the contribution of C. tortissimum to the total phytoplankton abundance (42,000-76,000 cells. mL(-1)) was 99.4%. High rainfall was found to be the primary causative agent for triggering the bloom of C. tortissimum. Moreover, increase in water temperature and salinity was also found to be an influencing co-factor which had contributed to the bloom. Conclusively, intense fertilization of the farms, coupled with ineffective management strategies is hypothesized to have a direct link on the increase of nutrients found in Chouldari Bay.																	0007-9723	2262-3094					2017	58	4					423	433		10.21411/CBM.A.C3348C08								WOS:000425305300006

WATER RESOURCES QUALITY CONSIDERING IN THE RATING AS A COMPONENT OF ECONOMIC STIMULATING ECOLOGIC POLICY OF INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES	SCIENTIFIC BULLETIN OF POLISSIA												Urgency of the research. Today the formation of adequate tariffs for water use is controversial in the scientific debate. Target setting. The state influence on the mechanism of rational nature resources use concentrates on the rating and tariffing as the main economic tools and we find the quality of water resources as the basic index of water resources condition in the aspect of this rating. Now we need to find out the best ways of the water resources qualitative index considering foreshortened the rating aspect. Actual scientific researches and issues analysis. A number of well-known Ukrainian scientists Melnyk L. G., Karintseva O. I., Shevchenko S. M., Shapochka M. K., Bun E., Yatsyk A. V., Gryshchenko Y. M., Volkova L. A., Melnyk, L., Shevchuk V. A. conducted investigations on salient and emerging trends in water resources rating and their quality determination. Uninvestigated parts of general matters defining. The research objective. Still this topic remains of the considerable importance as water resources rating faces a number of issues which have to be organized, investigated and resolved. This article describes how to establish main aspects of water conditions rating by identifying the trends of water resources use by the industrial enterprises. The statement of basic materials. The article investigates a qualitative component of water resources in general water economic system of Ukraine, it's considering in the rating process and also the system of economic stimulating ecologic policy in the industrial sphere. The paper also describes the issues and explores how to solve the identified major problems. Conclusions. Water resources quality considering is one of the key elements of rating as a component of economic stimulating ecologic policy of industrial enterprises. Water quality influences rating as the tariffs are formed by rental concept and also the concept of the charges partition between all the participants of the water consumption system. The price for industrial water consumption differences from basin to basin, so this is another proof of water quality considering (among other factors). The water quality considering must remain one of the main tools in tariffing and there must me new ways of water quality determination investigated.																	2410-9576	2225-5508					2017		4					144	148		10.25140/2410-9576-2017-2-4(12)-144-148								WOS:000425647700022

Potentiostats exhibit high sensitivities and can be used for a variety of applications. In this application, they use electrochemical techniques to detect heavy metals via stripping analysis. The potentiostat front-end, consisting of an LMP91000 sensing chip, was designed and manufactured on a printed circuit board (PCB) and compared to a laboratory-based potentiostat using cyclic voltammetry performed using an 80 mu l sample of 5 mM ferriferrocyanide dropped onto a commercial screen-printed electrode. The results obtained from the PCB potentiostat are comparable to those obtained using the development board and the laboratory-based potentiostat. The results highlight the functionality of a low-cost point-of-need potentiostat that can be used for environmental monitoring as well as the feasibility of transferring the design to a paper substrate.																	2153-0025		978-1-5386-2775-4				2017							83	87										WOS:000424741600014

However, deficiencies in the performances of some methods make it difficult for implementation in full-scale water supply systems. This study examines the efficiency of random forest (RF) which is made up of a number of decision trees in the prediction of fecal indicator organisms in raw water based on records of conductivity, pH, color, turbidity taken from a drinking water source in Bergen, Norway, as well as seasons. Results of the study indicate that the method is capable of estimating important variations in levels of the microorganisms in the raw water with acceptable accuracy. Color of water and the effect of autumn season were the most important in explaining the variations in the levels of the coliform bacteria, intestinal enterococci and E. coli in raw water in both the full and the reduced models. Considerable reduction in the model out-of-bag sample error was achieved in the reduced models, where only two most important variables were used as predictors. With further research aimed at improving the estimation error, the random forest method can be a reliable tool for real time prediction of potential levels of microorganisms in raw water.																			978-1-5386-2365-7				2017																		WOS:000425236400036						
J	Beretta, GP				Beretta, Giovanni Pietro			Groundwater recharge through wells in open loop geothermal system: problems and solutions - part 1	ACQUE SOTTERRANEE-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF GROUNDWATER												In the two parts of this article, the problems related to the management of water wells as part of a low-enthalpy geothermal power plant by means of heat pumps (open loop system) are described. In many cases, in absence of discharge in surface water and/or to ensure the conservation of the resource from a quantitative point of view, a doublet system constituted by a pumping and a recharge well is provided. The clogging phenomenon often occurs in this kind of plant, affecting wells with different functions and different thermal potential related to water withdrawal and reinjection into the ground. This phenomenon is due to the presence of air bubbles, suspended solids, bacterial growth and to the chemical-physical reactions that are described in the text. Besides acknowledging the activities for recharge wells management to avoid the fracturing of the drain and the cementation, is also suggested the procedure of in situ tests that are used to properly determine the optimal well discharge, which determines the efficiency and effectiveness of the geothermal system and its economic performance. It is finally shown a regional regulation on the water quality used in an open loop.																	1828-454X						2017	6	2					41	54		10.7343/as-2017-263								WOS:000424991100005

EVALUATION OF IRRIGATION WATER Quality INDEX (IWQI) FOR MAIN IRAQI RIVERS (TIGRIS, EUPHRATES, ShATT AL-ARAB AND DIYALA)	IRAQI JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												As a result of different quality standards for irrigation water and the varying ion composition, and the fact that classification of irrigation water consists of large and complex data, this study was conducted in order to find a way for combining the complex water quality data into a single value, a quality of irrigation water index (IWQI) which reflects the suitability of the water quality for irrigation. Irrigation water quality variables were divided into five groups according to Food and Agriculture Organization FAO guide. The order of the parameters were, Salinity expressed in electrical conductivity (EC), Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), Toxicity of specific ions (boron, chloride, sodium, Toxic trace elements and Miscellaneous effects on sensitive crops (nitrates and bicarbonates and pH). Linear equations of each variable and the formulation of mathematical equations had been done to convert the actual concentration values in the classification adopted to estimate the values of the indicators (sub-indices) and then converting the actual values and different units for each variable to the estimated values under the general scheme consists of grades between (0 - 100). For the purpose of calculating irrigation water quality index, a software was originated entitled IWQI program was applied to the data of the irrigation water samples for eighteen (18) locations of water sampling in the rivers: Tigris, Euphrates, Diyala and Shatt al-Arab. Results showed that the values of irrigation water quality index for the period March to December 2015 of the Tigris River were highest than the values of Euphrates River at all locations from the north to the south as it was estimated 94.38 and 88.6 in Muthana bridge site (Tigris) and sader Al-Yusufiya (Euphrates), respectively in Baghdad and reached 74.55 and 67.78 in Qurna (Tigris) and Qurna (Euphrates), respectively. Irrigation water quality index of Shatt al-Arab was at the site of Altnoma 39.78 and classified as almost unsuitable. In Diyala River, it has been observed that the impact of Rustumiya weste water station in reducing the quality of irrigation water quality index was relatively low and water in the two sites (before and after Rustumiya station) are classified as moderately suitable.																	0075-0530	2410-0862					2017	48	4					1010	1020										WOS:000424625600011

Distribution of Heavy Metals in Surface Sediments of the Bay of Bengal Coast	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY												The concentrations of major (Si, Al, Ca, Fe, and K) and minor (Cd, Mn, Ni, Pb, U, Zn, Co, Cr, As, Cu, Rb, Sr, and Zr,) elements in the surficial sediments were studied in an attempt to establish their concentration in the Bengal coast. It was revealed that the majority of the trace elements have been introduced into the Bengal marine from the riverine inflows that are also affected by the impact of industrial, ship breaking yard, gas production plant, and urban wastes. The concentration of heavy metals was measured using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray fluorescence instruments. The highest concentrations for several trace elements were thus recorded which generally decrease with distance from the coast. It was observed that the heavy metal concentrations in the sediments generally met the criteria of international marine sediment quality. However, both the contamination factor and pollution load index values suggested the elevation of some metals' concentrations in the region. Constant monitoring of the Bengal coast water quality needs to be recorded with a view to minimizing the risk of health of the population and the detrimental impacts on the aquatic ecosystem.					khan, mohammad rehan ajmal/0000-0002-2480-9379; Khan, Md.

USING OF REMOTE SENSING FOR MONITORING GEOMORPHOLOGICAL TEOMPRAL CHANGES FOR TIGRIS RIVER IN BAGHDAD CITY	IRAQI JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Tigris River was chosen as astudy area in Baghdad province to study the geomorphological temporal changes due to the effect of erosion and deposition by remote sensing. Normalized Difference Suspended Sediment Index (NDSSI) was calculated by data of Landsat 7 and 8 for + ETM and OLI, respectively, between 1989 and 2014. Ten sites were selected within five regions represent all geomorphologic forms in the study area starting from Altajee to Alga'ara site located between the longitude 44 degrees 19' 50.512 '' E, 33 degrees 23' 24.754 '' N and 44 degrees 32' 07.762 '' E, 33 degrees 09' 21.432 '' N, with distance of 59945 m. The results indicated that there is a difference in the activity of geomorphologic processes associated with the movement of the Tigris River in Baghdad province, particularly sculpture and sedimentation processes. It was easy to find the existence of activity of sedimentation, especially in some curves that have helped to reduce the movement factor of the carrier sediments speed, and the results showed a significant contrast in the sedimentary material area between the selected sites during the study period in the year 2014 than it was in 1989.

Since then, various short-term studies have shown water quality to degrade, and sedimentation to gradually fill the lake. The lake appears to have lost 42 % of its initial water capacity due to present mean sedimentation rates nearing 8000 m(3)/year. A sedimentary balance shows that this phenomenon can be attributed to watershed allochtonous particulate inflow for 87 %. Sediment fluxes and their lacustrine accumulation act in turn as in-lake nutrient sources accelerating the eutrophication process. As a conclusion for this study, some solutions are proposed to improve drinking water production sustainability.																	1958-573X						2017	11									10.4000/physio-geo.5544								WOS:000424626300021

This ecosystem is 70 Km long, and is a major regional source of urban and agricultural water supply, mainly for the municipality of Rio Grande, with ca. 250 thousand citizens. This study aims to diagnose their water quality by measuring benthic invertebrates (Shannon-Wiener diversity index, richness and abundance), use of a BMWP biotic index, physical and chemical evaluation, and applying a trophic state index. The BMWP index showed predominance of taxa indicating altered conditions and polluted waters (Sarcodina and Hydracarina). The abiotic variables indicated eutrophicated waters, chlorophyll values characteristic of eutrophic environments (>2.9 mu g.L-1), low N:P rates in sediment and water, with nitrogen limitation during most periods studied. The results of trophic state indexes indicated mesotrophic and eutrophic conditions, reaching hipereutrophic periods. The highest TSI were in Piratini river, in April 2009 and February 2011, coinciding with rice crop leaching. These results regarding nutrient concentration, nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry and biotic index support the need to evaluate the occupation of the surroundings of this water supply.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e2	10.1590/2318-0331.011716082								WOS:000424560900003

It generates extensive databases with time series of many variables and monitoring points that require the application of statistical methods for the information extraction. The application of statistical methods for frequency analysis of time series is linked to attending of the basic assumptions of randomness, homogeneity, independence, and stationarity. However, despite its importance, the verification of these assumptions in water quality literature is unusual. Therefore, the present study tests the Upper Iguacu basin water quality time series against the mentioned hypotheses. Rejection was observed in 15%, 26%, 51% e 31% for randomness, homogeneity, independence, and stationarity, respectively. The results evidenced the strong relation between monitoring strategy, data assessment and meeting of basic statistical assumptions for the analysis of water quality time series. Even with the existence of possible solutions for addressing those issues, the standard monitoring strategies, with irregular frequencies and lack of representativeness in relation to other periods, beyond commercial, act as an obstacle to their implementation.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e51	10.1590/2318-0331.0217160071								WOS:000424560900052

Among the main impacts observed are anoxia, hypoxia, toxic algal blooms, fish kills, loss of biodiversity and loss of bathing. This study aimed to evaluate the evolution of the trophic state of Lagoa da Conceicao, a subtropical lagoon located in an urbanized watershed on the island of Santa Catarina - Brazil. Spatio temporal patterns of stratification and eutrophication were investigated to understand the main biochemical changes over time. The water quality data were obtained from field campaigns supplemented with literature of the last 15 years. The vertical structure of the water column and the trophic state were evaluated by the stratification index and the TRIX index, respectively. Analyses of variance were performed in order to identify possible temporal variations in vertical stratification and trophic level. Eutrophication effects on biogeochemical cycles were verified through a multi-dimensional cluster analysis (MDS) and correlations between variables related to physical, chemical and biological processes were verified by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the water column is homogeneous in all regions except in the central region of the lagoon, and the highest ammonia concentrations and lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations with periods of anoxia are observed in bottom waters. The study looked at the high trophic level of the lagoon and its inability to process the biogeochemical changes imposed by urban development.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e10	10.1590/2318-0331.011716027								WOS:000424560900011

In Rio Grande do Sul, during El Nino, air temperatures and the precipitation index are higher, contrary to La Nina. Moreover, the Guaiba Lake receives water from the Guaiba's Hydrographical Region, which corresponds to 1/3 of Rio Grande do Sul State, and is thus an important water body to the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre. Methods that seek to understand the behavior of Guaiba lake surface water temperature (LSWT) may lead to relevant information to identify periods of more or less water warming, as well as the relations between LSWT, water quality deterioration and risks to human health. This paper aims to comprehend the behavior of Guaiba LSWT during periods of climatic anomalies (El Nino/La Nina). Therefore, 418 sea surface temperature (SST) images from the MODIS sensor were processed with SeaDas 7.2 software. The quarterly averages of LSWT were obtained and compared to the climatological anomalies in Equatorial Pacific Ocean. LSWT behavior is more complex in El Nino/La Nina periods. The results show that during climatic abnormality periods there are no direct relationship between the warming/cooling of Guaiba LSWT and the warming/cooling of Equatorial Pacific Ocean's SST. The precipitation indices were more significant to the behavior of LSWT during El Nino periods, but for all periods (of climatic normality and abnormality), air temperature is what most influences LSWT. This relation occurs with climatic factors of water retention time, water entry and precipitation, and air temperature. There is a major correspondence during La Nina periods with the cooling of Guaiba LSWT only for some years. On the other hand, during El Nino periods there are no correspondences of this phenomenon with the warming of Guaiba LSWT. There are only more intense oscillations in surface temperatures than during regular and La Nina periods, but with a tendency to LSWT warming.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e17	10.1590/2318-0331.011716094								WOS:000424560900018

In this context, the present study aims to establish a methodology for pre-selection of wastewater treatment alternatives within watersheds. The methodology involves the combined use of water quality model, optimization technique and a set of technical and economic criteria associated with different wastewater treatment systems. To evaluate the proposed methodology there were considered different effluent disposal scenarios in the Pardo river watershed. Pardo is a major tributary of the Itapemirim river, watercourse located in the southern portion of Espirito Santo State, Brazil. The results indicated that the optimization model, that aimed to minimize wastewater treatment efficiencies within the watershed, considering watercourses self-purification capacities, selected treatment systems ranging from the combination of UASB and polishing lagoons systems to slow infiltration, treatment alternatives that presented the lowest net cost estimates. The incorporation of equity perspective between treatment systems increased the total present net cost associated with wastewater treatment within the watershed.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e12	10.1590/2318-0331.011716079								WOS:000424560900013

Rainwater drainage management plays a key role in urban areas, becoming increasingly complex, involving not only hydrological and hydraulic aspects, but also environmental, social and health issues, as well as other technical and high costs issues. This complexity leads, increasingly, to the use of multicriteria analysis as a support for decision-making. To deal with this, this work aimed to apply a multicriteria analysis methodology, using PROMETHEE method, to issues of urban rainwater drainage. The results indicated that the application of multiparticipative decision making and multicriteria analysis to possible scenarios of hydraulic interventions is well suited to reality.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e18	10.1590/2318-0331.011716006								WOS:000424560900019

However, in addition to the negative effects that dams have on the water quality of rivers, other practices such as discharge of untreated wastewater, intensive crop fertilization and fish farming have been contributing to water quality deterioration. Climate change may be another driver of water quality decrease. Increases in precipitation and drought intensities as well as temperature increase may redefine the dynamics of planktonic communities and favour species more adapted to the new environment. Water samples were collected in two reservoirs selected based on the recurrence of positive results for saxitoxins, Acarape do Meio (AM) and Sitios Novos (SN). In general, diversity in SN (1.08) was higher than in the AM (0.60). Phytoplankton dynamics in these reservoirs differ from other reservoirs in the same region of Brazil, in the sense that filamentous cyanobacteria are dominant. Furthermore, lower diversity, concentration and richness of chlorophyceae and bacillariophyceae were found in both reservoirs. Increase in diversity was observed during the intense rainy season of 2011, suggesting a slight improvement of water quality. A close inverse correlation between Cylindrospermopsis sp and other cyanobacteria was found in SN (R-2=-0.862) and in AM (R-2=-0.997) and the data collected demonstrates that a season with intensive rainfall may lead to lower cyanobacteria concentrations probably due to water dilution and higher flushing rates.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e6	10.1590/2318-0331.011716072								WOS:000424560900007

In this research, emphasis was placed on understanding the dynamics of organic matter (OM) in a drainage basin heavily influenced by anthropogenic activities, through the analysis and interpretation of qualitative and quantitative information. The case study was the Iguacu River basin, from its headwaters in the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba (MRC) to the municipality of Uniao da Vitoria. The results obtained showed a large deposition of labile OM in the MRC coming probably from domestic effluents, with consequent DO depletion and water quality degradation. However, after the more urbanized region, there is a reduction in the concentration of OM and the indication of the predominance of pedogenic material, suggesting that in addition to the dilution effect, there is less input of anthropogenic effluents in this region, which results in an improvement in water quality, represented mainly by the recovery of the DO concentration. The combined use of quantitative data and UV-visible spectroscopy was fundamental to comprehend the variation in the characteristics of OM and its sources along the studied section.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e55	10.1590/2318-0331.021720160065								WOS:000424560900056						
J	Martins, PD; Poleto, C				Martins, Patricia Diniz; Poleto, Cristiano			Principle of maximum entropy in the estimation of suspended sediment concentration	RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS												The concern with water quality has been promoting development of better monitoring and control techniques every day. As sediments transport most of water contaminants, their study is fundamental. Given the large number of variables for estimating sediment concentration and high costs of monitoring campaigns, it becomes necessary to develop more accessible methods which bring satisfactory practical results. Therefore, this work deals with application of the principle of maximum entropy, a probabilistic method to determine concentration of sediments in river channels with various concentrations and particle sizes. For this purpose, it was proposed a relationship between the theory of entropy parameters in order to reduce the computational effort. The results were satisfactory at concentrations above 10 g/L with R-2 greater than 0.88. The calculated squared errors in this study were lower than those found when using the theory of entropy by Tsallis and the equation of Rouse, classic models for determining the sediment concentration profile. The applicability of the proposed model and the ease of using the probabilistic method, since it reduces the amount of data needed to perform the estimate, makes it feasible on a global scale.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e23	10.1590/2318-0331.011716058								WOS:000424560900024

This method is insufficient given the broad variety and compositions of discharges. Therefore, the objectives of the study are to propose alternative charging mechanisms for the qualitative use of water resources, aiming to insert, beside BOD, other parameters as calculation criteria; and to evaluate the charging potential for the Doce River hydrological basin. Two methods were proposed: the Limiting Population Equivalent (LPE) and the Compromised/Committed Volume (CV). Five water quality parameters were established: Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, Total Suspended Solids, Ammonia Nitrogen, and Phosphorus. The proposed mechanisms contemplated, from a broader perspective, the real problem concerning water quality in the Doce River basin. Simulations showed that phosphorus was a problem of concern for managing water resources in the specific basin. The method of Limiting Population Equivalent was considered of easiest application and understanding by its users.

However, usually this method does not take into consideration the potentially polluting human activities, either in punctual or diffuse sources, or because the relative importance of the attributes are not considered. The paper proposes a multi-criteria approach as a way of solving this gap, reducing subjectivity and considering land use/cover due human actions influence in the process. The study was developed in Araras river watershed (Parana Basin, Brazil) using rock, groundwater, relief, soils, and land use/land cover classification, employing multi-criteria analysis and data of contamination sources. The potential contamination classification showed the predominance (54% of the area) of very high and high potential, especially due to geological environment conditions (exploitation areas and groundwater recharge of the Itarare Aquifer - clastic sedimentary and free flow). The contaminant sources analyzed are located mainly in higher potential contamination areas.

The aim of this study was to calculate time trends of loads and concentrations of eleven physical, chemical and biological parameters, in nine quality monitoring stations of the Verde River Basin from 2008 to 2014. The time series analysis was performed with different tests. First, with the verification of autocorrelation of the time series using the Spearman correlation test. Then, Kruskal-Wallis test was used to check significant differences between the seasons and, afterwards the Mann-Kendall or the Seasonal Mann-Kendall time trend tests were applied accordingly. The analysis results indicated differences between the spatial distribution of loads and concentrations for most of the parameters evaluated in this study. The results showed that the simultaneous analysis of concentration data and flow data is essential for a more comprehensive and reliable evaluation of water quality, since the changes in river flow over time can mislead the interpretation of the concentration data. Moreover, to analyze only the pollutant load data, without looking how the flow and concentration behaves, does not provide conclusive results, since it does not allow to evaluate whether changes in the load values were caused by alterations of the flow or concentration. Thus, the results indicate the need to monitor water quality along with flow measurement, providing more complete and reliable assessments of the evolution of water quality.																	1414-381X	2318-0331					2017	22								UNSP e40	10.1590/2318-0331.0117160030								WOS:000424560900041

EFFECT OF MAGNETIC AND QUALITY OF IRRIGATION WATER IN MEAN WEIGHT DIAMETER AND AGGREGATION INDEX FOR CLAY LOAM SOIL DURING GROWTH STAGES OF BARLEY CROP	IRAQI JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Field experiments were conducted at the Research Station College of Agriculture, University of Basra at Garmat Ali district. The experiments were carried out during the winter season 2012-2013 in clay loam soil. The purpose of the research was to study the effect of water magnetizing and the quality of irrigation water in mean weight diameter and aggregation index during the plant growth stages (the beginning of the forest and the beginning of flowering and after harvesting) for barley crop (Hordium vulgare L.). The magnetizing of irrigation water treatments Included, non-magnetized water (M0) and water magnetized (M1). The irrigation water quality treatment included five types of water namely, tap water (TW), River water (RW), wastewater (WW), treated sewage water passed through sand filter (WWT) and mixed water (MW) (50% RW + 50% WWT). The experiments were conducted using factorial experiments according to randomized complete block design (RCBD). The irrigation water was added on the basis of the shortfall in the level of water of the evaporation pan installed in the field. The amount of water added was 100% of the amount vaporized water plus 20% as leaching requirements. The results showed that : Magnetization of irrigation water resulted in a significant increase in the mean weight diameter and aggregation index for both layers 0-30cm and 30-60 cm compared with non-magnetized water. The order of the effect of treatments on the mean weight diameter and aggregation index is WW > TW > WWT > MW > RW for both layers. The results showed that the values of both parameters increased as growth season progress and layer 0-30 cm surpassed layer of 30-60 cm.																	0075-0530	2410-0862					2017	48	6					1473	1484										WOS:000424626000011

Long-Term and Seasonal Trends of Wastewater Chemicals in Lake Mead: An Introduction to Time Series Decomposition	JOURNAL OF STATISTICS EDUCATION												A recent paper published time series of concentrations of chemicals in drinking water collected from the bottom of Lake Mead, a major American water supply reservoir. Data were compared to water level using only linear regression. This creates an opportunity for students to analyze these data further. This article presents a structured introduction to time series decomposition that compares long-term and seasonal components of a time series of a single chemical (meprobamate) with those of two supporting datasets (reservoir volume and specific conductance). For the chemical data, this must be preceded by estimation of missing datum points. Results show that linear regression analyses of time series data obscure meaningful detail and that specific conductance is the important predictor of seasonal chemical variations. To learn this, students must execute a linear regression, estimate missing data using local regression, decompose time series, and compare time series using cross-correlation. Complete R code for these exercises appears in the supplementary information. This article uses real data and requires that students make and justify key decisions about the analysis. It can be a guided or an individual project. It is scalable to instructor needs and student interests in ways that are identified clearly in this article.																	1069-1898						2017	25	1					38	49		10.1080/10691898.2017.1286960								WOS:000424625200006

The Zoning of Groundwater Quality and Quantity for Agricultural Purpose using Wilcox Model and Geographic Information System (GIS): A Case Study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS & STATISTICS												Changes in groundwater quality and quantity usually occur as a results of mismanagement, is introduction of the other resources destruction either directly or indirectly. Given the importance of agriculture in Mehran plain, the aim of this study is to investigate the changes in quantity and chemical quality of groundwater from 1996 to 2013. In order to study the quality of underground water three variables including EC, SAR and CL and to evaluate the quantitative changes water height were used. Then, zonation maps were prepared using ArcGIS9.3 software. The Wilcox diagram was used to assess the water quality of agricultural area. According to the results of Wilcox classification the water quality was suitable for agricultural irrigation in much of the area. The results of ground water quality showed the parameters of chlorine and sodium adsorption ratio of the area have a good quality but the electrical conductivity is poor. It has reached even more than 2650 mu m/cm in parts of the region. Water table decrease has occurred most sharply in 2013 reducing the water level. The electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio, chlorine and water level decrease have increased from the southern and eastern part on the study area to the West and North West. These can be related to the recently droughts and an over utilization from wells in the study area.																	0973-1385						2017	38	4					23	32										WOS:000424211400003

INFLUENCE OF FILTER MATERIALS ON WATER QUALITY	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURE												Statement of the problem. Tatural water is now being processed using different types of filtering materials-ion and inert materials type of active coal, anthracite, sand, and zeolites, etc. The cleaning process fixed the flow side of the filters. It is particularly the case for ion exchangers. One should be aware of the nature of impurities and thus prevent the secondary pollution of water through special preparation of sorbents. Results. It is established that the product ion exchangers emit water as mineral and organic compounds. Fixed emission in water previously absorbed substances after regeneration of filters. It is shown that it is even a flow of distilled water that leads to degradation of ion exchangers. In addition all sorbents pollutes water with microorganisms. Conclusions. The proposed cleaning method of ion exchangers from monomers or other substances entered in the synthesis of ion controlling regenerates was tested. It was found that anionites in the main form are chemically less resistant than in the salt ones. The restrictions on the reproduction of microorganisms in industrial ion exchange filters are proposed.																	2542-0526						2017		4					77	91										WOS:000424402200006

Modeling chlorophyll-a and turbidity concentrations in river Ganga (India) using Landsat-8 OLI imagery	EARTH RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING/GIS APPLICATIONS VIII	Proceedings of SPIE				17th SPIE Conference on Earth Resources and Environmental Remote Sensing/GIS Applications	SEP 12-14, 2017	Warsaw, POLAND	SPIE				Rivers, one of the most complex ecosystems are highly dynamic and vary spatially as well as temporally. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is considered one of the primary indicators of water quality and a measure of river productivity, while turbidity in rivers is a measure of suspended organic matter. Monitoring of river water quality is quite challenging, demand tremendous efforts and resources. Numerous algorithms have been developed in the recent years for estimating environmental parameters such as chlorophyll-a and turbidity from remote sensing imagery. However, most of these algorithms were focused on the lentic ecosystems. There is a paucity of algorithms for rivers from which water quality variables can be estimated using remotely sensed imagery. The primary objective of our study is to develop algorithms based on Landsat 8 OLI imagery and in-situ observations for estimating of Chl-a and turbidity in the Upper Ganga river, India. Band reflectance images from multispectral Landsat-8 OLI pertaining to May and October 2016, and May 2017 were used for model development and validation along with near synchronous ground truth data. Algorithms based on Band 3 (R-2=0.73) proved to be the best applicable algorithm for estimating chlorophyll-a. The best algorithm for estimating turbidity was found to be log (B4/B5) (R-2=0.69) based on band combinations (individual band reflectance, band ratio, logarithmically transformed band reflectance and ratios) tested. The developed algorithms were used to generate maps showing the spatiotemporal variability of chlorophyll-a and turbidity concentration in the Upper Ganga river (Brijghat to Narora) which is also a Ramsar site.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1321-8; 978-1-5106-1320-1				2017	10428								UNSP 1042814	10.1117/12.2278289								WOS:000423869700033

Quantifying the percentage of imperviousness within the Xiangjiang River basin is important to pollution control and watershed management. Per-pixel and sub-pixel methods have been widely used for analyzing impervious surface changes, but these methods are considered as complicated, computationally intensive, and sometimes subjective, especially when applied to a large geographic area. In this paper, normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced built-up and bareness index (EBBI) were respectively used to estimate impervious surfaces in Chang-ZhuTan region (CZT) of the Xiangjiang River basin, and a comparative analyses was conducted. Then the optimum spectral index was chosen to map the percentage of impervious surfaces for the study area. The results show that the spectral index of NDBI has the optimum estimation of large-scale impervious surfaces, and the percentage of imperviousness in CZT was 13.87%. The water quality in CZT was characterized as "protected", indicating that water quality protection in the plain areas of CZT is imperative.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1321-8; 978-1-5106-1320-1				2017	10428								UNSP 104281I	10.1117/12.2277984								WOS:000423869700045

The object of the research is a section near the Sosnovskie intake stations of the Shershnevsky reservoir. Based on the hydrometric surveys of the studied section and using the Kriging method and the Surfer suite, we calculated the volume of ground deposits. As a result of the analyses, the authors have proved that ground deposits in the studied section have a technology-related nature which is connected with the annual growth of the volume of ground deposits which is inadmissible in the operating conditions of the pump stations of water intake facilities whereas ground deposits will fully block the intake windows of pump stations. In case the bed area of the Shershnevsky reservoir is not timely treated, the ground deposits here will complicate the operation of the pump stations which will result in a technological problem of the treatment facilities operation up to a transfer of the pump station premises to other territories less exposed to the deposits. The treatment of the Shershnevsky reservoir from the ground deposits accumulated in the course of time will help to considerably increase its actual capacity, which will allow one to increase water circulation paths and to improve the water quality indices. In its turn, the water quality improvement will decrease the supply of suspended solids into the water intake facilities and cut the reagent costs in the course of the treatment water works operation.																	1757-8981						2017	262								012203	10.1088/1757-899X/262/1/012203								WOS:000423728200203

The paper studies the sludge of water-supply network treatment facilities formed in the conditions of low turbidity and average water colour index in the water source. Such sludge has a low water yielding capacity and is subject to conditioning. The paper shows the influence of seasonal variations of turbidity, water colour index and temperature of the feed water on the specific sludge filtration resistance. It considers the specific features of sludge formation in different settling basins influencing its water yielding capacity. It is shown that the washwater return performed at one of the blocks of the facilities increases the feed water turbidity and leads to the formation of the sludge easily susceptible to conditioning. The paper studies the following methods of the reagent sludge treatment: polyacrylamide-based flocculant treatment, joint treatment with flocculant and vermiculite filler, lime treatment. The use of vermiculite allows to reduce the required flocculant dose. The author determines optimum doses of reagents allowing to direct the sludge for further mechanical dewatering after conditioning. It is shown that, when the sludge is processed with lime, the filtrate formed at dewatering can be reused as an alkalifying agent, which will allow one to cut the costs for the acquisition of reagents.																	1757-8981						2017	262								012221	10.1088/1757-899X/262/1/012221								WOS:000423728200221

It was determined that the quality of drinking water was stable and consistent with the existing standards in Zheleznodorozhniy, Samarskiy, Leninskiy, Octyabrskiy, Kirovsliy, Sovetskiy and Promyshlenniy districts of Samara. The following indicators were taken into account: pH, colour, turbidity, alkalinity, general rigidity, content of ions Ca2+, Mg2+. It was also established that drinking water in Kuibyshevskiy district with all other excellent indicators) had increased mineralization due to the natural hydrological conditions of the water inlet. Some change in the size of zeta-potential of the water was detected during its transportation through the existing water-supplying networks of the city. It was shown that the link between zeta-potential and various kinds of contamination in drinking water is underexplored and requires further detailed study.																	1757-8981						2017	262								012094	10.1088/1757-899X/262/1/012094								WOS:000423728200094

Development of Water Softening Method of Intake in Magnitogorsk	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTRUCTION, ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOSPHERE SAFETY (ICCATS 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				International Conference on Construction, Architecture and Technosphere Safety (ICCATS)	SEP 21-22, 2017	Chelyabinsk, RUSSIA	S Ural State Univ, Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Far Eastern Fed Univ				This article contains an appraisal of the drinking water quality of Magnitogorsk intake. A water analysis was made which led to the conclusion that the standard for general water hardness was exceeded. As a result, it became necessary to develop a number of measures to reduce water hardness. To solve this problem all the necessary studies of the factors affecting the value of increased water hardness were carried out and the water softening method by using an ion exchange filter was proposed. The calculation of the cation-exchanger filling volume of the proposed filter is given in the article, its overall dimensions are chosen. The obtained calculations were confirmed by the results of laboratory studies by using the test installation. The research and laboratory tests results make the authors conclude that the proposed method should be used to obtain softened water for the requirements of SanPin.																	1757-8981						2017	262								012089	10.1088/1757-899X/262/1/012089								WOS:000423728200089

Urban Land: Study of Surface Run-off Composition and Its Dynamics	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTRUCTION, ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOSPHERE SAFETY (ICCATS 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				International Conference on Construction, Architecture and Technosphere Safety (ICCATS)	SEP 21-22, 2017	Chelyabinsk, RUSSIA	S Ural State Univ, Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Far Eastern Fed Univ				The qualitative composition of urban land surface run-off is liable to significant variations. To study surface run-off dynamics, to examine its behaviour and to discover reasons of these variations, it is relevant to use the mathematical apparatus technique of time series analysis. A seasonal decomposition procedure was applied to a temporary series of monthly dynamics with the annual frequency of seasonal variations in connection with a multiplicative model. The results of the quantitative chemical analysis of surface wastewater of the 22nd Partsjezd outlet in Samara for the period of 2004-2016 were used as basic data. As a result of the analysis, a seasonal pattern of variations in the composition of surface run-off in Samara was identified. Seasonal indices upon 15 waste-water quality indicators were defined. BOD (full), suspended materials, mineralization, chlorides, sulphates, ammonium-ion, nitrite-anion, nitrate-anion, phosphates (phosphorus), iron general, copper, zinc, aluminium, petroleum products, synthetic surfactants (anion-active). Based on the seasonal decomposition of the time series data, the contribution of trends, seasonal and accidental components of the variability of the surface run-off indicators was estimated.																	1757-8981						2017	262								012181	10.1088/1757-899X/262/1/012181								WOS:000423728200181

Analysis, Evaluation and Measures to Reduce Environmental Risk within Watershed Areas of the Eastern Zauralye District Lakes	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONSTRUCTION, ARCHITECTURE AND TECHNOSPHERE SAFETY (ICCATS 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				International Conference on Construction, Architecture and Technosphere Safety (ICCATS)	SEP 21-22, 2017	Chelyabinsk, RUSSIA	S Ural State Univ, Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Far Eastern Fed Univ				The authors have performed an analysis for the use of watershed areas of the lakes of the Eastern Zauralye district (the territory to the east of Ural) for national economic purposes. The analysis gave a possibility to assess the impact of watersheds depending on the applied technologies on the dump of various runoff into the reservoir waters. The watershed areas of all lakes have been found to be actively used as pastures, farmland and recreational resources. Some of the main sources of solid and liquid industrial waste are cattle farms and agricultural land using outdated equipment and technologies. The study of 26 km of the watershed line areas showed that pollutants (household garbage, fuels and lubricants) and organic substances (phosphorus and nitrogen) got into the waters of the reservoirs. The maximum runoff of solid and liquid waste into the waters of the lakes happens in summer which leads to increased concentrations of organic substances, an increase in productivity of alga and higher aquatic flora determining the degree of eutrophication and trophy in the reservoirs. The average annual trophic status of TSI lakes of the Eastern Zauralye district is 56 which corresponds to the typical phase of eutrophy. The reduced transparency of lakes is also the evidence of an increase in biological productivity of reservoirs, their eutrophication and, as a result, the water quality deterioration. The intensive eutrophication of reservoirs, in its turn, most significantly affects the concentration of the ammonium form of nitrogen, total phosphorus and total nitrogen, increase in pH and deterioration of oxygen condition. The authors have developed various activities to reduce a technogenic risk in the watershed areas of the lakes in the Eastern Zauralye district which can be applied to other areas using the analogy method.																	1757-8981						2017	262								012172	10.1088/1757-899X/262/1/012172								WOS:000423728200172

It explores the preferences of residents in the Eurometropole de Strasbourg (France), with the aim of redefining priorities for sewer network asset management. Valuation is performed using the contingent ranking method and results are compared to a recoded choice experiment. Comparison of results from both methods reveals that price influences the ranking of the different alternatives given to the respondents, but does not influence respondents' preferred alternative. In other words, the price of the alternatives is only considered by respondents later in the decision process. For residents, the trade-offs between the potential disruption caused by a network malfunction favour the reduction of the risk of flooding (either in terms of their frequency or attained water levels). These findings highlight the challenges of asset management.																	1466-2132	1741-511X					2017	20	3-4					163	182		10.1504/IJETM.2017.10010689								WOS:000424335700003

Monitoring was located in areas with different degrees of anthropogenic impacts. Selected environmental variables were recorded during the monitoring periods.. The Odonata fauna and biological indices were used to characterize development of the study area, after two decades and to assess the quality of the environment. The alteration of this river has resulted in a marked simplification of the original (1993-1994) odonatological fauna. Over the past two decades, odonatological species richness has decreased from 14 to 7 species inventoried during the 1993 and 2015 seasons. The phenology of adult was extended until early December 2015, possibly as a result of global warming. Odonata are identified as useful as indicators of environmental change in the monitored river systems. The majority of species such as the Gomphidae are not tolerant of increased contamination and changes in structure of the river. Only some species such as Lestes vridis, Platycnemis subdilatata, Ischnura graellsii and Ceriagrion tenellum, appear to be adapted to changed conditions and became dominant in heavily disturbed sites. The species disappeared from these sites are clearly associated with good water quality and less disturbance, which highlights the importance of the conservation of the habitats of freshwater and regular monitoring																	2351-812X						2017	5	4					610	621										WOS:000424223200008						
J	Affuso, E				Affuso, Ermanno			The environmental impact of El Nino southern oscillation forecasts	TROPICAL AGRICULTURE												Yearly weather variability has an impact on agricultural supply and farmer welfare. More accurate weather predictions may increase the net returns for farmers but the indirect environmental impact of forecasts has not been examined. A stochastic bioeconomic model, which includes weather information, examines the impact of agricultural activities on water quality in a large agricultural area affected by the El Nino Southern Oscillation phases. This region is part of the Black Warrior-Tombigbee and the Middle Tennessee-Elk Basins in the Southeast of the United States. The results of the study reveal that if farmers were to use accurate weather predictions, their net returns may increase by 1.64% and the nitrogen loss associated with the agricultural activities would increase by 1.67%. The potential private value of climate uncertainty mitigation exceeds its social cost. In the long run, the net benefit of weather forecast could be approximately $949,450 per year.																	0041-3216					JAN	2017	94	1					31	41										WOS:000424192400004

DESIGN JOURNAL					12th International Conference of the European-Academy-of-Design (EAD)	APR 12-14, 2017	Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Architecture, Rome, ITALY	European Acad Design	Sapienza Univ Rome, Fac Architecture			the idea of growing food in cities is not a new one; agriculture has been practiced in urban areas for millennia, often out of necessity or to obtain a food security against sudden food shortages but these are not reasons that we have to face in the modern cities. The growing interest in urban agriculture can be attributed to other factors: healthy food access, green space, air and water quality, economic development, and community engagement. People see it as a tangible and accessible opportunity to become involved in issues of food provenance, security and to reconnect with a system that many feel far from them. Even though today's larger scale urban agriculture might have attracted more people, that isn't to say that urban agriculture can't still save our environment or food supply. The next step is crucial to understanding if it is possible to amplify the benefits that urban agriculture currently provides to a small group to a larger constituency. The next challenge is to make people able to farm in their own spaces. I really believe urban agriculture is an area in which architects and designer can play a strong role by thinking innovative e practices and expanding its presence in our cities.																	1460-6925	1756-3062					2017	20			1			S1971	S1977		10.1080/14606925.2017.1352716								WOS:000419738000162

Ecosystem restoration: recent advances in theory and practice	RANGELAND JOURNAL					Conference on Restore, Regenerate, Revegetate - Restoring Ecological Processes, Ecosystems and Landscapes in a Changing World	FEB 05-09, 2017	Univ New England, Armidale, AUSTRALIA		Univ New England			Restoration of damaged ecosystems is receiving increasing attention worldwide as awareness increases that humanity must sustain ecosystem structure, functioning, and diversity for its own wellbeing. Restoration will become increasingly important because our planet will sustain an increasingly heavy human footprint as human populations continue to increase. Restoration efforts can improve desirable ecological functioning, even when restoration to a historic standard is not feasible with current practice. Debate as to whether restoration is feasible is coupled to long-standing disputes regarding the definition of restoration, whether more-damaged lands are worthy of restoration efforts given limited financial resources, and ongoing conflicts as to whether the novel ecosystem concept is a help or a hindrance to restoration efforts. A willingness to consider restoration options that have promise, yet would have previously been regarded as 'taboo' based on the precautionary principle, is increasing. Functional restoration is becoming more prominent in the scientific literature, as evidenced by an increased emphasis on functional traits, as opposed to a simple inventory of vascular plant species. Biodiversity continues to be important, but an increasingly expansive array of provenance options that are less stringent than the traditional 'local is best' is now being considered. Increased appreciation for soil health, plant-soil feedbacks, biological crusts, and water quality is evident. In the United States, restoration projects are becoming increasingly motivated by or tied to remediation of major environmental problems or recovery of fauna that are either charismatic, for example, the monarch butterfly, or deliver key ecosystem services, for example, hymenopteran pollinators.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2017	39	5-6			SI		417	430		10.1071/RJ17024								WOS:000423401600003

Five sites in the coastal zones of ALGERIA are examined based on dynamic modelling, which was performed by TRNSYS 17 software, in order to investigate the feasibility of this type, an economic analysis was done. The MED unit is incorporated to replace the condenser in the power block system (cogeneration by exploiting the heat ejected by the condensation of the steam in the power block). The Technico-economic results obtained show that the cogeneration in the concentrating solar tower power plant can produce the electricity and the fresh water for the different zones tested in good proportion. In the proposed study, the produced fresh water quality with MED unit is not affected with the solar radiation intermittence and fluctuation in partial load, in which, only the quantity of produced water varied according to the steam flow entered in the MED unit. The obtained results for the examined sites show that the Algerian coast is suitable for the technology of CSP-MED.																	1309-0127						2017	7	3					1145	1154										WOS:000423929200016

Assessment of river water quality and ecological diversity through multivariate statistical techniques, and earth observation dataset of rivers Ghaghara and Gandak, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												Water quality and ecological diversity of aquatic flora with respect to distribution in active channels and on banks of the rivers Ghaghara and Gandak have been investigated in years 2011-2012. The land use/land cover map of year 2010 showed agricultural land as the dominant class in both river basins. The appraisal of aquatic flora has indicated that the dominant plant species in numbers are as follows: macrophytic algae, aquatic angiosperms, aquatic pteridophytes, sedges, grasses, herbs, shrubs, climbers and trees collected from the banks and active channels of rivers Ghaghara and Gandak. In total, 207 plants species were reported as common in both river environments, and the remaining species have showed variability for both rivers. It was observed that the algal group showed higher species diversity in comparison to other plant groups. High numbers of macrophytic species were observed due to the alkaline pH and good level of dissolved oxygen at different sampling sites of the two rivers. Further, multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis and principal component/factor analysis were applied to fulfil the knowledge gap and to identify the potential sources and types of pollutants.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	3					347	360		10.1080/15715124.2017.1300159								WOS:000423964400010

The River Arab is monitored at the Babar dam. The later was build for drinking and industrial water supply for the local population. The impounded water is experiencing a degradation of its quality due to different types of pollution, in addition to the natural processes of erosion and leaching of various toxic elements. A total of 21 samples were collected. Eleven variables were determined on every sample representing three different sampling stations. TDS in the saline water was high in the eastern part (S1), low in the western part (S2), and intermediate in the dam (S3). The water type is SO42- - Na+ for S1, HCO3-Ca2+ - Mg2+ for S2 and SO42- - Ca2+ - Mg2+, mixed water in the dam. In the CA, 7 variables were classified into 2 clusters controlled by SO42- and 21 samples are grouped into 3 statistical groups coinciding with the stations S1, S2 and S3. Principal component analysis indicates two principal components (PCs), which explained 87% of the total variance in water quality data set. Two PCs, which are salinization and sulphates, explain 73% and 14% of the total variance, respectively. Time series analysis showed that Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, Cl- and SO42- have very similar trend to TDS and K+ have a similar pattern to NO3-. It suggests that five components control TDS. K+ and NO3- resulted from fertilizers and domestic sewage inputs from the tributaries of river.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	3					361	372		10.1080/15715124.2017.1299157								WOS:000423964400011

Heavy metal monitoring and health risk assessment of a tropical mountainous river in Kerala, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT												Seasonal monitoring of surface water was performed in Meenachil River with emphasis on heavy metal quality. Mean concentration of heavy metals such as Cu, Cr, Zn and Pb during post-monsoon are comparatively higher than that in the other seasons. As and Cd concentrations are below detectable limit in all seasons. The escalated heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and contamination degree (CD) index level at the river mouth indicate a contaminated environment. Direct application of agrochemicals in the typical catchment activities like intense plantation and widespread lowland agriculture contribute heavy metals to the riverine system. The contamination index (CI) was strongly lowered during monsoon. The study has demonstrated that the mean hazard quotient falls to a permissible level throughout pre-monsoon and monsoon while the level slightly exceeds the level during post-monsoon. HPI, CD and CI indices suggest that better agricultural management practices need to be implemented in the Meenachil River basin for maintaining ecological integrity and protecting the lotic system from further degradation.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	4					475	484		10.1080/15715124.2017.1315813								WOS:000423964600009

In this study, the state of water quality and their effects on some hematological parameters of African Catfish (Clarias gariepinus) was identified. Reserach, in the area under the crest of the Aslantas Dam (station I) located on the Ceyhan River and discharging region on the same river (station II). water temperature, chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, nitrate (NO3-N), nitrite (NO2-N), ammonia (NH3-N) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) values were determined in these two stations. The study was realised on 45 fish from each station during the summer seasons (June, July, August). The hematological parameters included erythrocyte (RBC) and RBC indices (MCV: mean corpuscular volume, MCH: mean corpuscular hemoglobin, MCHC: mean corpuscular hemoglobin consentration), leukocyte (WBC), haemoglobine (Hb), hematocrit (Hct) values and leukocyte cell formulas (lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil), serum glucose and protein levels were evaluated. The physico-chemical parameters observed that the water at station II had higher COD, NH3-N, NO2-N, pH and SRP than at station I. In this study, WBC values and leukocyte cell formulas of C. gariepinus were found increasing by means of environmental stressors and also, RBC, RBC indices, Hb and Hct values were determined decreasing in C. gariepinus collected from station II (p<0.05). On the other hand, serum glucose levels were increased and protein levels were decreased in station II.

The different parameters indicate that the data are homogeneous. As against this record an annual variation is more important than the monthly change in connection with climate change. The facies of these waters is Cl-Na especially in connection with human actions. Values of the Water Quality Index classified the surface water as medium to good quality. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between salinity and all variables and negative relationship between water volume of dam and all variables. The CA in R mode grouped the 16 variables into 4 clusters of similar water quality characteristics and in Q mode, 160 sampling are grouped into 2 statistically groups where total dissolve solids and capacity seem to be major distinguishing factors between variables and years. The CA has classified the data into two groups, one formed by the dry years and the other formed by wet years. The PCA and the FA applied to the datasets have resulted in two significant factors which represent 69.92% of total variance. The first factor as salinization factor explained 58.68% of the total variance. The second factor, can be called organic pollution factor, explained 11.24% of the total variance. The results of discriminant analysis showed only 11 parameters were necessary in the temporal variations analysis, affording more than 90% correct assignations.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	2					133	143		10.1080/15715124.2016.1215325								WOS:000423964100001

This information is typically collected by field trip measurements, but these are not always feasible. Furthermore, freshwater discharge data are needed but these are generally gauged further upstream outside the tidal region and unable to reflect the individual flows entering a multi-channel estuary. With data provided by a network of fixed measurement stations only, the main goal of this paper is to set up an analytic model to simulate salinity distribution along a multi-channel estuary at high water slack. The Ma Estuary in Vietnam is considered as case study. A new approach is introduced to calibrate the parameters of a parsimonious salt intrusion model, which are typically extracted from estuary geometry measurements. Compared to the values derived from a field survey, the calibrated parameter values are in very high agreement. Furthermore, by assuming a linear relation between inverses of the individual flows entering the estuary and inverses of the sum of flows gauged further upstream, the individual flows can be assessed. Evaluation on the model simulations shows that the model explains salinity distribution along the Ma Estuary reasonably well with 75% of the simulations being satisfactory or better and with NSE values at the gauging stations being 0.50 or higher. This performance demonstrates the predictive power of the model and of the proposed parameter/input estimation approach.

The system was built by the authors and tested at the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility in New Mexico. EDR has the potential to be more cost effective than currently installed village-scale reverse osmosis (RO) systems in off grid locations due to the lower specific energy consumption of EDR versus RO at high recovery ratios. Lower energetic demand leads to lower solar power system costs for off-grid areas. The system tested in this study is designed to validate that energetic, product water quality, and water recovery requirements can be met. An analytical model of the system that accounts for the composition of natural groundwater is presented and compared to initial experimental results.

Phase-I of the STRIDER project included the capability for STRIDER to collect water samples and water quality data on the surface of water bodies. This paper discusses the Phase-II efforts of the project, in which the previous design of STRIDER was adapted to extend its capabilities to include monitoring, depth profiling, and visualization of in-situ water quality data at various depths as well as collect water samples at each depth for bacterial analysis. At present, the vessel has been utilized for navigation to specified locations using remote control for collecting water quality data and water samples from the surface, as well as 2 feet and 4 feet below the surface at multiple UMES ponds. In a series of preliminary trial runs with the supervision of UMES faculty members and collaborators from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), STRIDER successfully collected 48 water samples for bacterial analysis at different locations and depths of ponds on the UMES campus. Design alternatives are being explored for more efficient water sampling capabilities.																	2159-7383		978-0-7918-5823-3				2017									UNSP V009T07A049									WOS:000423244700049

Effect of degrading yellow oxo-biodegradable low-density polyethylene films to water quality	7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KEY ENGINEERING MATERIALS (ICKEM 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				7th International Conference on Key Engineering Materials (ICKEM)	MAR 11-13, 2017	MALAYSIA					Polyethylene (PE) contributes largely to plastic wastes that are disposed in aquatic environment as a consequence of its widespread use. In this study, yellow oxo-biodegradable low-density PE films were immersed in deionized water at 50 degrees C for 49 days. Indicators of water quality: pH, oxidation-reduction potential, turbidity, and total dissolved solids (TDS), were monitored at regular intervals. It was observed that pH initially rises and then slowly decreases with time, oxidation-reduction potential decreases then slowly increases with time, turbidity rises above the control at varied rates, and TDS increases abruptly and rises at a hindered rate. Moreover, the films potentially leach out lead chromate. The results imply that degrading oxo-biodegradable LDPE films results to significant reduction of water quality.																	1757-8981						2017	201								UNSP 012004	10.1088/1757-899X/201/1/012004								WOS:000422900700004

The research presented in this paper is the first to address biofilms at selected occurrences of mineral water in Serbia (Bogatic, Metkovic and Belotic in the Macva District as well as Radaljska Banja, Lukovska Banja and Vranjska Banja) (in Serbian, banja denotes a spa town). The study period is from 2014 to 2016. The temperatures of the studied occurrences are in the 30-93.9 degrees C range and the chemical composition corresponds to the HCO3- -Na++ K+ and SO42-, HCO3--Na++ K+ types of mineral water. One of the objectives was to examine the condition of wellheads (incrustation, biofouling and corrosion), focusing on the presence of phototrophic microorganisms whose metabolites may lead to changes in mineral water quality, yield and chemistry. Analysis by light and scanning electron microscopy provides insight into the diversity of phototrophic microorganisms that populate biofilms near the points of emergence and on wellhead. The research reveals the presence of representatives of three groups of phototrophic microorganisms: Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta. Cyanobacteria were the most numerous, dominated by the order Oscillatoriales with ten recorded genera, of which Leptolynbgya and Phormidium feature the largest numbers of species. The order Chroococcales are the second most numerous, with seven recorded genera, of which Gloeocapsa and Synechocystisare the most noteworthy. The largest numbers of representative taxa were noted at Radaljska Banja and Vranjska Banja, where mineral waters originate from lithostratigraphic units of igneous origin, followed by mineral water occurrences in karst aquifers (Bogatic and Belotic) and an intergranular aquifer (Metkovic). The smallest number of identified phototrophic microorganisms is noted at Lukovska Banja, where the origin is associated with a fractured aquifer formed in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, with occasional diabase interbeds. Although many representative taxa are found on only one of the studied localities, such as Synechococcus bigranulatus and Pseudanabaena thermalis, those of the genera Leptolyngbya, Phormidium and Cosmarium laeve, as well as genera of the phylum Bacillariophyta, occur at several sampling sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to show the relationship between documented cyanobacterial and algal taxa and environmental parameters.																	0583-6050	1580-2612					2017	46	2-3					295	316										WOS:000423294700011						
J	Filstrup, CT; Downing, JA				Filstrup, Christopher T.; Downing, John A.			Relationship of chlorophyll to phosphorus and nitrogen in nutrient-rich lakes	INLAND WATERS												Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) commonly co-limit primary productivity in lakes, and chlorophyll a (Chl-alpha) is predicted to be greatest under high N, high P regimes. Because land use practices can alter N and P biogeochemical cycles in watersheds, it is unclear whether previously documented phytoplankton-nutrient relationships apply where landscapes are highly disturbed. Here, we analyzed a lake water quality database from an agricultural region to explore relationships among Chl-alpha, total N (TN), and total P (TP) under extreme nutrient concentrations. Chl-alpha was weakly related to TN when TP was <= 100 mu g L-1 but displayed a stronger response to TN at higher TP. When TP exceeded 100 mu g L-1, Chl-alpha increased with increasing TN until reaching a TN threshold of similar to 3 mg L-1 and decreased thereafter, resulting in a high nutrient, low Chl-alpha region that did not coincide with shifts in nutrient limitation, light availability, cellular Chl-alpha content, phytoplankton composition, or zooplankton grazing pressure. Beyond the threshold, nitrate comprised most of TN and occurred with reduced dissolved organic matter (DOM). These observations suggest that photolysis of nitrate may produce reactive oxygen species that damage DOM and phytoplankton. Reduction in N loading at high P could therefore increase Chl-alpha and decrease water clarity, resulting in an apparent worsening of water quality. Our data suggest that monitoring Chl-alpha or Secchi depth may fail to indicate water quality degradation by extreme nutrient concentrations. These findings highlight how extreme nutrient regimes in lakes can produce novel relationships between phytoplankton and nutrients.

J	Osgood, RA				Osgood, Richard A.			Inadequacy of best management practices for restoring eutrophic lakes in the United States: guidance for policy and practice	INLAND WATERS												The policy and practice of restoring eutrophic or phosphorus (P)-impaired lakes that relies heavily on watershed best management practices (BMPs) is mostly inadequate. This strategy has been prevalent in the United States for several decades, but there are few documented positive outcomes. To restore most eutrophic lakes requires external P reductions > 80% in the United States. A review of BMP performance literature with respect to P removal indicates the maximum expected P removal under ideal conditions on a watershed-wide basis approaches 50%, however in practice reductions in P load may be < 25%. The discrepancy between required P reductions and BMP performance explains the observed paucity of positive outcomes. BMPs may be sufficient in cases where watershed size is small (i.e., < 10-times lake surface area) and external and internal P loading rates are modest, or where incremental water quality improvement rather than restoration is the management goal. Guidance for restoring eutrophic lakes is provided here. In cases where BMPs are inadequate as the sole restoration strategy, alternative or supplemental approaches are available. In many cases, effective P inactivation methods to mitigate internal P loading and to intercept dissolved P in inflowing waters are required to restore lakes. Engineering approaches or chemical treatment systems can feasibly, reliably, and effectively provide sufficient external or internal P load reductions.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	4					401	407		10.1080/20442041.2017.1368881								WOS:000423406300002

Spatial variability of CO2 concentrations and biogeochemistry in the Lower Columbia River	INLAND WATERS												Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from rivers and other inland waters are thought to be a major component of regional and global carbon cycling. In large managed rivers such as the Columbia River, contemporary ecosystem changes such as damming, nutrient enrichment, and increased water residence times may lead to reduced CO2 concentrations (and emissions) due to increased primary production, as has been shown in another large North American river (Upper Mississippi). In this work, spatial patterns of water quality, including dissolved CO2 concentrations, were assessed in the Lower Columbia River (LCR) and major tributaries using underway measurements from a small research vessel during July 2016. We observed near-equilibrium CO2 conditions and overall weak supersaturation of CO2 in the main channel (average 133.8% saturation) and tributaries. We observed only weak correlations between CO2 saturation, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity, thus not strongly supporting our hypothesis of primary productivity controls. In general, the LCR was clear (low turbidity, mean = 1.48 FNU) and had low chlorophyll fluorescence (mean = 0.177 RFU) during the sampling period. As a whole, the LCR was homogeneous with respect to biogeochemical conditions and showed low spatial variability at > 100 km scales. Overall, we find that the LCR is likely a weak summertime source of CO2 to the atmosphere, in line with findings from other altered rivers such as the Upper Mississippi.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	4					417	427		10.1080/20442041.2017.1366487								WOS:000423406300004

QUALITY OF DRINKABLE WATER SPRINGS IN TWO ALBA COUNTY REGIONS - COMPARATIVE STUDY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Water pollution implies any physical, chemical, biological or bacteriological contamination over allowable limits. Alterations of water quality occur as a result of natural phenomena (natural pollution) or due to human activities (artificial pollution). Pollutants are any matter or energy present in the environment in a quantity exceeding a tolerable limit for humans or living species, preventing their normal evolution. Depending on the environmental factors that affect water quality, such outbreaks may occur more frequently in certain seasons of the year. In our study, samples were collected from several sources in two areas within Alba County, Romania. Water samples were studied in terms of physical-chemical properties (pH, mineral content, acidity, nitrite, nitrate and ammonium concentrations) and microbiological load (aerobic mesophilic bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli and enterococci). Variations of microbiological parameters in time were studied for both areas. The value of microbiological parameters and their variation in time was compared for the two areas. The study demonstrated that the risks of illness due to water consumption are present in both areas, and that a correlation in the increases of microbiological contamination over time between the two areas was found.																	1311-5065						2017	18	4					1389	1397										WOS:000423283800010

Specific objectives are to (1) evaluate characteristics of spawning habitat in a number of different systems; (2) determine if spawning habitat can be predicted from data on land cover, geology, and physical characteristics in the lake or river; and (3) compare spawning habitat in inland lakes and some Great Lakes locations. In inland lakes, Muskellunge preferred to spawn over fine sediments near emergent and submersed vegetation in protected bays or shorelines, but bay and calm shoreline habitat is not always available and may be degraded, so they may end up spawning over open sand, gravel, or coarse particulate organic matter and spawning in areas without vegetation. For objective two, the best-performing MaxEnt model included shoreline development index, presence of nearby shallow areas, distance from out flowing streams, effective fetch, maximum depth, Carlson's trophic status index, and an indicator of east- or west-facing shoreline as significant factors predicting spawning locations in inland lakes. Overall, 64% of all observed spawning fell within locations predicted by a model, including the most suitable 40% of available habitat for all lakes. For objective 3, we compared habitat selection of Great Lakes-strain Muskellunge with the inland strain. MaxEnt models of habitat for Great Lakes Muskellunge included some similar factors like shallow depth and low slope, but also included river habitat factors like presence of moderate vegetative cover and woody debris. To conclude, we propose a conceptual model of Muskellunge spawning and nursery habitat where survival from egg to larva is limited by water quality, predation on eggs, and abundant food resources.																	0892-2284		978-1-934874-46-2				2017	85						183	201										WOS:000422891800022

SETBACK DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR REMOVAL OF SWINE SLURRY CONSTITUENTS IN RUNOFF	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												The use of setback distances for manure application on cropland areas adjacent to surface water bodies could serve a function similar to vegetative filter strips. However, little information currently exists to identify the setback distances necessary to effectively reduce the transport of contaminants in runoff. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of setback distance and runoff rate on concentrations of selected constituents in runoff following land application of swine slurry to a no-till cropland area in southeast Nebraska. The study site had a residue cover of 7.73 Mg ha(-1) and a slope gradient of 4.9%. The twenty plots examined during the investigation were 3.7 m across the slope by 4.9, 7.9, 11.0, 17.1, or 23.2 m long. An initial set of rainfall simulation tests were completed to identify background concentrations of selected constituents. Swine slurry was then applied to the upper 4.9 m of each plot, and additional rainfall simulation tests were conducted on the same plots examined previously. A first-order exponential decay function was used to estimate the effects of setback distance on concentrations of selected constituents. A setback distance of 12.2 m reduced runoff concentrations of dissolved phosphorus (DP), NH4-N, total nitrogen (TN), boron, chloride, manganese, potassium, sulfate, zinc, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH to background values similar to those measured for the no-slurry condition. Runoff rate significantly influenced transport of several of the constituents, with concentrations generally decreasing as runoff rate increased. The transport of selected pollutants in runoff was significantly reduced when setback areas were employed.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	6					1885	1894		10.13031/trans.12310								WOS:000423266400009

INTERNATIONAL WATERSHED TECHNOLOGY: IMPROVING WATER QUALITY AND QUANTITY AT THE LOCAL, BASIN, AND REGIONAL SCALES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												This article introduces the five papers in the "International Watershed Technology" collection. These papers were selected from 60 technical presentations at the fifth biennial ASABE 21st Century Watershed Technology Conference and Workshop: Improving the Quality of Water Resources at Local, Basin, and Regional Scales, held in Quito, Ecuador, on 3-9 December 2016. The conference focused on solving spatial and temporal water quality and quantity problems and addressed topics such as watershed management in developing countries, aquatic ecology and ecohydrology, ecosystem services, climate change mitigation strategies, flood forecasting, remote sensing, and water resource policy and management. While diverse, the presentation topics reflected the continuing evolution of the "data mining" and "big data" themes of past conferences related to geospatial data applications, with increasing emphasis on practical solutions. The papers selected for this collection represent applications of spatial data analyses toward practical ends with a theme of "tools and techniques for sustainability." The papers address a range of topics, including the matching of crops with water availability, and assessing the environmental impacts of agricultural production. The papers identify some of the latest tools and techniques for improving sustainability in watershed resource management that are relevant to both developing and developed countries.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	6					1915	1916		10.13031/trans.12687								WOS:000423266400011

ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF FUTURE CLIMATE CONDITIONS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF WINTER COVER CROPS IN REDUCING NITRATE LOADS INTO THE CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHEDS USING THE SWAT MODEL	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Winter cover crops (WCCs) have been widely implemented in the Coastal Plain of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) due to their high effectiveness in reducing nitrate loads. However, future climate conditions (FCCs) are expected to exacerbate water quality degradation in the CBW by increasing nitrate loads from agriculture. Accordingly, the question remains whether WCCs are sufficient to mitigate increased nutrient loads caused by FCCs. In this study, we assessed the impacts of FCCs on WCC nitrate reduction efficiency in the Coastal Plain of the CBW using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Three FCC scenarios (2085-2098) were prepared using general circulation models (GCMs), considering three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. We also developed six representative WCC implementation scenarios based on the most commonly used planting dates and species of WCCs in this region. Simulation results showed that WCC biomass increased by similar to 58% under FCC scenarios due to climate conditions conducive to WCC growth. Prior to implementing WCCs, annual nitrate loads increased by similar to 43% under FCC scenarios compared to the baseline scenario (2001-2014). When WCCs were planted, annual nitrate loads were substantially reduced by similar to 48%, and WCC nitrate reduction efficiency was similar to 5% higher under FCC scenarios relative to the baseline scenario. The increase in WCC nitrate reduction efficiency varied with FCC scenario and WCC planting method. As CO2 concentrations were higher and winters were warmer under FCC scenarios, WCCs had greater biomass and thus demonstrated higher nitrate reduction efficiency. In response to FCC scenarios, the performance of less effective WCC practices (i.e., barley, wheat, and late planting) under the baseline scenario indicated a similar to 14% higher increase in nitrate reduction efficiency compared to WCC practices with greater effectiveness under the baseline scenario (i.e., rye and early planting) due to warmer temperatures. The SWAT simulation results indicated that WCCs were effective in mitigating nitrate loads accelerated by FCCs, suggesting the role of WCCs in mitigating nitrate loads will likely be even more important under FCCs.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	6					1939	1955		10.13031/trans.12390								WOS:000423266400014

ANALYSIS OF PARAMETER SENSITIVITY AND IDENTIFIABILITY OF ROOT ZONE WATER QUALITY MODEL (RZWQM) FOR DRYLAND SUGARBEET MODELING	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Sugarbeet is being considered as one of the most viable feedstock alternatives to corn for biofuel production since herbicide-resistant energy beets were deregulated by the USDA in 2012. Growing sugarbeets for biofuel production may have significant impacts on soil health and water quality in the north-central regions of the U.S., where 50% of the nation's total sugarbeets were produced in 2015. Almost all the current sugarbeet models simulate only plant growth and yield but have no capability to simulate the effects of sugarbeet production on soil and water quality. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) is a widely used model that simulates crop yield, water flow, and transport of salts and nitrogen in crop fields. RZWQM is currently linked to 23 specific crop models in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) version 4.0, not including a sugarbeet model. In this study, the Crop and Environment REsource Synthesis (CERES) in RZWQM was adapted for sugarbeet simulation to model the soil and water quality impact of sugarbeet for biofuel production. The Beet model was then evaluated against dryland sugarbeet production at the Carrington Research and Extension Station (North Dakota) in 2014 and 2015. The PEST (Parameter ESTimation) tool in RZWQM was used for parameter estimation and sensitivity and identifiability analysis. The model did reasonably well in both 2014 (d-statistic = 0.709 to 0.992; rRMSE = 0.066 to 1.211) and 2015 (d-statistic = 0.733 to 0.990; rRMSE = 0.043 to 0.930) in terms of simulating leaf area index, top weight, root weight, soil water content, and soil nitrates. Under dry conditions, the most sensitive soil parameters were soil bulk densities and saturated hydraulic conductivities in different layers. Identifiability analysis also showed that three to five model parameters may be identifiable by calibration datasets. RZWQM enhanced with a sugarbeet module and its parameter analysis can be used for water use optimization under dryland conditions.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	6					1995	2010		10.13031/trans.12313								WOS:000423266400018

OPTIMIZING ET-BASED IRRIGATION SCHEDULING FOR WHEAT AND MAIZE WITH WATER CONSTRAINTS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Deficit irrigation has been shown to increase crop water use efficiency (WUE) under certain conditions, even though the yield is slightly reduced. In this study, the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) was first calibrated with measured data from a large weighing lysimeter from 1998 to 2003 at the Yucheng Experimental Station in the North China Plain for daily evapotranspiration (ET), soil water storage (0-120 cm), leaf area index (LAI), aboveground biomass, and grain yield. The calibrated model was then used to explore crop responses to ET-based irrigation management using weather data from 1958 to 2015 and identify the most suitable ET-based irrigation schedules for the area. Irrigation amount was determined by constraining irrigation to a percentage of potential crop ET (40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% ETc) at the various growth stages of wheat [planting to before winter dormancy (P-D), green up to booting (G-B), booting to flowering (B-F), and flowering to maturity (F-M)] and of maize [planting to silking (P-S) and silking to maturity (S-M)], subject to seasonal water availability limits of 100/50, 200/100, 300/150, and 400/200 mm and no water limit for wheat/maize seasons, respectively. In general, wheat was more responsive to irrigation than maize, while greater influence of weather variation was simulated on maize than on wheat. For wheat with seasonal water limits, the highest average WUE was simulated with the highest targeted ETc levels at both the G-B and B-F stages and lower targeted ETc levels at the P-D and F-M stages. However, the highest average grain yield was simulated with the highest targeted ETc levels at all four growth stages for no water limit and the 400 mm water limit, or at both the G-B and B-F stages for the 300 and 200 mm water limits. For maize, lower targeted ETc levels after silking did not significantly affect maize production due to the high season rainfall, but irrigation of 60% ETc before silking was recommended. These results could be used as guidelines for precision irrigation along with real-time weather information.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	6					2053	2065		10.13031/trans.12363								WOS:000423266400022

MODELING N CONCENTRATION AND UPTAKE FOR MAIZE HYBRIDS UNDER GROWTH STAGE-BASED DEFICIT IRRIGATIONS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Current maize hybrids have lower critical aboveground biomass nitrogen (N) concentration (TCNP) and grain N concentration (GNC) compared to older hybrids, but few crop models have incorporated this trend. The objective of this study was to evaluate alternative algorithms for calculating TCNP (biomass-based method) and GNC (grain N demand based on N dilution curve) for predicting crop N concentration and N uptake for a current maize hybrid in the CERES-Maize model as implemented in the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM). Experimental data were obtained from a field study on maize irrigated to meet various percentages (40% to 100%) of evapotranspiration demand at both vegetative and reproductive stages in 2012 and 2013 in Greeley, Colorado. The original RZWQM showed little response of aboveground N concentration (AGBNC) to the irrigation treatments and overpredicted GNC in both years. As a result, crop N uptake was generally overpredicted, with root mean square error (RMSE) values of 28 to 60 kg N ha(-1) for the two years. Adjusted coefficients in the original TCNP and GNC algorithms (RZWQM_ADJ) effectively reduced the overpredicted GNC but with less improvement in response to the irrigation treatments in 2013 compared with the original RZWQM simulations. The RZWQM with modified TCNP and GNC algorithms simulated lower GNC and AGBNC than the original version, significantly improved the responses to the irrigation treatments, and captured the variations in measured GNC among seasons. The corresponding crop N uptake simulations improved more in 2012 than in 2013, with lower RMSE values of 16 to 32 kg N ha(-1) than the original and RZWQM_ADJ versions. The better-predicted grain N uptake by the alternative algorithms could be helpful to making better crop N management decisions under different deficit irrigation conditions.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	6					2067	2081		10.13031/trans.12405								WOS:000423266400023

SIMULATED EFFECTS OF WINTER WHEAT COVER CROP ON COTTON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS OF THE TEXAS ROLLING PLAINS	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Interest in cover crops has been increasing in the Texas Rolling Plains (TRP) region, mainly to improve soil health. However, there are concerns that cover crops could potentially reduce soil water and thereby affect the yield of subsequent cash crops. Previous field studies from this region have demonstrated mixed results, with some showing a reduction in cash crop yield due to cover crops and others indicating no significant impact of cover crops on subsequent cotton fiber yield. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the CROPGRO-Cotton and CERES-Wheat modules within the cropping system model (CSM) of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) for the TRP region, and (2) use the evaluated model to assess the long-term effects of growing winter wheat as a cover crop on water balances and seed cotton yield under irrigated and dryland conditions. The two DSSAT crop modules were calibrated using measured data on soil water and crop yield from four treatments: (1) irrigated cotton without a cover crop (CwoC-I), (2) irrigated cotton with winter wheat as a cover crop (CwC-I), (3) dryland cotton without a cover crop (CwoC-D), and (4) dryland cotton with a winter wheat cover crop (CwC-D) at the Texas A& M AgriLife Research Station at Chillicothe from 2011 to 2015. The average percent error (PE) between the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton simulated and measured seed cotton yield was -10.1% and -1.0% during the calibration and evaluation periods, respectively, and the percent root mean square error (% RMSE) was 11.9% during calibration and 27.6% during evaluation. For simulation of aboveground biomass by the CSM-CERES-Wheat model, the PE and % RMSE were 8.9% and 9.1%, respectively, during calibration and -0.9% and 21.8%, respectively, during evaluation. Results from the long-term (2001-2015) simulations indicated that there was no substantial reduction in average seed cotton yield and soil water due to growing winter wheat as a cover crop.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	6					2083	2096		10.13031/trans.12272								WOS:000423266400024

Due to the diversity, nonlinear and uneven distribution of aquaculture water quality parameters, it's very difficulty to assess the water quality. In this paper, the accurate water quality parameters are obtained by an adaptive weighted fusion method, then the water quality is assessment by the BP neural network, thus the software of the monitoring and evaluation system for ecological water quality is developed. The test results show that the accuracy of the water quality assessment system is 93.3%, which has good practicability.																			978-1-5090-5363-6				2017							37	41										WOS:000422907300008

Thus it is in urgent demand for real-time monitoring of river water. However, traditional methods have some disadvantages such as complicated instrument, high cost and cumbersome operation. Herein, we developed wireless conductivity sensor, which forms a monitoring network system based on ZigBee. The node of the network is powered by battery and connected to coordinator by star network of ZigBee. Conductivity of the water was detected by the sensor node and the data was then sent to the coordinator. After that, the coordinator sent the result to PC through RS458 serial port. Taking advantage of this sensor node, real-time monitoring of the water conductivity was realized with a low relative error of 1% and a loss rate of network package of 0.67%. It can be predicted that, by developing a network of this sensor node, monitoring of a considerable large area of water would be realized.																			978-1-5090-5363-6				2017							1092	1096										WOS:000422907300223

We aimed to determine whether complementary school garden, nutrition, and WASH interventions reduce intestinal parasites and improve school children's nutritional status in two regions of Burkina Faso. A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Plateau Central and Center-Ouest regions of Burkina Faso. A total of 360 randomly selected children, aged 8-15 years, had complete baseline and end-line survey data. Mixed regression models were used to assess the impact of the interventions, controlling for baseline characteristics. The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections decreased both in intervention and control schools, but the decrease was significantly higher in the intervention schools related to the control schools (odds ratio [OR] of the intervention effect = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1-0.5). Indices of undernutrition did not decrease at end-line in intervention schools. Safe handwashing practices before eating and the use of latrines at schools were significantly higher in the intervention schools than in the control schools at end-line (OR = 6.9, 95% CI = 1.4-34.4, and OR = 14.9, 95% CI = 1.4-153.9, respectively). Parameters of water quality remained unchanged. A combination of agricultural, nutritional, and WASH-related interventions embedded in the social-ecological systems and delivered through the school platform improved several child health outcomes, including intestinal parasitic infections and some WASH-related behaviors. Sustained interventions with stronger household and community-based components are, however, needed to improve school children's health in the long-term.																	0002-9637	1476-1645					2017	97	3					904	913		10.4269/ajtmh.16-0964								WOS:000423202900050	28722585

This is the first report to geo-reference pemphigus cases in a high-prevalence Brazilian region using geographic information systems. We aimed to report the spatio-temporal behavior of pemphigus foliaceus (PF) and vulgaris (PV) in southeastern Brazil, over the last five decades to describe geographical clusters, as well as to characterize the land use in the city with the highest number of cases. Patients were identified from 1965 to 2014. Maps were developed using ArcGIS software and organized into decades from 1965 to 2014. Ribeirao Preto was identified as the city with the greatest number of cases. Land use was analyzed within a 2 km-buffer surrounding the residence of each patient. A total of 426 cases of pemphigus were identified. PF was the predominant form (285 cases); notwithstanding, the number of new cases of PV rose, overtaking the number of new cases of PF in the last decade studied. Agricultural area (42%) and exposed soil (33.2%) are the most predominant land uses in Ribeirao Preto surrounding patients' residences. This study shows high-confidence geographical foci of PF and PV, as well as provides evidence of an increase of both clinical forms over the last five decades. All cases of PV and PF are in proximity to rivers and agricultural areas which reinforce the hypothesis that environmental factors play a role in pemphigus etiopathogenesis.

Effectiveness of the Hydrogen Sulfide Test as a Water Quality Indicator for Diarrhea Risk in Rural Bangladesh	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												Microbiological water quality is usually assessed by the identification of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a fecal indicator. The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) test is an inexpensive, easy-to-use, and portable alternative field-based water quality test. Our study evaluated the H2S test's effectiveness as a water quality indicator for diarrhea risk. Field workers collected stored drinking water samples for H2S analysis and detection of E. coli by membrane filtration and measured caregiver-reported diarrhea among children < 5 years in the same households 1 month later. We assessed the association between the H2S test (incubated for 24 hours and 48 hours) and diarrhea prevalence, with 2-day and 7-day symptom recall periods (N = 1,348). We determined the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV) of the H2S test compared with E. coli (N = 525). Controlling for potentially confounding covariates, H2S-positive water (at 24 or 48 hours) was not associated with 2-day diarrhea prevalence (24-hour prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63-1.69; 48-hour PR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.58-1.38) or 7-day diarrhea prevalence (24-hour PR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.76-1.78; 48-hour PR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.81-1.80). The sensitivity, PPV, and NPV of the H2S test was significantly higher when the H2S test was incubated for 48 versus 24 hours whereas specificity showed the opposite trend. H2S test sensitivity, PPV, and NPV increased with increasing E. coli levels, consistent with previous evidence that the H2S test is a useful water quality tool in high-contamination settings. However, our results suggest that the H2S test is not an effective indicator for waterborne diarrhea.																	0002-9637	1476-1645					2017	97	6					1867	1871		10.4269/ajtmh.17-0387								WOS:000423231800045	29141754

Riparian and landscape disturbance effects on stream fish community composition in an agriculturally-dominated drainage	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												We compared historical stream fish community sampling and remote sensing data from 1993-2011 in an agriculturally-dominated drainage basin to determine the effects of varying levels of riparian and landscape disturbances on fish communities. Stream fish guilds were analyzed with National Land Cover Database and aerial imagery products to quantify disturbance levels at a local and watershed scale. Insectivores and benthic insectivores were associated with intact riparian areas, whereas environmentally tolerant and omnivorous species were found in environments with degraded riparian areas. Riparian disturbances had the greatest effect near the stream (0-10 m), and the effects diminished with increasing distance from the stream. This spatial scale corresponds with those reported in the literature whereby allocthonous inputs and riparian filtering influenced stream fish communities and water quality. The landscape disturbance was not a strong predictor for any fish guild, indicating that local riparian conditions were more biologically meaningful. Considering the rapid rates of land conversion to production agriculture across the midwestern United States, ensuring adequate riparian buffering of streams may help protect specialist aquatic species and their habitat. Given the broad temporal and spatial nature of our data, these results suggest that targeted conservation of the 10-m scale of intact riparian vegetation directly adjacent to streams is a sound practice and should be considered the minimum conservation goal for watershed restoration in low-gradient landscapes historically dominated by agricultural land-use practices.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	4			SI		445	456		10.1080/14634988.2017.1368831								WOS:000423091000015

A major type of vendor is private kiosks, advertising reverse osmosis-treated water for sale by volume. To describe the scale and geographical distribution of private kiosks in metropolitan Port-au-Prince, an inventory of private kiosks was conducted from July to August 2013. Coordinates of kiosks were recorded with global positioning system units and a brief questionnaire was administered with the operator to document key kiosk characteristics. To assess the quality of water originating from private kiosks, water quality analyses were also conducted on a sample of those inventoried as well as from the major provider company sites. The parameters tested were Escherichia coli, free chlorine residual, pH, turbidity, and total dissolved solids. More than 1,300 kiosks were inventoried, the majority of which were franchises of four large provider companies. Approximately half of kiosks reported opening within 12 months of the date of the inventory. The kiosk treatment chain and sales price was consistent among a majority of the kiosks. Of the 757 kiosks sampled for water quality, 90.9% of samples met World Health Organization (WHO) microbiological guideline at the point of sale for nondetectable E. coli in a 100-mL sample. Of the eight provider company sites tested, all samples met the WHO microbiological guideline. Because of the increasing role of the private sector in drinking water provision in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in Haiti, this assessment was an important first step for government regulation of this sector.																	0002-9637	1476-1645					2017	97	4		S			84	91		10.4269/ajtmh.16-0692								WOS:000423210000012	29064355

Measuring Physical Properties, Plant Development, and Runoff Water Quality	COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION												Six green roof substrate blends were created by using composts sourced from local suppliers and the Michigan State University Student Organic Farm. Bulk density, field capacity, total porosity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were determined for each substrate and compared to an unamended expanded shale aggregate. Significant differences were detected in all measured physical properties. A plant growth study was conducted in a greenhouse. Ocimum basilicum (basil), Sedum floriforum (sedum), and Carex eburnea (bristleleaf sedge) were grown in a depth of 10 cm of all six substrates for 6 months. The greatest dry shoot masses in bristleleaf sedge and sedum were twice those of the smallest masses. The largest wet harvest of basil was four times greater than the smallest harvest. Runoff water was collected after simulated precipitation events on regular intervals during the plant growth study and analyzed for nitrate and phosphate concentrations. Ion concentrations were greatest on the first measurement date and decreased rapidly with time. Compost selection had a strong impact on initial nitrate and phosphate concentrations, but the influence of compost on concentrations diminished with time. Overall, compost selection was found to have measureable and meaningful impacts on green roof substrate performance.																	1065-657X	2326-2397					2017	25	4					231	241		10.1080/1065657X.2017.1295887								WOS:000423197100003

However, the level of impacts, especially on macroinvertebrates, are not well known, which is the goal of this study. Here, three biotic indices were used. The Saginaw River Basin, the largest watershed in Michigan was selected for this study. Since no know modeling package exists to evaluate the impacts of climate change on these biotic indices, a coupled modeling approach was proposed. First, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was setup to estimate streamflow and water quality for all stream segments. Next, the results from the SWAT model in combination with long-term biological monitoring data were used to develop biotic indices predictive models using a two-phase approach. An assemblage of 42 climate scenarios (2040-2060) were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which are biased corrected and statistically downscaled. The dataset provides two extreme Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to account for best (RCP 4.5) and worst (RCP 8.5) case scenarios. The climate data were incorporated in SWAT and biotic indices predictive models to understand stream health conditions in the watershed. Results showed that the majority of streams have a probability of declining in values of biotic indices while streams that currently have excellent conditions are the most vulnerable streams to the climate change. This modeling approach provides a new mean to link more strongly biota indicators with flow regime indicators, which is of prime interest for the implementation of ecohydrology principles.

A comparative investigation on the inhibition kinetics of bioaccumulation of As(III) and As(V) ions using Bacillus arsenicus MTCC 4380	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												In the context of global environmental and social change, with increasing pollution and deterioration of biodiversity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems having its deep roots in radical changes to hydrological mesocycles, there is an urgent requirement for a new approach for sustainability. The ecohydrology concept covers the entire hydrological cycle, including its atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic phases, and the entire cycle of biological components of the environment playing a vital role as moderators of water quality and quantity. In the present study the simultaneous growth and bioaccumulation of As(III) and As(V) ions of living cells of Bacillus arsenicus MTCC 4380 was studied as a function of pH, inoculum size, concentrations of peptone and arsenic (As(III) or As(V)) ions. Although both As(III) and As(V) ions resulted in an inhibition effect on the growth of the bacteria, B. arsenicus MTCC 4380 was capable of removing. As(III) and As(V) with the maximum bioaccumulation % of 90.43 and 94.31 at 50 mg/L initial arsenic concentration, respectively at pH 7.0 and inoculum size 5% (v/v). As the maximum specific growth rate (mu(m))remained constant and the saturation constant (K '(s,app)) value increased in the presence of increasing concentrations of arsenic ions, the inhibition of As(III) or As(V) ions on the growth rate of B. arsenicus MTCC 4380 was found to be a competitive inhibition. The current investigation provides a new insight into the effect of As(III) and As(V) ions on B. arsenicus MTCC 4380, exclusively with regard to its toxicity, bioaccumulation and bioremediation potential.

Senthil			Assessment of Leachate Effects on Groundwater and Soil from Nduba Land Fill in Kigali, Rwanda	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH IN AFRICA												Landfills are one of the groundwater pollution sources in Rwanda. Physical and chemical analyses of water samples were carried out to assure the magnitude of Nduba Landfill on ground water quality. Laboratory tests were conducted to get the results which helped us to study the assessment of leachate effect and to propose mitigation measures of Nduba landfill. The results showed that most of water were contaminated, where concentration of most physical and chemical parameters were above acceptable standard levels required by local and international standards for potable. The analytical results of leachates samples (Cu: 38.5 mg/L, Mn: 13.075mg/l, Zn: 15mg/l, TP:4525mg/l, pH:8.52 mu S/cm, COD:7100mg/l, BOD:182.1mg/l, TN:5mg/l and Fe:43.025mg/L) showed that heavy metals are leached out from the MSW. The analytical results of groundwater from the wells located in the vicinity of Nduba landfill site (Cu: 2 mg/L, Zn: 3.5-5.5mg/l, SO42-: 250-275mg/l, NO3-: 55-67.5mg/l, NH4+: 1.5-2.25mg/l, COD: 39-53.4mg/l, Fe: 1.75-4.25 mg/L, Turbidity: 4.03-4.32NTU, pH: 5.31-5.73 mu S/cm, Temperature: 21 degrees C and BOD: 20.7-21.6mg/l) compared to the World Health Organization standard (Cu:0.1mg/L, Fe:0.3mg/L, Zn:5mg/l, SO42-: 200mg/l, NO3-: 50mg/l NH4+: 1.5mg/l, Turbidity: <5.0 NTU and pH: 6.5-9.2 mu S/cm) revealed that groundwater from the wells located in the vicinity of Nduba landfill site requires further physical chemical treatment to ensure their suitability for human consumption as the levels of some water quality parameters exceeded the EPA guidelines for drinking water. Designing a sanitary landfill was recommended to avoid effects of leachate on environment.

Drinking water may contain disease causing agents and toxic chemicals, and to control the risks to public health, systematic water quality monitoring and surveillance are required. Thousands of chemicals have been identified in drinking water supplies around the world and are considered potentially hazardous to human health at relatively high concentrations. Heavy metals are the most harmful of the chemical pollutants and are of concern due to their toxicities to humans. Moringa oleifera seed acts as a natural coagulant, adsorbent and antimicrobial agent while commercial activated carbon is known for its excellent heavy metal removal. It is believed that Moringa oleifera seed is an organic natural polymer. This work has been carried out to analyse the removal of some heavy metals (lead, nickel, iron, and zinc) from borehole water using moringa seed powder, activated carbon and a combination of the two adsorbents. The results obtained showed that Moringa oleifera is environmentally friendly and suitable for water treatment containing undesirable heavy metals. It was also discovered that all the adsorbents were able to completely remove the lead metal in the water. Furthermore, within the adsorbent dosage limit investigated, only activated carbon could remove all the zinc present in the water. However, there was an indication that higher dosage of the coagulants would be able to remove higher percentage of the other metals. It was also found that, in some cases, an increase in the dosage of some adsorbents led to decrease in the percentage removal of some metals. This was observed to be an indication that there could be the need to take note of the optimum dosages of the adsorbents that need to be used in treating any water. The good performances displayed by these local adsorbents have shown that they could effectively replace the chemicals that have been found to have links with some health problems in human.

An introduction to Lake of the Woods-from science to governance in an international waterbody	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW), a vast lake covering over 3850 km(2), is a waterbody of current and historical significance that spans the borders between Minnesota and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. Over the past 2 decades, there has been concern for the water quality of LOW, sparked by anecdotal evidence of increased intensity and frequency of algal blooms by the public and resource managers. Minnesota's waters of LOW were declared impaired in 2008 due to exceedances of eutrophication criteria, initiating a Total Maximum Daily Load study. LOW's impairment declaration spurred several contrasting challenges and opportunities for water quality management across this diverse lake and basin. Governance challenges are emphasized by the large number of government agencies (>25) with land or water authorities in the 70,000 km(2) basin, the variability in phosphorus standards applicable to LOW between Minnesota, Ontario, and Manitoba, and unequal funding resources allocated to LOW's water quality management agencies. Despite these challenges, there is a long history of international cooperation among agencies, recent funding increases, and the formation of a new International Joint Commission Board with the mandate to monitor ecosystem health in the entire LOW basin. As highlighted by the studies in this issue, the science of nutrient and algal dynamics in LOW is complex, and water quality restoration may take years to decades because major sources of nutrients to the lake are not subject to reductions by conventional lake restoration methods.

Internal phosphorus loading contributions from deposited and resuspended sediment to the Lake of the Woods	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												The Lake of the Woods exhibits cyanobacterial blooms despite substantial declines in watershed phosphorus (P) loading since the 1970s, suggesting that internal P loads are contributing to the P budget. A better understanding of internal P loading contributions and dynamics is needed to refine management strategies and water quality goals. Sediment cores were collected from several stations within the US portion to examine potential internal P contributions from deposited and resuspended sediment. Although laboratory-derived diffusive P fluxes were highest under anaerobic conditions (8-12 mg/m(2) d), aerobic conditions at the sediment-water interface may regulate in situ diffusive P fluxes due to frequent polymixis. Although much lower under aerobic conditions, modest fluxes of 0.2-0.6 mg/m(2) d could play an important role in the P budget. Simulated resuspension indicated that the critical shear stress of deposited sediment was relatively low at 1.3-2.3 dynes/cm(2). The wind-exposed long fetches and shallow morphometry of regions of Lake of the Woods could result in frequent resuspension of P-enriched clays and silts that contribute inorganic P to the water column. Resuspended sediments exhibited a low equilibrium P concentration (near zero) and high linear adsorption coefficient (700-3200 L/kg), suggesting they may act more as a sink rather than a source for soluble P. Resuspension could compete with cyanobacterial uptake by sequestering soluble reactive P. Resuspended inorganic P could also constitute a significant portion of the water column total P composition in addition to organic P, incorporated as cyanobacterial biomass, and needs to be considered in the P budget and chlorophyll prediction.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					347	359		10.1080/10402381.2017.1312647								WOS:000423047200003

Here we analyzed sediments from 6 sites in the southern basin for diverse biogeochemical (loss-on-ignition, biogenic silica, pigments) and microfossil (diatoms, chrysophytes) remains to reconstruct the environmental history of the lake. Our objectives were to quantify the magnitude and direction of historical trophic change and evaluate reasons for an apparent lack of basin recovery following documented nutrient diversion. Evidence came from fossil indicator profiles and comparisons of these long-term trends with historical land use and monitoring data. Results indicate major changes in algal communities during and following peak nutrient loading in the mid-20th century as well as more recent increases in colonial cyanobacteria and high-nutrient diatomtaxa. Combined, fossil indicators reflect an anthropogenically enriched system that has undergone substantial ecological change, particularly since similar to 1980, due to multiple drivers. Physical changes in lake thermal regime resulting from climate warming may be exacerbating internal phosphorus release from sediments, thereby lowering nitrogen: phosphorus ratios and enhancing cyanobacterial abundance. These drivers of lake condition in the lake may apply to other large shallow lakes that exhibit only limited biological recovery from reduced external nutrient loading.

Historical phosphorus dynamics in Lake of the Woods (USA-Canada) - does legacy phosphorus still affect the southern basin?	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A historical phosphorus (P) budget was constructed for southern Lake of the Woods. Sediment cores from 7 bays were radioisotopically dated and analyzed for loss-on-ignition, P, Si, diatoms, and pigments. Geochemical records for cores were combined using focusing factors for whole-basin estimates of sediment, total P, and P fraction accumulation. Although historical monitoring shows that external P loads decreased since the 1950s, sediment P has continued to increase since the mid-20th century. Much sediment P is labile and may be mobile within the sediments and/or available for internal loading and resuspension. Two mass-balance models were used to explore historical P loading scenarios and in-lake dynamics, a static one-box model and a dynamic multi-box model. The one-box model predicts presettlement external loads were slightly less than modern loads. The dynamic model shows that water-column P was higher in the 1950s-1970s than today, that the lake is sensitive to external loads because P losses from burial and outflow are high, and that the lake is moving to a new steady state with respect to water-column P and size of the active sediment P pool. The active sediment pool built up in the mid-20th century has been depleted through outflow and burial, such that its legacy effects are now minimal. Comparison of historical nutrient dynamics and sediment records of algal production showed a counterintuitive increase in production after external P loads decreased, suggesting other drivers may now regulate modern limnoecology, including seasonality of P loading, shifting nutrient limitation, and climate warming.

Climate as a driver of increasing algal production in Lake of theWoods, Ontario, Canada	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW) is a large, transboundary lake that straddles the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, and the state of Minnesota. Although algal blooms have been reported in the lake since the early 1800s, monitoring data and anecdotal evidence suggest that toxic, cyanobacterial blooms have increased in frequency and intensity in recent years. However, total phosphorus inputs from the lake's primary tributary, the Rainy River, have declined significantly since the late 1960s. We explore this disconnect by examining spectrally-inferred determinations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) in lake sediment cores, as a measure of past changes in aquatic primary production. Beginning in the late 1970s to early 1980s, inferred Chl-a increased at 5 impact sites in the north end of LOW that currently experience cyanobacterial blooms in late summer and autumn. In contrast, no change in Chl-a was observed at an oligotrophic reference site with much lower cyanobacteria biomass. At the impact sites, Chl-a generally showed no significant relationship to long-term trends in diatom-inferred total phosphorus concentrations, but was significantly and positively correlated to climatic variables, including mean annual air temperature at all sites and total annual precipitation at 4 sites. These data suggest that climate change may exacerbate algal blooms in this moderately-enriched lake. The results also show that the effects of climate change on aquatic production may be enhanced at sites with higher nutrient concentrations, likely because of positive feedbacks between cyanobacteria biomass, water temperature and nutrient availability. The impact of climate change should be considered carefully in future management initiatives.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					403	414		10.1080/10402381.2017.1379574								WOS:000423047200007						
J	Watson, SB; Kling, H				Watson, Susan B.; Kling, Hedy			Lake of theWoods phyto- and picoplankton: spatiotemporal patterns in blooms, community composition, and nutrient status	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This study evaluated the phytoplankton and trophic status in Lake of the Woods (LOW; Ontario, Canada), a large, multi-basin waterbody with marked gradients in water quality and annual cyanobacterial blooms. We combined a broad comparison of average total phosphorus (TP)-biomass relationships in LOW and other north temperate lakes with a detailed spatiotemporal analysis of net-, nanno-, and picoplankton, total bacterioplankton, nutrient status, and water quality across six hydrological sectors of the lake between 2008 and 2010. Average total phytoplankton biomass (TB) varied considerably among zones and years but, similar to TP, was highest in the shallower, more eutrophic southern zones with a generally lower than average TB/TP yield within the among-lakes dataset. Summer-fall blooms of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria were dominated by Aphanizomenon across most sectors except in the north, where Dolichospermum predominated. Unlike the larger size fractions, patterns in picoplankton suggested non-nutrient constraints: phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria (<2 mu m) showed a distinct south-north increase correlated with water transparency, while the more abundant phycocyanin-rich fraction was related to dissolved organicmaterial with no distinct spatial patterns. Bacterial numbers were higher in surface layers and significantly related to temperature but not nutrients; spatial distribution indicated they were not directly introduced from riverine inputs. Overall, planktonic P deficiency was higher in the north and increased in late summer concurrent with N co-limitation and increases in N-2-fixers. The combined data suggest that P ultimately limits LOW plankton, but short-term N and Si deficiencies influence the plankton community composition.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					415	432		10.1080/10402381.2017.1331282								WOS:000423047200008						
J	McDaniel, T; Pascoe, T				McDaniel, Tana; Pascoe, Timothy			Applying the reference condition approach to Lake of the Woods: sediment and benthic invertebrate community assessment for lake-wide management	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Lake of the Woods (LOW) is a large, international lake recently designated as impaired by the State of Minnesota due to excess nutrients and nuisance algal blooms. Concerns regarding the impacts of eutrophication have prompted the need for management tools to help to defines areas of ecosystem impairment and to monitor changes in trophic status. The goal of this study was to assess areas of potential anthropogenic impacts in LOW using a benthic macro-invertebrate reference condition approach model and identify factors correlating with these impacts. We also sought to provide baseline information on sediment chemistry prior to the initiation of increased mining activity in the basin. A Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network (CABIN) reference model was developed for LOW to compare the benthic community structure at a number of potentially stressed or impaired sites. Concentrations of both nutrients and metals in sediments at many sites in LOW exceeded Ontario provincial and Canadian federal effect levels for aquatic life. The benthic community at some locations was found to be divergent from reference sites, with substantial reductions in diversity and abundance associated with stress to the benthic community. As expected, benthic invertebrate diversity appeared to be most affected at sites that were deep, thermally stratified and high in nutrients thus making them prone to hypoxia. Benthic diversity was also negatively associated with higher concentrations of metals such as lead and arsenic. The CABIN approach can provide a useful tool in lake management for the identification of stressed sites.																	1040-2381	2151-5530					2017	33	4					452	471		10.1080/10402381.2017.1379573								WOS:000423047200011						
J	Abdelraheem, MB				Abdelraheem, Mohamed B.			Acute kidney injury in low- and middle-income countries: investigations, management and prevention	PAEDIATRICS AND INTERNATIONAL CHILD HEALTH												Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a relatively common condition, encountered in everyday paediatric clinical practice. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in children both inside and outside intensive care units. It is associated with prolonged hospital stay and progression to chronic kidney disease. The burden of AKI is particularly high in low-and middle-income countries where rural areas and smaller cities in the countryside predominate. Most of these areas suffer from poverty, poor sanitation, water quality and hygiene, lack of education and poor access to health care. AKI is preventable if it is detected sufficiently early and managed promptly. Improved nephrology services and the availability of cost-effective dialysis facilities in resource-limited settings should reduce morbidity and save many children's lives.																	2046-9047	2046-9055					2017	37	4			SI		269	272		10.1080/20469047.2017.1386816								WOS:000423048400006	29216816

J	Oglu, B; Yorulmaz, B				Oglu, Burak; Yorulmaz, Bulent			Accumulation of Metals and Metalloids in Aegean Chub, Inhabiting in Two Middle Sized Streams in Southwest Anatolia	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Essential and non-essential total eleven metals and metalloids (Al, B, Cr, Co, Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) concentrations were determined by ICP-AES in muscle of Squalius fellowesii (Gunther, 1868), between November of 2013 and June of 2014, on chosen four stations on Tersakan and Saricay streams. Average concentrations (mu g g(-1) wet weight) in Tersakan: Al (60.81 +/- 58.51), B (27.13 +/- 12.42), Co (0.07 +/- 0.05), Cd (0.01 +/- 0.02), Cu (1.44 +/- 0.51), Cr (0.75 +/- 0.54), Fe (33.49 +/- 30.69), Mn (2.19 +/- 1.35), Ni (0.98 +/- 1.27), Zn (20.71 +/- 20.16) and in Saricay: Al (33.82 +/- 37.19), B(8.15 +/- 8.90), Co (0.04 +/- 0.035), Cd (0.01 +/- 0.01), Cu (0.90 +/- 0.44), Cr (0.40 +/- 0.27), Fe (12.97 +/- 8.17), Mn (3.75 +/- 2.045), Ni (0.54 +/- 0.82), Zn (19.05 +/- 10.65) were found. Lead (Pb) was found below detection limits in all stations or seasons while Al accumulation was found highest. The effects of water quality parameters on essential and non-essential metal-metalloid accumulations in fish tissue were indicated by PCA and Co-inertia analyses. Concentrations of observed non-essential metals did not exceed the consumption limits. The evaluation of the data obtained from the study, in Tersakan and Saricay streams, reveal that the ecological balance can be changed in a negative way in case of continuation of the pollution of these two streams.																	1303-2712						2017	17				SI		1405	1413		10.4194/1303-2712-v17_6_34								WOS:000422959000009

The source of electricity is needed whenever we consider point-of-care diagnostics, in-vivo tests or in particular - environmental applications. The need of supplying energy to biosensor may be an important obstacle for its everyday use, particularly in developing countries. Here, we present the concept of biosensor able to generate power by bioelectrochemical oxidation of the analyte and thus - able to autonomously maintain its operation. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The conventional biological water quality indicators do not provide adequate information about the presence of pathogenic viruses. In this work a cost effective and rapid system is designed for Hepatitis A virus monitoring in food. A sandwich Enzyme Linked Immuno Magnetic assays is proposed. This system is based on the use of new polydopamine-modified magnetic nanobeads as solid support for the immunochemical chain, and screen printed electrodes as a sensing platform. This rapid, sensitive and low-cost analysis method involves the use of a portable instrument, able to perform measurements directly in the field. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The developed platform utilizes free and open satellite data available from different data sources like COPERNICUS, the European Earth Observation Initiative, or NASA, from different satellites and instruments. The quality of the marine environment is operationally evaluated using parameters like chlorophyll-a concentration, water color and Sea Surface Temperature (SST). For each parameter, there are more than one dataset available, from different data sources or satellites, to allow users to select the most appropriate dataset for their area or time of interest. The above datasets are automatically downloaded from the data provider's services and ingested to the central, spatial engine. The spatial data platform uses the Postgresql database with the PostGIS extension for spatial data storage and Geoserver for the provision of the spatial data services. The system provides daily, 10 days and monthly maps and time series of the above parameters. The information is provided using a web client which is based on the GET SDI PORTAL, an easy to use and feature rich geospatial visualization and analysis platform. The users can examine the temporal variation of the parameters using a simple time animation tool. In addition, with just one click on the map, the system provides an interactive time series chart for any of the parameters of the available datasets. The platform can be offered as Software as a Service (SaaS) to any area in the Mediterranean region.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1353-9; 978-1-5106-1352-2				2017	10444								UNSP 1044419	10.1117/12.2279135								WOS:000422619600044

The paper presents the results of patrol monitoring of a 40-kilometre stretch of the Oder between Raciborz and Kozle. It has been established that patrol monitoring is a good tool for verifying the distribution of points of classic stationary monitoring, particularly in areas subject to varied human impact, where tributaries of the main river are very diversified as regards hydrochemistry. For this reason the results of operational monitoring carried out once every few years may not be reliable and the presented condition of the monitored waterbodies may be far from reality.

This was with a view to create public awareness about the safety of groundwater as a source for domestic purposes (e.g., drinking, cooking etc.) in non-industrial area. Water samples were collected on seasonal basis, comprising of three months (August-October) in the wet season and three months (December-February) in the dry season. The PAHs in the water samples were extracted with n-hexane using liquid-liquid extraction method, while their qualitative identifications and quantitative estimations were carried out with the use of gas chromatography. Levels of PAHs detected showed predominance of light PAHs (less than four fused rings) for both wet and the dry seasons. Higher concentrations of PAHs were recorded during the wet season than the dry season. The study concluded that the groundwater in the communities was contaminated with light PAHs and the total PAHs in this area exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 10 mu g L-1 recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) for safety of groundwater.

IDENTIFYING THE SOURCE OF POLLUTANTS IN MALACCA RIVER USING GIS APPROACH	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The study was conducted to determine the dominant source of pollutants in Malacca River using the combined methods of water sampling and GIS approach. The study was conducted in 9 sampling stations based on Malacca River sub-basins. The result of WQI indicated that station 4 and 5 are polluted; station 8 and 9 are clean; and other stations are slightly polluted. PCA identified several pollutant sources, namely agricultural, residential, industrial, animal husbandry activities, as well as sewage treatment plants. Applied GIS technique detected several areas as hotspots pollutants sources, namely agricultural activities in station 5; residential activities in station 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7; industrial activities in station 3, 4, 5, and 7; animal husbandry in station 5 and some scatterings in station 1 to 4; as well as sewage treatment plant in moderate hotspot area between station 5 and 6, respectively. Besides the recommendation to reduce the river water pollution through the control of pollutants source, this study provides crucial information for the identification of problematic areas and spatial database of Malacca River for better understanding and management of river water quality in the future, as well as a reference for future land use and urban design development purposes.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					571	588		10.15666/aeer/1504_571588								WOS:000419994800039

APPLICATION OF CA-MARKOV MODEL AND LAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGES IN MALACCA RIVER WATERSHED, MALAYSIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Modeling the effects of past and current land use composition on surface water quality of the Malacca River watershed provides valuable information for environmental and land planning. The Land use land cover (LULC) spatio-temporal changes in watershed are classified as non-industrial area, industrial area, vegetation area, open space area, water bodies, as well as farming area. This is compared with the future spatial pattern simulated using CA-Markov model to evaluate qualitative and quantitative changes of LULC over time (between 2001, 2008, 2015, and 2029). This analysis consisted of the entire Malacca River watershed area. Changes may provide information on determinant of river water quality in future. Based on LULC monitoring and future simulation approach, the results may be used in an early warning system by demonstrating trend and consequences of changes in watershed. Continuous downward trends for vegetation area, open space area, and water bodies are due to expansion in non-industrial area, industrial area, and farming areas that increase contamination in the Malacca River. The findings demonstrate the need for more regulation in land use policy design, planning, and development for the protection of river water quality.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					605	622		10.15666/aeer/1504_605622								WOS:000419994800041

ISOTOPIC (delta C-13 AND delta N-15) VARIATIONS IN TROPICAL RIVER SEDIMENTS OF KELANTAN, MALAYSIA: A RECONNAISSANCE STUDY OF LAND USE IMPACT TO THE WATERSHED	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Intensification of sedimentation process has resulted in shallower river, thus increasing their vulnerability to natural hazards (i.e. climate change, floods). Considering the impact of soil erosion to the sedimentation, identification of the main source of erosion is critical to watershed management. Stable isotope of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) were carried out in Kelantan catchment. Results from delta C-13 showed that C-3 type plant represents as major plant (-29.10% to -23.60%) in the river. While for delta N-15, the isotopic variations demonstrate distinct pattern of dry (Southwest Monsoon, SWM) and wet (Northeast Monsoon, NEM) seasons, suggesting significant pollutants washout from terrestrial (due to agricultural activities) to the water bodies. In addition, the Kelantan river system is an autochthonous as determined by carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio. Essentially, this study will serve as a precursor of future study to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities on carbon and nitrogen cycles in tropical catchment.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					1101	1119		10.15666/aeer/1504_11011119								WOS:000419994800073

EVALUATION OF GROUNDWATER QUALITY AT COCONUT HUSK RETTING AREA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This paper evaluates the quality of the groundwater in and around a coconut husk retting area. The area selected for the study is Mondaikadu of Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India, which is very near to the coast of the Indian Ocean. Groundwater samples were collected during summer, winter and pre-monsoon season and analyzed using analytical instruments. It was observed that the groundwater quality is significantly affected by coconut husk retting process. The pH level in the groundwater was found to be unacceptable because it was below the permissible limit of 6.5 to 9.2 as per the World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). All other parameters such as Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Electrical conductivity (EC), Hardness, Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Ferrous (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Nitrate (NH3), Chloride (Cl), Fluoride (F), Sulphate (SO4) are within the limits. Low pH water was neutralized using addition of Sodium Hydroxide methods (NaoH), addition of soda ash and aeration process. Using correlation analysis, the dependent and independent variables were selected and regression analysis was conducted for these variables and the best fit regression model was created.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					1745	1756		10.15666/aeer/1504_17451756								WOS:000419994800111

Expansion of landscape characterisation methods within the Hydrogeological Landscape Framework: application in the Australian Capital Territory	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Hydrogeological Landscape (HGL) Framework is a landscape-characterisation tool that is used to discern areas of similar physical, hydrogeological, hydrological, chemical and biological properties, referred to as HGL Units. The HGL Framework facilitates prioritisation of natural-resource management investment by identifying current and potential hazards in the landscape. Within prioritised regions, on-ground management actions are tailored for specific Management Areas within individual HGL Units. The HGL Unit boundaries are determined through expert interpretation of spatial and field based datasets, such as climate, landform, geology, regolith, soil, stream network, groundwater flow systems, water quality and vegetation assemblages. The resulting HGL Units are validated by an interdisciplinary team using field assessment and biophysical testing. The use of the HGL Framework for new applications creates opportunities for refinement of the existing methodology and products for end users. This paper uses an application in the Australian Capital Territory as a case study to illustrate two enhanced techniques for the landscape characterisation component of the HGL Framework: use of an unsupervised statistical learning algorithm, Self-Organising Maps (SOM), to further validate HGL Units; and landform modelling to assist in delineation of Management Areas. The combined use of SOM and landform modelling techniques provides statistical support to the existing expert and field-based techniques, ensuring greater rigour and confidence in determination of landscape patterns. This creates a more refined HGL Framework landscape-characterisation tool, facilitating more precise hazard assessment and strategic natural-resource management by end users.

The traditional methods have their limitations to perform optimized monitoring due to factors like battery consumption, manpower, high cost, more sampling time, complex installation and delay variances. Therefore, to provide efficient monitoring, the paper has proposed the Triangular Pyramidal Topology with basic features like maximum coverage, minimum number of sensors, less battery consumption and high sustainability with no human intervention. The topology is deployed and tested at Ganges River of Sutlej in Doraha, India. The obtained consequences justify the proposed topology to be proficient, extensible and beneficial method for monitoring of river water.																	1551-9899	1552-0633					2017	39	1-4					1	35										WOS:000422730200001

This paper describes wastewater characteristic of an existing enterprise, LLC "Melita". This enterprise is a factory of a complete technology cycle, with the process starting from fur manufacture and design to implementation. Maximum capacity of the factory is 1800 skins per day, (excluding fur), and its average productivity is 1000 skins per day. Thorough examination of possible methods and schemes for wastewater from fur production purification showed that it is most reasonable to use technology schemes which included the structures of mechanical, physico-chemical and biological purification. As a result, the study provided a new technological scheme for industrial wastewater purification. This scheme offers using chloride barium and sodium hydrocarbons complex as reagents. For LLC "Melita", the wastewater absorbing pond is the Volga River. Water quality indicators are taken according to the data of the FGBU "Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring Office". The research also calculates allowable discharge rates and environmental charges in the city sewer networks and ponds.																	1755-1307						2017	90								UNSP 012041	10.1088/1755-1315/90/1/012041								WOS:000419816700041

The aims of the study are to determine the water quality and to investigate the environmental quality using the Biological Monitoring Working Party Average Score Per Taxon (BMWP-ASPT) indices. Water quality was identified using the BMWP-ASPT method. Its score was calculated based on determining the number of macroinvertebrate taxa found. The result shows that ten taxa were detected at Kalibokor drainage, i.e., seven taxa from Mollusca, one taxon from Coleoptera, one taxon from Oligochaeta, and one taxon from Crustacea. Our study indicated that the water quality at Kalibokor drainage is poor and heavily polluted. However, this result is obtained from a particular sampling point. At other sampling points, we found an average level of polluted water quality. This finding also strongly demonstrates that these indices should be adjustable based on the geomorphological and environmental features of Surabaya. Subsequent research should be performed intensively to recognize the effectiveness of the BMWP-ASPT indices for measuring water quality.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1600-0				2017	1908								UNSP 030007-1	10.1063/1.5012707								WOS:000419834600009

A phytoremediation process was carried out in a hydroponic floating system by using transparent plastic bags of 1 m in diameter and 1 m in height that were placed in collecting ponds before they were used for agricultural activities. Paddy soils were used as substrates in this system. The irrigation water was treated with nutrient enrichment (Urea and SP-36 fertilizers). Then, the system was planted with remediation actors (Azolla sp., Ipomoea aquatica, Limnocharis flava, Marsilea crenata, polyculture of those hydro macrophytes and control). The improvement of the water quality as a result of the phytoremediation process was characterized by a decline in the concentration of some physicochemical parameters, which were measured at 7 days after incubation, as well as an increase in the plankton diversity index value. The results showed that all of the hydro macrophytes used in this research, which was grown in the hydroponic batch culture system for a period of 7 days, were able to significantly improve the irrigation water quality, which was enriched by the synthetic fertilizers Urea and SP36. This was reflected by a significant decrease in the concentration of water TSS, nitrate, BOD, COD and total phosphate and an increase in the value of water DO at 7 days after incubation. Improvement of the water quality is also reflected in the increasing plankton diversity index value as a bioindicator of water pollution indicating a change in the pollution status from moderately polluted to slightly polluted at 7 days after incubation.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1600-0				2017	1908								UNSP 030003-1	10.1063/1.5012703								WOS:000419834600005

Also, the migration of CO2 through heterogeneous subsurface is very difficult to predict because small differences in material properties may result in vastly different migration patterns. Therefore, like other environmental contaminants, it is necessary to design optimized groundwater monitoring network to effectively characterize the migration of the CO2. Main objectives of this study is to construct optimized groundwater monitoring network considering hydrogeological characteristics in field-scale transport of CO2 originated from artificially-injected CO2 at the environmental impact monitoring test site in Eumseong, Korea (K-COSEM). 24 monitoring wells were installed at the site aligned with the regional groundwater flow direction. Various hydraulic tests were performed to estimate the hydraulic characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, and groundwater velocity. Groundwater monitoring network for CO2 injection and leak test constructed with regard of the heterogeneity understood through the various field tests. Three multidepth monitoring well nests each of them was composed of four monitoring well units drilled with different depths (each 18, 22, 26, 30 m deep) have been installed along the groundwater flow direction and dedicated to depth-discrete water quality monitoring in saturated zone. Additional, four multi-depth monitoring well nests each of them was composed of four unsaturated-zone monitoring well units drilled with different depths (each 5, 8, 11, 14 m deep) were also installed with a distance of 1.25 m away between saturated zone monitoring wells and were dedicated to depth-discrete gas monitoring in unsaturated zone. By these efforts, effective groundwater monitoring network for temporal and spatial CO2 leakage detection and groundwater safety management have been designed and constructed at the test site.

In addition to the natural CO2 seeps a groundwater well drilled on a farm in Bongwana encountered CO2 and now leaks. Thus the Bongwana sites provide excellent analogues for failed CO2 storage under the two primary leakage scenarios; 1) abrupt leakage through injection well failure or leakage up an abandoned well, and 2) gradual leakage, through undetected faults, fractures or wells.

Managers counteracted the detrimental effects of cultural acidification on aquatic ecosystems during the industrial era using liming to salvage biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, historical contingencies, i.e., whether lakes were naturally acidic or degraded because of acidification, were largely unknown and therefore not accounted for in management. It is uncertain whether liming outcomes had a potentially detrimental effect on naturally acidic lakes. Evidence from paleolimnological reconstructions allowed us to analyze community structure in limed acidified and naturally acidic lakes, and acidified and circumneutral references. We analyzed community structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates (littoral, sublittoral, profundal), and fish between 2000 and 2004. Naturally acidic limed lakes formed communities that were not representative of the other lake types. The occurrence of fish species relevant for ecosystem service provisioning (fisheries potential) in naturally acidic limed lakes were confounded by biogeographical factors. In addition, sustained changes in water quality were conducive to harmful algal blooms. This highlights a pathological outcome of liming lakes when their naturally acidic conditions are not accounted for. Because liming is an important social-ecological system, sustained ecological change of lakes might incur undesired costs for societies in the long term.																	1708-3087						2017	22	4							44	10.5751/ES-09794-220444								WOS:000419351000039

Historically and culturally, cenotes are also important cultural and spiritual natural sites for the Maya, but they have been contaminated and degraded. We ask the following: What are the present-day meanings, understanding, and values of cenotes for the Maya? Is it possible to adopt a cultural approach for conservation of cenotes in Yucatan? Participant observation, interviews with stakeholders, and underwater exploration in cenotes were used to obtain data. Results indicate that cenotes often retain some spiritual meaning for people but not as important cultural, spiritual, or sacred sites. Little consensus was found regarding the significance of cenotes and how best to protect them. Informants noted changes in water quality, and identified the threats to cenotes including tourism, poor solid waste management, contamination, and deficiency of interest in preservation. Lack of accurate knowledge was a problem: informants did not seem to understand that cenotes are interconnected through the groundwater system. The Yucatan case illustrates how loss of cultural values can be linked to environmental quality and resource degradation. Conversely, it can be argued that cultural revitalization in indigenous communities has the potential to bring back community-based conservation.

Adoption of an ES approach requires agency personnel to have knowledge or experience in implementing an ES approach and metrics that link potential actions to impacts on ES. We characterize the degree to which ES considerations are taken into account in setting priorities for conservation acquisitions in the U.S. state of Minnesota. We assess two core dimensions of an ES approach: (1) multiobjective targeting and (2) measuring program benefits in terms of increases in human well-being. We assess the degree to which these two dimensions occur in statute and in conservation program decision making. We find that state statute provides clear support for an ES approach in conservation funding mechanisms. However, we find that many of the programs funded through those mechanisms have more traditional habitat-centric approaches. In contrast to statutory emphasis, water quality related metrics were not prominent. We recommend expanding current prioritization systems to include a broader suite of metrics that are linked to human well-being to further mainstream ES in Minnesota. These metrics can be generated from existing data and would allow program managers to better communicate the public benefits of conservation spending.																	1708-3087						2017	22	4							4	10.5751/ES-09581-220404								WOS:000419351000009

We linked terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem process models to simulate the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrological and water quality characteristics related to ecosystem services. The linked model integrates two existing models (a forest ecosystem model and a river network model) to establish consistent responses to changing drivers across climate, terrestrial, and aquatic domains. The linked model is spatially distributed, accounts for terrestrial-aquatic and upstreamdownstream linkages, and operates on a daily time-step, all characteristics needed to understand regional responses. The model was applied to the diverse landscapes of the Upper Merrimack River watershed, New Hampshire, USA. Potential changes in future environmental functions were evaluated using statistically downscaled global climate model simulations (both a high and low emission scenario) coupled with scenarios of changing land cover (centralized vs. dispersed land development) for the time period of 1980-2099. Projections of climate, land cover, and water quality were translated into a suite of environmental indicators that represent conditions relevant to important ecosystem services and were designed to be readily understood by the public. Model projections show that climate will have a greater influence on future aquatic ecosystem services (flooding, drinking water, fish habitat, and nitrogen export) than plausible changes in land cover. Minimal changes in aquatic environmental indicators are predicted through 2050, after which the high emissions scenarios show intensifying impacts. The spatially distributed modeling approach indicates that heavily populated portions of the watershed will show the strongest responses. Management of land cover could attenuate some of the changes associated with climate change and should be considered in future planning for the region.

The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of mussel Mytilus galloprovinciallis on soluble nutrient dynamic and its effect in aqueous environment by direct observations. Two experiments were carried out in water tanks. The first one was done using water with flow, while in the second one there was no flow. Two water tanks were used: one of them was a control tank, while in the other tank, 320 mussels were placed in four net bags. Dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a concentration were declined in the presence of Mytilus galloprovinciallis; marked increases that were observed especially in the concentrations of N-NH4, P-PO4, POC were a result of nutrient regeneration via excretion of Mytilus galloprovinciallis.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12A					210	216										WOS:000419539900026

The O. mykiss muscle tissue, blood and water samples were obtained simultaneously from all stations on February 2016. For each station, fourteen physicochemical parameters were measured in water samples and water quality levels determined by YSKYY (Surface Water Quality Management Regulation) were recorded. Muscle tissue malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl (PC) levels, and grade of DNA damage in erythrocytes using comet assay were determined in 0 mykiss from three fish farms. The water's physical and chemical parameters show that based on Turkish YSKYY, the water in all stations are categorised as class II according to the Turkish YSKYY. However, based upon its nitrite and total nitrogen values, Station III was found to be less polluted than the other stations, followed by a moderate degree of pollution for Station II, and significantly higher levels or pollution for Station I. The MDA and protein carbonyl levels were significantly higher in the muscle of the O. mykiss from Station I than Station II and III (p<0.01). Fish from Station I exhibited a significantly higher DNA damage in red blood cells than Station II and Station III (p<0.01). The study concluded that nitrogen species caused by exposure to an accumulation of environmental pollutants are an important source of RNS/ROS generation within the fish's tissue. RNS/ROS-mediated oxidative stress causes DNA fragmentation, lipid oxidation, and protein dysfunction, consequently negatively contributing to the quality of fish as a source of food, and also to their welfare.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12					7105	7113										WOS:000419539700018

This study (1) estimated GPP, NEP, and R of Lake Abant using diel oxygen technique at three locations over the period of 2012 to 2014; and (2) built empirical models to predict temporal changes in GPP, NEP, and R. To estimate the lake metabolism components, dissolved oxygen concentration (DO, mg L-1), saturated dissolved oxygen value (O-2sat, %), and water temperature (T-w, degrees C) were continuously measured using in situ water quality monitoring probes, while solar radiation (SR, W m(-2)) and wind speed (WS, m s(-1)) were monitored using a meteorological station set up by the lake. Lake Abant was found to be of a net heterotrophic character (GPP/R < 1 and NEP < 0) for 2012, 2013 and 2014. Also, temporal GPP and R dynamics were modelled and validated on a monthly basis.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12					7114	7121										WOS:000419539700019

For this purpose, the study was conducted in the Istranca Stream, which is draining into the Lake Durusu in Istanbul city, from March 2012 to June 2013, monthly. The sampling surveys were carried out at six stations on the stream, and fish samples were collected from the stations by electro-fishing. Water samples for water quality (NO2-N, NO3-N, SiO2, PO4-P, TP, Fe, SO4 ) and chlorophyll a analyses were taken simultaneously with fish sampling from the stations. At each sampling station, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity (EC) and water temperature were measured in situ with a portable digital multiparametric analyzer. Water depth, stream width, flow rate and weather temperature were also recorded in situ. To assess the relationships between the biotic variables (fish assemblages and chl-a) and the environmental variables, redundancy analysis (RDA) was employed to explore possible patterns. During the study, a total of 20 taxa belonging to 4 families were captured from the Istranca Stream. Rhodeus amarus (Bloch, 1782) (24%), Squalius cephalus (Linnaeus, 1758) (16%) and Gobio bulgaricus Drensky, 1926 (13%) were determined as the most abundant fish species in the stream. RDA analysis explained 68% of the variation between biotic and environmental variables. Statistical analyses indicated that fish assemblages of the stream highly associated with the environmental variables; flow rate, conductivity and water temperature were the most influential.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	12					7150	7159										WOS:000419539700024

Zn (II) Removal from River Water Samples of Sembrong, Johor State, Malaysia by Electrokinetic Remediation	INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH AND INNOVATION SUMMIT (IRIS2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				International Research and Innovation Summit (IRIS)	MAY 06-07, 2017	Melaka, MALAYSIA	Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia				Heavy metals pollution has become one of the most serious environmental problems today. The treatment of heavy metals is of special concern due to their recalcitrance and persistence in the environment. Even many physical, chemical and biological treatment processes have been proposed to remove heavy metals from river water, the use of these treatment processes are not efficient and relatively costly. This study focused on the potential application of electrokinetic (EK) remediation in Sembrong River water to remove zinc (Zn2+). The physicochemical and biological parameters and water quality index (WQI) of Sembrong River water was characterized. The electrokinetic remediation experiments were performed by controlling pH, and electric density on voltage were observed and investigated. The results indicated that all physicochemical and biological parameters of Sembrong River complied with the standard discharged limit set by the Department of Environment (DOE). However, suspended solids (SS) and pH can be categorized as Class III according to INWQS. The best performance of 88% efficiency of zinc can be achieved EK experiment run at a fixed voltage of 30 V at pH 5.14 after 60 min of the process operate. This technology may be proposed for faster and eco-friendly removal of heavy metals in the environment.																	1757-8981						2017	226								UNSP 012072	10.1088/1757-899X/226/1/012072								WOS:000419293900072

Monthly sampling was conducted for a period of 24 months between January 2012 and December 2013. Nine parameters were evaluated: pH, T (degrees C), Turbidity (NTU), Al, Fe, Cu, Mn, Al-2(SO4)(3) and CaO. Indexing approaches have been applied by calculating the Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI) and Metal Index (MI) for the assessment of influence of heavy metals on the overall quality of water. The obtained results for heavy metals are in good agreement with World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Though the aluminum concentration remains in the limits set by WHO, yet it shows a major contribution in the indices. This has been verified by the statistical analysis which demonstrates fair correlations between aluminum, HPI (r = 0.9) and MI (r = 0.77). Aluminum showed the important influence of seasonal change in the year as well as the doses of reagents injected during the treatment process on the concentration of aluminum is detailed.																	1582-540X						2017	18	3					319	328										WOS:000419642100008

Effect of Water Bicarbonate Concentration, pH and the Presence, or Not, of a Nitrification Inhibitor in the Nitrification Process	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												Ammonium (NH4+) is an important nitrogen (N) source for plant growth. Nevertheless, NH4+-N can be oxidized to nitrate (NO3-) by nitrification and then nitrate and nitrite can be leached into groundwater. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of the water bicarbonate concentration, pH, and the presence, or not, of a nitrification inhibitor, on the nitrification process. Six treatments were established, changing the pH and the bicarbonate concentration, with or without the nitrification inhibitor. The results showed that an active nitrification process occurred in treatments with high pHs (8 and 7) and with no nitrification inhibitors. This causes an increase in the nitrate and nitrite concentration in the substrate. The use of N-NH4+ fertilizers joint to a nitrification inhibitor, especially in nutritive solutions with a high concentration of bicarbonate and a pH of 8 and 7, decreases nitrate and nitrite accumulation in substrate which can prevent nitrate and nitrite leaching.

The submontane catchment of the stream, with area of 94.40 m(2) is situated in the Malopolska province. The stream catchment area is covered mainly by agricultural lands (68.3%) and to a lesser degree by forests (25.5%), built-up and urbanized areas (6.2) located along the banks of the Jasienianka and its tributaries. The investigations were conducted in 2014. 21 selected physicochemical indices were determined in the stream water at five control-measurement points situated along the 13 km long stream reach. Along the analyzed stream section, only the water temperature, dissolved oxygen, BOD5 and N-NH4+ allowed to classify the waters to quality class I (maximum potential), whereas ChZT-Mn, EC, SO42-, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, water pH and P-PO43- did not fulfill the requirements for class II. The other indices, in compliance with the Minister of Environment Regulation of 2016, classified water to quality class II. Statistical analysis conducted using Kruskal-Wallis test revealed statistically significant differences in the indices values between the investigated measurement-control points for SO42-, Mg2+, K+, N-NO3- and PO43-. The assessment of water usable values revealed that it may be used for supply of water intended for human consumption only in the upper and middle reach. The Jasienianka did not meet the requirements for a natural habitat salmonid fish along its whole length because of high NO2- concentrations.

Some microalgae such as Arthrospira platensis, are rich in antioxidant substances and also have the capacity to remove toxics compounds from the water in aquaculture systems. The trial consisted in two treatements by triplicate, where the inclusion of filtered microalgae A. platensis as feed supplementation during production of juvenile Litopenaeus vannamei, was assessed. The experimental desing was based on a static system with six 250-L tanks with marine water (30 PSU), stocked 105 shirmps (300 shrimp m(-2)) with an average wheight of 0,7 +/- 0,2 g. At the end of the fed trial (42 days), the zootechnical and immunological parameters of shrimps were evaluated. Significatives differences among the treatments were found for both parameters. Shrimps that received supplementation of microalgae A. platensis showed higher growth and better response of the immune system. Thus, these results allow to conclude that the supplementation of filtered microalgae A. platensis improve growth and immunological parameters of white shrimp L. vannamei.

To control these plants CONAMA discuss for the use of chemicals, but feasibility and safety studies should be conducted to allow the use for such purpose. Thus the present study evaluated the effects of decomposition Egeria densa killed by the herbicide diquat on water quality variables and physiological responses of Nile tilapia. Thus, 176 tilapia was distributed in 16 tanks and submitted to four treatments (tilapia without macrophyte; tilapia and macrophyte; tilapia and macrophytes died by diquat and macrophytes died by freezing). The values of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity and conductivity did not differ between treatments. However, it observed an increase in total ammonia and phosphorus and reduction of nitrite concentrations in treatment with macrophyte killed by the herbicide. Chlorophyll-a concentration did not differ between treatments, however, phaeophytin-a increased in water submitted to plants died by freezing. After 21 days of experiment, no differences were observed in blood glucose, cortisol, leukocytes, erythrocytes and hemoglobin. Thus, tilapia does not alter their physiological patterns after chronic exposure to decomposing macrophytes killed by diquat.

The flow variation is a function of time and the precipitation shows a resemblance characterized by curves generally affected by certain peaks. The followed hydrochemical of the five source showed the same chemical facies which is calcic to magnesian bicarbonated with predominance of the first facies; except the source of Ain Sari is composed of calcic chlorinated. The evolution of the contents of the chemical elements is due to the increase in the flow of the sources after the period of flood which demonstrates the effect of the behavior of the karst area.

This last represents a real source of environmental pollution. This study aims to identify this pollution and its risks. Therefore, physico-chemical analyses were performed on leachates and water of the plain, which is located in the downstream of the landfill representing a direct relation with a highly sensitive ecosystem of the Fetzara Lake. A sampling campaign and analysis (pH, Eh, T, EC, major ions, heavy metals) were performed on all points (wells, boreholes and leachates). The mapping of hydrochemical elements allows the understanding of the pollution mechanisms and their origins. The use of LWPI as a tool for identifying hazards show that the leachate have a significant impact on water quality of the study area. A diagnosis of risks on public health has been achieved using the RI as hazard index. Results indicates few scenarios of water uses and show the significant influence of the old landfill site on the quality of water and the degradation of people's lives. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The solar still is one such method that has received notable revived attention recently. Research primarily focused on enhancing the productivity of the still with a very limited number of studies addressing the water quality issue of the distillate produced by the still, as it is often assumed that this distillate is safe to consume without proper analysis. In addition a very limited number of studies have examined the ability of the still to remove conventional and emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals. The objective of this paper is to address the bacteriological and chemical aspects of the distillate produced from a number of different water sources using several experimental setups. Results show that moderate temperature alone is not sufficient to kill bacteria hence the importance of ultra-violet light from solar radiation. It is also important that all parts of the still be accessible to sunlight to avoid bacterial breeding at shaded sections. Chemical quality parameters were found to be within the limits recommended by WHO standards for potable water. As for the pharmaceuticals considered, all three compounds that were spiked into the feed water were completely absent from the distillate, however, degradation products were found in the brine. The level of pharmaceutical degradation was influenced by the solar still configuration. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This was followed by polyculture of carp with tilapias, grey mullet, and planktivorous carp. Scientific research on polyculture started in the 1950s and has since contributed to the global science and practice of green water aquaculture, especially with novel polyculture approaches and concepts. Today, the industry is characterized by intensive freshwater polyculture, implemented in earthen fish ponds and reservoirs. In the Mediterranean coastal plain, fresh, brackish, and marine water polyculture is carried out in semi-intensive fishponds. Polyculture in Israel is an entrepreneurial activity that combines ecological principles of Chinese polyculture with local technologies and objectives. The Biofloc approach (active suspension ponds, ASP), periphyton, and aquaponics, were developed in the 1980s in response to rising public and policymakers` concerns and regulations on land use, pollution, use of chemicals, and organic manures. R&D on marine integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems began in the early 1970s at the National Center for Mariculture (NCM) in Eilat. It started with sea bream and mullet in earthen seawater ponds, whose plankton-rich water recirculated through bivalve and macroalgae biofiltration modules. An advanced form of the concept was deployed in the early 1980s and was studied in detail using nutrient budgets. Several system models with fish, bivalves, and algae, on small and pilot scales, were studied and quantified. Abalone, sea urchins, shrimp, brine shrimp, Salicornia, and periphyton, were added to the Eilat marine IMTA models, beginning in the 1990s. Upon entering the third millennium, Israeli research further examined the relationship between the sustainability and economics of IMTA in world aquaculture.																	0792-156X						2017	69								1385									WOS:000419385200001

Growth performance generally decreased and feed utilization increased with decreasing ration levels, while no significant differences were observed with small sized turbot fed to 80%, 90%, 100% levels of satiation, and with large sized turbot fed to 90% & 100% levels of satiation. There was no increase in size heterogeneity with decreasing ration levels. Ration levels significantly influenced water quality. There were no significant differences in growth and feed efficiency among turbot fed with different feeding frequencies. Feeding small size turbot once a day and large size turbot once every other day at a ration level of 80% satiation is suggested for better feed utilization and less waste output.																	0792-156X						2017	69								1416									WOS:000419388800002

Every sediment transport model application is different both in terms of time and space scale, study objectives, required accuracy, allocated resources, background of the study team etc. For sediment transport modelling, it is necessary to know the characteristics of the sediment in the river bed. Therefore, it is recommended to collect a number of bed sediment grap samples. These samples should be analysing in terms of grain size distribution. To solve theoretical problems of movement of water in the river Mehadica, it requires modelling of water flow in this case. Numerical modelling was performed using the program MIKE11. MIKE 11 is a user-friendly, fully dynamic, one-dimensional modelling tool for the detailed analysis, design, management and operation of both simple and complex river and channel systems. With its exceptional flexibility, speed and user friendly environment, MIKE 11 provides a complete and effective design environment for engineering, water resources, water quality management and planning applications. The Hydrodynamic (HD) module is the nucleus of the MIKE 11 modelling system and forms the basis for most modules including Flood Forecasting, Advection-Dispersion, Water Quality and Non-cohesive sediment transport modules. The MIKE 11 HD module solves the vertically integrated equations for the conservation of mass and momentum, i.e. the Saint-Venant equations. The input data are: area plan with location of cross sections; cross sections topographical data and roughness of river bed; flood discharge hydrograph. Advanced computational modules are included for description of flow over hydraulic structures, including possibilities to describe structure operation.																	1757-8981						2017	245								UNSP 032030	10.1088/1757-899X/245/3/032030								WOS:000419056401029

Concentration of these pollutants and the water quality highlights the importance of treatment process in grey water systems. Treatment technologies operating under low energy and maintenance are usually preferred, since they are more cost effective for users. Treatment technologies based on natural processes represent an example of such technology including vegetated wall. Main aim of this paper is to introduce the proposal of vegetated wall managing grey water and brief characteristic of proposed system. Is expected that prepared experiment will establish the purifying ability and the potential of green wall application as an efficient treatment technology.																	1757-8981						2017	245								UNSP 072049	10.1088/1757-899X/245/7/072049								WOS:000419056404078

Study Case - Crasna River Basin	WORLD MULTIDISCIPLINARY CIVIL ENGINEERING-ARCHITECTURE-URBAN PLANNING SYMPOSIUM - WMCAUS	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				World Multidisciplinary Civil Engineering-Architecture-Urban Planning Symposium (WMCAUS)	JUN 12-16, 2017	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					Hydrographical basins are important from hydrological, economic and ecological points of view. They receive and channel the runoff from rainfall and snowmelt which, when adequate managed, can provide fresh water necessary for water supply, irrigation, food industry, animal husbandry, hydrotechnical arrangements and recreation. Hydrographical basin planning and management follows the efficient use of available water resources in order to satisfy environmental, economic and social necessities and constraints. This can be facilitated by a decision support system that links hydrological, meteorological, engineering, water quality, agriculture, environmental, and other information in an integrated framework. In the last few decades different modelling tools for resolving problems regarding water quantity and quality were developed, respectively water resources management. Watershed models have been developed to the understanding of water cycle and pollution dynamics, and used to evaluate the impacts of hydrotechnical arrangements and land use management options on water quantity, quality, mitigation measures and possible global changes. Models have been used for planning monitoring network and to develop plans for intervention in case of hydrological disasters: floods, flash floods, drought and pollution. MIKE HYDRO Basin is a multi-purpose, map-centric decision support tool for integrated hydrographical basin analysis, planning and management. MIKE HYDRO Basin is designed for analyzing water sharing issues at international, national and local hydrographical basin level. MIKE HYDRO Basin uses a simplified mathematical representation of the hydrographical basin including the configuration of river and reservoir systems, catchment hydrology and existing and potential water user schemes with their various demands including a rigorous irrigation scheme module. This paper analyzes the importance and principles of integrated hydrographical basin management and develop a case study for Crasna river basin, with the use of MIKE HYDRO Basin advanced hydroinformatic tool for integrated hydrographical basin analysis, planning and management.

Experimental design followed a complete randomized distribution, with five treatments and six replicates. The treatments are equivalent to crude protein levels, dry matter basis, in the diet: 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 g kg(-1). Experimental units were into a recirculation system with mechanical and biological filter to keep the water quality within the suitable range for prawn culture. At the end of the trial mean prawn survival ranged from 84.8 to 91.3 % without significant differences among treatments (p > 0.05). Results show a quadratic growth for final weight, weight gain, final length and length growth, with the increase of crude protein levels in the diet. Prawn fed diets with 370 and 348 g kg(-1) achieved significant higher weight gain and length growth, respectively (p < 0.05). The body composition of amazon prawns was influenced by crude protein levels in the diet, in which the level of 350 g kg(-1) caused an increase in moisture content and reduction in crude protein deposition (p < 0.05) compared to the level of 200 g kg(-1). The recommended crude protein level in the diet of M. amazonicum juveniles is 370 g kg(-1).																	0046-9939	1678-2305					2017	43	3					417	425		10.20950/1678-2305.2017v43n3p417								WOS:000419191900010

Relatively little research, however, has empirically examined the influence of people's attitudes toward a place on their willingness to pay for environmental protection. Using the example of a payment for ecosystem services (PES) initiative in the McKenzie River watershed, Oregon, USA, we found that place attitudes were a significant predictor of respondents' willingness to pay for a program designed to benefit drinking water quality. These results suggest that connecting conservation actions to landscapes that are meaningful to people may increase their financial support for PES and other conservation programs. While program managers have little or no influence over stakeholders' political ideology, gender, or income, managers may be able to influence prospective PES buyers' awareness and attitudes through targeted communications, thereby potentially increasing support for place-based conservation efforts.

A Comparison of Awareness, Attitudes, and Usage of Water Quality Conservation Practices Between Amish and Non-Amish Farmers	SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES												This study provides a unique examination of Amish farmers' awareness of water quality issues and their attitudes toward and use of agricultural conservation practices compared with small non-Amish farmers in Northeastern Indiana. There is minimal research about the conservation beliefs and behaviors of this growing and highly diverse ethnoreligious minority, who have faith-based technological restrictions and are often hesitant to work with community outsiders, especially the government. We find that, compared with non-Amish farmers, Amish farmers have limited awareness of the linkages between common agricultural practices and broader water quality problems and lower levels of adoption of conservation practices, with the exception of cover crops. This information is essential for conservation practitioners who need to work with a diverse range of agricultural producers to increase the uptake of conservation practices that address critical water quality concerns.																	0894-1920	1521-0723					2017	30	12					1476	1490		10.1080/08941920.2017.1364457								WOS:000419335300004

Simpler models may be favored due to limited observational data, uncertainty in the complex model predictions, and intent of using a model as a component of a multimedia or multicompartmental model. Decision-making often relies on simple models. Model simplification can be useful in understanding the behavior of complex models.

Groundwater status in Pakistan: A review of contamination, health risks, and potential needs	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												We examined the current groundwater (used for drinking) quality in Pakistan after implementation of Millennium Development Goals, including contaminants, their sources, and relevant health impacts. The drinking water quality parameters of most of the reported results exceeded the guidelines suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS). Natural sources of groundwater contamination have been activated due to anthropogenic activities like mining, and open dumping of industrial and domestic wastes which lead to poor groundwater quality. Globally, 780 million people, and 100 million people in Pakistan are exposed to unsafe water sources. Therefore, this review demonstrates the potential needs to achieve the safe drinking water goal of the Agenda 2030. The development of a proper monitoring network, installation of treatment plants, and implementation of legislations are recommended in this review.

Combined with stricter water regulations this development has already and will continue to pose higher demands on water treatment technologies and their efficiencies. Activated carbon adsorption has been successfully applied to remove a broad range of dissolved molecules in various applications while porous membrane processes are typically applied to retain suspended particles. The combination of both processes promises superior product water quality and improved process stability. However, improved process performance and water quality is not a given for all combinations of adsorption and porous membrane filtration but rather depending on a variety of different influencing factors. This review provides a comprehensive overview on these influencing factors by careful analysis of the available literature, covering aspects from adsorption mechanisms and membrane fouling phenomena over differences in process configurations as well as water composition. Thereby, the review aims to broaden the knowledge and understanding of the process combination with respect to optimal process configuration and long term operation for best process performance and further contribution towards the technical realization of the process combination for other treatment tasks.																	1064-3389	1547-6537					2017	47	19					1783	1835		10.1080/10643389.2017.1382260								WOS:000419157200001

Assessing the potential zone of groundwater recharge is extremely crucial for the protection of water quality and the management of groundwater systems. To identify the groundwater potential zone in the study area, thematic layers of lithology, slope, karst degrees, land cover, lineament and drainage density were generated using topographic maps, thematic maps, field data and satellite image, and were prepared, classified, weighted and integrated in a geographic information system (GIS) environment by the means of fuzzy logic. The fuzzy membership values have been assigned to different thematic layers according to their classification on respect for their contribution and their occurrence in groundwater. Based on the generated groundwater potential map, it was found that about 8% of the investigation area was categorized as very high potential for groundwater recharge, 31% as high, 28% as moderate, 17% as low and 16% as very low potential for groundwater recharge. Finally, the results were verified using well-yield data. The highest recharge potential area is located towards the downstream regions related to more fractured and karstified limestone.																	1947-5705	1947-5713					2017	8	2					194	206		10.1080/19475705.2016.1181676								WOS:000418899200003

Enhancing fish productivity through pen culture: a case study in Sareni wetland of Uttar Pradesh	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												Pen culture for in situ raising of stocking material was conducted in Sareni Jheel, located in the Rae Bareli District of Uttar Pradesh. Sareni Jheel, being rich in organic carbon (4.5%) and nutrients, higher values of silt (29%) and clay (15%) were recorded. Rich oxygen levels, alkaline pH, high organic matter, moderate to high chemical parameters suggested moderately productive nature of this wetland. Pen with high-density polyethylene (HDPE) net was installed in an area of 0.1378 ha and stocked with advanced fry of the Indian major carps, rohu Labeo rohita and catla Catla catla in the ratio of 1:1 @ 25 nos. m(-2). No significant changes in water quality parameters were noticed within and outside the installed pen. Mean weight at stocking of rohu and catla was 2.88 +/- 1.41 g and 2.1 +/- 1.16 g, which increased to 57.2 +/- 13.84 g and 67.38 +/- 25.79 g respectively, in 120 days. The average feed conversion ratio (FCR) recorded was 1.08 with overall survivability of 69.52% in rohu and 74.74% in catla. Benefit-cost ratio and return on investment were calculated as 1.69 and 0.69, respectively.

Evaluation of different probiotic strains for growth performance and immunomodulation in Pacific white shrimp Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												The use of antibiotics in aquaculture can prevent certain diseases, however, its use is highly restricted due to several environmental and human health problems like development of antibacterial resistance. Probiotics are widely used for improving production of aquatic animals by means of improving water quality as well as by nutritional and immune modulation in animals thus, helping in preventing diseases. The present study was aimed to evaluate different strains of probiotics viz., a commercial probiotic, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus sp., Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces boulardii on the growth, microbial load and immunomodulatory performance of the Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei. Seven probiotic feeds each containing 5 x 10(9) CFU ml(-1) of respective probiotics kg(-1) of feed were prepared by top coating on a pellet feed containing 35% protein and duration of the experiment was 75 days. All of the 6 selected strains of probiotics except the commercial one influenced the growth significantly when fed to the shrimp, compared to control group. Specific growth rate (SGR), average daily growth (ADG) and survival rate were observed to be higher in probiotic fed groups. Maximum growth was recorded in S. cerevisiae fed groups (8.05 +/- 0.21 g), followed by B. subtilis (7.65 +/- 0.21 g), while the control animals showed an average growth of 4.85 +/- 0.49 g with percentage improvement in the range of 50-95% when compared to all other treatments. Total heterotrophic count significantly (p<0.05) increased in the rearing water of B. subtilis treated group (8.995 +/- 0.021 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1)) when compared to that of control (5.475 +/- 0.003 X 103 cfu ml-1) and total vibrio load was greatly reduced in B. subtilis (1.42 +/- 0.04 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1)) and S. cerevisiae (1.47 +/- 0.01 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1)) treated water compared to control (4.265 +/- 0.06 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1)). Non-specific immunity in terms of total haemocyte count (THC) was found to be significantly (p<0.05) higher in B. subtilis (12.4 +/- 0.8 106 cells ml(-1)) treated group while higher (p<0.05) prophenoloxidase (pro PO) activity was recorded in S. cerevisiae (0.132 +/- 0.001 units min(-1) mg protein(-1)) and B. subtilis (0.130 +/- 0.002 units min(-1) mg protein(-1)) treated groups.

One hundred coastal women beneficiaries from coastal districts of Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Cuddalore and Nagapattinam were selected for the study. Descriptive statistics and SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis were used to examine the data. Results of the study revealed that gender, age and community of the respondents had influence over the access to different sets of resources and livelihood assets. Drudgery of women increased after migration of men to urban areas in search of job. It is understood that livelihood patterns of women have changed considerably. Strengths expressed were knowledge, leadership qualities, self confidence and group cohesiveness, while the weaknesses identified were lack of knowledge, lack of technical knowledge, male migration, social taboos and beliefs as well as poor health status. The opportunities were government institutional support as well as research organisation support The threats identified were unusual rainfall, floods, cyclone and change in water quality. It is understood that women need access to training, credit and skills-development programmes to ensure their full participation in climate change initiatives. Participation of women in negotiations, policy actions and initiatives towards environmental change will help governments and coastal communities to maintain and build adaptive measures towards the effects of climate driven environmental changes in the coastal villages.																	0970-6011						2017	64				SI		153	159		10.21077/ijf.2017.64.special-issue.76247-21								WOS:000419095900021

A total of 71 ornamental fish enterprises were surveyed. Ornamental fish industry of Ratnagiri District was dominated by men and majority of them belong to one religion. The ornamental fish enterprises was found to be the primary source of livelihood for these people. Maximum units were established in less than 0.01 ha land. The retail shops were small with an area of 10-20 sq. m. The major items of non-recurring expenditure were tanks, water supply and electrical items, water treatment equipments, building for housing the tanks, water quality parameter analysis equipments, aerators, blowers and hosing for aquarium tanks. Major items of recurring expenditure were dry feed, electricity charges and communication charges. Goldfish and angelfish were the most preferred groups due to the demand in market. Monsoon crops were mostly taken by ornamental breeding and rearing units. Dry feed was commonly used by the enterprise for feeding and salt as chemical for treating fish while oxytetracycline was the common antibiotic used by ornamental fish entrepreneurs. The maximum breeding and rearing unit holders were those who got trained as beneficiaries of the Rainbow Revolution Scheme (RRS) of the Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA).																	0970-6011						2017	64				SI		172	178		10.21077/ijf.2017.64.special-issue.76251-24								WOS:000419095900024

Fuji	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI												To elucidate geochemical characteristics of groundwater and sources of dissolved ions in groundwater at the southern slope and the base of Mt. Fuji, central Japan, in 2011 and 2012, dissolved ions in 199 samples of both well water or spring water from the study region and 12 monthly precipitation samples at each of four elevations were collected and analyzed. Most of the groundwater was of the Ca-HCO3 type. The study region was divided from the near summit to the base of the mountain into four areas based on water quality, topography, geology, and land use at the watershed. The concentration of chlorine ion (Cl-) in the groundwater and precipitation tended to decrease with elevation, and the Na+/Cl- ratio in the precipitation (0.56 on average) was close to that of seawater (0.56) at all sites. The atmosphere-derived fractions of major cations in the groundwater, which were estimated by assuming that all Cl- was derived from sea salt in the atmosphere, were in ascending order: Ca (average 0.05), Mg (0.08), K (0.28), and Na (0.29). The concentrations of PO43- and F- and the cation: Cl- ratios of all cations were high in the groundwater in the eastern area, where the surface geology consists of Gotemba mud flow sediments, which are composed of volcanic materials of the Old Fuji period. These results indicate that groundwater quality is strongly affected by the basaltic materials composing Mt. Fuji, which are enriched with Ca and Mg, and are susceptible to chemical weathering, but differs between aquifers in volcanic rocks of the Old Fuji period (about 100 ka) and those in rocks of the New Fuji period (after about 10 ka). In the southwestern and southeastern areas, the groundwater was characterized by a high concentration of NO3-. Because tea plantations are distributed at upper elevations in these areas, we inferred the major source of nitrogen in the water to be fertilizer. Moreover, spring water was enriched more with NO3- than well water collected at similar elevations, suggesting that the recharge area of well water is at a higher elevation than the spring water recharge area.																	0022-135X	1884-0884					2017	126	1			SI		43	71		10.5026/jgeography.126.43								WOS:000418719200005

One of the options is the use of sensor networks based on fixed installations and moving platforms (coastal boats, supply-, cargo-, and passenger vessels). Such network allows to gather environmental data in time and space with direct links to operational activities in the controlled area for further environmental risk assessment. Among many remote sensing techniques the LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) based on Light Induced Fluorescence (LIF) is the tool of direct assessment of water quality variations caused by chemical pollution, colored dissolved organic matter, and phytoplankton composition. The Hyperspectral LIF (HLIF) LiDAR acquires comprehensive LIF spectra and analyses them by spectral pattern recognition technique to detect and classify the substances in water remotely. Combined use of HLIF LiDARs with Real-Time Data Management System (RTDMS) provides the economically effective solution for the regular monitoring in the controlled area. OCEAN VISUALS in cooperation with LDI INNOVATION has developed Oil in Water Locator (OWL (TM)) with RTDMS (OWL MAP (TM)) based on HLIF LiDAR technique. This is a novel technical solution for monitoring of marine environment providing continuous unattended operations. OWLTM has been extensively tested on board of various vessels in the North Sea, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea, Baltic Sea and Caribbean Sea. This paper describes the technology features, the results of its operational use in 2014-2017, and outlook for the technology development.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 1042202	10.1117/12.2278355								WOS:000418795400001

Collection and Corrections of Oblique Multiangle Hyperspectral Bidirectional Reflectance Imagery of the Water Surface	REMOTE SENSING OF THE OCEAN, SEA ICE, COASTAL WATERS, AND LARGE WATER REGIONS 2017	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions	SEP 11-12, 2017	Warsaw, POLAND	SPIE				Hyperspectral images of coastal waters in urbanized regions were collected from fixed platform locations. Surf zone imagery, images of shallow bays, lagoons and coastal waters are processed to produce bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) signatures corrected for changing viewing angles. Angular changes as a function of pixel location within a scene are used to estimate changes in pixel size and ground sampling areas. Diffuse calibration targets collected simultaneously from within the image scene provides the necessary information for calculating BRF signatures of the water surface and shorelines. Automated scanning using a pushbroom hyperspectral sensor allows imagery to be collected on the order of one minute or less for different regions of interest. Imagery is then rectified and georeferenced using ground control points within nadir viewing multispectral imagery via image to image registration techniques. This paper demonstrates the above as well as presenting how spectra can be extracted along different directions in the imagery. The extraction of BRF spectra along track lines allows the application of derivative reflectance spectroscopy for estimating chlorophyll-a, dissolved organic matter and suspended matter concentrations at or near the water surface. Imagery is presented demonstrating the techniques to identify subsurface features and targets within the littoral and surf zones.																	0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-1309-6; 978-1-5106-1308-9				2017	10422								UNSP 1042209	10.1117/12.2277088								WOS:000418795400006

The waste water which containing some of cellulose, lignin and semi fiber is very difficult to be used in the production of cellulose. The condensed water is a kind of harmful wastewater that containing a large amount of volatile acid, furfural and volatile phenol in the production process. The water quality analysis and treatment method of cellulosic ethanol wastewater were carried out. The removal mechanism of white-rot fungi on cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, and the removal effect of and the effect of residence time and pH value on the removal of COD and the change of lignin content in the treatment of wastewater were introduced. And the removal mechanism of rumen microorganism was introduced, and the degradation of cellulose and the inhibition of the degradation of and the relationship between the changes of COD and the biogas production were also tested in real time. After two kinds of different methods of biological treatment wastewater, in order to carry out the analysis and comparison, it is concluded that the degradation law of microbial treatment of wastewater in the production process of cellulosic ethanol wastewater can provide guidance for industrial wastewater treatment.																	2278-4535					JAN	2017	12				SI		111	120										WOS:000418956400017

Domestic Water Quality and Sanitation in Panglao Island, Bohol, Philippines	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												A study on water quailty and sanitation is conducted in an urban poor district in Panglao Island, Bohol Province, Philippines. Groundwater is the main domestic water source in the resort Island, where open dug wells and piped-water from deep wells supply the domestic needs of most households. But municipal reports show that from 2000-2003, diarrhea was among the top 10 leading causes of morbidity in the municipality. Household surveys, focused group discussions, infrastructure inspection, and initial field tests showed water quality concerns in the area which include saltwater intrusion and fecal contamination, among others. The aquifer is found to have high level of chlorides (i.e., 990 to 8,550 mg/L and 387 to 8,337 mg/L during wet and dry seasons, respectively) which exceeds WHO threshold value of 250 mg/L. Water sources (wells) in the island are also contaminated in both seasons where 24 out of 26 wells are positive for fecal Conform. Thus, long term solutions for Panglao Island are necessary to safeguard the health of water users in the island resort. One option is water connection to Bohol mainland and installing a sewerage network with centralized treatment.																	0119-1144						2017	20	2					95	109										WOS:000418728500011

E. coli is a faecal indicator microorganism. Climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, influence E. coli concentrations in surface and drinking water resources. We measure and statistically analyse E. coli concentrations in drinking and surface water in the Kabul River Basin. E. coli concentrations are very high in the basin. Drinking and bathing water standards are violated. Water temperature, surface air temperature, discharge and precipitation were positively correlated with E. coli concentrations. Precipitation induced runoff transports of E. coli from agricultural lands to Kabul River and high temperature coincides with high precipitation and discharge. A linear regression model was developed to assess the net effect of the climate variables on E. coli concentrations. We found that climate variables accounted for more than half of the observed variation in E. coli concentrations in surface (R-2 = 0.61) and drinking water (R-2 = 0.55). This study indicates that increased precipitation together with higher surface air temperature, as expected in this region with climate change, were significantly correlated with increased E. coli concentrations in the future. Waterborne pathogens are expected to respond similarly to hydro-climatic changes, indicating that disease outbreaks could well become more frequent and severe.

Ecological and geographical characteristics of algal communities on gastropod shells of the river Uzh	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												Freshwater molluscs serve as test objects in the ecological monitoring of the environment, because they are able to extract in indicator quantity from the environment and accumulate in their bodies radionuclides, various macro- and micronutrients, toxic substances of inorganic and organic origin, and so on. The gastropods are a taxonomically diverse, ecologically plastic and rather widespread group of aquatic organisms, whose role in the life of freshwater ecosystems is very important. Molluscs often have various interactions in biogeocenoses that determines their trophic net. As a rule, these interactions occur in the form of ectocommensalism, endocommensalism, supercrescence, predation or parasitism. The latter type of interaction is the subject of many studies, but the epibionts of gastropods and bivalves are practically not studied and that causes the relevance of the research. Species composition of algal epibionts identifies specific sensitivity to the effects of certain environmental factors and reflects the processes occurring in water bodies of its ecosystem. This determines their efficient use for analyzing changes of water bodies, particularly in terms of complex anthropogenic pressure on aquatic ecosystems, as aquatic habitat. The aim of the research was to determine the ecological characteristics of algal communities on gastropod shells: Lymnaea stagnalis, L. auricularia and Viviparus viviparus (the Uzh river, Korosten district, Zhytomyr region). Identified microalgae communities were grouped and studied according to such indices as: confinedness to the habitat (substrate), temperature, fluidity and water oxygenating, saprobiological characteristics according to the Pantle-Buck system in the modification of Sladecek and Watanabe, salinity according to Kolbe's system, pH at Hustedt scale in the interpretation of M. M. Davydova and geographical confinedness of objects of study. Algae fouling on shells L. stagnalis, L. auricularia and V. viviparous are formed by benthic and benthic-planktonic species. Algal epibionts of studied communities are mainly confined to slowflowing waters. The basis of a floristic list according to the temperature in all studied groups of gastropods formed indifferent species. According to geographical distribution of algae fouling cosmopolitan species dominated. In relation to salinity according to Kolbe's system, most discovered species were indifferent oligo-galob. Algal communities are reliable indicators of one of the important indices of watercourse hydrochemical conditions - pH of water. Analysis of algal epibionts on gastropod shells of the river Uzh, showed the dominance of alkaliphiles and indifferent species (from the number of identified microalgae). According to saprobiological characteristic of water quality of the river Uzh predominance of o-saprobes. Analysis of indicator groups showed that the most numerous algal epibionts on shells were euresaprobe species. A detailed ecological and geographical characteristic of algae fouling on shells of studied groups of molluscs allows to predict the state of hydrocenose, that is an important aspect of monitoring and requires further research to model the influence of anthropogenic factors on the state of waters.																	2310-0842	2312-301X					2017	25	3					186	190		10.15421/011728								WOS:000418538000004

WATER QUALITY INDEX MONITORING FOR SHRIMP AQUACULTURE USING OPEN SOURCE HARDWARE AND FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEMS	BIOTECNIA												Precision aquaculture is a new tool developed in the field of information technology (IT) that allows the farmers having a better control of the farm processes, facilitate the decisions making, and improve the efficiency of the activity. The development of systems for continuous monitoring are important to aquaculture crops since these can detect unwanted conditions that can be harmful for organisms. In this study, are valued open hardware and artificial intelligence as alternative platforms to develop new monitoring systems. The proposed system automatically records the physicochemical variables of the water (dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH) and processes them using fuzzy logic (artificial intelligence) for the determination of the water quality index. The system was tested in a shrimp culture (Litopenaeus vannamei) with a size of 1.67 +/- 0.23g in a period of 84 days. The results show that the system analyzes the physicochemical variables most important of a shrimp culture and were able to qualify as a water quality index: poor, good and excellent according to the optimal thresholds required by the crop. This indicates that it is possible the use of the open hardware and fuzzy logic system for the monitoring of water quality index and its application in aquaculture.																	1665-1456						2017	19	3					45	49										WOS:000418542900008

Fracking and Framing: A Comparative Analysis of Media Coverage of Hydraulic Fracturing in Canadian and US Newspapers	ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE												Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a controversial but popular method of extracting oil and gas in North America. There are a myriad of completing claims about the economic benefits and the environmental costs of the technology. This paper examines news media coverage of fracking in four Canadian and four American newspapers over a five-year period. A comparison is made at the national level as well as at a paired subnational level between jurisdictions where fracking is embraced and where fracking is banned. The paper demonstrates that in both countries the main storyline is about water quality, but beyond that differences emerge as Americans focus more on wildlife and public health and Canadians focus more on moratoriums and energy independence. Moreover, while there were similarities in media coverage of fracking in pro-fracking and anti-fracking jurisdictions, there were notable differences in attention to the topics of public health and economic benefits.																	1752-4032	1752-4040					2017	11	6					784	799		10.1080/17524032.2016.1275734								WOS:000418738300008

Magdalena Bay is a subtropical coastal lagoon of northwestern Mexico with important ecological considerations and numerous fisheries. Knowledge of hydrodynamics and water quality are essential for establishing best management practices for the Bay. Goals. The aim of the study was to analyze the influence of the tide on the variation and transport of nutrients and chlorophyll a between the inner lagoon and the adjacent ocean as a fertilization mechanism in the area. Methods. Samples were obtained in June, August, and November 2005 at a site close to the mouth (24 degrees 57' N and 112 degrees 03' W). The samples were obtained every 2 hours during each tidal cycle at three different depths (0, 15, and 30 m). Temperature and salinity were measured using a CTD. Nutrients, chlorophyll a, and oxygen were measured at a laboratory. Results. Three climatic-oceanographic conditions were identified: upwelling (June), stratification (August), and negative effects during the ENSO (November). The correlation between tidal range and other variables was significant (p < 0.05) in August, compared to June and November. Conclusions. The transport of net nutrients associated with the tidal cycle depends on the season and the state of the tide and is considered high compared to other smaller systems. This explains the high organic productivity in this coastal region.																	0188-8897						2017	27	2					253	264										WOS:000418486800010

SELECTION OF CLASSIFICATION MODELS FROM REPOSITORY OF MODEL FOR WATER QUALITY DATASET	JOURNAL OF FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES												This paper proposes a new technique, Model Selection Technique (MST) for selection and ranking of models from the repository of models by combining three performance measures (Acc, TPR and TNR). This technique provides weightage to each performance measure to find the most suitable model from the repository of models. A number of classification models have been generated to classify water quality using the most significant features and classifiers such as J48, JRip and BayesNet. To validate this technique proposed, the water quality dataset of Kinta River was used in this research. The results demonstrate that the Function classifier is the optimal model with the most outstanding accuracy of 97.02%, TPR = 0.96 and TNR = 0.98.

Results showed that the temporal dynamics of structure, diversity and abundance of bacterial community were not obvious. The persistent species had low diversity but high relative abundance. Dechloromonas, Thauera, Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira were the four dominant persistent genera. The intermittent and transient genera showed different dynamics with persistent genera. Variation partitioning analysis suggested that water quality indexes (13.40%) had the greatest contribution to bacterial community variation, followed by temperature (9.20%). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed the stable abundances of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria, and the occurrence of complete ammonia oxidizers (Comammox) in the full-scale WWTP. Functional prediction showed that the bacterial functional compositions were also relatively stable, and metabolism was the most dominant functional category. Many genes involved in the nitrogen metabolism pathway were predicted to be present with high gene counts, e. g., nirB, nirD, nasA, norB, nirK, nosZ and nifH. Most of these genes were predicted to be mainly contributed by Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales, Rhodocyclales and Actinomycetales. Overall, the composition and function of bacterial community in a long-term monitoring were relatively stable, which is important for maintaining the high wastewater treatment capability in full-scale WWTPs.																	2046-2069						2017	7	89					56317	56327		10.1039/c7ra10704h								WOS:000418373300021

Effects of an anthropogenic saltwater inlet on three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) (Teleostei: Gasterosteidae) and their parasites in an inland brook	EUROPEAN ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL												In industrialised areas, teleost fish are often exposed to anthropogenic changes of the water quality. These often have negative effects on species with a narrow ecological range. Species with a wider ecological range, such as the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus Linneaus, 1758), might benefit if water quality alteration reduces interspecific competition and/or parasite infection pressure. In the present study, we investigated sticklebacks in an inland brook, in which the inlet of warmand salty coal mine drainage water increases water temperature and changes the brook from freshwater to brackish (approx. 20 mS cm(-1)) conditions. We collected sticklebacks up- and downstream of the saltwater inlet (henceforth called freshwater and saltwater sites or habitats) in monthly intervals from April to October 2010, and monitored their body condition parameters and parasite infections. In particular during spring, the water temperature was higher (3.7-4.5 degrees C) in the saltwater habitat and juvenile sticklebacks occurred earlier and grew faster compared to juveniles in the freshwater habitat. In the saltwater habitat, fewer parasite species were detected compared to the freshwater situation (7 vs. 10). Moreover, parasite index, which peaked in young-of-the-year sticklebacks in September, was lower in sticklebacks from the saltwater site. The present study suggests that changes of freshwater conditions by the inlet of warm and salty coal mine drainage water match the adaptive range of three-spined sticklebacks, which grew faster and had lower parasite burden in the altered habitat.

Assessment of water quality of Sembilang River receiving effluent from controlled municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill in Selangor	INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL POSTGRADUATE CONFERENCE, 2017	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				International Technical Postgraduate Conference (Tech-Post)	APR 05-06, 2017	Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Univ Malaya	Univ Malaya, Fac Engn			Most of the landfills in Malaysia are situated near to the main river basin that supplies almost 90% of water requirement. This includes landfills in Selangor where a total of 20 landfill sites are situated in 5 main river basins and the highest number of operating landfills (three) are at the Selangor River Basin (Jeram, Bukit Tagar and Kuang Inert landfills). This situation has caused wide concern over the water safety, even the leachate has been treated. The leachate itself still contains contaminants that are difficult to treat. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect on water quality of Sembilang River that receives effluent from the nearby landfill. In this study, we analyzed samples of water from ten sampling stations starting from the upstream to downstream of Sembilang River. The water quality was evaluated by the Water Quality Index (WQI) depending on in-situ and laboratory analysis. 11 water quality variables are selected for the quality assessment; temperature, pH, turbidity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solid, ammoniacal nitrogen, phosphate and nitrate. The result indicated that, when the effluent mixed with the river water, the water quality decreased gradually and was found to be lower at a few stations. The water quality of Sembilang River falls under Class III of Water Quality Index with ranges between 68.03 to 43.46 mg/L. It is revealed that the present scenario of water quality of Sembilang River is due to the effect of effluent from the landfill.																	1757-8981						2017	210								UNSP 012019	10.1088/1757-899X/210/1/012019								WOS:000418543500019

From aquaculture practitioners' point of view, how to effectively control the water quality for the fish pond is very important. In basis of the experience of aquaculture practitioners, temperature. pH, conductivity, salinity, and last monitored oxygen content influence the water quality (here, called influencing factor). Life and death of fish am determined by water quality as well as water quality is decided by oxygen content. Therefore, the evaluation of the water quality is according to oxygen content. Regression method is often used for statistical analysis and prediction. In regression method, model is established by dependent variables and independent variables. In this study, the five influencing factors an represented as independent variables and the oxygen content is seen as dependent variable. From the experimental result, the oxygen content can be kept in the reasonable range.																			978-4-9077-6457-9				2017							545	546										WOS:000418323700122

These results indicate that the prepared photocatalytic systems are promising for improving water quality by reducing the viability of water-borne microorganisms, including bacterial spores.																	2471-2132						2017	3	4					498	513		10.3934/geosci.2017.4.498								WOS:000418528400001

The challenges faced by the operators of these fish ponds include the need for regular feeding of the fish, monitoring of the water quality and the changing of the water when the quality becomes unhealthy for the fish. This work presents an Internet of Things based approach for automating the management of the farms and enabling remote monitoring and management of the ponds. The system comprise of a pond controller which uses appropriate sensors to monitor the water quality of the pond. A CCTV records the activities around the pond and stores them in a cloud location. The Pond controller manages the automatic feeding system of the fish and the water control system for the pond. The system is also designed with capacity for remote operation through a specially designed mobile application which accesses the CCTV files and also controls the operation of the pond controller. This system will enable the management of one or more fish ponds from one mobile device, it will reduce the costs associated with managing the fish farms and improve quality of their yield.																	2078-0958		978-988-14047-5-6				2017							42	46										WOS:000418106200009

SSD is amandatory diagnostic required by environmental regulatory bodies from the European Union, the United States, Australia, China etc. Yet, it is subject to much scientific criticism, notably concerning a historically debated parametric assumption for modelling species variability. Tackling the problem using nonparametric mixture models, it is possible to shed this parametric assumption and build a statistically sounder basis for SSD. We use Normalized Random Measures with Independent Increments (NRMI) as the mixing measure because they offer a greater flexibility than the Dirichlet process. Indeed, NRMI can induce a prior on the number of components in the mixture model that is less informative than the Dirichlet process. This feature is consistent with the fact that SSD practitioners do not usually have a strong prior belief on the number of components. In this short paper, we illustrate the advantage of the nonparametric SSD over the classical normal SSD and a kernel density estimate SSD on several real datasets. We summarise the results of the complete study in [18], where the method is generalised to censored data and a systematic comparison on simulated data is also presented, along with a study of the clustering induced by the mixture model to examine patterns in species sensitivity.

Monthly precipitation and temperature data for 29 climate divisions, and streamflow data for 29 naturalized gauges were analyzed. Two variations of the Mann-Kendall test, considering lag-1 auto correlation and long-term persistence, and the Pettitt test were employed to assess trends and shifts, respectively. Results indicated that streamflow increased during the winter-spring months and decreased during the summer-autumn period. Decreasing trends in winter precipitation were identified over snow-dominated regions in the upper basin. Significant increases in temperature were detected over several months. Major shifts were noticed in 1964, 1968 and in the late 1920s. Increasing temperature while decreasing streamflow and precipitation were noticed after major shifts in the 1930s, and these shifts coincided with coupled phases of El Nino Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation.																	0262-6667	2150-3435					2017	62	14					2280	2296		10.1080/02626667.2017.1372855								WOS:000418480700003

The study was conducted in the Vienziemite stream basin (6 km(2)), where discharge was monitored on a daily basis during the time period of 1946-2010. In the stream basin, natural afforestation of agricultural land began in the 1950s, and in the mid-1970s artificial drainage systems were installed in all agricultural land (70% of the total basin area). Climate variability and artificial drainage were the main factors observed to be affecting stream discharge. The changes were most evident in annual and seasonal mean, minimum and maximum streamflow. There was no effect of afforestation of agriculture land on stream discharge.

This is to protect the receivers which typically are rivers, streams, lakes. Examination of the quality of treated wastewater allows for quick elimination of possible negative effects, and the study of water receiver prevents from excessive contamination. The paper presents the results of selected physical and chemical parameters of treated wastewater from the largest on the region in north-eastern Poland city of Bialystok municipal wastewater treatment and Biala River, the receiver. The samples for research were taken 3-4 a month in 2015 from two points: before and after discharge. The impact of the wastewater treatment plant on the quality of the receiver waters was studied by using non-parametric Wilcoxon test. This test determined whether the analyzed indicators varied significantly depending on different sampling points of the river, above and below place of discharge of treated wastewater. These results prove that the treated wastewater does not affect the water quality in the Biala River.																	2267-1242						2017	22								UNSP 00127	10.1051/e3sconf/20172200127								WOS:000417352100127

JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH												Pollution from untreated human sewage is one of several environmental concerns in the coastal waters of Belize. This study utilized distributions of fecal sterols and foraminiferal assemblages to determine if human sewage is affecting the coral reef system off the coast of Caye Caulker, Belize. A total of 125 sediment samples were collected from which fecal sterol concentrations (coprostanol, cholestanol and cholesterol) and diagnostic stanol ratios, sediment texture (% mud), and foraminiferal ecological indices, including species richness, density, and diversity, and the FORAM Index (FI), were assessed. Elevated concentrations of coprostanol were primarily found inshore, with 20 samples exceeding 100 ng/g. The two stanol ratios, evaluated together, confirmed presence of human sewage at 17 sites. Foraminiferal assemblages were dominated by Quinqueloculina, Trochulina, Archaias and Asterigerina. Predominance of sand-sized sediments and the prevalence of Trochulina rosea and Asterigerina carinata reflected the active hydrodynamic regime, particularly on the eastern side of the caye. While the FI values overall indicated that water quality is conducive to reef growth and recovery, data from 37 samples indicated that the area is experiencing environmental change, especially on the southwestern side. Significant positive correlations were found between coprostanol and both foraminiferal density and diversity, while coprostanol and FI were negatively correlated. These results indicate that human sewage is inducing nutrification, which may be promoting reported increases in macroalgal abundances throughout Belize, though the active wave and current regimes are limiting the impacts on the eastern, Caribbean-facing side of Caye Caulker.

The study has carried out systematic monitoring of pH value of four main rivers' (Panlong River, Baoxiang River, Chai River and Laoyu River) channel runoff that into the Dianchi Lake, and pH value of "farmland ditch water and water of sewage draining exit" that on drainage basin surface, to find out pH value and its variation mechanism of the main rivers into Dianchi Lake and to analyze pH value's variation characteristics of the main rivers into Dianchi Lake and the main factors resulting in pH value's variation of these rivers, thus finding out scientific evidences for disposal of water pollution in Dianchi Lake basin. The results are as following:(1) pH values of the main rivers into Dianchi Lake are regularly distributed: pH value of the upper course of the rivers is about 6.5 to 6.97 and the average value is 6.77, while that of the middle and lower reaches of the rivers channel runoff is about 6.85 to 7.77 and the average value is 7.33; (2) the variation characteristics of pH value of the main rivers into Dianchi Lake are that: water pH value of woodland river source with fewer human activities is lower and is acidulous, but that of "middle and lower reaches of rivers" with more human activities is gradually increasing from weak acidity to alkalescence; (3) human activities are important factorsfor the distribution and variation of pH value of the main rivers into Dianchi Lake, forfarmland irrigation water is the alkaline source while local sewage discharge results in decrease of pH value of nearby rivers channels.																	0252-2667	2169-0103					2017	38	7					1197	1210		10.1080/02522667.2017.1367501								WOS:000418483800008

Floristic associations and filtering ability of riparian vegetation strips	PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												The analysis of lateral flow runoff of superficial nutrients and sediments from an agricultural origin and their retention by infiltration of riparian vegetation strips are of great importance in reducing the agricultural externalities on surface water quality. The aim of this study was to relate soil infiltration to the main biophysical properties of riparian environments in the Pampa Austral of Argentina, defined by the composition of its plant community and the coverage of exotic species. We explored the relationships between hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and aboveground, litter and root biomasses, organic matter concentration, terrain slope, soil bulk density, texture and electrical conductivity. We determined eight floristic associations through the classification of 65 censuses of vegetation. Three of the associations were dominated by native grasses, three by exotic grasses and two presented a layer of exotic willow trees in combination with native and invasive grasses. The mean Ks in soils from the floristic associations with trees and from the associations of native grasses without trees were higher than in soils from the associations of exotic grasses without trees. Significant relationships were found between Ks and the soil properties that are sensitive to the influence of vegetation, suggesting that the relationships between floristic composition and infiltration could be explained partly due to causal relationships.																	1851-5657						2017	86						112	123										WOS:000418226500013

The widely identified contaminants are heavy metal. The toxicity of those heavy metal elements is high and very poisonous to humans' health and environment even at lower dose or concentration of exposure. Chronic poisoning can cause fatal or defect to one's body or environment. Organic contaminants such as oil and microbial are also found due to decomposition of organic matter. The excellent quality adsorption of contaminants is highly related to surface area, pore size, pore volume, and amount plus type of functional group on surface of CSAC. The higher the surface area and pore volume, the higher adsorption that CSAC have towards contaminants. In comparison to meso-pore and macro-pore, micro-pore is better for trapping and adsorbing water contaminants. The purpose of this article is to critically review the potential of CSAC in increasing adsorption to remove contaminants for water quality improvement. A critical review is implemented using search engine like Science Direct. Alkali-modification is shown to have good adsorption in anion elements and organic matter due to improvement of hydrophobic organic compound (HOC) while acid-modification is good in cation elements adsorption. Strong alkali impregnated solution makes CSAC more hydrophobic and positively charge especially after increasing the impregnation dosage. Strong acid of adsorbate affects the quality of adsorption by reducing the surface area, pore volume and it also breaks the Van der Waals forces between adsorbent and adsorbate. However, the formation of oxygen helps the activated carbon surface to become more hydrophilic and negative charge is produced. It helps the effectiveness of metal adsorption. Therefore, by controlling dosage and types of functional groups on surface of CSAC and the pH of adsorbate, it can contribute to high adsorption of organic and inorganic contaminants in the water.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1574-4				2017	1892								UNSP 070005	10.1063/1.5005723								WOS:000417351000092

The treatment gain attention due to their potential in wastewater treatment especially in organics, nutrients, and heavy metal removal of domestics, agricultural, and industrial wastewater treatment. Plant functions in phytoremediation make the plant selection as an essential element. The plant should have the ability to tolerate with the toxic effluent and able to uptake the contaminant. Cyperus alternifolius (umbrella grass) was chosen as aquatic plant due to the ability to tolerance in municipal and industrial effluent sources with strong and dense root systems. Thus, the objectives of this study are to determine the potential and effectiveness of Cyperus alternifolius in the palm oil mill effluent treatment especially in the removal of organics (COD), nutrients (NH3-N and TP) and suspended solid. The batch experiment was run using Cyperus alternifolius to determine their potential of aerobic pond effluent for 21 days of treatment. Cyperus alternifolius treatment shows the great removal of COD and TSS with 96% and 91%, respectively at the end of 21 days of treatment. Nutrients removal achieved the maximum removal of 92% NH3-N and 99% TP shows after 11 days of treatment and percentage slowly decrease until the end of 21 days of treatment. Cyperus alternifolius had shown potential in the palm oil mill effluent treatment and can be combined with ponding treatment to enhance to water quality prior discharge.

NOM content reaction with free chlorine in treated water lowers the water quality further. Chlorine is added for disinfection and produces undesirable disinfection by-products (DPBs). DBPs in drinking water are carcinogenic to consumers and may promote cancerous cell development in the human body. This study was performed to compare the coagulant efficiency of aluminum sulfate (Alum) and ferric chloride (FeCl3) on NOM removal (as in UV254 absorbance) and turbidity removal under three pH conditions (pH 6, pH 7, and sample actual pH). The three sampling points for these studies were Jalan Baru River, Kerian River, and Redac Pond. Additional sampling points, such as Lubuk Buntar and a tubewell located in the Civil Engineering School, were included to observe differences in characteristics. DOC, UV absorbance, and full wavelength were tested, after which samples treated with alum were also tested to further analyze the NOM content. Based on UV254 absorbance and DOC data, specific UV value was calculated to obtain vital synopsis of the characteristics of NOM content, as well as coagulation efficiency.

However, WQI does not clarify each water quality indices, for example nutrients and organic pollutants, that reflect the land-use and pollution source in the catchment. Therefore, in this research, the main objectives are to investigate the interaction of land-use and the water quality of rivers in Penang Island, the quantity of pollutant loads discharged, and identification of the pollution sources along the rivers. The procedure starts from the selection of rivers and parameters for investigation, carrying out field survey and sampling, measuring and analyzing each sample, and lastly, providing a conclusion. The three rivers selected are Pinang River, Keluang River and Burung River. In this research, the results show that total organic carbon (TOC) increases generally as the rivers flow towards the river mouths, which means the degree of organic pollution increases along the rivers. In Pinang River, TOC increases as the tributaries from housing areas flow into the mainstream whereas in Keluang River, a marked increase of TOC is shown in the location where the wastewater from a sewage treatment plant discharges. In Burung River, TOC increases as the river flows through the paddy fields. In the principal component analysis, all sampling points of the three rivers are able to be classified into five groups based on the characteristics of water quality. For example, upstream of Keluang River and Burung River show mutual characteristics in terms of man-made pollution index and heavy metal pollution index. As a conclusion, the results in this research show that the characteristics of water quality in Penang Island are highly affected by land-use surrounding the rivers.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1574-4				2017	1892								UNSP 040008-1	10.1063/1.5005688								WOS:000417351000057

A Reliable and Efficient Wireless Sensor Network System for Water Quality Monitoring	2017 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ENVIRONMENTS (IE 2017)	International Conference on Intelligent Environments				13th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE)	AUG 21-25, 2017	Chung Ang Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	IEEE, BCS, Chosun Univ, Hanyang Univ, Univ Minho, Univ Catolica Murcia, Univ Alacant, AAAI, ICEPCO, Saltlux, Kt, IEEE Syst Man Cybernet Soc, IOS Press, IEEE Human Comp Interact	Chung Ang Univ			Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are strongly useful to monitor physical and environmental conditions to provide real-time information for improving environment quality. However, deploying a WSN in a physical environment faces several critical challenges such as high energy consumption, and data loss. In this work, we have proposed a reliable and efficient environmental monitoring system in ponds using wireless sensor network and cellular communication technologies. We have designed a hardware and software ecosystem that can limit the data loss yet save the energy consumption of nodes. A lightweight protocol acknowledges data transmission among the nodes. Data are transmitted to the cloud using a cellular protocol to reduce power consumption. Information in the cloud is mining so that real-time warning notifications can be sent to users. If the values are reaching the threshold, the server will send an alarm signal to the pond's owner phone, enable him to take corrective actions in a timely manner. Besides, the client application system also provides the feature to help the user to manage the trend of a physical environment such as shrimp ponds by viewing charts of the collected data by hours, days, months. We have deployed our system using IEEE 802.15.4 Standard, ZigBEE, KIT CC2530 of Texas Instrument, and tested our system with temperature and pH level sensors. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed system have a low rate of data loss and long energy life with low cost while it can provide real-time data for water quality monitoring.																	2469-8792		978-1-5386-1920-9				2017							84	91		10.1109/IE.2017.34								WOS:000418330300012

Nutritional status of Fuxian Lake was evaluated by means of biological evaluation method and TSIM. Results show that, there are totally 8 phylum 66 categories and 101 species of phytoplankton, green alga, diatom, and blue-green algae as major dominant species. With this year, seasonal changes happened in phytoplankton community, green alga and diatom as principals in spring, green alga and blue-green algae as principals in summer, green alga, diatom and blue-green algae as principals in autumn, green alga and blue-green alga as principals in winter. Results of redundancy analysis show that, the greatest influence water quality factor of phytoplankton community structure in Fuxian Lake is SRP concentration. Water quality factors in spring include DO and SRP concentration, TN and SRP concentration in summer, SRP concentration and pH in autumn and winter. Results of eutrophication evaluation show that, evaluation results of biological evaluation method and TSIM are basically the same but there still exist differences. It can be seen by combining with two methods that Fuxian Lake now is still in oligotrophic stage but it has characteristics of poor medium nutritional type in transition stage.																			978-1-5386-1227-9				2017							302	306		10.1109/ICRIS.2017.83								WOS:000417393800076

Results showed that water quality was comparatively better at the center as Typha latifolia plants were growing toward the center of ponds. In another study, the wastewater treatment ability of T. latifolia was investigated by growing them in industrial and municipal effluent under greenhouse conditions. Water and plant samples were collected periodically (3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, and 31st day after transplanting) for the measurement of Pb, Cu, and Cd concentrations. A decrease in heavy metal concentration of both effluents was observed as the experiment progressed and metal removal percentages ranged between 81% and 96%. Complementary the increase in metal concentration in plant tissues was observed over experimental period. Among plant tissues, metal concentration of Pb was highest i.e. 362 mg kg(-1) in roots and 313 mg kg(-1) in shoots at end of experiment. Pb, Cu, and Cd concentrations were higher in roots than shoots and hence translocation factors were less than 1.0. Metal removal efficiency was better from industrial wastewater and was in order of Pb > Cu > Cd. T. latifolia can be used for remediation of heavy metal-polluted wastewater.																	1522-6514	1549-7879					2017	19	12					1077	1084		10.1080/15226514.2017.1328387								WOS:000416675000002

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of sand mining activities to environmental conditions of the Komering river. Field studies have been conducted during the period of April-June 2016 for observing the condition of the river channel, water quality measurement and mining activities. Analysis of the results of field studies combined with GIS and Remote sensing analysis was conducted to measure the impact of mining activities both spatially and temporally. The results showed that the sand mining activities on the Komering river have led not only to the degradation of water quality but also damage of the river channel. In this paper, we also discussed the relationship between the distribution of water quality and channel damage with the mining activities in the spatial perspective.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1536-2				2017	1862								UNSP 030198	10.1063/1.4991302								WOS:000417371800199

Relationship between Cyanobacteria Community and Water Quality Parameters on Intertidal Zone of Fish Ponds, Blanakan, West Java	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CURRENT PROGRESS IN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCES 2016 (ISCPMS 2016)	AIP Conference Proceedings				2nd International Symposium on Current Progress in Mathematics and Sciences (ISCPMS)	NOV 01-02, 2016	Univ Indonesia, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Depok, INDONESIA		Univ Indonesia, Fac Math & Nat Sci			The presence of cyanobacteria in the intertidal zone is strongly influenced by changes in physical and chemical parameters. In milkfish ponds, cyanobacteria community had been indirectly affected by the mixing of sea water and fresh water during low tides. To determine the relationship between the cyanobacteria community and water quality parameters, phytoplankton samples were taken both vertically and horizontally in three fish ponds at Blanakan Village on July and August 2016. The water quality parameters measured were temperature, DO, salinity, and pH. Based on the enumeration results of 36 samples of phytoplankton, 5 genus Cyanobacteria (Merismopedia, Microcystis, Lyngbya, Oscillatoria and Trichodesmium) were obtained. Cyanobacteria is a subdominant group after diatomae with dominance index between 2-21 %. Average of density ranged between 128-3563 plankters /10 dm(3) . High dominance level (97-99 %) between cyanobacteria and diatoms cause phytoplankton diversity indices in all three fish ponds were very small (0.0851 to 0.8734). Based on the analysis of the three main components (Principle Component Analysis) it was known that the presence of five cyanobacteria genus was determined by the differences of water quality parameters observed. Merismopedia was more affected by salinity and DO fluctuations. Oscillatoria, Trichodesmium and Lyngbya were determined by changes in temperature, whereas Microcystis was more affected by pH.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1536-2				2017	1862								UNSP 030114-1	10.1063/1.4991218								WOS:000417371800115

The main areas of interest for remote sensing research had always been concerned with environmental studies, especially water bodies monitoring. Many methods that are using visible and near-an infrared band of the electromagnetic spectrum had been already developed to detect surface water reservoirs. Moreover, the usage of an image obtained in visible and infrared spectrum allows quality monitoring of water bodies. Nevertheless, retrieval of water boundaries and mapping surface water reservoirs with optical sensors is still quite demanding. Therefore, the microwave data could be the perfect complement to data obtained with passive optical sensors to detect and monitor aquatic environment especially surface water bodies. This research presents the methodology to detect water bodies with open-source satellite imagery acquired with both optical and microwave sensors. The SAR Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery were used to detect and monitor chosen reservoirs in Poland. In the research Level, 1 Sentinel-2 data and Level 1 SAR images were used. SAR data were mainly used for mapping water bodies. Next, the results of water boundaries extraction with Sentinel-1 data were compared to results obtained after application of modified spectral indices for Sentinel-2 data. The multispectral optical data can be used in the future for the evaluation of the quality of the reservoirs. Preliminary results obtained in the research had shown, that the fusion of data obtained with optical and microwave sensors allow for the complex detection of water bodies and could be used in the future quality monitoring of water reservoirs.

The problem of satellite data utilization in multi-modeling approach for socio-ecological risks assessment is formally defined. Observation, measurement and modeling data utilization method in the framework of multi-model approach is described. Methodology and models of risk assessment in framework of decision support approach are defined and described. Method of water quality assessment using satellite observation data is described. Method is based on analysis of spectral reflectance of aquifers. Spectral signatures of freshwater bodies and offshores are analyzed. Correlations between spectral reflectance, pollutions and selected water quality parameters are analyzed and quantified. Data of MODIS, MISR, AIRS and Landsat sensors received in 2002-2014 have been utilized verified by in-field spectrometry and lab measurements. Fuzzy logic based approach for decision support in field of water quality degradation risk is discussed. Decision on water quality category is making based on fuzzy algorithm using limited set of uncertain parameters. Data from satellite observations, field measurements and modeling is utilizing in the framework of the approach proposed. It is shown that this algorithm allows estimate water quality degradation rate and pollution risks. Problems of construction of spatial and temporal distribution of calculated parameters, as well as a problem of data regularization are discussed. Using proposed approach, maps of surface water pollution risk from point and diffuse sources are calculated and discussed.

Linking Benthic Macroinvertebrates and Physicochemical Variables for Water Quality Assessment in Saigon River and Its Tributaries, Vietnam	1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING (AEE 2017)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				1st International Conference on Advances in Environmental Engineering (AEE)	NOV 28-30, 2017	Ostrava, CZECH REPUBLIC	VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Mining & Geol, Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Civil Engn				The benthic macroinvertebrates living on the bottom channels are one of the most promising of the potential indicators of river health for the Saigon River and its tributaries with hydrochemistry playing a supporting role. An evaluation of the interrelationships within this approach deems necessary. This work identified and tested these relationships to improve the method for water quality assessment. Data from over 4,500 km(2) watershed were used as a representative example for the Saigon River and its tributaries. The data covered the period March and September, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2015. To implement this evaluation, the analyses were based on accepted the methodology of Mekong River Commission and the studies of scientific group for the biological status assessment. For correlation analyses, the selected environmental variables were compared with the ecological indices, based on benthic macroinvertebrates. The results showed that the metrics of Species Richness, H', and 1-DS had significant and strong relationships with the water quality variables of DO, BOD5, T_ N, and T_ P (R-2 = 0.3751 -0.8866; P << 0.05). While the metrics of Abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates did not have a statistically significant relationship with any water quality variables (R-2 = 0.0000 -0.0744; P > 0.05). Additionally, the metrics of Species Richness, H', and 1-DS had negatively correlated with the pH and TSS. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the ecological quality of the Saigon River and its tributaries using benthic macroinvertebrates seems to be the most sensitive indicator to correlate with physicochemical variables. This demonstrated that it could be applied to describe the water quality in the Saigon River and its tributaries.																	1755-1307						2017	92								UNSP 012053	10.1088/1755-1315/92/1/012053								WOS:000417457600053

This paper analyses the current status in numerical modelling of pollution dispersion in streams and use of some modelling approaches for the inverse task. Inverse task means a modelling technique, which is focused on the localisation of unknown pollution source (typical common models or equations are rather focused on the pollution spreading simulation, whereas the pollution source location is known). Paper offers an idea of such inverse task solution. It is based on the known pollution concentration time courses or it can be based on the results of the on-line monitoring of the specific water quality parameters as well. For the application of inverse tasks in conditions of real streams and rivers a large number of various requirements and conditions in specific river should be considered, i.a. the non-prismatic river bed, occurrence of dead zones, dispersion rate etc. Paper also describes the first version of the software for solving inverse tasks and preliminary experiences of using this software.																	1755-1307						2017	92								UNSP 012056	10.1088/1755-1315/92/1/012056								WOS:000417457600056

The framework consists of five main steps that can evaluate, develop and implement a resource recovery project from concept to implementation through the systematic analysis of economic potential, technology availability and readiness as well as comprehensive net present value analysis. The application of the framework is demonstrated through a case study from the biotechnological industry where the objective was to reduce the hydraulic load on a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), thereby investigating opportunities for process water reuse. In this case, a recovery unit is studied, where purification and concentration generates large volumes of wastewater. Reverse osmosis (RO) could ensure that the desired drinking water quality could be achieved and would enable re-use of the water in the production site for different economic purposes.

This material must be removed because it can affect the water quality that can cause turbidity and colour. The objective of this study is to develop water treatment process from Seri Alam (Johor, Malaysia) lake water resources by using natural coagulant Acacia auriculiformis pods through a jar test experiment. Jar test is designed to show the effectiveness of the water treatment. This process is a laboratory procedure that will simulate coagulation/flocculation with several parameters selected namely contact time, coagulant dosage and agitation speed. The most optimum percentage of colloids removal for each parameter is determined at 0.2 g, 90 min and 80 rpm. FESEM (Field-emission Scanning Electron Microscope) observed the small structures of final floc particles for optimum parameter in this study to show that the colloids coagulated the coagulant. All result showed that the Acacia auriculiformis pods can be a very efficient coagulant in removing colloids from water.

In this water quality monitoring system, the processing part was based on a microcontroller instead of Lead and Copper Rule (LCR) machines to receive the results. By using four main sensors, this system obtained the readings based on the detection of the sensors, respectively. Therefore, users can receive the readings through SMS because there was a connection between Arduino Uno and GSM Module. This system was designed to be portable so that it would be convenient for users to carry it anywhere and everywhere they wanted to since the processor used is smaller in size compared to the LCR machines. It was also developed to ease the user to monitor and control the water quality. However, the ranges of the sensors' detection still a limitation in this study.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1565-2				2017	1885								UNSP 020302-1	10.1063/1.5002496								WOS:000417379700302

Recently, Malaysia is facing many environmental issues regarding water pollution. The main causes of river pollution are rapid urbanization, arising from the development of residential, commercial, industrial sites, infrastructural facilities and others. The purpose of the study was to predict the water quality of the Connaught Bridge Power Station (CBPS), Klang River. Besides that, affects to the low tide and high tide and. to forecast the pollutant concentrations of the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total Suspended Solid (TSS) for existing land use of the catchment area through water quality modeling (by using the MUSIC software). Besides that, to identifying an integrated urban stormwater treatment system (Best Management Practice or BMPs) to achieve optimal performance in improving the water quality of the catchment using the MUSIC software in catchment areas having tropical climates. Result from MUSIC Model such as BOD5 at station 1 can be reduce the concentration from Class IV to become Class III. Whereas, for TSS concentration from Class III to become Class II at the station 1. The model predicted a mean TSS reduction of 0.17%, TP reduction of 0.14%, TN reduction of 0.48% and BOD5 reduction of 0.31% for Station 1 Thus, from the result after purposed BMPs the water quality is safe to use because basically water quality monitoring is important due to threat such as activities are harmful to aquatic organisms and public health.

The importance of key attenuation factors for microbial and chemical contaminants during managed aquifer recharge: A review	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												There is increasing interest worldwide to utilize unconventional water resources such as reclaimed water, urban stormwater, or impaired surface water to augment drinking water supplies. Given the presence of traditional and emerging microbial and chemical contaminants (e.g., pathogens, trace organic chemicals, nutrients, trace metals) in these waters, efficient and reliable treatment processes are needed to assure a product water quality that is protective of public health. Natural treatment processes such as managed aquifer recharge (MAR) combine the benefits of efficient biological treatment for these contaminants with a low carbon footprint and a residual free operation. The drawbacks of MAR are the rather large space requirements and a lack of process understanding that can guide more efficient design and operation of these facilities. Among appropriate design and operational parameters as well as geochemical and hydrological conditions, retention time has been identified as a key parameter to achieve attenuation of microbial and chemical contaminants during MAR. Shorter retention time can result in significantly reduced footprints and thus facilitate the integration of MAR into urban and peri-urban water infrastructure. However, different minimum retention times are required to achieve reliable removal of microbial and chemical contaminants.

J	Zhang, L				Zhang, Lei			Different methods for the evaluation of surface water quality: The Case of the Liao River, Liaoning Province, China	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR SPATIAL PLANNING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												The water-quality index is a grading system for presenting water-quality data and comparing water of varying quality. It can be used in water quality trend analyses and presents valuable information to policy makers, managers, and other nontechnical people. For exploring water quality and identifying the main pollution parameter in the lower reaches of Liao River, Single Factor Evaluation (SFE) method in the form of a Comprehensive Water Pollution Index (CWPI), the Nemerow-Sumitomo Water Quality Index (NWQI), and the Comprehensive Water Quality Identification Index (CWQII) method were used to evaluate water quality in lower reaches of Liao River, Liaoning province, China. The results proved that at Zhaoquan river and Wailiao river the water quality status was good, and Pangxiegou river and Qingshui river showed unsatisfactory water quality status. The major pollution indicator in lower reaches of Liao River was petroleum, and compared with the other assessment methods, CWQII was found to give more useful and objective information, and it is worth further promoting water quality inspections in lower reaches of Liao River. Finally, according to the distribution of industry in the Liao river basin, this study makes some relevant suggestions for sustainable development in the future.																	2187-3666						2017	5	4					4	+		10.14246/irspsd.5.4_4								WOS:000417869000002

A major part of the benefits from improved water quality relate to the increased recreational value. However, there is a lack of easily operative and widely applicable quantitative methods to assess the benefits of improved water quality for recreational use. We present a new model to link physical indicators of water quality, water feasibility indicators for different recreational uses, individuals' perceptions concerning the current feasibility of water for recreational purposes and monetary measures of water-related recreation benefits. The model has been applied to nine lakes, three rivers and one large coastal area in Finland. In this paper, we present the principles of the method and the results from one case study.

In developing the Shale Network, we have experienced reluctance to share data from all participating sectors. This paper explores this reluctance, identifying barriers to greater collaboration among multiple stakeholders in natural resource management projects. Findings are derived from participant observation of the Shale Network team, surveys conducted during Shale Network workshops, interviews with water quality stakeholders, and participant observation of water quality monitoring training sessions. The barriers identified include perceptions about data problems and quality, technical capacity, regulatory and legal limitations, competition for resources, and resource allocation decisions. This paper identifies strategies the Shale Network has used to overcome data-sharing barriers to expand a culture of data sharing that supports enhanced nature resource management and citizen engagement.																	0964-0568	1360-0559					2017	60	12					2103	2121		10.1080/09640568.2016.1276435								WOS:000417680400002

Evaluation of temporary seasonal variation of heavy metals and their potential ecological risk in Nzhelele River, South Africa	OPEN CHEMISTRY												Surface water is often used as alternative source of drinking water in many regions of the world where the potable water supply is erratic or not present. The concentration of heavy metals was assessed using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). The impact of temporary seasonal variation on the contamination level was also assessed. Contamination factor (CF) and Hakanson's potential ecological risk (E-r and RI) indices were used to evaluate the toxicity levels of the metals in the sediments of the river. Higher concentrations of Fe, Mn, Pb, Cu and Zn were determined in the dry season in the river water whereas in the sediments higher levels were recorded for Al, Fe, Cd, Cr, Cu and Zn in the wet season. The average CF values for all the metals showed a low contamination level in the sediment, except for Cu and Cd which had moderate and considerable contamination levels, respectively. Similarly, Cu showed a moderate ecological risk level (E-r = 62.90) only in March 2014, for other months Cu and the other metals investigated had E r values < 40 which implies low ecological risk. The mean relative abundance of heavy metals in the sediments follows the trend Al>Fe>Mn>Cu>Zn>Cr>Pb>Cd.																	2391-5420					JAN	2017	15	1					272	282		10.1515/chem-2017-0033								WOS:000417929800006

Perennial legumes are often planted to supply nitrogen, enhance nutrient cycling and availability to other crops in the rotation. Legume aboveground mass is often used as green manure in crop production farms. However, in the case of large green manure and nitrogen content incorporation, it is not always possible to control the intensity of organic matter mineralization processes. It can have a deleterious effect on soil and water quality or climate change (due to N2O and NH3 losses). Therefore, there is a need for such green manure preparation methods, which could accumulate mobile nitrogen in biomass. The aim of the study is to assess preparation techniques of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) aboveground mass as green manure, namely mulching, ensiling and composting in terms of productivity (output rate), fuel and energy costs, and the production cost. In accordance with the decreasing amount of energy used, green manures lined up as: green manure-straw compost > green manure silage > fresh green manure (mulching). Preparation methods affect green manure quantity and quality. The cost evaluation of green manure preparation methods revealed that ensiling of red clover mass is more expedient compared with composting.																	1691-3043	1691-5976					2017							667	672		10.22616/ERDev2017.16.N133								WOS:000416378300101

Thus, this study focuses on optimizing of the flocculation process by microbial coagulant in river water. Turbidity and suspended solids are the main constraints of river water quality in Malaysia since they may reduce the dissolved oxygen in the water and affects the aquatic life. Hence, a study is conducted to produce microbial coagulants isolated locally for river water treatment. The chosen microbe used as the bioflocculant producer is Aspergillus niger. The parameters optimized in the flocculation process were pH, bioflocculant dosage and effluent concentration. The research was done in the jar test process and the process parameters for maximum turbidity removal was validated. The highest flocculating activity was obtained on day seven of cultivation in the supernatant. The optimum pH and bioflocculant dosage for an effective flocculation process were between 4-5 and 2-3 ml for 0.3 g/l of effluent concentration, respectively. The model was validated by using a river water sample from Sungai Pusu ( Pusu river) and the result showed that the model was acceptable to evaluate the bioflocculation process.																	1511-788X	2289-7860					2017	18	2					63	70										WOS:000417388700008

It includes water security and water scarcity. The water demand is increasing every year, while the planet's capacity to sustain increasing demands for water is challenged. The main global water problems fall into three categories. The first is too much of it, secondly is too little of it and thirdly, it is too dirty. The first category is due to extensive flooding, the second category is due to serious drought and the third category is due to pollution and misuse of water which needs water quality management. Nowadays, there are 1.2 x 10(9) people live in areas of water scarcity and 2.6 billion people in global are lacking safe water supply. There are (6 to 8) x 10(6) humans being are killed each year from water-related disasters and disease. In Indonesia, there is about 37 x 10(6) people lack access to safe water due to water quality issue. In this paper, emerging trends in water quality management to support water sustainability and the water-energy nexus will be discussed.																	2413-0877						2017							118	130		10.18502/kls.v3i5.984								WOS:000417445000011

Firstly, triangular fuzzy numbers of environmental parameters were defined. Then, fuzzy alpha-cut technique is introduced to figure out the fuzzy expected values. Based on the concept of fuzzy reliability of "recipient" water quality, the water pollution risk in fuzzy terms is calculated. Finally, the implementation process of the water risk assessment method is explained by the case study.																	2352-5401		978-94-6252-293-0				2017	94						85	89										WOS:000417131900017

Trends in the aquaculture industry in the recent decade are that salmon farming sites tend to gradually relocate to more wave and current exposed locations. This trend is mainly motivated by the good water quality found in more exposed areas, as well as a lack of available sheltered locations. On the other hand, the increased exposure puts higher loads on the structures and this needs to be addressed by the development of more robust technology. The first step in order to address an increased exposure is to quantify the level of exposure of waves and current, and in this paper a method to easily estimate the level of wind wave exposure on a large number of sites are presented, and subsequently used to analyse all Norwegian sites. The method can be called fetch analysis, and use long term wind data connected with the fetch length in order to estimate wind wave conditions. The method is divided into four steps: 1) Fetch analysis, 2) Wind data, 3) Estimating wave parameters HS and T-p and 4) Wave statistics. Significant wave height H-s with return period 1 year and 50 years are estimated for each site. H-s 50 year is often used for design, and the analysis shows that for 38% of the sites Hs so year exceeds 1 meter, for 17% of the sites H-s 50 year exceeds 1.5 meter, while 1.4% of the sites have H-s 50 year larger than 2.5 meter. The most exposed site has a IL so year of 2.9 meter. Thus there are large differences in H-s 50 year in the various coastal regions of Norway.																			978-0-7918-5772-4				2017									UNSP V006T05A005									WOS:000417225100005

A Systems Approach to Water Infrastructure Planning in Urban Watersheds	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE 2017: TECHNOLOGY					International Conference on Sustainable Infrastructure	OCT 26-28, 2017	New York, NY	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Comm Sustainabil				Planning water infrastructure reflecting a watershed systems approach has been on the forefront of 21st century water resource management to meet the challenges of heavily urbanized watersheds. Processes to effectively merge system thinking with local infrastructure needs have not been adequately addressed in the field of sustainable infrastructure planning. This paper addresses methods of integrating local water infrastructure needs with a watershed systems approach necessary to sustainably address water supply, water quality, and water recycling issues using the Santa Ana River Watershed as an example. Through analysis of water's impact and how it is impacted as it travels from the upper to lower watershed, better approaches to sustainable water infrastructure that reuse, recycle, and preserve our precious water supplies can be achieved. With the growing challenges from climate change and expanding populations with increasing water demands, new lines of watershed systems thinking must be adopted to plan for resilient and sustainable infrastructure in urbanized watersheds.																			978-0-7844-8121-9				2017							53	64										WOS:000417353400005

The deployment of state-of-the-art and mono/multi-parameter systems for sensors' health monitoring provide the operators with innovative reliable capabilities to ensure early microbial contamination detection, efficiently filter false alarms, undertake preemptive incident mitigation measures and monitor their impacts. Due to lack of labeled water bio-contamination data, numerical models (EPANET-MSX) have been used for bio-contamination scenario simulations of Escherichia Coli (E.Coli) injections into a water distribution network modeled with EPANET. The monitored effect on water quality parameters, as free chlorine and total chlorine, are compared with laboratory results obtained at the University of Lille. The outcome has demonstrated the feasibility of using the on-line monitoring of water quality parameters for real time bio-contamination detection and mitigation impacts monitoring.																			978-0-7844-8121-9				2017							258	269										WOS:000417353400023

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OF MODERN PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGIES	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The problem of cutting difficult-to-machine materials used in the aerospace industry, aircraft industry and automobile industry, led to the development and application of today the most attractive technology for contour cutting - Abrasive Water Jet Cutting. Besides high accuracy, flexibility, and low material loss, abrasive water jet cutting can be described as 'ecological' or 'clean' technology over inert and abundant main processing substances (water, sand) and absence of airborne dust particles, smoke and fumes. The recycling of the abrasives makes the process more economical (savings of 50% in operating costs), effective and environmentally friendly (reduction in waste material). It is widely understood that modern, intensive agricultural production is based on the exploitation of natural, primarily biological, chemical and physical resources. A model indicator of environmental sustainability in rural areas and agricultural production in the form of the index is given. It contains 10 main indicators, where each indicator contains 10 variables. The indicators on which the index is calculated are: soil quality; water quality; air quality; external effects (geographic, climatic, edaphic, and others); the need for growing plant and animal products; biological efficiency; dependence on external sources of energy (biofuel); human participation component (inclination to work, training for work in rural areas); social aspects and economic impacts. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview to the environmental impact of production technologies in area of manufacturing and agricultural production.																	1311-5065						2017	18	3					1088	1099										WOS:000417113200026

CALCULATION OF SEDIMENT YIELD USING THE 'RIVER BASIN' AND 'SURFACE AND DISTANCE' MODELS: A CASE STUDY OF THE SHEREMETSKI POTOK WATERSHED, MONTENEGRO	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Sediment is a final result of erosion playing an important role in sustainable development of water resource system, controlling riverine hydrology, morphology, ecology, and water quality. A comprehensive approach estimating sediment yield from a watershed is needed to develop proper measures for mitigating sediment disasters and assessing downstream impacts. The researchers are using qualitative and quantitative methods for describing erosion through field observations and laboratory experiments. Indirect valuations of the erosion processes have been carried out using suspended sediment yield data of rivers or by assessing the sediments deposited in reservoirs. Modelling in ungauged basins has been considered as one of the main challenges in hydrological sciences. The objective of this research was to simulate responses of erosion processes in the Sheremetski Potok calculating sediment yield by using the models 'River Basin' and 'Surface and Distance'. Our findings pointed out a low potential of soil erosion risk, although in the river basin prevails very steep slopes (average river basin decline, Isr, 43.42%). With 2058 m(3) yr(-1) of sediment yield, and an area-specific sediment yield of 298 m(3) km(-2) yr(-1), the studied basin belongs to the Montenegrin basins with low sediment discharge. The model outcomes were validated through measurements at the Potpec reservoir.

COMPARISON OF MICROBIOLOGICAL NON-COMPLIANCE FREQUENCIES OF CHEMICAL DISINFECTANTS USED IN SWIMMING POOLS IN TURKEY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												Swimming pools are used in Turkey for physical activity and entertainment purposes as in many countries. Such common use brings recreational water-associated illness risk. Disinfection is an important application to prevent RWIs resulting from microbiological agents. This study aimed to calculate the non-compliance frequencies emerging in the use of different chemical disinfectants in swimming pools in Turkey and compare the effectiveness of different disinfection methods in the prevention of microbiological non-compliances. We evaluated the analysis results of a total of 79 087 pool water samples taken from inspection semi-public and public swimming pools in Turkey, where chemical disinfection was used, for routine monitoring purposes in the first eight months of 2015 and 2016. The minimum non-compliance for the total numbers of colony, total coliform, E. coli and P. aeruginosa parameters was determined in pools where chlorine and chlorine compounds were used (0.9-1.0% and 0.4-1.1%, respectively) whereas the highest non-compliance was found in pools using hydrogen peroxide + biguanide (5.5-5.3% and 3.1-9.1%, respectively). The applied statistical tests revealed a statistically significant difference between disinfection methods in terms of non-compliance frequency of all microbiological parameters (p < 0.0000001). This study found that chlorine in semi-public and public pools to be more effective against microbiological pollution than other chemical disinfection methods. This result is extremely important as it emphasises that other methods may be a suitable option in small, domestic pools with low user density whereas chlorine should be the primary preference especially in semi-public and public pools with high user density.																	1311-5065						2017	18	3					1231	1237										WOS:000417113200040

Monoalgal axenic cultures were treated for 10 days under controlled conditions with different concentrations (from 0.1 mu M to 100 mu M) of glufosinate (a nonselective contact herbicide that inhibits glutamine synthase activity, thus disturbing photorespiration, inhibiting photosynthetic carbon assimilation, and generating ammonium excess in plant cells). S. opoliensis was found to be a better indicator of adverse effects of glufosinate than S. acuminatus. Changes in the ground chlorophyll fluorescence (reflecting light energy harvesting capacity), in cell division rate and in chlorophyll-a content may be early, costeffective and sensitive markers of herbicide impact on microalgal communities inhabiting polluted water. Our results bring new data concerning the need of selection among related test organisms based on differentiated tolerance, as well as concerning biochemical parameters suitable for evaluation of water pollution impact when organic xenobiotics accumulate in aquatic environments. Thus, the presented results may be applied in optimizing bioindication of water quality using microalgae, and in treatment of wastewater polluted due to agricultural practices.																	1224-7154						2017	62	3					239	250		10.24193/subbchem.2017.3.20								WOS:000417267000021

The developer applied to the Department of Environment (DOE) Johor in July 2008 for approval of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) report for the overall Medini development. A conditional approval of the EIA report was granted by the DOE subject to some conditions, one of which stipulated that sewage effluent from the centralized sewage treatment plant (STP) is not permitted to be discharged into Sungai Pendas. A suitable location for the discharge of sewage into the Selat Johor is to be identified, based on a hydraulic and water quality modelling investigation. This modelling investigation aims to assess the impact of the discharge of treated sewage effluent on the marine water quality and on aquatic life in the Selat Johor. The supplementary EIA report was submitted to the DOE. Approval was granted in December 2011 for the construction of the marine sewage outfall and its operations. This paper presents the sampling and simulation results for key hydraulic and environmental parameters suitable for sustaining acceptable faecal coliform criteria in Selat Johor.

In doing so, this article represents a clear contribution to both the literature on non-market valuation and public policy regarding the preservation of water quality. The results show that a one-unit increase in satisfaction with the state of water bodies an individual has visited, is associated with a 1.6 per cent greater likelihood to report being very satisfied with their life. This positive link is robust to the estimation technique employed and a range of control variables. We find the value depends greatly on the functional form imposed on income. Specifically, the use of a cube root functional form yields an implicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimate of NZD 11,003, approximately half the size of the base model estimate. Uniquely, we couch this point estimate in the context of a broader distribution of implicit WTP estimates. It is hoped that these results will inform future applications and development of the experienced preference method and support public policy.																	1448-6563	2159-5356					2017	24	4					423	440		10.1080/14486563.2017.1378134								WOS:000417164400007

Devolli River's source is in the southwestern corner of the Devoll municipality. It joins the Osum near Kucove, to form the Seman. The aim of this study is to assess the microbiological quality of the air around the urban area of Berat district which contributes to the river's statement and the quality of citizen's life. Sampling period was settled between 10: 00 am12: 00 pm from June to August 2016 and each sample was performed on the sunny days with similar climatic conditions to reduce the measurement uncertainty resulted from weather variations. Technique applied to assess the air quality was the sedimentation technique as culture settling plates using plate count agar. Microorganisms were captured on Petri dishes with appropriate cultivation agars. After sampling, the agar plates were immediately transported to the laboratory for incubation. It was observed that meteorological factors influence on the variation of the concentrations of air borne bacteria, also air pollution contributes in the water quality of rivers of Berat district.																	2224-4980					JAN	2017	7	1					135	140										WOS:000417182400019

Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the primary factors that can affect the planktonic community with emphasis on temperature rise and oxygen depletion. Sampling was conducted in Blanakan, West Java. Samples were assessed to determine levels of planktonic community and other water quality parameters. DO was monitored in situ along with pH and temperature. Based on the results, the temperature average in ponds was 31.88 +/- 1.93 degrees C and ranged from 29.0 to 35.0 degrees C. The DO average was 7.63 +/- 0.59 mg/l and ranged from 7.0 to 8.5 mg/l. The rise of pond temperature affected slighltyto the DO and had reduced the DO level to the lowest level (7.0-7.2 mg/l) when temperature reached its peak at 32.5-35.0 degrees C. The results showed that the oxygen depletion will significantly reduce the phytoplankton population (r(2)=0.54). However, the oxygen depletion did not affect the plankton diversity. The results revealedthe presence of 23 genera of phytoplankton and 18 genera for zooplankton in Blanakan ponds. Nitzchia and Pleurosigma were known as genera that can adapt both in the DOmin and DOmax environment (7.0-8.5 mg/l).

Based on the investigation of phytoplankton in 14 samples of the waters among Xiaowutai Mountain in August 2016, the species composition, evenness, abundance and diversity of phytoplankton in the Xiaowutai Mountain were studied, and then evaluated the quality conditions of water. The results showed that the samples collected from the phytoplankton survey in the Xiaowutai Mountain were identified by microscopic observation. There were 108 species of 8 phyla, among which the dominant species of cyanobacteria species accounted for 41 species, accounting for 37.96% of all species, followed by diatoms and green algae. Dominant species are mainly Microcystis flos-aquae, Anbaena circinalis, Melosira sp., Oedogonium sp., Closterium sp. There is unique geographical environment among Xiaowutai Mountain. It is a national nature reserve and is rated as the national AA level tourist scenic spot. The ecological types of phytoplankton are varied. The Diversity index was 0.687 - 4.905. The degree of evenness was 0.226 - 1.637 and the richness were 2.389 - 8.564.4. The diversity evenness and richness index were fluctuated in August (the wet season). The results show that most of the sampling points are not highly nutritious and the water quality is good.																	2352-5401		978-94-6252-328-9				2017	129						776	779										WOS:000414083700159

Development and Field Application of a Model Predicting Effects of Episodic Hypoxia on Short-Term Growth of Spot	MARINE AND COASTAL FISHERIES												In North Carolina and elsewhere, there is concern that excessive nutrient loading and resulting hypoxic conditions in coastal ecosystems are adversely affecting the native fauna, but quantifying the effects on fish can be difficult. Hypoxia may reduce fish growth via direct exposure or indirectly (e.g., cost of low-oxygen avoidance, reduced food availability, and density-dependent effects in oxygenated refuges). Given the fine spatial and temporal scale of oxygen dynamics in estuarine habitats, evaluating the impacts of hypoxia on fish growth requires short-term growth indicators that integrate the effects of rapidly changing environmental conditions. To address this need, we experimentally determined the sensitivity and response time of a suite of bioindicators of recent growth (RNA: DNA ratio and RNA concentration in muscle tissue; insulin-like growth factor-I messenger RNA expression in the liver; hepatosomatic index; and Fulton's condition factor K) to changes in the specific growth rate of juvenile Spot Leiostomus xanthurus. A model based on multiple bioindicators was better at estimating growth rate than models based on single indicators. We used this model to estimate recent growth rates of juvenile Spot collected from the Neuse River estuary and related them to recent dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions. Estimated growth rates of Spot collected after a week of good DO conditions were almost twice those of Spot collected after a week of poor DO conditions. Using these results and DO data from the Neuse River estuary in 2007-2010, we estimated that hypoxia dynamics reduced Spot growth over the summer by 6-18% in these years relative to growth under constant good DO conditions. This approach can be used to evaluate impacts of observed or modeled scenarios of water quality dynamics on growth of juvenile Spot and serves as a template for development of predictive growth models for other species.																	1942-5120						2017	9	1					504	520		10.1080/19425120.2017.1362492								WOS:000417037900012

These problems include the destruction of the river ecosystem, decreased the quality of river water quality, increased water pollution load, and another effect on capacity and power support river. The Lambidaro River is one of the rivers found in Palembang, where the inhabitants who live around it take advantage of the existence of this river to meet their daily needs such as bathing, washing, and latrines. The purpose of this research is to know the influence of mining activities towards sustainability of the power support and capacity of the river. The method used in this research is to compare the availability of water and water needs of the population in determining the status of environmental power support based on regulation of the state minister of the environment number 17 in 2009 about the determination of the power guidance support environment in spatial regions, as well as using the index method of pollution based on the decision of the State Minister of the environment number 115 in 2003 about the determination of the status of water quality guidelines with parameters measured are TDS, TSS, pH, DO, COD, dan BOD5. The results of the calculation of the power support river are deficit where SA (34,200,655.64 m(3)/year) < DA (253,105,600 m(3)/year). The result of pollution index calculation at 5 water sampling locations shows that the condition of a river is in good condition (uncontaminated) and mild pollutant.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1591-1				2017	1903								UNSP 040015	10.1063/1.5011534								WOS:000416965000054

In this study, a new multivariate analysis approach integrating the maximum likelihood estimation structural equation modelling (ML-SEM) with neural network method is proposed. Twenty-seven variables indicating water quality from 2005 to 2012 were derived from the Dongting Lake Ecological Environment Monitoring Center of Hunan Province. The results showed that: (1) temperature (T) and hydraulic gradient (HG) had the most positive influence on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) with a sensitivity ratio of 1.218 and 1.039, respectively, (2) transparency (SD) had the most negative effect on Chl-a concentration and (3) Chl-a increased quickly and reached the highest level when total phosphorus (TP) levels were from 0.08 mg/L to 0.12 mg/L. These results would provide guidance for eutrophication control strategies for Dongting Lake. By combining ML-SEM with artificial intelligence technique such as neural network, this study examined the causal and nonlinear relationships involved in the eutrophication process.																	0957-4352	1741-5101					2017	62	1					31	52		10.1504/IJEP.2017.10009295								WOS:000416899000003

An auto-regressive-moving-average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) model is designed and tested based on the dataset. The model takes into account the effect of the measured water characteristics and nutrient level information. Through this study, it is demonstrated that the developed dynamical model can be used for estimating the fluorescence level (which characterises the phytoplankton biomass) and for predicting the various states of phytoplankton bloom. Thus, the developed model can be used for monitoring phytoplankton biomass in the water which in turn might give information about an unbalanced ecosystem or change in water quality.

Four sites were sampled regularly every month for one year. Simultaneously, pH and temperature were measured continuously. The concentration of ammonia nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen were determined by subsequent analysis of the water samples. The results were classified in compliance with Government Decree (GD) No. 401/2015 Coll., as amended, and Czech standard CSN 75 7221. High concentrations of ammonia nitrogen that were detected during the whole period are the result of the discharge of all wastewater from the village of Dolni Cermna to flow Cermna. Although the results showed a positive effect pond Cermensky, during the growing season the concentration of ammonia nitrogen at SP No. 2 placed under the pond increased mainly due to fertilizing pond by manure to increase nutrients for the fish population in the pond.

The EPS coats fishing lines and blocks water filters. The phenomenon was first noticed in Lake Wanaka in the early 2000s and has recently been reported in Lakes Coleridge and Wakatipu, with single, isolated historical events occurring in Lakes Waikaremoana (confirmed) and Benmore (presumed). The species has been reported from a handful of other lakes in New Zealand, all except one of which are microtrophic-to-oligotrophic. Light and ultrastructural microscopic studies of New Zealand populations, DNA sequencing and comparison with published descriptions identify the causative species as Lindavia intermedia, part of the 'bodanicoid' complex. These species are best known from the Northern Hemisphere where they are regarded as confined to nutrient-poor habitats, frequently having disappeared from European lakes as the lakes underwent eutrophication. Lake snow is known from a small number of other lakes in the Northern Hemisphere, but no evidence has been reported linking L. intermedia to the production of lake snow in these lakes. The expected growth characteristics (slow and at depth) of L. intermedia pose difficulties for any prospective containment campaign.																	0028-825X	1175-8643					2017	55	4					479	495		10.1080/0028825X.2017.1377263								WOS:000416595400008

The effects of Biorock-associated electric fields on the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi) and the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas)	ANIMAL BIOLOGY												Healthy coral reefs are biologically diverse and provide vital ecosystem services. However, decreasing water quality and global warming are key contributors to coral reef decline, which poses substantial environmental threats. In response to this degradation, an innovative coral reef restoration technology, called Biorock, utilizes weak direct current electric fields to cause limestone deposition on conductive materials, inevitably inducing prolific coral reef growth. Although expediting coral growth, research on how the associated electric fields may impact the behavioural patterns of teleosts and/or organisms (i.e. elasmobranchs) possessing electroreception capabilities is lacking. Therefore, we studied the behavioural responses of two shark species, the bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) and the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi) and multiple teleost species towards weak direct current electric fields in Bimini, Bahamas. Generalized linear mixed model analyses based on 90 trials illustrate that both the feeding and avoidance behaviors of C. leucas and C. perezi were significantly associated with treatment type, with the weak experimental electrode treatments resulting in the greatest quantity of avoidances and fewest feedings for both species. However, data analyses illustrate that teleost feeding behavior was not observably impacted by experimental treatments. Although the Biorock technology exhibits promise in coral reef restoration, the findings from this study illustrate a need for future large-scale studies assessing shark behavioral patterns around these devices, since the deterrence of apex predators may impact ecosystem balance.																	1570-7555	1570-7563					2017	67	3-4					191	208		10.1163/15707563-00002531								WOS:000416858400001

INFLUENCE OF STOCKING DENSITY ON THE PRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE OF ANGELFISH (Pterophyllum scalare) REARED IN CAGES	BOLETIM DE INDUSTRIA ANIMAL												The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of stocking density on the performance of angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare) reared at different densities for 60 days in water tanks containing cages. A completely randomized designed consisting of three treatments (2.33, 4.66 and 9.33 fish/L) and five replicates was adopted, totaling 105 experimental units. The hydrological variables remained within the standards recommended for the species, regardless of stocking density. Stocking density exerted a significant effect (P<0.05) on survival rate (%). In this respect, animals housed at a lower density exhibited higher survival, while an increase in density negatively affected survival rate. There was a significant effect (P<0.05) of treatment on length uniformity and feed conversion. The best productive performance of angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare) including better feed conversion, survival and length and weight uniformity is observed at the lowest stocking density (2.33 fish/L).																	0067-9615	1981-4100					2017	74	3					156	161		10.17523/bia.v74n3p156								WOS:000416750900002

In view of this, it was cut to one yuan Chebyshev neural network expansion proposed multivariate Chebyshev neural network model, and Chebyshev polynomials orthogonal gives rapid weight determined on the basis of the algorithm. Simulation results show that, compared to conventional multi-layer perceptron neural network, the method in computational accuracy and speed, etc. There are obvious advantages. Traditional BP neural network learning algorithm is based on the idea of the return error. As for the specific network model, the pseudo-inverse thinking can be directly determined weights and thus avoid the conventional iterative process of amendment. A Chebyshev orthogonal basis neural network, the model three-tier structure based on polynomial interpolation and approximation theory structure and a set of Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial as a function of hidden layer neuron activation function. Based on the error return (BP) can be deduced ideological weight update iteration formula of the network model, use this formula to obtain the optimal weights iterative training network. This is different from the classic approach for Chebyshev orthogonal basis neural network model we propose a method based on direct determination of the right pseudo-inverse value, thus avoiding the traditional methods of network weights by iterative training process can be lengthy. Simulation results show that this method has a faster computational speed and accuracy of at least the same work, which proves its superiority.																			978-1-946788-02-3				2017							25	31										WOS:000416978300004

Applications were confined to the winter period, at a time when soil moisture content was often at or very near to field capacity and was applied over two seasons. Cows were confined to the housing facility during winter only, and outside of this period they remained on pasture. Losses of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and the faecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) in surface runoff and subsurface drainage from the LRLD treatment were compared with losses from effluent applications that occurred during spring to autumn, at an application depth not exceeding the soil water deficit, i.e. a standard practice treatment (SP, typically 10-15 mm per application). The annual quantities of nutrients applied by the treatments and the grazing managements imposed were similar. Although winter losses of N were significantly greater for the LRLD treatment (15 vs. 8 kg N ha(-1) for the SP treatment), on an annual basis fluxes were similar between treatments (approximately 20 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Effluent management had no significant effect on the annual fluxes of P and E. coli although the latter varied considerably. Average contaminant fluxes over a 2-year period indicated that the LRLD management system did not lead to a significantly greater risk to water quality compared with standard practices.																	0028-8233	1175-8775					2017	60	4					449	469		10.1080/00288233.2017.1366344								WOS:000416776100007						
S	Angulo, J		Saldarriaga, J		Angulo, Jose			Barranquilla's Water Distribution System: A First Detailed Description	XVIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WDSA2016	Procedia Engineering				18th International Conference on Water Distribution System Analysis (WDSA)	JUL 24-28, 2016	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cartagena, COLOMBIA	Univ Andes, Water Supply & Sewers Syst Res Ctr	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn			Due to its great industrial and economic development, and its privileged geographical position, Barranquilla has always been one of the most important cities of Colombia. For this reason, Barranquilla is one of the most populated urban conglomerates in the country, having the obligation to ensure the coverage of public services to about 2 million people. Since 1992, the company Triple A S.A. E.S.P. has been responsible to manage, design and operate the Water Distribution System (WDS) that supplies treated water to the city, which must also supply water to 6 other municipalities in the region. To accomplish this task, the WDS has specialized facilities in each of the main stages of the process: collection, purification and distribution. Refering to collection, the system is able to take directly 7.5 m(3)/s from the Magdalena River, the principal waterway of Colombia. To achieve this, the system has a dock, a headrace channel and two pumping stations of low pressure. The water is conducted through cast iron and reinforced concrete pipes, from the pumping stations to treatment plants. To perform the potabilization process, the system has 5 Water Treatment Plants (WTPs) to ensure redundancy and security in the network. The plants have capacities ranging from 0.5 m(3)/s to 3 m(3)/s and its operations are based in the conventional treatment train of mixing-flocculation-coagulation-sedimentation-filtration-disinfection. Plant No. 5 can be highlighted, which has the largest capacity and consists of four modules. Regarding with the distribution, after the water potabilization process takes place in the main WTP, the treated water is pumped by the action of four high pressure pumping stations (6.5 m(3)/s including all the municipalities covered by the network) and is transported from the WTPs to other pumping stations located at strategic points in the city where the water is distributed to points of demand and also pumped again to another pump station located at a higher ground level to attend the new urbanizations in zones with higher elevations. This not allow a correct functioning of the distribution system by gravity. Additionally, Triple A has a laboratory of water quality control, accredited by ONAC (The National Agency for Accreditation of Colombia) and IDEAM (Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia) and authorized by the National Institute of Health in which all the characterizations required in the current Colombian legislation are performed. With the historical record of this monitoring, technical staff of Triple A is able to understand the dynamics of the river and variations in the water quality in order to identify changes that require the implementation of corrective actions.

However, these studies have focused in understanding mixing phenomena at junctions, without applying these results in water quality modeling of water distribution networks. This paper focuses on the application of both the complete and incomplete mixing models to model water quality in water distribution networks. Hydraulic networks are modelled in EPANET and EPANET-BAM, and the concentrations and their distributions are compared. Results show that there is little difference between the two mixing models, so water quality modeling might be done by using EPANET and its complete mixing model. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The DWDS offers reaction surfaces and contact time and, thus, acts as a bioreactor where biofilms develop that influence biomass dynamics. Under normal operational conditions the biofilm is in a steady state and the exchange of biomass between the biofilm and the bulk water phase is in equilibrium. When this equilibrium is disturbed, e.g. by a hydraulic incident, there is a potential of release of biomass from the biofilm leading to higher concentrations of biomass in the drinking water. This could lead to a discolouration event and may have an impact on microbial water quality. The main issue for a water company is to know where in the network the risk of these disturbances of the equilibrium is the largest and what control measures can be taken. The goal of our research is to combine and improve water quality models and a hydraulic network model to determine high and low risk locations in the DWDS with respect to bacterial biomass. As a first result a conceptual model, with parameter values based on internationally published laboratory and in situ measurements in the DWDS, has been developed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Extensive studies have acknowledged the risk posed to large populations by an accidental or intentional contamination intrusion within a WDS; failure of an early warning system (EWS) to report a contamination event carries profound economic and public health consequences. Dynamic, stochastic conditions exist in municipal WDSs and a monitoring system needs to be designed according to a robust protocol that incorporates the inherent uncertainty in WDS operation, including: demand variability, and contamination event characteristic variability. This work composes the problem of locating the best junctions within a WDS to place fixed monitoring stations, and the best junctions to input innovative inline mobile sensors, in a multi-objective framework that incorporates uncertainty in the network's demands and EWS operation. Mobile sensors are carried by flow within pipes sampling and monitoring water quality in real time, and wirelessly uploading data to fixed transceiver beacons, providing an implicit preference towards demand dense regions. A multi-objective noisy messy genetic algorithm is structured to the problem at hand and employed on a small, medium, and large-scale model WDS to calculate near-optimal solutions from the large solutions space. This multi-objective framework provides high performing trade off (Pareto) sets comparing an EWS's system cost to numerous performance objectives incorporating non-deterministic objective functions to provide a high performing and resilient EWS. Results show a large trade off surface between the cost and the respective system's performance, with large diminishing returns. Although implementing a more expensive solution may provide little to no benefit from a traditional performance standpoint, implementing a system of higher cost can increase the systems resiliency, highlighting the importance of incorporating proper objective measures in optimization procedure.

Predicting the formation of haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides by simulated distribution system tests	XVIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WDSA2016	Procedia Engineering				18th International Conference on Water Distribution System Analysis (WDSA)	JUL 24-28, 2016	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cartagena, COLOMBIA	Univ Andes, Water Supply & Sewers Syst Res Ctr	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn			Unintended chemical reactions between disinfectants and natural organic matter (NOM) or anthropogenic compounds in natural waters result in the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) during drinking water treatment. To date, numerous groups of disinfection by-products have been identified in drinking water, some of which are suspected to be of public health importance and thus are regulated in the water industry. Recent studies have suggested that some unregulated nitrogen-containing DBPs, such as haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloacetamides (HAcAms), may have greater toxicity than the currently regulated groups (trihalomethanes, THMs, and haloacetic acids, HAAs). There is only sparse information on the behaviour of the HANs and HAcAms in distribution systems. It is however known that HANs can be hydrolysed to the HAcAms, which in turn can hydrolyse to form dihaloacetic acids (DHAAs). Simulated distribution systems tests (SDS) have been successfully applied to predict the formation of THMs and HAAs using a simple and inexpensive lab-based technique, and have been recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to American water utilities for collecting information about the levels of DBPs occurring in their distribution systems. SDS tests aim to simulate the water quality, disinfectant residuals, and water ages of a real distribution system, allowing easy sampling at prescribed time intervals for analysis of DBP formation. These tests are also a useful tool for considering the impact of potential changes to distribution practices, such as switching from chlorination to chloramination, for example. Therefore, a sampling survey was conducted in four surface water treatment plants in the UK to examine the formation of HANs and HAcAms in both real distribution systems and SDS tests. The samples were extracted using liquid-liquid extraction and analysed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). The research sought to determine whether SDS can be a useful predictive tool for HANs and HAcAms in distribution systems and what levels of prediction error are to be expected. (C) 2016 The Authors.

DL has been widely applied to big data analytics, graphics object detection, classification, voice recognition and many other problems. This paper presents an integrated data-driven modelling framework that couples DL with the well-developed evolutionary optimization tool in a scalable and heterogeneous high performance computing paradigm. The integrated framework enables modellers to effectively and efficiently construct a model with a given dataset. It is demonstrated that the framework has wide applicability including but not limited to the simulation, optimization and operation decision of water distribution systems. The paper elaborates the development of the deep learning framework with potential applications of facilitating the data fusion, system simulation and predictive analysis, anomaly detection from the time series data (pressures, flows and consumptions etc.), water usage prediction, construction of a meta-model as a surrogate to the physics-based models (hydraulic and water quality) for water distribution management.

Exact skeletonization method in water distribution systems for hydraulic and quality models	XVIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WDSA2016	Procedia Engineering				18th International Conference on Water Distribution System Analysis (WDSA)	JUL 24-28, 2016	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cartagena, COLOMBIA	Univ Andes, Water Supply & Sewers Syst Res Ctr	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn			A mathematical model is a powerful tool for simulating different scenarios that occur in a water distribution network without making physical experimentation. According to the objectives, a model can be classified into three categories: layout, design and operation. Furthermore, the level of detail is strongly related to the objective that the model tries to achieve. However, bigger amount of information does not mean better accuracy. For example, a fully detailed mathematical model of the network would lead to know every single connection. Usually, this information is so difficult to compile as imprecise. Therefore, one of the most important stages in elaborating a model consists of the model simplification, also known as skeletonization. During the works made for model skeletonization some assumptions are made. Most of the times, these assumptions may produce significant errors. Among the different techniques for network skeletonization, series pipe removal is one of the most used. It consists of replacing several adjacent pipes with a single one which must present the same head losses than the pipes being substituted. When there are no intermediate consumptions the problem has been effectively solved. The problem arises when a demand appears in one of the pipes being removed. It has been demonstrated that methods which assume constant roughness coefficients (either Hazen-Williams or Darcy equations) produce errors in the head losses. These errors may be even higher if travel time is included as a restriction, for example in water quality models. This paper reviews the most common techniques for serial pipes association. The error will be evaluated in both hydraulic and quality models. Finally, a method for exact substitution of serial pipes with intermediate demands is proposed. This method imposes two restrictions (head losses and travel time) and gives exact results when the flow direction is known. The method is tested with an example that highlights the results.

With some exceptions, at most nodes in a model, complete mixing occurs and the concentration after mixing can be given by a standard materials balance equation. This paper used benchtop batch mixing tests and a lab scale physical model of a water distribution system to test the hypothesis that standard water quality models based on a simple materials balance can be used to track turbidity through a water system. The results showed that as long as the components being mixed had similar concentration vs. Turbidity relationships, a materials balance was accurate but the accuracy decreased as the particle properties of the components differed.

In the present work the possibility to reduce the vulnerability of the population exposed to TTHMs by the optimal operational interventions in water distribution systems is explored. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem with two objective functions, the number of the operations and the maximum TTHMs concentration that occurs at each node in the network during time, both to minimize. The feasible operational actions concern opening/closing valves and hydrants and turning pumping stations for a fixed time. The AMGA 2 optimizer [2] is used herein for solving the problem, coupled with a module coded in C++, where the implementation of the EPANET Programmers Toolkit functions allows to run the hydraulic and water quality simulations and to calculate the objective functions.

Three failure modes were considered for examining the risk. The risk has been defined imitating the original definition of Hashimoto's vulnerability, and expressed as the failure magnitude with respect to each level of service provided at a certain location and during a certain period of time. When assessing the risk rather than focusing on just one aspect the overwhelming task has been used for better evaluation and mitigation of the overall risk. The model was developed using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) coupled with Fuzzy Set Theory. The first assigns weight for each kind of risk that reflects its relative importance among the other risks. The second is a fuzzy building methodology that employs the assigned weight and others external information to harmonize all risks into a unique platform and allow one to obtain the system's overall risk. The model has been implemented and tested through the real network of Matera city. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Extending EPANET capabilities with Add-In Tools	XVIII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, WDSA2016	Procedia Engineering				18th International Conference on Water Distribution System Analysis (WDSA)	JUL 24-28, 2016	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Cartagena, COLOMBIA	Univ Andes, Water Supply & Sewers Syst Res Ctr	Univ Andes, Dept Civil & Environm Engn			EPANET is probably the most widespread model for water distribution network (WDN). More than twenty years after its appearance, it has become a global reference both for hydraulic and quality analysis of water networks. In 2000, EPANET 2 appears, which includes as most important computational feature a new Toolkit. This toolkit was a library of functions allowing the modification of network data and reading results without access to the appropriate files. Over time, the use of this library has been the communication protocol for every application developers who use the method propose by Todini and Pilati to analyze the behavior of WDN. This library also provides interface tools that allow the execution of a simulation from an external application, as long as the network characteristics had been previously defined. This paper presents a change in the original EPANET model, including a new menu in the graphical user interface (GUI). This menu allows users to set up a personal collection of Add-In tools, which use both project data and simulation results. These tools can be customized and allows to extend the analysis capability of EPANET. All of them can access EPANET functions through the Toolkit and were developed by the authors during the Spanish translation of EPANET, taking into account the homologous Add-in tools developed for SWMM model. As an example of the operation and capabilities of this new menu, several applications integrated as EPANET add-in tools are presented. These tools perform tasks such as importing data network from both CAD and GIS systems, the design of WDNs using genetic algorithms, automatic assignment of initial water quality to network nodes; the skeletonization of a network or optimization of pumping schedule in the network in order to achieve a minimum energy cost.

Improving the performance of the EPT Index to accommodate multiple stressors in Afrotropical streams	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) may be skewed by the wide tolerance to multiple stressors of the Baetid, Caenid and Hydropsychid families, which affects the performance of the EPT index as an indicator of multiple stressors in aquatic ecosystems. The effect of the BCH families on the EPT index was evaluated and alternatives were considered to improve its performance. The hypothesis that the removal of the BCH families improves sensitivity of the EPT index to human-induced stressors in streams and rivers was tested. Macroinvertebrates were collected in January-March 2009 at 22 sites in the Nyando and Nzoia Rivers, Lake Victoria basin, Kenya. Nine derivatives and modifications of the EPT index were tested for responses to a disturbance gradient, ranked into three condition categories (reference, intermediate and impaired). The sensitivity of the proportionate abundance derivative of the EPT index improved when the BCH families were removed, whereas that of the richness derivative improved marginally. Other modifications considered performed poorly when compared with the EPT-BCH metrics. Wide distribution of the BCH across all sites, irrespective of the level of disturbance, reduced the sensitivity of the EPT index in the studied streams. The removal of the BCH families enhanced the sensitivity of the index to multiple stressors in Afrotropical streams and rivers.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	3					219	233		10.2989/16085914.2017.1392282								WOS:000416745200002

Key factors that drive phytoplankton biomass and community composition in the urbanised Nahoon Estuary, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Estuaries are under intense pressure, because of urban developments and water abstraction. Water column characteristics of the Nahoon Estuary were examined in 2014-2015 to identify factors that influenced phytoplankton dynamics. The estuary was found to be saline (similar to 33) and remained well-oxygenated (similar to 6 mg l(-1)) throughout the current study. During this period, freshwater inflow into the estuary was minimal and chlorophyll a biomass was low (3.6 +/- 0.3 mu g l(-1) ). Nutrient concentration at Nahoon Estuary showed a linear relationship with salinity, indicative of a conservative behaviour. Phytoplankton dynamics were altered by fluctuations in nutrient levels, not necessarily in response to freshwater inflow. The impact of Nahoon Dam and destructive land-use alongside the Nahoon River decreases freshwater inflow and increases nutrient loading into the estuary. In terms of nutrient loading, the current study showed the importance of microalgae as indicators of the nutrient status of an estuary. The presence of cyanobacteria and high phytoplankton biomass in the upper reaches of the estuary confirms the input of excessive nutrients. The results of the current study clearly show that better management of both the Nahoon River and its catchment is vital to ensure the health of the system.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	3					245	257		10.2989/16085914.2017.1373058								WOS:000416745200004

Water quality assessment of the Siluko River, southern Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The water quality of the Siluko River, Edo State, Nigeria was investigated from March to August 2015 to determine its suitability for drinking and usage for domestic purposes. Water samples collected from three stations were tested for thirteen physico-chemical parameters using standard analytical procedures. Temperature, phosphate and chloride were significantly different across the three stations. All other parameters, with the exception of turbidity, dissolved oxygen and phosphate, were within the permissible limits recommended by the Nigerian Standard for Drinking Water Quality (NSDWQ) and World Health Organization (WHO). Water Quality Index (WQI) values ranged from 11.24 to 16.15, indicating excellent water quality. While the quality of the water from the Siluko River is suitable for drinking and domestic usage, to prevent future deterioration of the water, it is recommended that the regulating authorities monitor effluents discharged into the river from human activities.																	1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	3					279	286		10.2989/16085914.2017.1371579								WOS:000416745200007

A decade of drinking water advisories: Historical evidence of frequency, duration and causes	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Maintaining acceptable drinking water quality is a challenge in Canadian First Nations communities, resulting in many residents experiencing frequent drinking water advisories (DWAs). Detailed information about drinking water systems on reserves was combined with 11 years of advisory data to consolidate existing data sets and to understand historical trends. Patterns related to the frequency, duration and causes of advisories are summarized. The results show that the total number of DWAs has increased over the last decade despite recent attention, policy renewal and funding commitments. The frequency and duration of DWAs vary according to location, source type, system size and operator certification. Facilities relying on surface water have a higher likelihood of experiencing DWAs, and systems without fully trained operators are more likely to experience long-lasting DWAs. Findings indicate the need exists to maintain an up-to-date record of First Nations system information to close existing data gaps.																	0701-1784	1918-1817					2017	42	4					378	390		10.1080/07011784.2017.1387609								WOS:000416548800006

It surveyed a network of 49 organic sheep farmers and obtained technical, socioeconomic, and environmental findings. Compared to conventional systems, organic systems are less intensive (e.g., lower ewe productivity, farm income, concentrate levels). Environmental impacts (e.g., greenhouse-gas emissions, energy consumption, and water quality [per ha or per kg produced]) are generally equivalent or lower.

Restoring water quality in cash-crop regions via organic agriculture and renewed links with livestock farming	FOURRAGES												Long-term monitoring of nitrate fluxes has been carried out in 2 catchment areas, one in the Brie dairy region and the other on the Burgundy plateau. The results show that grain production systems-even those in which mineral fertilisers are carefully adjusted to track plant needs-lead to nitrogen loss and thus compromise continued water quality. Consequently, which alternative production systems should be employed? Using the soil surface balance (SSB) method, it is possible to estimate the long-term environmental loss of nitrogen from given production systems. Here, we thus evaluated pre-industrial systems utilised in the 1950s, intensive and organic farming systems utilised at present. Organic mixed croplivestock systems lost less nitrogen while maintaining respectable levels of agricultural performance. Such systems could be used to produce cheese (Brie) or sheep (Burgundy).																	0429-2766						2017		231					257	268										WOS:000416405300009

By analyzing the marine product quality and safety control, a standardized, intelligent and universal marine product quality safety traceability system is proposed based on the Internet of things technology and the characteristics of the seafood industry chain are analyzed. The process about "seedling purchase (seedling propagation) - seafood cultivation - seafood fishing - seafood processing - seafood sales" is selected as the main line, and sensors are used to collect seafood information. The final information is pooled into the seafood traceability data center. Companies can view the seafood traceability data in the traceability system, and consumers can obtain product traceability data by scanning the two-dimensional code of product packaging. The system adopts B/S model and SSH framework to complete system development. The experimental results show that the new system provides powerful technical support for marine product traceability and marine product quality safety management. Based on the above finding, it is concluded that the traceability system has been technically able to effectively improve the product management of marine fishery enterprises through the information management technology. At the same time, it lays a good foundation for the overall upgrading and reform of China's marine fishery industry.																	1868-1646	1861-2121					2017	13	9					132	139		10.3991/ijoe.v13i09.7590								WOS:000416624400011

Accurate measurements of these air pollutants and greenhouse gases are needed to support management and regulatory decisions. A mobile platform was developed to measure air emissions from tailings pond in the oil sands region of Alberta. The mobile platform was tested in 2015 in a municipal wastewater treatment lagoon. With a flux chamber and a CO2/CH4 sensor on board, the mobile platform was able to measure CO2 and CH4 emissions over two days at two different locations in the pond. Flux emission rates of CO2 and CH4 that were measured over the study period suggest the presence of aerobic and anaerobic zones in the wastewater treatment lagoon. The study demonstrated the capabilities of the mobile platform in measuring fugitive air emissions and identified the potential for the applications in air and water quality monitoring programs. Implications: The Mobile Platform demonstrated in this study has the ability to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fugitive sources such as municipal wastewater lagoons. This technology can be used to measure emission fluxes from tailings ponds with better detection of spatial and temporal variations of fugitive emissions. Additional air and water sampling equipment could be added to the mobile platform for a broad range of air and water quality studies in the oil sands region of Alberta.																	1096-2247	2162-2906					2017	67	11			SI		1205	1212		10.1080/10962247.2017.1285832								WOS:000416544400006	28152339

Lake and species specific patterns of non-diadromous recruitment in amphidromous fish: the importance of local recruitment and habitat requirements	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Understanding migratory life histories is critical for the effective management and conservation of migratory species. However, amphidromous migrations (fish hatch in streams, immediately migrate to the sea for a feeding period and return to fresh water as juveniles) remain understudied owing to the difficulties of tracking tiny larval fish. Despite this, it has widely been assumed that amphidromous fish have open, resilient populations, with marine-rearing larvae dispersing widely during their pelagic phase. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that when an alternative freshwater pelagic habitat is available, non-diadromous recruitment will be the dominant process in sustaining amphidromous fish populations, with implications for their connectivity and resilience. Otolith microchemical analyses of five species (three Galaxias (Galaxiidae), two Gobiomorphus (Eleotridae)) from paired systems on the South Island of New Zealand indicated that when a suitable freshwater pelagic habitat existed downstream, non-diadromous recruitment was the primary population-sustaining process, typically contributing >90% of recruits. In addition, not all species recruited from all lakes, indicating the importance of the largely unstudied role of species-specific amphidromous larval requirements. The results of the present study emphasise the need to better understand the dynamics of individual populations of amphidromous fish, and highlight the importance of understanding species-specific early life history requirements to fully understand their distributions and management needs.

Thus, quick and effective methods for detecting the abundance of cyanobacteria in waterbodies are needed to complement conventional laboratory methods. In addition, inadequate control techniques that are applied at times of high cyanobacterial concentrations can cause the cells to lyse and release toxins into the water. In the present study we investigated the behaviour of cyanobacteria by determining phycocyanin and chlorophyll concentrations, using spectroradiometric and fluorometric techniques, in three field campaigns performed at the Nova Avanhandava Reservoir, Brazil. The sampling rate and favourable season for data collected had been determined previously by remote sensing analysis. Seasonal estimates of cyanobacteria were made because fluorometric sensors were able to record low concentrations, whereas the spectral analyses only detected phycocyanin at higher concentrations. Results of spectral analyses highlighted the subtle spectral characteristics indicating the presence of phycocyanin, even without a clear definition of the diagnostic features in the reflectance curve. Therefore, multiscale remote sensing complemented by fluorometric analysis and relevant environmental variables is an effective approach for monitoring cyanobacteria in Brazilian inland waters.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	12					2344	2354		10.1071/MF16259								WOS:000416334800016

Both physico - chemical and phycological aspects are used to assess the quality of water and degree of pollution. Five different groups of algae were recorded in the River i.e. The phytoplankton is dominated by Bacillariophyceae followed by Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Zygnematophyceae. The species Chlorella, Closterium, Closteridium, Oedogonium, Anacystis, Fragilaria, Cymbella, Nitzschia, Cyclotella, Synedra, Navicula, Trachelomonas, Phacus, Euglena andSpirogyra were dominant, and they can be used as good indicators of water quality and pollution.																	0976-2612	2278-599X					2017	8	4					219	225										WOS:000416165800029

Of these hot springs Sinkosh, Ratopani and Paudwar are reported first time in this study. The water samples were analyzed for physical characters, major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K+), and major anions (Cl-, SO4(2-), NO3-, and HCO3-) and some trace elements e.g. Cu2+, Fe2+, F-, Hg2+, Se2-, B+, As3+, Cd2+ and NH4+. Physico-chemical results were compared with WHO and National Drinking Water Quality Standard (NDWQS) of Nepal. For balneotherapy suitability were compared to European Union (EU) and United States (US) spas standards. Temperature of the hot springs varied from 42.3 to 65.3 0C. The pH of the water samples in study area was slightly acidic to neutral (6.6 to 7.2) and electrical conductivity 1462 to 2368 mu S/cm. Piper diagram showed Na+ Cl- type water quality in all hot springs except Ratopani that shows "mixed" (Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl-) type water. Durov diagram revealed that, Bhurung and Ratopani hot springs water is in simple dissolution or mixing type, whereas Singha, Sinkosh and Paudwar hot springs possesses reverse ion exchange type. Schoeller diagram showed almost similar relative tendency of water in all the five hot springs. The hot springs water was above the permissible standard for drinking water, so water can be used only after certain treatment. On the other hand, all of the parameters were within the acceptable standards for balneotherapy.																	0976-2612	2278-599X					2017	8	4					699	709										WOS:000416165800092

Nineteen living species were collected in the lake (Darwinula stevensoni, Candona (Candona) candida, Candona (Neglecandona) angulata, Fabaeformiscandona fabaeformis, Pseudocandona marchica, Cypria ophtalmica, Ilyocypris gibba, I. salebrosa, I. getica, Cypridopsis vidua, Eucypris virens, Trajancypris clavata, Herpetocypris helenae, Heterocypris salina, H. incongruens, Isocypris beauchampi, Cyprideis torosa, Limnocythere inopinata, and L. stationis). All the identified species belong to the fresh-water Italian ostracod fauna but Cyprideis torosa is documented in an oligohaline athalassic lacustrine environment in Italy for the first time. The occurrence of Ilyocypris salebrosa represents the southernmost record in Italy and the westernmost in Eurasia. The recovery of Limnocythere stationis represents the westernmost record in Eurasia. The distribution of the different ostracods recovered in Lake Trasimeno is linked to the dominant physical and chemical parameters for each ecological niche. Physical and chemical data along with substratum type, grain-size and presence of aquatic macrophytes have been related to different ostracods using a multivariate analyses approach (NMDS, CCA, Spearman's rank correlation test). These results allow to differentiate several ecological niches within the lake and indicate that the main parameters affecting the ostracod assemblages are the aquatic macrophyte coverage, the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and, to a lesser extent, temperature and type of substrate. Cyprideis torosa and Candona (Neglecandona) angulata have been recovered both in the distal part of the lake and in the lakeshore area. In both cases they are associated with scarce or absent aquatic macrophytes and low amounts of TOC. The alternate dominance of these two species in the distal deeper assemblages seems to be mainly linked with the bottom oxygen availability, being C.(N.) angulata dominant in the most oxygen-depleted sediments and C. torosa dominant in higher oxygen conditions. Along the lakeshore area they are often discovered together with other prevailing species, such as Cypridopsis vidua that is common in very shallow to shallow (20-140 cm) sites with high TOC content, abundant macrophytes and algae, and Limnocythere inopinata, which dominates slightly deeper areas (around 150-210 cm) where the previous species are almost absent. The Spearman's rank correlation test showed significant positive correlation between some ostracods and macrophyte species.																	1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76	3					469	487		10.4081/jlimnol.2017.1478								WOS:000416222200003

They also play an invaluable role in the assimilation and removal of nutrients. Canna indica L, Iris tectorums, Lythrum salicaria L., Cyperus alternifolius were found to be highly effective in remediating high nutrient levels in an aquatic environment. In this paper, the four plants were planted in floating beds in a park pond-Fuzhuang, Hefei city. The nearby pond-Lianfang as control was unplanted. The results suggested that combination of four species emergent plants performed well in nutrients removal; the removal efficiencies for suspended solids (SS), turbidity, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) were 82.5%, 87.5%, 75%, 82.9% respectively, compared with the control. At the end of the test, it successfully transformed from V grade water-body to III grade water-body. Different periods of flowering could maintain longer landscape effect. This paper demonstrated that combination of emergent plants could form pleasant scenery as well as restore eutrophic landscape pond.																	1466-2132	1741-511X					2017	20	1-2					22	36										WOS:000416508600003

Suspended sediment has long been recognized as the largest sources of sea contaminant and must be considered as one of the important parameters in water quality of seawater. This research was to determine SSC from measured acoustic backscattered intensity of static and mobile ADCP. In this study, vertically mounted 400 kHz and 750 kHz static ADCP were deployed in Lembeh Strait, North Sulawesi. A mobile ADCP 307.2 kHz was also mounted on the boat and moved to the predefined cross-section, accordingly. The linear regression analysis of echo intensity measured by ADCP and by direct measurement methods showed that ADCP is a reliable method to measure SSC with correlation coefficient (r) 0.92. Higher SSC was observed in low water compared to that in high water and near port area compared to those in observed areas. All of this analysis showed that the combination of static and mobile ADCP methods produces reasonably good spatial and temporal data of SSC.

Citizen science participation in research in the environmental sciences: key factors related to projects' success and longevity	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												The potential impacts of citizen science initiatives are increasing across the globe, albeit in an imbalanced manner. In general, there is a strong element of trial and error in most projects, and the comparison of best practices and project structure between different initiatives remains difficult. In Brazil, the participation of volunteers in environmental research is limited. Identifying the factors related to citizen science projects' success and longevity within a global perspective can contribute for consolidating such practices in the country. In this study, we explore past and present projects, including a case study in Brazil, to identify the spatial and temporal trends of citizen science programs as well as their best practices and challenges. We performed a bibliographic search using Google Scholar and considered results from 2005-2014. Although these results are subjective due to the Google Scholar's algorithm and ranking criteria, we highlighted factors to compare projects across geographical and disciplinary areas and identified key matches between project proponents and participants, project goals and local priorities, participant profiles and engagement, scientific methods and funding. This approach is a useful starting point for future citizen science projects, allowing for a systematic analysis of potential inconsistencies and shortcomings in this emerging field.

In order to gain deeper understanding of biological processes in Israel's freshwater ecosystems and to develop a bioindication system, species have to be known and characterised at all life stages. Here, we applied an integrative morphological and genetic approach to characterise caddisflies of the genus Hydropsyche Pictet, 1834 from the Lake Kinneret catchment. Seventeen sites in the Lake Kinneret catchment were sampled in spring/summer 2015 and 2016. For 77 hydropsychid larvae and two adult specimens of H. yahfufah Malicky, 2001, we analysed a 658bp fragment of the mitochondrial COI gene and compared the results of different genetic species delimitation methods to observed morphological variation. Our results suggest the presence of at least five species. This study is an important first step towards assessing stream biodiversity of a yet largely understudied region and highlights advantages of integrative taxonomic approaches.																	0165-0424	1744-4152					2017	38	3					125	140		10.1080/01650424.2017.1351567								WOS:000415994200003

The present study quantifies trace elements such as As, Ba, Cu, Cd, Cr, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb, and Zn, as well as pH and electrical conductivity (EC), in condensed atmospheric water vapor at three localities in Mexico. Atmospheric water vapor was condensed with an atmospheric water generator prototype. A total of 108 samples were obtained from three survey sites over the course of two seasons (wet and dry) during day/night shifts. The concentration of heavy metals was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The pH and EC parameters were measured with a potentiometer/conductometer. We found Pb, Fe, and Cd in 91.66, 58.33, and 33% of the samples, respectively, at concentrations exceeding those permitted by the World Health Organization (WHO) for water intended for human consumption. Both pH and EC were within the limits established by the Department of Water Affairs of Namibia. The concentrations of trace metals in condensed atmospheric water vapor samples were within the maximum permissible limits determined by WHO for most elements analyzed in this study.

Using BP neural network method with the combination of purelin, logsig, and tansig activation functions is proposed for the prediction of aquaculture's dissolved oxygen. The input layer, hidden layer, and output layer are introduced in detail including the weight adjustment process. The breeding data of three ponds in actual 10 consecutive days were used for experiments; these ponds were located in Beihai, Guangxi, a traditional aquaculture base in southern China. Thedata of the first 7 days are used for training, and the data of the latter 3 days are used for the test. Compared with the common prediction models, curve fitting (CF), autoregression (AR), grey model (GM), and support vector machines (SVM), the experimental results show that the prediction accuracy of the neural network is the highest, and all the predicted values are less than 5% of the error limit, which can meet the needs of practical applications, followed by AR, GM, SVM, and CF. The prediction model can help to improve the water quality monitoring level of aquaculture which will prevent the deterioration of water quality and the outbreak of disease.																	1076-2787	1099-0526					2017									4967870	10.1155/2017/4967870								WOS:000412592600001

A CASE STUDY FROM THE MESOPOTAMIAN MARSHES, IRAQ	ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION ENGINEERING												Water quality status of marshes within Mesopotamia has been investigated, and temporal and spatial changes determined by examining causes and effects. Data gathered from pre-desiccation and after re-flooding periods were subjected to index and statistical analysis. The quality of waters in the region was assigned to polluted class, regarding specific salinity related parameters. Total dissolved solids, chloride and sulfate were main variables negatively impacting the water quality. The main quality parameters creating spatial differences between the selected marshes were electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids. Temporal differences in dissolved oxygen, salinity, nitrate and phosphate concentrations between the 1980's and 2000's reflected the impact of desiccation and water shortage on the marshes. Salinity and nutrient concentrations generally increased after desiccation compared to their historical levels. These findings indicated that the Mesopotamian marshes had poor water quality due to increase in the concentration of salinity. The study revealed that the index and statistical methods are useful tools identifying water quality and fingerprinting pollution. This will help decision makers to establish strategic and comprehensive water management plans.																	0324-8828						2017	43	3					21	37		10.5277/epe170302								WOS:000416201200002

The authors examined separate river stretches representing maximum changes in the hydraulic gradient and investigated the dependence of variations in the concentrations of biogenic nutrients on river flow velocity, i.e., turbulence, defining it by the Reynolds criterion. The calculation of the coefficient of self-purification provides that the river flowing downstream is 100% self-purified and removes all nitrates and 61% of phosphates. The content of dissolved oxygen at the confluence of the river in spring was by 5.5% larger than that at the headwaters, whereas in the summer season, the difference in the content of dissolved oxygen in river water between the headwaters and confluence increased and made 25%. The conducted research has disclosed that the dynamics of river flow affects water quality, and therefore, for selecting monitoring places, land use structure or economic entities situated around the sampling point as well as the nature of the river flow itself must be considered.																	0324-8828						2017	43	3					81	91		10.5277/epe170305								WOS:000416201200005

For this purpose, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes were used in a cross-flow laboratory equipment. The permeate fluxes at the steady state were determined, and the resistances to the permeate flux were established. It was found that the inherent resistance of the clean membranes provided a much larger resistance than the fouling resistance. The retention coefficients for each individual contaminant were evaluated, as well as the retention coefficients referred to three water quality parameters: absorbance at 254 nm, COD and TOC. These parameters provide the effectiveness of the filtration processes for the elimination of the organic matter present in the selected water matrices.

Using annual and storm-event datasets, this paper explores the hypothesis that key suspended sediment variables increase along a land-use disturbance gradient in hilly terrain in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo). Five small (1.7-4.6 km(2)) catchments of increasing disturbance history - primary forest, old growth virgin jungle reserve, twice-logged forest, multiple-logged forest and mature oil palm - were instrumented from late 2011 with dataloggers and sensors to record river stage, turbidity and rainfall. The oil palm catchment had 4-12 times greater mean discharge-weighted SSC (587 mg L-1), annual sediment yield (1128 t km(-2) y(-1)), median event peak SSC, and duration of SSC above 1000 mg L-1 than in the other catchments. The multiple-logged catchment (last logged around 2004) has SSC characteristics close to values for primary forest, possibly due to increased ground protection against erosion afforded by low understorey regrowth and/or depletion of erodible sediment by multiple logging episodes. Results demonstrate that in hilly terrain even heavily logged rainforest has high value in safeguarding water quality and reducing erosion, whereas oil palm requires careful land management, especially of road runoff and ground cover.																	1882-3416						2017	11	1					79	84		10.3178/hrl.11.79								WOS:000416311100013

One of the major problems is abundance of agricultural product during the peak of harvest season that is not matched by an increase in demand of agricultural product by consumers, this causes a wasted agricultural products. Alternative way was food preservation by freeze dried method. This method was already using heat transfer through conduction and convection to reduce water quality in the food. The main objective of this research was to design a model heat and mass transfer in freeze-dried medium. We had two steps in this research, the first step was design of medium as the heat injection site and the second was simulate heat and mass transfer of the product. During simulation process, we use physical property of some agriculture product. The result will show how temperature and moisture distribution every second.

Many techniques have been introduced to make this stage easier, and one of them is bibliometric analysis. The following paper is the second part of our bibliometric project in the search for a gap in the water resources research in Jakarta. This paper starts to analyse the visualisations that had been extracted from the previous paper based on our database. Using the keyword "groundwater Jakarta", we managed to get 70 relevant papers. Several visualisations have been built using open source applications. Word cloud analysis shows that the trend to discuss groundwater in scientific sense had only been started in the early 2000's. This is presumably due to the emerging regional autonomy in which forcing regions to understand their groundwater setting before creating a management strategy. More papers in the later time has been induced by more geo-hazards (land subsidence and floods) resulted in the vast groundwater pumping. More and more resources have been utilized to get more groundwater data. Water scientists by then understood that these hazards had been started long before the 2000's. This had become the starting point of data era later on. The next era will be the era of water management. Hydrologists had been proposing integrated water management Jakarta and its nearby groundwater basins. Most of them have been strongly suggested to manage all water bodies, rainfall, surface water, and groundwater as one system. In the 2010's we identify more papers are discussing in water quality following the vast discussion in water quantity in the previous era. People have been more aware the importance of quality in providing water system for the citizen. Then five years later, we believe that water researchers have also put their mind in the interactions between surface water and groundwater, especially in the riverbank, where most of the slums are located. Based on the results, we believe that more researches to understand interactions between groundwater and surface water would fill the gap to come up with better water management system in Jakarta.																	1742-6588						2017	877								UNSP 012033	10.1088/1742-6596/877/1/012033								WOS:000414154800033

There is a strong connection between people and water, as well as a need to appreciate the social factors associated with the unique cultural and socioeconomic factors that the provision of drinking water has for Aboriginal communities. We used a mixed method design within a community-based participatory action Research (PAR) framework. Water hardness and parental influence were the key factors associated with participants' decisions to drink rainwater. This study provides important insights for water supply authorities when assessing health risks and when choosing appropriate mitigation measures for water quality improvement programs in Aboriginal communities.																	1916-5781						2017	8	3							4	10.18584/iipj.2017.8.3.4								WOS:000416090900004

Achialum, Meupi, and Ala'amiti quarters in Awing depend on springs as the major source of drinking water and inhabitants consume it in its natural state without prior assessment and treatment. Water samples were collected from Achialum, Meupi, and Ala'amiti and analysed for organoleptic, physicochemical, and bacteriological parameters using standard methods. Results of organoleptic and physicochemical parameters showed that most of the parameters fell below WHO limits. Water quality index results, based on physicochemical parameters only, showed that Achialum and Ala'amiti springs were of good quality while Meupi spring was of poor quality. Water quality index may not carry enough information about the real quality situation since a single bad parameter value can give misleading information about the water quality. However, the bacteriological aspect revealed the presence of faecal coliforms and pathogenic bacteria in all the springs that justified the high rate of water borne diseases recorded in the area. This poor water quality could be associated to poor hygiene and farming practices. Thus, the population of Awing should implement home water treatment methods such as boiling, filtration, or chlorination before consumption.

Cormorant predation overlaps with fish communities and commercial-fishery interest in a Swedish lake	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The increase of the fish-eating cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) in Europe has resulted in conflicts with fisheries. In Lake Roxen, Sweden, cormorants are blamed for causing a decrease in fishery catches. To study and describe the potential effects that cormorants may have had on fish in the lake, their diet was analysed in relation to fish catches in gill-net surveys and fishery catches. Estimates of predation were achieved by 'tag and recovery' on eel, pike-perch and perch. Cormorants predated on the most common species and sizes, which were mainly smaller perch, ruffe and roach (mean sizes of 9, 8 and 13 cm respectively). Tag recoveries from perch, eel and pike-perch detected predation estimates of 14, 7 and 15% respectively. From a highly eutrophic state, the lake has shown improvements in water quality and a development towards larger predatory fish was expected, but the results from gill-net surveys did not show this. Results indicated that cormorants and fisheries may both be responsible, but because cormorants remove more fish, they may be the main factor for the lack of recovery of large predatory fish. Their predation keeps recruitment high, but the number of fish that reach large sizes remains low.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	9					1677	1685		10.1071/MF16227								WOS:000408576800009

Impacts of Nutrient Loading on Mercury Fractionation and Mobility in an Estuarine Wetland in Nansi Lake, China	SOIL & SEDIMENT CONTAMINATION												Total mercury is closely related to nutrient status in ecosystems. However, studies specifying the effects of various nutrient forms on the mobility of mercury are rare. In this study, three fractions of mercury (mobile, semi-mobile, and non-mobile) were examined in the soil of an estuarine wetland with excessive nutrient inputs in northern China. The wetland is located in the east route of China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project. Correlations between the three fractions of mercury and four nutrient parameters were analyzed. Results showed that toxic mobile and semi-mobile mercury comprised a great portion of total soil mercury in the studied wetland. Among the four nutrient parameters, ammonium nitrogen showed a significant negative correlation with mobile toxic mercury and was the principal nutrient component that influenced the mobility and toxicity of mercury. Nitrate nitrogen showed a positive correlation with mobile toxic mercury. Moreover, carbon/nitrogen ratio and soil acid were positively correlated with mercury mobility. Given that lower nitrogen loading is required in the watershed to ensure the water quality during the water transfer project, our study suggested that changes in nitrogen inputs might promote the mobility and bioavailability of mercury in the watershed. Thus, more attention should be provided to the potential hazard of mercury in the food web during the water transfer.																	1532-0383	1549-7887					2017	26	5					526	537		10.1080/15320383.2017.1362371								WOS:000415737500005

Oil-water separation profiles were measured by low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which allows monitoring the water content as well as the mean droplet size in the emulsion as function of the sample height and the time. Separation profiles measured by NMR depicted an increase of the free water release kinetics as the concentration of demulsifier as well as the sedimentation rate increased. The water resolution was not substantially improved by increasing the concentration further while the water quality was worse, most likely due to adsolubilization. There was no observation of DPL formation in these crude oil emulsions. Four different demulsifiers were tested on a model DPL and compared with normal crude oil emulsions. One chemical showed higher efficiency in destabilizing DPL than destabilizing crude oil emulsion. The interfacial rheological properties for one of the systems showed a slight increase in the elastic modulus (E), as the concentration of demulsifier increased. The increment of the elastic modulus is not totally understood. The most central parameters were represented by principal component analysis (PCA). PCA did not contribute in a better characterization of the chemicals. The new-generation yellow demulsifiers did not reproduce the efficiency of commercially available, less environmentally friendly, (red) demulsifiers.

Phytoplankton in two tropical mangroves of Sao Tome Island (Gulf of Guinea): A contribution towards sustainable management strategies	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Phytoplankton are important primary producers in tropical coastal lagoons, with a critical role in sustaining food webs. However, most studies conducted in tropical systems with high anthropogenic influence have focused only on biomass. Water samples were collected, for phytoplankton (pigments and microscopy) and other environmental parameters, from two mangrove lagoons in Sao Tome Island. The highest nutrient concentrations were observed in the mangrove of Praia das Conchas, indicating stronger nutrient inputs in this catchment area. Bottom oxygen deficiency was observed in the mangrove of Malanza, which is likely to be associated with the existence of a bridge that constrains the water exchange with the sea. Pigment analyses showed that overall chlorophyll a concentrations were low, indicating low phytoplankton biomass. The highest values were found at Praia das Conchas. It is suggested that chlorophyll a can be used as an indicator of anthropogenic pressure in this tropical system. Microscopy reveales the presence of Dinophysis sp. and Ostreopsis sp. cells, which can be harmful even at low densities. Water quality could be improved by enhancing oxygen condition in Malanza and by monitoring the occurrence of algal blooms, with potential benefits for public health and tourism.

Water quantity and hydrochemical quality monitoring of Laspias River, North Greece	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The water quantity and quality of Laspias River, located in Xanthi Prefecture, Thrace, North Greece, are studied. A data collection program was designed at five stations along the main river course and its main tributary. Sampling frequency was about once every 10days. Temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ simultaneously with discharge measurements. Moreover, water samples were collected and analyzed for the determination of nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids and alkalinity, according to standard methods. Anions (i.e., SO4-2 and Cl-) and cations (i.e., Li+, Na+, Mg+2, and Ca+2) were determined using ion chromatography (Dionex ICS-3000 ion chromatograph). The results showed that there is an impact of point (e.g., wastewater treatment plant effluent and farms) and non-point (e.g., agricultural activities) sources of pollution on the EC values, and chloride, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the river water. The trophic state of Laspias River, based on nutrient concentrations, was found eutrophic. Based on the Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment Water Quality Index, the river water quality ranged from poor to marginal category, indicating the need for management measures in order to improve it.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	14					1312	1321		10.1080/10934529.2017.1357408								WOS:000415634300005	28956687

IDENTIFICATION OF SIGNIFICANT PRESSURES AND ASSESSMENT OF WASTEWATER DISCHARGE ON KRIVAJA RIVER WATER QUALITY	HEMIJSKA INDUSTRIJA												One of the key stages of the process of preparing management plans for the river basin is the analysis of pressures and impacts, as well as the risk assessment of failing to achieve the environmental objectives. DPSIR framework (Driving Forces-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) was developed by the European Agency for the environmental protection, and makes the conceptual basis for the pressures and impacts analysis, taking into account the complexity of the interactions in the environment and represents the tool for their analysis. Impact assessment of the water body requires some quantitative information to describe the condition of the water body and/or the pressures that act on it. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of wastewater discharge on Krivaja water-course. Impact assessment is carried out based on data of polluters' wastewater and monitoring information for water in Krivaja. For each site at which sampling was performed, the specific risk quotients for surface water were calculated, as the ratio of the each pollutant concentration in surface water at the sampling point and environmental quality standards for pollutants, as well as their sum that represents the risk index. In order to have the integrated perceive of processes in the Krivaja River, taking into account cumulative effects from point sources, the concept of total maximum daily load was applied, using which the pollution amount, that can be discharged daily in a water body without degrading his prescribed/required quality, was calculated. Comparison of emitted loads from pollution point sources with maximum allowable ones was performed. Waste-waters of different polluters located on Krivaja are, due to insufficient treatment, very loaded with organic matter and nutrients. Krivaja receives daily 1332 m(3) of wastewater, 999 kg COD, 722 kg BOD, 144 kg of nitrogen, 4.3 kg of phosphorus and 627 kg of suspended solids. Of the total wastewater volume, the majority (69%) originates from municipal wastewater, 81% of the total amount of organic matter comes from the industry, while nutrients mostly originate from municipal wastewater. Loading of Krivaja with wastewater is major, uneven and unbalanced. Water quality of Krivaja is unsatisfactory. According to national legislation there is the exceedance of maximum permissible values for Class II for watercourse (good status) for most parameters, in all sampling locations and in both sampling periods. Parameters that exceeded the value for the Class II are dissolved oxygen, organic matter content, suspended solids, nutrients. Water flow in the river is not sufficient to receive the total amount of the pollutant load from point sources. Risk assessment, based on the monitoring results, indicates that the river Krivaja is possibly at risk of failing to meet the required water quality because the most of the values exceeded the limit values.																	0367-598X	2217-7426					2017	71	5					407	418		10.2298/HEMIND160603002P								WOS:000415092200005

Distribution of epiphytic diatoms on five macrophytes from a Pampean shallow lake: host-specificity and implications for paleoenvironmental reconstructions	DIATOM RESEARCH												Epiphytic diatoms are an important component of death and fossil assemblages in macrophyte-dominated shallow lakes. In the Argentinean Pampas, the lack of studies on the composition, diversity and distribution of epiphytic diatoms limits the extent of the paleoenvironmental inferences that can be made from their fossil record. We studied the composition of epiphytic diatom biofilms living on five macrophytes in a Pampean shallow lake (Nahuel Ruca, Buenos Aires Province). Samples of emergent, free-floating, rooted-floating and submersed macrophytes were collected in triplicate over one year and analyzed for diatoms. Epiphytic assemblages on the free-floating species Azolla filiculoides and Ricciocarpus natans were dominated by Lemnicola hungarica, whereas the remaining macrophytes (the emergent Schoenoplectus californicus, the submersed Ceratophyllum demersum and the rooted-floating Hydrocotyle ranunculoides) were dominated by Cocconeis placentula. Although all assemblages were dominated by epiphytic taxa, low proportions of planktonic and benthic taxa were also recorded. Composition, diversity, richness and evenness of diatom assemblages found on free-floating macrophytes differed significantly from the rest of the samples analyzed. The strong association of the epiphytic diatom, L. hungarica, with free-floating macrophytes, together with the high dominance of C. placentula on emergent and submersed plants provides a potential method for inferring past fluctuations in aquatic vegetation coverage in the palaeolimnological record of Pampean shallow lakes.																	0269-249X	2159-8347					2017	32	3					263	275		10.1080/0269249X.2017.1378128								WOS:000414949300003						
J	Tas, S; Hernandez-Becerril, DU				Tas, Seyfettin; Uriel Hernandez-Becerril, David			Diversity and distribution of the planktonic diatom genus Chaetoceros (Bacillariophyceae) in the Golden Horn Estuary (Sea of Marmara)	DIATOM RESEARCH												The diversity and distribution of the diatom genus Chaetoceros (Bacillariophyceae) was studied at monthly, bi-weekly and weekly intervals over two periods (2009-2010, 2013-2014) in the Golden Horn Estuary. Chaetoceros was the most diverse genus in the diatom assemblage of the study area. A total of 23 Chaetoceros species were identified based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Three taxa, Chaetoceros aequatorialis, C. contortus and C. lorenzianus f. forceps were recorded for the first time in Turkish seas. The most common species were C. affinis, C. curvisetus, C. decipiens and C. holsaticus. The contribution of Chaetoceros species to the number of total phytoplankton species was between 15% and 17%. The highest abundance of Chaetoceros species was 507 x 10(3) cells L-1, dominated by C. affinis, C. constrictus, C. holsaticus, C. lauderi in the middle estuary in spring. Chaetoceros species were more abundant in the middle and lower estuary in April and May. In the upper estuary (UE), Chaetoceros species were rarely observed due to low water transparency caused by suspended particulate materials. Light limitation may be considered one of the most important factors affecting the diversity and spatial distribution of these species in the UE. The present work is the first detailed study on the diversity and distribution of Chaetoceros species for Turkish seas.					, Seyfettin/0000-0002-4660-3937												0269-249X	2159-8347					2017	32	3					309	323		10.1080/0269249X.2017.1360800								WOS:000414949300006

The presence of these compounds might pose a risk to the aquatic environment. To determine a possible (eco) toxicological risk, aquatic samples are tested using various bioassays, including sub-organismic assays such as the luminescent bacteria inhibition test, the acetylcholinesterase inhibition test, and the umu-test. The effect-directed analysis (EDA) combines physicochemical separation methods with biological (in vitro) tests. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) has proved to be particularly well suited for the separation of organic compounds and the subsequent analysis of effects by the application of the biotests directly on the surface of the HPTLC plate. The advantage of using HPTLC in comparison to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for EDA is that the solvent which is used as a mobile phase during chromatography is completely evaporated after the separation and therefore can no longer influence the applied bioassays. A prioritization during the complex identification process can be achieved when observed effects are associated with the separated zones in HPTLC. This increases the probability of identifying the substance responsible for an adverse effect from the multitude of organic trace substances in environmental samples. Furthermore, by comparing the pattern of biological effects of a separated sample, it is possible to track and assess changes in biological activity over time, over space, or in the course of a process, even without identifying the substance. HPTLC has already been coupled with various bioassays. Because HPTLC is a very flexible system, various detection techniques can be used and combined. In addition to the UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence measurements, TLC can also be coupled with a mass spectrometer (MS) for compound identification. In addition, detection of functional groups by means of derivatization reagents can support this identification. It is also possible to combine derivatization and HPLC-MS. Two case studies are used to illustrate the significance of HPTLC-EDA in investigating water quality: center dot Study on a wastewater treatment plant center dot Possible influence of an artificial turf surface on ground water																	0724-6145	1616-8542	978-3-319-45908-0; 978-3-319-45906-6				2017	157						187	224		10.1007/10_2016_16	10.1007/978-3-319-45908-0							WOS:000414556600008	27757476

ASSESSMENT OF NUTRIENT CONTAMINATION IN SURFACE WATER, CASE STUDY OF AIN ZADA DAM (NORTH-EAST OF ALGERIA)	JOURNAL OF FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED SCIENCES												In order to evaluate the impact of potential pollutions on the water quality in the watershed of the upstream of wadi Boussellem (North-east of Algeria), the evolution of the chemical composition of waters of the Ain Zada dam was studied over a period of ten years. Using a linear model of trends and a principal components analysis (PCA) methods, have been detected and quantified for the substances that are connected with the fertilizers and domestic effluents. An increasing concentration is observed for most of these substances. The increase of 88% in COD, 66% in BOD5 and the decrease of 4.3% in pH, suggests a degradation of O.M 85% by microorganisms. This degradation was accompanied by a decrease of 2% of O-2dis content. The large increases of E.C 76%, NH4 290% and NO2 100%, are related to a marked increase in fertilizers applications and the denitrification of NO3 where latters declined by 77%. These increases are related also to the large amount of human and animal organic materials and industrial waste dumped.																	1112-9867						2017	9	3					1358	1377		10.4314/jfas.v9i3.8								WOS:000414742700008

The interannual and quarterly mean concentrations of COD, NH3-N, DO, and river pH value are calculated to evaluate pollution characteristics. Water quality in flood and non-flood periods were monitored to explore the relationship between peak flows and water quality in stormwater. The results showed that in the stormwater period, index concentrations and their fluctuation ranges decreased and were reduced gradually with the increase of peak flow. When peak flow was in the range of 480-680 m(3)/s, concentrations of COD and NH3-N had the same trend of increasing and decreasing in general. During 2005-15, river pH value fluctuated in the range of 7 to 8, and pH value in the second quarter was slightly higher than in the other three quarters. Water quality of the Weihe improved significantly after 2010.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	6					2495	2505		10.15244/pjoes/74153								WOS:000414471200008

Zeta potentials of the residual colloidal particles in floated water and other typical water quality indexes measurements reinforced the fact that micro-bubble surface was successfully modified by dosing chitosan in a saturation system. The flotation efficiencies of both natural organic matters (NOM) and particles were obviously enhanced via chitosan-modified bubbles and the effects became more remarkable after the pH of saturation water was adjusted from 7.0 to 5.5, especially for NOM removal. Moreover, the influence of chitosan on DAF performance, as a coagulant aid, was also evaluated. The coagulation-aiding effects of chitosan were equal to acting as a bubble modifier at pH 7.0, but less efficient than the bubble modification DAF at pH 5.5. In addition, the effects of molecular weight (MW) and deacetylation degree (DD) of chitosan on its performance in both dosing strategies were discussed in detail. These findings highlight the advantages of bubble surface modification in surface water treatment and provide an alternative for DAF process optimization.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	6					2731	2737		10.15244/pjoes/73806								WOS:000414471200032

An example is Cikijing River, located in Rancaekek, Bandung which has expected contaminated by water disposal. Total loss approach by Total Economic Valuation is Rp 11.385.847.532.188 (+/- 11.4 trillion). One of the dangerous effect is the water quality in there. The aim of this research is to know and prove water disposal contaminated in that river. This research was conducted by mapping the magnetic anomaly which obtained from the surrounding river. Afterward, modeling the research is conducted to get the susceptibility value. In the previous research, the geological condition of our research field is Kosambi Formation ( clay, sandstone, shale). The Kosambi Formation susceptibility value estimated 0.017cgs unit there after it used to be background susceptibility. As the result of modeling magnetic anomaly from the anomaly map, the susceptibility contrast shows negative value. The relation between magnetic anomaly and susceptibility indicated the hazardous and toxic substance pollution, which affected Cikijing River and around there.					widodo, Widodo/0000-0003-0106-2150												0094-243X		978-0-7354-1535-5				2017	1861								UNSP 030039-1	10.1063/1.4990926								WOS:000413696500040

Traditionally, mechanistic simulation models are employed for water quality modeling and prediction. However, given the complicate nature of Lake Michigan in Northwestern Indiana, the detailed simulation model is extremely simple in comparison and, at some point, additional detail exceeds our ability to simulate and predict with reasonable error levels. In this regard, my project applied data mining technologies, as an innovative alternative, to develop an easy and more accurate approach for water quality assessment and prediction. The drawback of the data mining modeling is that the execution takes quite long time, especially when we employ a better accuracy but more time consuming algorithm in clustering. Therefore, we applied the High Performance Computing System of the Northwest Indiana Computational Grid to deal with this problem. Up to now, the pilot experiments have achieved very promising preliminary results. The visualized water quality assessment and prediction obtained from this project would be published in an interactive website so that the public and the environmental managers could use the information for their decision making.																			978-1-5090-5507-4				2017							279	283										WOS:000414478200047

Furtherly, the water resources scarcity due to pollution is among the most serious challenges for sustainable water resources management in China. In this paper, the concept of gray water footprint (GWF) was introduced for the assessment of water utilization in energy industrial sectors, focusing on the water scarcity due to the quality degradation. Hunan Province was taken as the study case for the GWF accounting from 2005 to 2014. The results indicated that the water supplies in the energy sectors of Hunan province, in most cases, were surplus the gray WFs of the same time period. Therefore, the water pollutants in the sectors could be fully assimilated. Thus, the water quality in the energy industrial sectors of Hunan province were not deteriorated from the energy sectors.

Fish communities can support or hinder water quality management. Sulejow Reservoir, which is situated on the Pilica River in Central Poland, serves as a strategic reserve of drinking water for the Lodz Agglomeration. Precise knowledge of the long-term dynamics of the structure of the fish community, what was the aim of this study, is important for proper management to slow the eutrophication of the reservoir and prevent toxic algal blooms. Materials and methods. To determine fish species composition, multimesh gill nets with mesh sizes ranging from 11 to 80 mm were used. From 1993 to 2015, gillnetting was conducted 1-2 times per month from June through November in two representative parts of the reservoir, and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to explore the temporal variation in fish community structure expressed as the relative contribution of each species to the total fish biomass. Results. Dominance fluctuated among four species in the fish community: common bream, Abramis brama (Linnaeus, 1758); roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); white bream, Blicca bjoerkna (Linnaeus, 1758); and pike-perch, Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758). PCA revealed three principal components with eigenvalues larger than one that explained 73.3% of the observed variance in the temporal changes in fish community composition. A negative correlation was found between pike-perch biomass and roach biomass (r = 0.82), while a positive correlation was observed between the biomass of pike-perch and that of common bream (r = 0.73). Consequently, there was a highly negative correlation between the biomasses of common bream and roach (r = 0.80). Furthermore, an interesting temporal pattern was observed; from 1993 to 2000, the fish community was dominated by common bream and pike-perch but then shifted towards domination by roach and white bream, despite declining phosphorous and carbon concentrations. Recently, this trend has been reversed, and a more balanced fish community structure has been established. Conclusion. Fish community succession, which is usually reported to be a one-directional process in reservoirs, i.e., from a riverine fish or percid-dominated to a cyprinid (bream)-dominated state, was more ambiguous in Sulejow Reservoir. This was likely a consequence of both restoration issues related to decreasing nutrient loads and the influence of zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha invasion on the trophic relations in the reservoir.

Studies were carried out in part of river localised in a forest. Analyses of water quality changes of watercourse below sewage discharge were made in the years 2008-2011. Waste water treatment plant situated in Kwilcz town is a biological type one with additional settling pond, which sometimes caused increase of phosphorus concentration in sewages discharged to studied watercourse. Worsening of river water quality was found particularly in site localised 100 metres below discharge. In other sites situated 350 and 700 metres below interceptor the situation was getting better despite low river water discharge. Positive changes in water quality were observed in case of trophic parameters, as like as soluble reactive phosphates, total phosphorus, nitrates and also for conductivity. Due to shadow conditions in river valley only few aquatic species were identified in watercourse with domination of reed with some minor area covered by other taxa including mosses.																	1644-0765						2017	16	1					161	171		10.15576/ASP.FC/2017.16.1.161								WOS:000412720400001

The emergence of antibiotics in the aquatic environment is a matter of concern as they may induce bacterial resistance, a major threat to health-care management and an increasing economic crisis. The current methods that are used to detect antibiotics are expensive and time consuming due to the sample preparation necessary for the determination of low concentrations of antibiotics in water and the instruments used. Electrochemical sensors and biosensors are simple systems, with high selectivity and sensitivity for individual measurements and low cost. In this study, we present a novel polyamic acid/graphene oxide electrode that was prepared for electrochemical screening of selected antibiotic residues in aqueous solution. Polyamic acid and graphene oxide were synthesized independently and characterized using microscopic, spectroscopic, and voltammetric approaches. A polyamic acid/graphene oxide/screen-sprinted carbon electrode was prepared in situ by electrochemical deposition of polyamic acid/graphene (0.03mg/mL 50:50 mass ratio) on screen-printed carbon electrodes using five cycles between -1000 and 1000mV at 50mV/s. The polyamic acid/graphene oxide/screen-printed carbon electrode provided limits of detection of 0.034 mu M for norfloxacin and 1.07 mu M for neomycin. Recovery studies on synthetic urine showed good inter-day and intra-day coefficients of variation (n=3).

ANNUAL REVIEW OF RESOURCE ECONOMICS, VOL 9	Annual Review of Resource Economics											Policy analysts and government agencies promote a particular form of what they term water quality trading as a means to address the most vexing obstacle to meeting water quality standards: reducing nutrient pollutants from agricultural nonpoint sources. However, agricultural nonpoint sources' participation in water quality trading programs will only make limited contributions to lowering overall pollutant loads. We argue that economists need to more clearly articulate the limitations of current and proposed water quality trading programs as a water quality management strategy. A new generation of market-like incentive policies will be necessary to make significant progress in reducing agricultural nonpoint source loads.																	1941-1340		978-0-8243-4709-3				2017	9						95	116		10.1146/annurev-resource-100516-053639								WOS:000413326600007

Now three new clusters of Cyanophyta variables were found. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests are used to compare the now obtained Cyanophyta clusters and the previous Reservoirs clusters, in order to validate the classification of the water quality of reservoirs. The amount of Cyanophyta algae present in the reservoirs from the three clusters is significantly different, which validates the previous classification.				Goncalves, A.

After performing rotation using the Varimax method, the relations between the factors and the original variables got clearer and more explainable, which provided a Factor Analysis model for these environmental variables using 13 varifactors: Water quality and distance to the source, Hypolimnion chemical composition, Sulfite-reducing bacteria and nutrients, Coliforms and faecal streptococci, Reservoir depth, Temperature, Location, among other factors.

Effects of atmospheric cold fronts on stratification and water quality of a tropical reservoir: implications for aquaculture	AQUACULTURE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS												Stratification and mixing patterns of a water body are influenced by the variability of atmospheric systems, which can also modify their biogeochemical properties. The primary goal of this study was to analyze the effect of atmospheric cold fronts (CFs) on thermal stratification and water quality parameters in 4 embayments of the Furnas Hydroelectric Reservoir (FHR) (southeastern Brazil), a warm monomictic water body. A secondary goal was to evaluate the implications of this effect on the aquaculture of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (L.) in net cages. A 2 yr dataset of meteorological and water quality parameters was used to compute heat flux balance components and buoyancy frequency. These parameters were used to evaluate the influence of CFs on FHR water column stability and water quality. It was observed that the passing of CFs increased net heat loss and wind velocity, resulting in a partial mixture of surface waters with deeper layers. These changes in the physical structure of the water column altered the diel cycle of water temperature, led to a slight decrease in dissolved oxygen concentrations and pH values during the stratification period, and contributed to the increase in dilution power at the fish cultivation sites. However, following CF passages, no significant changes were observed in water quality parameters that influenced Nile tilapia cultivation in the FHR. Nevertheless, the understanding of meteorological systems and their influence on the physical and biogeochemical properties of an aquatic system is important for optimal management of aquaculture activities.																	1869-215X	1869-7534					2017	9						385	403		10.3354/aei00240								WOS:000412233700005

Before the construction of a new bridge, the zero state was determined in the direct vicinity and at locations downstream from the construction site in order to have a realistic picture of impacts of the mentioned construction on the quality of surface waters. Comparison of the data acquired by continual monitoring of a significant number of parameters (total 18) during 12 months and their zero state, i. e. their values before the commencement of construction, gives a realistic overview of impacts of the construction site on the quality of water in nearby surface watercourses. In the case that the execution of civil works proves to have a negative impact on the quality of these rivers, the cause of negative impacts shall be determined and additional measures of prevention, reduction or mitigation of impacts shall be taken.																	1840-4855	2233-0046					2017		17					99	106		10.7251/afts.2017.0917.099P								WOS:000414399900012

Therefore, the objectives of the present work were to identify different factors affecting the ground water quality based on multivariate analysis. This study also aimed to determine the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques to improve our understanding of factors affecting groundwater properties and their interactions. The original matrix consisted of 25 physico-chemical parameters analyzed in 70 number of ground water samples collected from different sites of sampling stations. All the physical and chemical parameters were analyzed by the standard methods of APHA, whereas minerals were determined by ICP-OES method. Thereafter, experimental 70 x 25 matrix was run through the multivariate statistical data analysis which consists of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), R and Q mode Factor Analysis (FA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). Results showed that physico-chemical factors are important source of variation in the groundwater quality. Interestingly, multivariate analysis revealed that other factors such as dissolution of salts present in the underlying rocks, presence of nutrient load, non-mixing/partial mixing of different types of ground water and moderate type of exchange between river water with adjacent ground water has been found to affect groundwater quality. The study also showed the significant role of multivariate statistical analysis in evaluation and interpretation of the groundwater quality data. The outcome of this study can be used as baseline data to inhospitable and critical areas for future sustainable development and proper management of groundwater system which will ultimately produce good water quality.																	0972-9860	1875-8568					2017	14	4					61	75		10.3233/AJW-170037								WOS:000413285700008

Influence of urban industrial and domestic discharge on Uruguay River in the period 1998-2004	AUGMDOMUS												Uruguay river is 1800 km long and its basin covers an area of 339000 km(2). It is the international border between Argentina and Uruguay in its last 508 km along which seven cities are settled. From north to south Concordia, Colon, Concepcion del Uruguay and Gualeguaycho are located on the Argentinian margin whereas Salto, Paysandu and Fray Bentos are on the Uruguayan margin. These cities have greatly developed in the last 50 years. However, their influence on Uruguay River has not been studied. This work was aimed at analyzing the impact of these discharges on the Uruguay River during the period 1998-2004 and at comparing the physicochemical values and biological parameters based on the levels proposed by the Administrative Commission of the Uruguay River (CARU, in Spanish) and the baseline of the main channel. Data from 12 winter or spring campaigns were gathered. The following physicochemical parameters were measured: conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, hardness, total dissolved solids, nitrates, nitrites, ammoniums, phosphates, major ions (Na+, K+; Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-) and metals (Cd2+, Cc(2+), Cr3+ y Pb2+). Fecal coliform bacteria were considered to be a biological parameter. All these parameters were analyzed by applying standard methods. The results showed that the seven cities on Uruguay River banks produce different effects on the quality of its coastal waters. The sampling sites at Concordia in Argentina and Paysandu in Uruguay showed values higher than those recommended by the CARU to ensure water quality for public consumption with a conventional treatment. It is noteworthy that, although an important influence of the discharge of the seven cities on the river is observed, it is moderate due to its self-purifying capacity.																	1852-2181						2017	9				SI		12	36										WOS:000413685600002

Monthly readings were taken from six strategically located sampling sites. Three of the sites are on the river itself (DiqueValle de Uco (VU), Costa Anzorena (CA) and Dique Tiburcio Benegas (TB) and the other three are on its main tributaries (Las Tunas river (LT) and the Aguanda (A) and Yaucha (Y) brooks). The objectives of this paper are: (1) to build a database of physical, chemical and biological parameters; (2) to describe the characteristics of water in the basin; (3) to identify the most important contamination sources; (4) to compare the evolution of contamination in time and space; and (5) to provide the General Department of Irrigation with water management guidelines. The parameters that were analysed included: temperature (T), flow rate (Q), salinity (CE), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), nitrates (NO3), phosphates (PO4), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB) and fecal coliforms (FC). The paper shows the variations in time and space of the parameters subjected to non-parametric statistical analysis (Kruskal Wallis). Water salinity showed low values at LT, A and Y and much higher ones at VU, CA and TB, all of which points with a rising trend. The highest salinity values were found at TB (1414 mu S. cm(-1)) followed by CA (1368 mu S. cm-1) and VU (1238 mu S. cm(-1)). Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) values at these three sites were the highest. Fecal coliform content at CA and TB exceeded the maximum values established in Resolution 778/96 by the General Department of Irrigation. With respect to evolution in time, the only parameters with significant differences (alpha < 0.05) are chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen and fecal coliforms.																	1852-2181						2017	9				SI		67	82										WOS:000413685600005

Traditionally, the WNP is based on empirical suggestions and on trial and error approaches used with hydraulic simulation software, difficult to apply to large networks. Recently, some heuristic procedures, based on graph and network theory, have shown that it is possible to find optimal solutions in terms of number, shape and dimension of DMAs. In this paper, spectral clustering theory was used to define the water districts, taking into account the spatial and hydraulic constraints, through weight matrices. A comparison between different spectral clustering methods was achieved on a real water network measuring some energy performance indices, in order to identify the optimal water network partitioning.

A review of the fate and transport of nitrogen, phosphorus, pathogens, and trace organic chemicals in septic systems	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A large population living in suburban and rural areas in the world uses septic systems, also called onsite wastewater treatment systems, to dispose of household wastewater. In a conventional septic system, the wastewater flows from a household to a septic tank, where solids settle and a clarified effluent is produced. This effluent is dispersed into the soil for further treatment and can be a potential source of various contaminants such as nutrients, pathogens, and a new class of compounds known as trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) in shallow groundwater and surface waters. We review the current state of the science on the fate and transport of three groups of contaminants-nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus), pathogens, and TOrCs-and water quality impacts associated with these contaminants in conventional septic systems. We also discuss alternative technologies that may be employed when site conditions or environmental needs preclude the use of conventional septic systems.																	1064-3389	1547-6537					2017	47	7					455	541		10.1080/10643389.2017.1327787								WOS:000414036200002

The theoretical framework of final ecosystem services focuses attention on such measurable attributes, as a common currency for social-ecological systems research. Environmental communications as well as ecological monitoring and analysis efforts could be enhanced through increased documentation of final ecosystem services. For example, small changes in the way ecosystems are described could strongly influence relevance to the public and improve the foundation for environmental decision making. Focusing on rivers and streams, we conducted a content analysis of existing publications to document the breadth and frequency with which various measurable attributes, such as flooding, water quality characteristics, and wildlife appeared in different news sources over a multiyear timeline. In addition to attributes, motivations for human interest in river-related resources were also coded, such as recreation or preservation for future generations. To allow testing of differences between materials written for different audiences, three sources were sampled: a blog hosted by National Geographic, New York Times articles, and Wall Street Journal articles. The coding approach was rigorously tested in a pilot phase, with measures developed to ensure high data quality, including use of two independent coders. Results show numerous similarities across sources with some notable differences in emphasis. Significant relationships between groups of attribute and motivation codes were also found, one outcome of which is further support for the importance of nonuse values for fish and wildlife. Besides offering insight on ecosystem services, the project demonstrates an in-depth quantitative approach to analyzing preexisting qualitative data.																	1708-3087						2017	22	3							15	10.5751/ES-09496-220315								WOS:000412944300028

Analysis of Drinking Water Quality for Presence of Heavy Metals and Its Impacts on Health of Local Population in Sibi District	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												This study aimed at finding out the presence of heavy metals in the drinking water sources of Sibi District, Pakistan. These metals are causing various diseases in the local population such as browning of the teeth, bone deformations, and malfunctioning of different organs of the human body. The researchers collected water samples from 8 sampling sites of Sibi district and the same were analyzed for fluoride, lead, arsenic and manganese. Modern instruments available in the advanced GSP laboratory were used for examining these samples. The results showed that the values of pH and TDS in water samples ranged from 7.2 to 8.31 and 650 to 9,800, fluoride was present from 2.0 to 12.5 mg/l, arsenic values were observed in the range of 0.0008 to 4.56 mg/l and lead was present from 0.0001 to 0.02 mg/l and manganese was present from 0.002 to 0.353 mg/l. These results show that the values of heavy metals are mostly higher than the values set by World Health Organization (WHO) except values of Manganese and Lead which were mostly within permissible limits. The reason for the presence of these heavy metals was observed to be the combination of rock alterations and exploitation of surface and underground minerals in the selected areas of Sibi district.																	2239-5938	2239-6101					2017	6	4			SI		32	40		10.14207/ejsd.2017.v6n4p32								WOS:000412137100004

J	Shoko, C; Dube, T; Clark, D				Shoko, Cletah; Dube, Timothy; Clark, David			Total evaporation estimation for accurate water accounting purposes: an appraisal of various available estimation methods	GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL												The estimation of total evaporation is fundamental for water accounting, considering its influence on water availability. Moreover, the current increase in water consumption (e.g. in sub-Saharan Africa and the world over), land cover/use changes, deteriorating water quality and the climate change projections in most regions of the world underscore the need to understand water loss. So far, different approaches have been developed and implemented in estimating the variations of total evaporation, with varying accuracies. The aim of this work was therefore, to provide a review of these different approaches for estimating total evaporation, as well as a detailed discussion of their strengths and weaknesses. Findings from this review have shown that total evaporation estimates derived, using ground-based meteorological and micro-meteorological methods are inadequate for representing its large-scale spatial variations. On the other hand, remote sensing technology, which acquires data at different resolutions (i.e. radiometric, spectral, spatial and temporal), provides timely, up-to-date and relatively accurate spatial estimates of total evaporation over large geographic coverage, for sustainable and effective water accounting, which is key for well-informed and improved management of water resources at both catchment and regional scales. In this regard, more details on the remote sensing-based methods of estimating total evaporation are provided, especially considering the robust technological advancements and its potential in characterizing earth features over time and space. This work has also managed to identify research gaps and challenges in the accurate estimation of total evaporation, using remote sensing, especially with the emergence of more advanced sensors and the characteristics of the landscape.

Based on the theories of uncertainty measurement evaluation (WME) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the comprehensive risk evaluation of underground goafs was carried out using multiple indexes. Considering the hydrogeological conditions, mining status, and engineering parameters of underground goafs, the evaluation index system was established to evaluate the risk degrees considering quantified uncertain factors. The single indexmeasurement values were solved by the semiridgemeasurement function. The weights for evaluation vectors were calculated through the entropy theory and AHP. Finally, the risk level was evaluated according to the credible degree recognition criterion (CDRC) and the maximum membership principle. The risk levels of 37 underground goafs in Dabaoshan mine were evaluated using 4 coupled methods. The order for underground goafs risk degrees was ranked and classified on account of the uncertainty important degree. According to the ranked order, the reasonability of 4 coupled methods was evaluated quantitatively. Results show that the UME-CDRC can be applied in the practical engineering, which provides an efficient guidance to both reduce the accident risk and improve the mining environment.

CYANOBACTERIA IN RESERVOIRS IN THE STATE OF PERNAMBUCO: OCURRENCE AND TOXICITY	HOLOS												The quality and potability of water in public water supply reservoirs in the state of Pernambuco are being jeopardized by an intense eutrophication process. That enrichment of the waters puts at risk the multiple uses of the water as it propitiates the development of cyanobacteria blooms capable of producing cyanotoxins harmful to the health of many animals including man. This study set out to conduct a taxonomic survey of the cyanobacteria in the waters of the Jucazinho and Carpina reservoirs in the 'Agreste' and northern 'Zona da Mata' regions, respectively, in the state of Pernambuco and to determine cyanotoxin concentrations in them by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Monthly samples were collected from September to December 2014 in the limnetic zone near to the point of catchment in the reservoirs. Cyanobacteria blooms were identified in the reservoir water samples that could potentially produce cyanotoxins. However the toxin concentrations in both reservoirs were below the maximum levels permitted in the respective Ministry of Health regulatory document MS 2.914/2011. The results indicate that the occurrence of toxic cyanobacteria blooms represent a permanent risk of cyanotoxins and the need to take steps to control the blooms and improve water quality.																	1518-1634	1807-1600					2017	33	4					111	124		10.15628/holos.2017.4470								WOS:000412549000008

Green water from a broodstock fish pond was used for rearing shrimp in treatment ponds; whereas, filtered seawater was used for growing shrimp in control ponds, with both treatment and control in triplicates. Shrimp juveniles (specific pathogen free, SPF) of uniform size (1.74 +/- 0.46 g) were stocked at the rate of 100 nos. m(-2) per pond. Feeding, water exchange, sampling and water quality analysis were done as per standard shrimp growout procedure. Shrimp health status and microbial load in culture ponds were recorded periodically. Water quality parameters did not show significant variations between control and treatment ponds. Enhanced growth, survival (19.7%) and biomass (23.3%) were observed in treatment ponds when compared to control. Significant reduction in bacterial population and improved shrimp health status were also noticed in treatment ponds. Green water culture technique reduced harmful bacterial population in culture ponds and enhanced shrimp growth, survival, health and production.																	0970-6011						2017	64	3					43	49		10.21077/ijf.2017.64.3.63656-07								WOS:000413432700007

Trace organic compounds in rivers, streams, and wastewater in southeastern Alberta, Canada	INLAND WATERS												We selected 14 anthropogenic organic compounds representing major classes of potential contaminants for analysis to determine their occurrence in the South Saskatchewan River and its tributaries near irrigated farmland and the only urban center in southeast Alberta, Canada. Agriculture and urban runoff and discharges seem to have little impact on the quality of surface water based on samples taken above and below Medicine Hat/Redcliff in the South Saskatchewan River and local tributaries. Samples of river water, tributary water, and raw and treated wastewater taken over a period of 3 years allowed an estimation of the impact of trace organic compounds from urban and agricultural activities on water quality. Of the 14 compounds investigated, 10 were detected in concentrations above the detection limit in at least one surface water sample and 9 at concentrations above the detection limit in sewage samples. The wastewater treatment plant removed indicator compounds to varying degrees, and the volume of treated effluent discharge was <1% of the river, even during the lowest flow conditions, thereby minimizing potential impact. Discharge in the river and tributaries varied by an order of magnitude over the period of study, including 2 major flood events in the South Saskatchewan River. Potential health or environmental effects were difficult to evaluate from a regulatory perspective because few guidelines are available for reference.																	2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	3					283	296		10.1080/20442041.2017.1329908								WOS:000412646100006						
J	Ji, HY; Shao, MA; Jia, XX				Ji Hengying; Shao Ming-an; Jia Xiaoxu			EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF WATER QUALITY ON RAINFALL EROSION	INMATEH-AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING												Considering the serious soil and water losses that impede the development of agricultural production in Loess Plateau in China, this study investigated the soil water infiltration, runoff yield, and sediment yield through simulated rainfall using rainfall water of different qualities; additionally, this study investigated the influence of water quality on rainfall-induced erosion. The effects of rainfall water quality on soil erosion under artificial simulation were studied in the State Key Laboratory of Soil Erosion and Dryland Farming on the Loess Plateau from 2015 to 2016. This experiment used four rainfall water types (water, natural precipitation, natural hydrops, and tap water) and three typical loess plateau soil samples (Loessal soil, Lou soil, and laminated Lou-Sand). The effect of water quality on soil erosion under the same rainfall intensity (60mm/H) and slope (5 degrees) was determined. Results showed that the intensity of rainfall erosion was significantly affected by water quality, and soil erosion intensity gradually decreased with increased sodium adsorption ratio and conductivity (water<natural precipitation<natural hydrops<tap water) under natural hydrops; the runoff coefficient of soil erosion was the lowest (29.3%) under natural hydrops; stable infiltration rate and rainfall erosion were the lowest under rainfall hydrops; and soil erosion was the highest under water. Moreover, the influence of water quality on rainfall erosion was affected by soil type. Compared with the Loessal soil, which contains low amount of clay particles, the erosion of rainfall to the Lou soil with higher content of clay particle was more susceptible to the water quality. Water quality plays an important role in soil erosion and exerts more significant effects on soil with higher clay content. Therefore, water quality factors must be fully considered in studying and simulating rainfall erosion.																	2068-4215	2068-2239				JAN-APR	2017	51	1					135	144										WOS:000413658400016

Heavy Metal Absorption Efficiency of two Species of Mosses (Physcomitrellapatens and Funariahygrometrica) StudiedinMercury Treated Culture under Laboratory Condition	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MATERIALS, ALLOYS AND EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS (ICMAEM-2017)	IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				International Conference on Materials, Alloys and Experimental Mechanics (ICMAEM)	JUL 03-04, 2017	Narsimha Reddy Engn Coll, INDIA		Narsimha Reddy Engn Coll			As an important component of ecosystems, mosses have a strong influence on the cycling of water, energy and nutrient. Given their sensitivity to environmental change, mosses can be used as bioindicators of water quality, air pollution, metal accumulation and climate change. In the present study, the growth, differentiation and heavy metal (Hg) absorption of two species of mosses like Physcomitrella patens and Funariahygrometrica were studied in solid cultures under laboratory conditions. It was observed that, the number of gametophores developed from single inoculated gametophores after 45 days of growth of F. hygrometrica was 11 +/- 2.0 in control whereas it has decreased at higher concentrations, 4 +/- 1.5 in 1ppm of mercury treatment. P. patens also shows asimilar trend. The heavy metal uptake of both the species of mosses was studied. It was observed thatHg content in pseudo leaves ofP. patens ranged from 0.98ppm to 2.76 ppm at different Hg treatment (0.1-1ppm), whereas in F. hygrometrica it ranged from 0.78ppm to 2.43ppm under the same treatment condition. Comparing between the Hg content in pseudo-leaves and rhizoids of P. patensandF. hygrometrica, it was observed that the Hg content was elevatedabout 60-64% in rhizoids than that of pseudo-leaves at 0.1% treatment level, whereas it was increased almost up to 50% in other treatment level.																	1757-8981						2017	225								012225	10.1088/1757-899X/225/1/012225								WOS:000412003600225						
J	Fuentes, R; Leon-Munoz, J; Echeverria, C				Fuentes, Rodrigo; Leon-Munoz, Jorge; Echeverria, Cristian			Spatially explicit modelling of the impacts of land-use and land-cover change on nutrient inputs to an oligotrophic lake	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Land-use and land-cover has a relevant role in nutrient fluxes at the watershed scale. Rivers are the natural bridges between terrestrial and aquatic systems where water, nutrients, and sediments, among others, are transferred through land-margin and margin-aquatic interactions. In this regard, it is necessary to gain further understanding of the influence of land-use and land-cover changes (LULCCs) on aquatic systems characterized by high quality standards but whose watersheds are subject to recent LULCC. In this study, a spatially explicit model (N-SPECT) was applied with the purpose of assessing whether, in southern-central Chile, the recent LULCC could alter the nutrient input to oligotrophic lakes (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)). We hypothesize that maintaining the LULCC would force a significant increase in nutrient inputs, mainly due to deforestation and agricultural expansion into areas of greater slopes and altitudes currently covered by temperate forest. The results showed degradation and deforestation with annual rates of loss of old-growth forest close to 1%. Similarly, significant clearance for agricultural purposes near rivers and coastal areas was noted. This condition will cause an increase in nutrient inputs from tributary rivers, and it is estimated that by 2020, under current LULCC trajectories, the TN loads entering the lake will be 1.11 times higher than those registered in the mid-1980s. The results indicate that to preserve and/or restore the quality of aquatic south-central Chilean ecosystems, it is necessary to modify the current LULCC: (1) to fundamentally stop the temperate forest degradation and (2) to regulate the expansion of agricultural land in steeper and higher areas, where important forest still exists.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	24					7531	7550		10.1080/01431161.2017.1339928								WOS:000412547100005

Jahani Salt Diapir, Iran: hydrogeology, karst features and effect on surroundings environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPELEOLOGY												The Jahani Salt Diapir (JSD), with an area of 54 km(2), is an active diapir in the Simply Folded Belt of the Zagros Orogeny, in the south of Iran. Most of the available studies on this diapir are focused on tectonics. The hydrogeology, schematic model of flow direction and hydrochemical effects of the JSD on the adjacent water resources are lacking, and thus, are the focus of this study. The morphology of the JSD was reevaluated by fieldwork and using available maps. The physicochemical characteristics of the springs and hydrometric stations were also measured. The vent of the diapir is located 250 m higher than the surrounding glaciers, and covered by small polygonal sinkholes (dolines). The glacier is covered by cap soils, sparse trees and pastures, and contains large sinkholes, numerous shafts, several caves, and 30 brine springs. Two main groups of caves were distinguished. Sub-horizontal or inclined stream passages following the surface valleys and vertical shafts (with short inlet caves) at the bottoms of nearly circular blind valleys. Salt exposure is limited to steep slopes. The controlling variables of flow route within salt diapirs are the negligible porosity of the salt rocks at depth more than about ten meters below the ground surface and the rapid halite saturation along the flow route. These mechanisms prevent deep cave development and enforce the emergence points of brine springs with low flow rates and small catchment area throughout the JSD and above the local base of erosion. Tectonics do not affect karst development, because the distributions of sinkholes and brine springs show no preferential directions. The type of spring water is sodium chloride, with a TDS of 320 g/l, and saturated with halite, gypsum, calcite and dolomite. The water balance budget of the JSD indicates that the total recharge water is 1.46 MCM (million cubic meter)/a, emerges from 30 brine springs, two springs from the adjacent karstic limestone, and flows into the Firoozabad River (FR) and the adjacent alluvium aquifer. The FR cuts through the northern margin of the salt diapir, dissolving the glacier salts at the contact with JSD, increasing the halite concentration of the 17.7 MCM/a of the FR from 100 mg/l to 12,000 mg/l. This is a permanent process because the active glacier flows rapidly down the steep slopes into the river gorge from the nearby vent. The possible relocation of the FR channel would enhance the FR water quality, but disrupt the natural beauty of the diapir.																	0392-6672	1827-806X					2017	46	3					445	457		10.5038/1827-806X.46.3.2133								WOS:000413996400010

Improvement of water quality using dielectric barrier discharge plasma	INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE 2016	Journal of Physics Conference Series				International Nuclear Science and Technology Conference (INST)	AUG 04-06, 2016	Thammasat Univ, Bangkok, THAILAND	Minist Sci & Technol Thailand, Offi Atoms Peace, Synchrotron Light Res Inst, Nucl Soc Thailand, Chulalongkorn Univ, Kasetsart Univ, Khon Kaen Univ, Elect Generating Thailand, Pondpol Analyt Co Ltd, Thai Sterilizat Serv Co Ltd, Synergy Hlth Ltd, Thailand Inst Nucl Technol	Thammasat Univ			The improvement of water quality using by atmospheric plasma produced from a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) was studied. An experiment was set-up with a 4 mm diameter pipe, which contains 2 electrodes and has an air flow with the rate of 15 liters per minute. Surface water, domestic wastewater and DI water were treated with the DBD plasma for some period of time. Electricity was supplied at 3.5 kV with the frequency of 5.5 kHz. Some key parameters of water quality includes the level of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solid (TSS), color, and odor are measured before and after. The result showed that strong acid with pH below 2 was observed after 60 minutes plasma treatment for the DI water, while the surface water and wastewater needs about 120 minutes to pH below 2 even though the pH value are about the same at the beginning. Moreover, It was formed that the COD, TSS microorganism was noticeably decreased, therefore the increasing of transparency level. This result confirms that atmospheric DBD plasma generated acidity in water as reduce amount of organic and suspended solid in water.																	1742-6588						2017	860								UNSP 012031	10.1088/1742-6596/860/1/012031								WOS:000412324300031

To prevent water pollution in rural areas, the processing of household garbage and domestic wastewater is important. However, rural areas are not considered under government policies. To preserve the quality of water in drainage canals, we initiated activities conducted by local residents to prevent the dumping of garbage and to construct wastewater treatment facilities. As a result of these activities, a garbage collection system and wastewater treatment facilities were developed under an operation and management system run by the residents. Thus, utilizing the power of community residents is one solution to water quality problems in rural areas.																	0021-3551						2017	51	4					319	326		10.6090/jarq.51.319								WOS:000412922800004						
J	Wu, QL; Zhang, ZH; Cao, GD; Zhang, XH				Wu, Qilong; Zhang, Zhenghua; Cao, Guodong; Zhang, Xihui			Impact of polymeric membrane breakage on drinking water quality and an online detection method of the breakage	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Polymeric membrane has been widely used for the treatment of drinking water in China, and the total treating capacity has reached up to 3.8 million m(3)/d. However, the membrane breakage found in the membrane modules in many water treatment plants resulted in an increase in turbidity and bacterial amount in the membrane permeate. In this study, a membrane module running for 3years in a full-scale application was examined in terms of the breaking positions and the numbers of the broken fibers. It was found that most of the breaking positions were mainly on the outlet side of the module and that the distance from these points to the outlet was about 1/10-2/10 length of the membrane module. The lab-scale tests showed that the increase of the numbers of the breaking fibers in the membrane module (the breaking fibers were from 1 to 4 of 75 fibers) resulted in the increase in turbidity, particle count and the amount of total bacteria and coliform bacteria. Meanwhile, the water quality after the filtration with broken membrane fibers was similar to the quality of the raw water, which indicated that once the membrane fiber breakage occurred in the membrane module, the quality of drinking water after membrane filtration was significantly affected. Furthermore, the breaking position closer to the outlet side of the membrane module exposed much higher microbiological risk than those in the middle or near the bottom side. A pilot scale test was conducted by using a membrane module with 6600 fibers, and the effect of the membrane breakage (1-4 broken fibers) on water quality was also investigated. The results indicated that periodical backwashing caused drastic fluctuation of turbidity, particle count and the bacterial amount in the permeate water, which might be due to the washing force and self-blocking action inside the hollow fibers. Moreover, there is a good quantitative relationship (R-2 = 0.945) between particle count and the bacterial amount, which indicated that an online detection of particle count can be used to evaluate the bacterial risk. It was also suggested that the online detection of particle count after backwashing within 100s would be a quick and precise method to identify any fiber breakage in time. These results are very important for the safety issue in the application of polymeric membrane to water treatment plants.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	12					1126	1132		10.1080/10934529.2017.1342496								WOS:000414129100002	28738172					
J	Dede, OT; Sezer, M				Dede, Ozlem Tunc; Sezer, Melike			The application of Canadian water quality index (CWQI) model for the assessment of water quality of Aksu creek	JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE OF GAZI UNIVERSITY												Water quality is an important factor effecting health and safety of all living. With growing population and emerging technologies, the concern about the sustainability of water quality is increasing day by day. The concerns about water quality issues are increasing day by day with growing population and technological development. Thus, determination and assessment of parameters effecting water quality is important. For this purpose, Water Quality Index (WQI) which can be calculated easily as a single number can be used. In this study, the water quality data obtained from 3 sampling stations during one year monitoring period at Aksu Creek, one of the main drinking water resource of Giresun province, was evaluated. The analysis of 36 water quality parameters was done for all water samples at Water Analysis Laboratory of General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) in Trabzon. In conclusion, it was found that DO, T. coli, E. coli and phenol values which exceed the limit values given in the water quality standards are the major pollutants that affect the water quality. By the way; color, turbidity, ammonia nitrogen, manganese, iron, aluminum, mercury and surfactant values also exceeded the limit values at some points. Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI) was used for the comprehensible expression and interpretation of the data. When the calculated index values were compared with the measured water quality data, it was seen that index values are radical. The categories of index model for all stations were found as "poor" category.																	1300-1884	1304-4915					2017	32	3					909	917		10.17341/gazimmfd.337643								WOS:000412800400023

The development effort of a suitable system for process data analysis comprises a serious effort for the connection to the data sources, the comprehension of the recorded data, and the development of a feasible visualization. To avoid this, an integrated architecture based on existing industrial standards can be used. The present paper discusses such a modular architecture which makes the possibilities of process optimization and predictive maintenance transparent to the user. The architecture is based on standards fur production plant modelling (AutomationML) and for the connection to the production process (OPC UA). It includes an example implementation of water quality monitoring using principal component analysis.																			978-3-662-53806-7; 978-3-662-53805-0				2017	3						25	33		10.1007/978-3-662-53806-7_4								WOS:000412803500004

To detect anomalies, usually each sensor contains its own threshold, but machine-learning algorithms become an alternative to reduce the parametrization effort. Still, one reason why they are not used in practice is the geographical restricted data access. Data is stored at the plant, but data scientists needed for the data analysis are situated elsewhere. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes a cloud-based event-detection and reporting platform, which provides a possibility to use machine learning algorithms. The plant's measurements are cyclically transferred into a secure cloud service where they are downloaded and analyzed from the data scientist. Results are made available as reports.																			978-3-662-53806-7; 978-3-662-53805-0				2017	3						35	43		10.1007/978-3-662-53806-7_5								WOS:000412803500005						
J	Estigoni, MV; Miranda, RB; Mauad, FF				Estigoni, Marcus Vinicius; Miranda, Renato Billia; Mauad, Frederico Fabio			Hydropower reservoir sediment and water quality assessment	MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Purpose - Finer sediment particles (silt and clay) transported by rivers carry the major part of nutrient loads by absorption; thus, sediment settling can remove nutrients from the water column. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relation between reservoir sedimentation and water quality by assessing the reservoir sedimentation process and the sediments' characteristics. Design/methodology/approach - Bathymetric surveys from 2004 to 2014 were analyzed to assess the sedimentation process. Core samples provided information on a layer-by-layer basis of the sediment deposits, and water samples near the surface and near the bottom provided information on sediment concentration, and adsorbed and dissolved nutrients. Findings - The upstream region of a reservoir is already silted. From 2004 to 2014, the delta evoluted approximately 500 m downstream and the deposits were mainly composed of clay. An area of approximately 1,000 m between the delta and the dam should still be able to continue allowing sediment deposition in the coming years. Most of the nutrients were absorbed into the sediment particles, except for the nitrogen measured in the dry season. Research limitations/implications - Although analyses of the full cycle of the nutrients were not carried out, the constant sediment trapping of finer sediments and the high rate of absorbed nutrients in the suspended sediment support the hypothesis that the reservoir has removed nutrients from aqueous media by adsorption into sediments. Practical implications - In the studied case, reservoir sedimentation has led to better water quality downstream. Originality/value - It is shown in this study that reservoir sedimentation may have positive effects on river water quality.																	1477-7835	1758-6119					2017	28	1					43	56		10.1108/MEQ-07-2015-0153								WOS:000413397700004

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impacts of the discharges of Juquitiba's WTP and STP on the quality of the SLR, by using an integrated approach based on different lines of evidence. Design/methodology/approach - Six sampling sites were established along the river and comprised areas situated upstream and downstream of the discharges. Five sampling surveys were performed between 2004 and 2006 for collecting water and sediment samples for ecotoxicological assays. In two of these campaigns, benthic community structure and geochemistry (metals, nutrients and sediment texture) were also assessed. Findings - Concentrations of P, Fe and Al in waters exceeded the national standards, but sediments were not considered to be contaminated by metals or nutrients. Water and sediments tended to exhibit marginal toxicities, excluding the sediments from JQT007 and JQT008 that were frequently toxic. Combination of geochemistry, toxicity and ecological indices indicated that some sites are not degraded, but in some stations the benthic alteration may be due to non-measured contaminants, especially in JQT007 and JQT008. Practical implications - As the use of waters from SLR for public supply has increased, these results show that action should be taken in order to reverse the environmental degradation of SRL. Originality/value - This research combined sediment and water quality assessments in order to provide a more suitable and reliable diagnostic of the environmental quality of the SLR.

Design/methodology/approach - In order to address the water quality of the basins, field sampling was conducted and the samples were analysed in the laboratory. A comparison with water quality standards was also made and the interpretations of the results were done using GIS and statistical tools. Findings - The values of conductivity, chlorides and salinity show that the coastal areas of Neyyar and Karamana basins are severely affected by salinity intrusion in addition to the pollution problems. More than 90 per cent of the samples are with hardness lower than 100 mg/l. About 70 per cent of the study area is with calcium concentrations lower than 25 mg/l. The content of sulphate and magnesium in Poovar and Poonthura coastal stretches is found to be higher compared to other regions. Originality/value - Since not much work has been published from the study area on these aspects, the hydrochemical characterization is a very important in deciphering the quality of ground water for its proper management. The water quality evaluation and salinity intrusion studies are very important for the future planning and development of this area.																	1477-7835	1758-6119					2017	28	3					444	459		10.1108/MEQ-01-2015-0002								WOS:000413398400010

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the degree of deterioration using the water quality index. Design/methodology/approach - Rapid urban growth without proper land use and occupation planning results in the overload of urban water resources. Therefore, a literature review was conducted on the research subject published in the dissertation databases of the Engineering Faculty of Ilha Solteira, which resulted in the selection of two dissertations on water quality in the Ipe Stream, Ilha Solteira - SP, Brazil. The results will be evaluated according to the Brazilian laws and regulations in force. Findings - This study shows that pollution and degradation in the stream intensified during the study period, with the most impacted areas within the urban perimeter. Practical implications - The increasing impacts underscore the need for efficient measures such as implementation of retention reservoirs, elimination of clandestine sewage connections and restoration of riparian forests. Originality/value - This study highlights the need to monitor the water quality of streams in order to establish preventive and mitigating measures to avert the growing environmental impacts and to ensure quality water for future generations.																	1477-7835	1758-6119					2017	28	4					566	578		10.1108/MEQ-07-2015-0141								WOS:000413399000008

Design/methodology/approach - The research study included employee interviews, noise monitoring, effluent and ground water sampling, stack emission testing, and assessment of the solid waste management system. Findings - Semi-structured interviews randomly conducted with employees showed a 57 percent environmental awareness response. The stack emission results showed that the nitrogen oxide (NOx) from engine no. 5 and 7 was 2,447 and 2,624 mg/Nm(3), respectively, higher than the World Bank limit of 2,300 mg/Nm(3) as well as exceeding the 600 mg/Nm(3) set by the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) with no emission control technology in place. The ground water and effluent samples were found unfit for irrigation purposes. Electrical conductivity exceeded the permissible level of Directorate of Land Reclamation (DLR) irrigation water quality criteria of 1.5 dS/m. Similarly, the sodium absorption ratio (SAR) exceeded 10 mmolc/l. Residual sodium carbonate was more than the DLR permissible level of 2.5 me/l. The noise level in the engine hall was 103 dB(A) which is beyond the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's permissible exposure limit of 90 dB(A) and the NEQS for industrial area at day time, i.e. 75 dB(A). Research limitations/implications - The research analysis shows that environmental survey may serve as an example for other power plants to review their environmental policy and be more vigilant as an environmentally conscious organization. Originality/value - This paper underscores an easy understanding and evaluation of environmental indicators that are minor but neglected in a thermal power plant. The sampling, testing, and employee awareness are crucial to gauge the level of an organization's conformity with the international quality, occupational health, and environmental standards.																	1477-7835	1758-6119					2017	28	6					930	945		10.1108/MEQ-05-2014-0080								WOS:000413399800010

Land use, soil properties and weather conditions influence nutrient fluxes into a deep oligotrophic lake	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Many streams and rivers in upland watersheds in southern New Zealand drain into deep, oligotrophic lakes with major aesthetic, recreational and conservation values. We examined the effects of increasing pasture cover and weather-related variables on nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in eight streams draining into Lake Wanaka and hypothesised that (1) DOC and N concentrations would increase with increasing land development, but soil characteristics in the watershed would mediate P input and (2) weather-related factors that increase hydrological connectivity in the landscape would enhance the influx of N and DOC. Agricultural development correlated positively with N and DOC concentrations in stream water, but temperature and soil moisture mitigated the influence of pasture cover on surface-water DOC concentration under very dry or very wet conditions. Weather-related factors did not influence N concentrations in streams. Neither land use nor weather-related conditions correlated with concentrations of dissolved P, possibly reflecting good P-binding in soils and lack of sampling during high-flow events. Our results provided evidence that agricultural development in grassland watersheds increases the concentrations of Nand DOC entering Lake Wanaka, and weather and soil conditions mediate the amount of DOC transferred from soils into streams.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	10					1830	1844		10.1071/MF16042								WOS:000411826800005

We measured nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios and concentrations in mangrove leaves and muscle tissues of two species of gastropod snails to determine the dispersion and biological assimilation of sewage-derived nutrients in a macro-tidal creek. The values of stable isotope of nitrogen (delta N-15) in mangrove leaves and gastropods from the affected creek were significantly higher than those in samples from an unaffected creek, reflecting a graduated influence of sewage-derived N. The delta N-15 values in mangrove leaves showed high repeatability between sampling rounds and this, coupled with ease of sampling, makes them an effective monitoring tool to trace the influence of sewage effluent in receiving waters. The combined use of values of delta N-15 and stable isotope of carbon in gastropods showed some promise as a monitoring tool, but intra-and inter-specific variations in isotope values due to spatial differences in available food sources may affect their reliability in tracing sewage influence.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	10					1855	1866		10.1071/MF16080								WOS:000411826800007

Characterising the variations in phytoplankton communities and the factors affecting these variations in a fluctuating environment are central issues in ecology and essential to developing appropriate conservation strategies. In the present study, seasonal variations in the phytoplankton community and the driving environmental factors were analysed based on data from Lake Nansihu in 2013. In all, 138 phytoplankton species were identified. The phytoplankton community exhibited seasonal variations, with a mean abundance that ranged from 5.00 x 10(5) cells L-1 in winter to 4.57 x 10(6) cells L-1 in summer and a mean biomass that varied from 0.44 mg L-1 in winter to 3.75 mg L-1 in summer. A spring algal bloom did not appear in this warm, temperate monsoon lake, but an algal bloom did appear in summer when the temperature and nutrient concentrations were high. There were substantial seasonal variations in the dominant phytoplankton taxa, from Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta and Euglenophyta in spring to Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta in summer, followed by dominance of Chlorophyta in autumn and Bacillariophyta in winter. Results of canonical correspondence analysis indicated that although the environmental factors affecting the seasonal variations in different phytoplankton species varied, water temperature, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen appeared to be the most dominant. These four variables were also the main environmental factors driving the seasonal variations in the phytoplankton community in the lake. The results of the present study will be useful in guaranteeing the water quality and ecological security of Lake Nansihu.

Nitrogen nutrients in a subtropical river: temporal variation and analysis at different spatial scales	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Herein we provide a framework for evaluating the spatiotemporal variation of nitrate and ammonium and their relationships with environmental and anthropogenic variables at different scales. Bimonthly samples were collected from 28 sites in the Duero River, Mexico, from May to December 2013. The river flow changed and lost connectivity during the dry season because more water was diverted for irrigation. Four sites had the highest nitrate and ammonium values (7.6 and 22.1 mg L-1 respectively), which were related to direct waste water discharge. The remaining 24 sites were analysed using a multivariate approach. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, seasonal trends were identified with two groupings during July and five in December. Sites were grouped into those with constant discharge and nitrates affected by springs and those with poor water quality (high concentrations of ammonium). Non-metric multidimensional scaling simultaneously revealed the variation in time and space, organised sites into an environmental ammonium gradient and differentiated between seasons according to nitrate levels. Regression tree analysis established a relationship between nutrients and independent variables. At the landscape level, the agricultural area affected nitrate (75%) and urban area affected ammonium (45%); at the basin level, road density influenced both parameters (10.68 km per 25 km(2)).																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	10					1935	1949		10.1071/MF16344								WOS:000411826800014

The effect of agriculture on cave-stream invertebrate communities	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The impacts that land-use changes have on cave-stream fauna have not been considered widely in the investigations of land-use impacts on stream ecology. The present study examines how above-ground agriculture may influence cave-stream invertebrate communities. The invertebrate communities in four cave streams and their surface counterparts were sampled in 2014-2015, including two drained predominantly agricultural catchments and two drained forested catchments. These communities were examined alongside habitat and GIS land-use data to determine the relationship between above-ground land use and the stream communities. Invertebrate community composition and ecological health for surface streams was different between the agricultural and forest catchments. These differences were less pronounced within the cave-stream communities. Sedimentation was the principal agricultural stressor in the cave streams. The overall effects of agriculture were lower within the cave streams than on the surface; this is likely to be due to the reduced number of potentially deleterious stressors on cave streams.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	11					1999	2007		10.1071/MF16112								WOS:000413690000003

The effect of riparian restoration on channel complexity and soil nutrients	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Restoration of riparian vegetation may reduce nutrient and sediment contamination of waterways while potentially enhancing stream channel complexity. Accordingly, the present study used a paired-site approach to investigate the effects of mature regrowth riparian vegetation on river channel morphology and soil nutrients (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus), comparing four sites of degraded (pasture) and reforested reaches. A revised rapid assessment of riparian condition (RARC) was used to validate the site pairings. Riparian soil nutrient and elemental geochemistry were compared between paired sites, along with two parameters of channel width complexity and two for channel slope complexity. The RARC analysis confirmed the validity of the paired site design. The elemental geochemistry results indicated that underlying geology may affect the paired site analyses. Reaches with mature regrowth vegetation had greater channel width complexity but no difference in their riverbed slope complexity. In addition, degraded reaches had higher soil nutrient (i.e. nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations, potentially indicative of the greater nutrient retention of pasture grass sites compared with mature regrowth forested reaches with less ground cover. Overall, the present study indicates that restoring mature regrowth riparian vegetation may increase river channel width complexity, although it may require canopy management to optimise the nutrient retention potential necessary to maximise the effect of riparian restoration strategies on freshwater environments.

To recover these salmonid populations, an interagency committee is developing a plan to reintroduce fish to tributaries upstream of Shasta Dam and provide juvenile fish passage downstream past the dam. One downstream fish passage alternative involves the collection and transport of juvenile fish from head-of-reservoir locations. A hydrodynamic and water quality model (CE-QUAL-W2) of Shasta Lake and its main tributaries was used to assess where and when water temperatures were favorable for juvenile salmonid collection on the McCloud River arm of the lake under different hydrologic scenarios. The application of anchored and floating temperature curtains (i.e., flexible fabric flow barriers) was examined to assess whether they could be used to improve temperature conditions for juvenile fish by reducing temperatures to within an optimal range. Model results indicated that head-of-reservoir conditions without a temperature curtain were suitable for spring-run Chinook Salmon, fall-run Chinook Salmon, and steelhead but not for winter-run and late-fall-run Chinook Salmon. However, permanent or temporary use of temperature curtains, especially a long floating curtain, may improve conditions for juvenile winter-run and late-fall-run Chinook Salmon by reducing or eliminating lethal water temperatures.

J	Dembowska, EA				Dembowska, Ewa Anna			Evaluation of Ecological Potential of the Lower Vistula River Based on Multi-Year Research on Phytoplankton	OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												Changes in ecological status of the lower Vistula River over the past two decades were evaluated. The.1990s saw dynamic changes in the Polish economy and increasing environmental awareness, accompanied by introduction of modem, effective treatment methods of wastewater discharges into rivers. Yet, extensive research on modern evaluation of aquatic ecosystems was only conducted in the first decade of the 21st century. Planktonic diatoms (mainly of the Centricae subclass) followed by coccal chlorophyta were the main groups determined to form the phytoplankton biomass in the Vistula River in Torun. A more significant contribution of other algal groups (including cyanobacteria) is only occasional. Application of phytoplankton multimetric index (IFPL) for rivers allowed assessment of water quality variations in the Vistula River. Phytoplankton of the Vistula River determined in the '90s was compared with that of the period of 2007-2015. The trophic index (TI) measured in the 90's indicated poor ecological status of the river. Its value for both years of research (1994 and 1998) was 0.35. Over the subsequent twenty years the water quality significantly improved. Today, the TI value is 0.66, while the average phytoplankton multimetric index is 0.75, indicating good ecological potential of the Vistula River in Torun.																	1230-6169						2017	39	3					19	24										WOS:000412619400003

The intestinal microbiota of the C. ectenes were identified by the V4 of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, the water quality of different sampling sites was also evaluated. A total of 53 phyla and 730 classified genera were found in all the samples. The eight dominant phyla Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, Crenarchaeota, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia were included. The intestinal microbiota compositions of the C. ectenes obtained from the same location presented more similar profiles, and the intestinal microbiota compositions of the C. ectenes from different geographical locations showed considerable differences. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) abundance of the intestinal microbiota was significantly correlated with both the concentrations of total nitrogen and chlorophyll-a of the aquatic environment (p<0.05). Geographical location was an important determinant for the fish's intestinal microbiota composition. The intestinal microbiota of C. ectenes would be affected by the concentrations of total nitrogen and chlorophyll-a in the water. These findings achieve a basic understanding of fish's gut microbiota, and are helpful for the protection of fish resources in Lake Taihu and provided the cornerstone to sustainable utlization of C. ectenes.																	2391-5412						2017	12	1					315	325		10.1515/biol-2017-0037								WOS:000413566200006

An innovative hybrid process based on biofiltration, ozonation and short SAT (sSAT, with similar to 22 days retention time) was demonstrated in a 6 m(3)/hr pilot system to remove emerging trace organic compounds (TrOCs), organic matter and control Mn2+ dissolution in reclaimed water. The biofiltration stage was proposed for nitrification of ammonia as well as removal of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM), to enable efficient ozonation of secondary effluents. The pilot system was operated in two modes, where samples were periodically taken from all pilot stages to observe changes in product water quality. At first (Mode 1), biofiltered effluents were infiltrated through sSAT (i.e., no ozonation prior infiltration). During this operation, ammonia, nitrite and phosphate were completely removed, and pathogens were highly reduced. In addition, all measured TrOCs were effectively removed after sSAT, besides the persistent TrOCs Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Iodine-organic contrast media Iopamidol (IPDL). In Mode 2, biofiltered and ozonated (1.0-1.2 mg ozone/mg DOC) effluents were infiltrated through sSAT. In the final reclaimed product, values of DOC, UVA and Mn2+ were reduced to 0.8 mg/L, 2.2 L/m, and 29-35 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, ammonia and nitritewere not detected in the product, and good bacterial quality was obtained. Following 56-75 days of operation at Mode 2, all TrOCs were reduced down to <100 ng/L. The delay in the effect of the pretreatment stages on TrOCs removal by sSAT (>56 days instead of similar to 22 days) could be explained by their displacement retardation in the upper soil layers of the pilot SAT (0-25 cm). In-depth sampling inbservation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water. the observation well after 111 days atMode 2 showed homogeneity along the overall perforated section of the well (from -14 to -26 m) with 0.7-0.9 mg/L DOC, 2.1-2.2 1/m UVA and <10 ng/L CBZ. This result proved that the ozonated water completely covered the area around the observation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water.																	0191-9512	1547-6545					2017	39	5					385	394		10.1080/01919512.2017.1346465								WOS:000413092900010

The influence of dissolved oxygen on dinoflagellate cyst distribution across Sluice Pond, a meromictic lake in NE Massachusetts, USA	PALYNOLOGY												Assemblages of dinoflagellate cysts in lakebed sediments across the deep, meromictic basin of Sluice Pond (Lynn, Massachusetts) were compared with measurements of water quality and sediment geochemistry and with testate amoeba and tintinnid assemblages. Lakebed sediments below oxygenated waters (DO > 2 mg/L) contain diverse testate amoebae, but sparse Peridinium willei-dominated dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. Sediments collected under hypoxic conditions (DO < 2 mg/L) showed higher preservation of organic carbon and nitrogen, and these deep basin sediments are characterised by diverse dinoflagellate cyst assemblages, but sieved microfossil assemblages are typically dominated by the planktonic Codonella cratera and the pseudo-planktonic Cucurbitella tricuspis. Strong inverse relationships of cysts of Peridinium willei (R-2 = 0.81) and Difflugia oblonga tests (R-2 = 0.7) with water depth are attributed to variations in bottom water oxygen concentrations. Both ecological and taphonomic factors must be considered when reconstructing palaeoenvironments from microfossil assemblages.																	0191-6122	1558-9188					2017	41	4					516	532		10.1080/01916122.2016.1276027								WOS:000413571400009

To evaluate the possible control of Microcystis-based water blooms using fruit from Macleaya cordata (MC-fruit), the effects of MC-fruit on the growth, polyphasic chlorophyll fluorescence transients, microcystin production and efficacy of in situ cyanobacterial bloom removal were investigated. The results showed that MC-fruit could effectively inhibit the growth of M. aeruginosa PCC7806 at a concentration of 1 mg l(-1). MC-fruit stress caused severe damage to photosynthesis of M. aeruginosa and decreased the content of cellular microcystin-LR. The results of an in situ field test showed that MC-fruit effectively reduced the biomass of Microcystis and improved water quality. Accordingly, MC-fruit may be a useful biologically derived algicide for cyanobacterial bloom control.																	0031-8884						2017	56	4					382	389		10.2216/16-87.1								WOS:000412892800003

Hence, the present study aimed to determine the changes in the physicochemical characteristics of the Batang Baram, a tropical river in Malaysia, due to a rainfall event. Two samplings were conducted in the Baram in Sarawak before and after rain. The results show that the mean velocity and mean depth of the river increased substantially after rain. The high volume of surface runoff coupled with the fast-flowing river significantly increased the dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, turbidity, chlorophyll a, total sulphide, hydrogen sulphide, and nitrite-nitrogen in the river after rain; whereas the pH, transparency, and organic nitrogen decreased significantly after rain. The water quality index (WQI) in the tributary after rain showed improvement mainly due to an increase in the concentration of dissolved oxygen. On the other hand, the total suspended solids in the main river after rain changed from Class I/II/III to Class III/V due to soil erosion.

The aquatic plants were collected at monthly intervals between March 2014 and November 2014, and epiphytic algae on the plants were identified. In total, 98, 74, and 66 taxa of epiphytic algae were identified on C. demersum, M. spicatum, and P. crispus, respectively. The species composition of the epiphytic algae on the three macrophyte species showed a statistically significant difference (F = 7.07, p<0.05). There was also a statistically significant difference in epiphytic algae species diversity, depending on the sampled month (F = 3.59, p<0.05). The mean species richness and species diversity on C. demersum was 33 and 1.546, respectively. On M. spicatum, the mean species richness and species diversity was 23 and 1.407, respectively. On P. crispus, the mean species richness was 19, and the species diversity was 1.256. The following species were the dominant epiphytic taxa in Gala Lake: Cocconeis placentula, Anabaena constricta, Gomphonema acuminatum, Oscillatoria limosa, Cymbella cistula, and Epithemia sorex.

Recently, the quality of groundwater has been endangered due to several reasons, including human activities, vast agricultural activities, and the discharge of industrial wastewater containing nitrogen (N) and heavy metals. For this study we investigated the values of NO3, NO2, and some heavy metals and analyzed the groundwater of the Ardabil Aquifer area in wet and dry seasons. For this purpose we evaluated 76 wells in the study area. In order to analyze the results we used World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Institute of Standard and Industrial Research of Iran (ISIRI) standards. The results indicated that, according to WHO and ISIRI, 10.5% of wells and, according to the EPA, 69.7% of wells have NO3 above the standard level in the wet season, but in the dry season, according to WHO and ISIRI, 29% and, according to the EPA, 80.6% of the wells have NO3 above the permissible level. However, according to all standards, NO2 values are less than the permissible level for drinking consumption. In terms of evaluation criteria of the simultaneous presence of NO3 and NO2 in drinking water (K), 29% of wells in the dry season and 13.15% of wells in the wet season have NO3 and NO2 problems. In order to find an appropriate interpolation method and zoning parameter of NO3 and NO2, different interpolation methods were evaluated and Kriging method with the lowest error was chosen for zoning the parameters. According to zoning maps, in the wet season the Namin and south Ardabil areas, which have the most drinking water wells, contain values of NO3 above the permissible levels, whereas the values of NO3 are at the mediocre level in the dry season. In addition to NO3 and NO2 analysis, the evaluation of heavy metals pollution indices in the aquifer include: heavy metal pollution index (HPI), heavy metal evaluation index (HEI), and contamination degree (C d). Generally, according to the EPA, in terms of NO3 and NO2 pollution, Ardabil aquifer is in an undesirable condition, and according to WHO and ISIRI standards, this area has a mediocre level of undesirable condition. According to HPI and C d indices, most parts are in a high class of heavy metal pollution, as well.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	5					2267	2276		10.15244/pjoes/69943								WOS:000412767500035

The case study presents an example of the assessment of the surface water quality in the Horned basin in terms of tourism. The surface water quality has been evaluated in 10 sampling profiles on the river Horned and water reservoirs Ruzin and Palcmanska Masa for the period 2010 - 2015, potentially toxic elements for the period 1995 - 2015. Evaluated had been selected indicators of surface water quality - general indicators, non-synthetic substances, synthetic substances, hydrological and biological indicators. According to valid legislative norms for the evaluation of surface water, data had been statistically processed and evaluated water quality and trends for the period. Overall evaluation provides a comprehensive picture of the quality of surface water in the evaluated area from the point of tourism, in relation to fishing tourism, swimming water quality and health risks.																	2336-6311	2336-632X	978-80-7509-487-2				2017							515	524										WOS:000411915000079

Predicting the amount of chemical dosage in Effluent Treatment Plant Using Artificial Neural Network	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												The wastewater is treated to dispose the water safely to the environment that can be acceptable for the end-use, which can be for drinking, domestic and industrial use. Wastewater treatment is the complex and dynamic process of removing pollutants from outlets of industries, agricultural farms or municipal organizations. The main features of the pollutants are randomly distributed, non-Linear, time-varying and uncertain. The concept of the treatment is based on controlling the effluent parameters like pH values and dissolved oxygen (COD, BOD) so that the condensate coming out will meet the fresh water quality. The main objective of this paper is to predict the amount of dosage (acid or alkali) to be added at the primary clarifier to control the pH value. To predict the correct amount of acid or alkaline, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used. The sensors read the pH value, COD, BOD, TSS etc., from the polluted water collection tank. The sensor inputs are fed to the ANN along with the target values for training. Backpropagation training algorithm has been used along with Gradient descent training algorithm for training the neural network. Using the trained ANN model the amount of acid or alkaline is added to restore the pH value to the desired level (Ph value = 7). It is observed that the ANN model developed is able to predict the amount of acid or alkaline correctly for a set of input sensor values.																	0975-8585					JAN-FEB	2017	8	1					88	95										WOS:000410595600012

The survey of the odonatofauna of three major Algerian wadis: Kebir-East, Seybouse, and Rhumel, led to the identification of 40 species. Our results revealed the presence of Calopteryx exul, a Maghrebian endemic, at Wadi Seybouse and seemed to confirm the extinction of the type population at Wadi Rhumel where the species was first recorded in the XIXth Century. The results also indicated the range expansion of several species: Coenagrion caerulescens, Orthetrum nitidinerve, Trithemis kirbyi and Urothemis edwardsii whose relict population is critically endangered. Additionally sampling of abiotic factors (altitude, water temperature, conductivity, etc.) was carried out and data analysed in view of exploring a possible co-structure between the faunistic and environmental data sets. Data analysis indicated that correlation between abiotic factors (hydroperiod, water conductivity and water temperature) and species richness differed between streams and thus Odonata may prove useful in evaluating the ecological integrity of Mediterranean lotic systems.																	0249-7395						2017	72	3					314	329										WOS:000413090300007

Applying behavioural science to the Queensland sugar cane industry and its relationship to the Great Barrier Reef	RURAL EXTENSION AND INNOVATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL												The decline of the health of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has motivated efforts to modify the farming practices of landholders connected to the Reef-especially cane growers. Despite knowledge of the importance of human behaviour in protecting the GBR, a focus on the science of how to change human behaviour has not featured prominently in discussions about water quality. This paper outlines the empirical basis for an evidence-based behaviour change program targeting Queensland's population of sugar cane growers. The paper reviews the evidence of behaviour change in the context of the sugar cane industry and outlines the key considerations in designing a program of change at scale. It is concluded that a population-level approach to behavioural change is a potentially pivotal means for accelerating the adoption of new farming practices across the sugar cane industry.																	2204-8758	2204-8766					2017	13	2					1	10										WOS:000413773500002

The aim of this paper is to quantify the effectiveness of extension delivery mechanisms. Over the period 2013 to 2015, the project conducted 93 surveys of randomly selected producers who had engaged with the project from 2011 to 2015. The surveys collected information such as improved confidence, practice change and narratives. The evaluation of survey data found that the project greatly exceeded project targets for practice change (>= 40 per cent), achieving 78 per cent (95% confidence interval: 69% - 87%). As well, producers who had engaged with DAF in Grazing Land Management (GLM) extension were more likely to adopt GLM practices than producers who did not (p = 0.01), though the extension delivery method was not influential (p = 0.53). This analysis has shown the value in conducting a robust evaluation program both for demonstrating practice change and informing future extension programs.																	2204-8758	2204-8766					2017	13	2					70	75										WOS:000413773500009

In Australia, there are very few examples where collaborative NRM projects have been implemented on this scale, let alone be subject to a robust evaluation. Documenting the path taken to submit and implement the single application as well as evaluating the delivery model to determine if it provides a more cost effective and strategic way of delivering NRM projects is critical. Managing a single project with twelve organisations requires ownership, commitment and flexibility from all partners. Through the development and implementation of a robust M&E framework, the Reef Alliance will have a much better understanding as to the impact of the collaboration and whether it is a more strategic and cost effective model to generate water quality outcomes.																	2204-8758	2204-8766					2017	13	2					141	146										WOS:000413773500020

Graziers can identify opportunities to achieve best management practice. In the Burdekin Catchment, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) supports Grazing BMP with an extension project that has a whole-of-business approach to achieve reef water quality outcomes. The DAF extension and support project has documented evidence of both intent to change and actual practice change as a result of the extension activities across 272 beef businesses. This is in contrast to responses to regulatory programs such as the Environmental Risk Management Plan (ERMP) requirement previously applied in the region. Even though 265 beef businesses in the Burdekin Catchment completed the ERMP requirement there is no documented evidence of intent or actual practice change taking place to improve reef water quality using this legislative approach.																	2204-8758	2204-8766					2017	13	2					156	160										WOS:000413773500023

Funding from the public and private sectors has enabled Project Catalyst to build a strong network of innovators committed to sustainable cane farming. With a focus on changes that have environmental as well as economic benefits, Project Catalyst highlights that farmers can drive significant improvements for the environment without jeopardising their business viability. Growers are supported throughout the trialling of new concepts by an experienced team including farm extension and agronomic service providers, economists, suppliers, environmental consultants and communications specialists. The project has been structured to provide growers with a positive environment for the exchange of ideas and information that has fostered innovation. In this paper, we explore how Project Catalyst came about, some of the early challenges, and some key learnings from this approach to innovation.																	2204-8758	2204-8766					2017	13	2					167	171										WOS:000413773500025						
J	Royle, A; Di Bella, L				Royle, Adam; Di Bella, Lawrence			Targeted sugarcane grower extension improves reef water quality	RURAL EXTENSION AND INNOVATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL												Environmentally, economically and socially the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is a high value asset. To protect this asset, the quality of water leaving sugarcane farms and entering the GBR has come under the spotlight. While the science behind improving water quality has received much attention, a targeted extension program to deliver research outcomes has been critical in achieving adoption of best management practices (BMP). Primary causes of water quality concerns have come from the use of pesticides and fertilisers. With the assistance of state and national funding, an extension program targeting group activities, oneon- one extension and demonstration trial plots was employed to improve adoption of BMP. Information gathered through the Herbert Cane Productivity Services 'green sheet' data collection system has also indicated that there has been a positive change in on-farm management practices, in particular with improvements to nitrogen use efficiency (NUE).																	2204-8758	2204-8766					2017	13	2					187	192										WOS:000413773500029

In assessing the water quality, classical methods are no longer sufficient to express the complexity of the effects that pollutants have over the environment. Therefore, advanced researches have been made to acquire better methods and instruments for a cleaner environment. Utilizing microorganism and their metabolic activity for evaluating the water condition is not totally new but the research over these methods is improved by every study that is made bringing fresh perspectives in this area. In order to evaluate the quality of water and sediment, samples have been taken from three main areas of Castailor Creek (upstream of the city, industrial area and downstream of Bistrita city). Some groups of microorganisms, used as pollution indicators, have been assessed, and also the effect of pollutants on creek micro biota. The physical-chemical parameters of water from different sampling points were also determined. The quantitative enzyme activity has been assessed: actual and potential dehydrogenase activity, catalase and phosphatase activities. Based on the results, the bacterial and enzymatic indicators of water and sediment quality from Castailor Creek were also calculated. The main purpose of this research is to assess microbiological and enzymological indicators of pollution in the water and sediment of Castailor Creek, Bistrita.

The aim of present study was to investigate a new found species of Lemna in Bulgarian water reservoirs regarding their protein content and bioaccumulation of heavy metals. Two water bodies located on the territory of South East Bulgaria - Tvardica Dam Lake with growing L. minuta and Nikolaevo fishpond with growing L. valdiviana were studied. Crude protein, lipid, ash contentin two species of Lemna were analysed. The heavy metal in water andaquatic plants was determined on an atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS) "A Analyst 800" - Perkin Elmer. The highest quantity of protein was measured in L. minuta (26.42%), which was 8.71% more compared to L. valdiviana (24.12). The concentrations of metals in the L. minuta and L. valdiviana followed a downward trend: Mn>Fe>Zn>Cu>Ni>Cr>Pb>Cd. The series of bioaccumulation is in descending order: Mn>Fe>Cu>Zn>Cr>Cd>Pb>Ni for L. minuta, and Mn>Fe>Zn>Cu>Cd>Pb>Cr>Ni for L. valdiviana.																	2285-6064						2017	6						104	107										WOS:000413693400018

This study was performed to compare water quality in the domestic wells in these aquifers and to assess the efficacy of household water treatments for treating contaminated water. Replicate well water samples were collected from each aquifer and pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, temperature, total solids (TS), total hardness (TH), chemical oxygen demand (COD), oil and grease (OG), nitrate N (N), and total phosphate (TP) were measured. The sampled water from the domestic wells was filtered through commercial mineral filter and Moringa oleifera leaf powder and boiled at 100 degrees C for 10 minutes and the TH, OG, N, and TP were measured. Both OG and N in Chunnakam were significantly higher and the DO were significantly lower than those of Vadamaradchi. TH, N, and OG of some wells exceeded the drinking water quality standards established by Sri Lanka Standards Institution. Moringa oleifera leaf powder filtration reduced N significantly and filtering through commercial mineral filter reduced OG, TH, and N significantly. Boiling at 100 degrees C could remove TH significantly but may cause significant increase in N which might result in health impacts.																	2090-908X						2017									9478589	10.1155/2017/9478589								WOS:000413476500001

OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FOR TREATED WASTEWATER REUSE IN THE WEST BANK, TUNISIA, AND QATAR	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Harsh environment, severe aridity, and climate change create chronic water shortages in the Middle East. Technical challenges, socio-economic factors, and competing uses of water have escalated the difficulties in water planning at national and institutional levels. This research identifies opportunities and challenges associated with wastewater treatment systems and the potential for wastewater reuse in the West Bank, Tunisia, and Qatar through the following objectives: (1) identify the factors associated with successful and unsuccessful reuse schemes, (2) compare treated wastewater quality with end use application of treated wastewater, and (3) identify the governance and social challenges preventing the use of treated wastewater, specifically in agricultural applications. Water quality analyses and consultations with farmers, local stakeholders, and water and agriculture experts were conducted. Opportunities and challenges for treated wastewater reuse in agriculture are identified as the proximity of the treatment facility to agricultural areas, water quality, and motivation of farmers. With proper maintenance and appropriate monitoring, the modest (natural) treatment facilities in the West Bank and secondary treatment technologies in Tunisia are capable of producing effluent safe for use in production of certain agricultural products; however, in Qatar, despite massive investments in producing high-quality treated wastewater using advanced treatment technologies, there is little demand. Water policies, laws and acts, and action plans are urgently needed to be coupled and integrated for implementation.

WATER QUALITY EFFECTS OF SWITCHGRASS INTERCROPPING ON PINE FOREST IN COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Interplanting a cellulosic bioenergy crop (switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L.) between loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) rows could potentially provide a sustainable source of bio-feedstock without competing for land currently in food production. The objectives of this study were to: (1) quantify the concentrations and loads of drainage water nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (phosphate) associated with establishment and growth of switchgrass treatments and compare them with those for a mid-rotation pine forest (control), and (2) quantify the treatment effects on drainage water N and phosphate compared to the control and compare the effects between treatments, i.e., switchgrass intercropped into young loblolly pine (IC) and switchgrass only (SG). Thinned mid-rotation loblolly pine with natural understory (MP) was used as the control. Pretreatment calibration equations for nutrients were obtained using a paired watershed approach and bootstrap geometric regression with 2007-2008 data, when pine on all sites had reached canopy closure. Treatment effects on IC and SG were calculated as the difference between expected respective values from the pretreatment relationship and measured data for the treatment period. Precipitation, outflow, and N and phosphate concentrations in the outflow were measured during calibration (Jan. 2007 to Dec. 2008), site preparation for switchgrass establishment (Nov. 2009 to Mar. 2012), and switchgrass growth (Apr. 2012 to Apr. 2014). Mean NO3-N concentrations and loads were significantly (alpha = 0.05) greater for SG than for IC during the switchgrass growth period. Average treatment concentrations with standard errors and total load effects during switchgrass growth for NO3-N followed the trends SG (-0.002 +/- 0.01 mg L-1) >IC (-0.12 +/- 0.04 mg L-1) and SG (0.75kg ha(-1)) > IC (0.23kg ha(-1)), respectively. For phosphate average concentrations and loads, the treatment effects during switchgrass growth followed the trends SG (-0.004 +/- 0.0 mg L-1) >IC (-0.02 +/- 0.0 mg L-1) and IC (-0.43 kg ha(-1)) >SG (0.70 kg ha(-1)), respectively. Average concentration effects for NO3-N and phosphate and total load effects for phosphate significantly (a = 0.05) decreased for IC compared to the MP control. These results suggest that the intercropping treatment (IC) with loblolly pine and switchgrass improved water quality by reducing NO3-N and phosphate concentrations and phosphate loads.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	5					1607	1620		10.13031/trans.12181								WOS:000413277100017

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF HYDRODYNAMIC VORTEX SEPARATOR AT DIFFERENT HYDRAULIC RETENTION TIMES APPLIED IN RECIRCULATING BIOFLOC TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Recirculating biofloc technology (RBFT) has been gradually acknowledged for its positive effect on the control of biofloc concentration using a hydrodynamic vortex separator (HDVS). To operate an RBFT system at maximum performance, the removal efficiency of an HDVS at different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) must be fully predictable. Hence, a numerical study of the fluid flow and particle dynamics was performed to characterize the performance of an HDVS at varying HRTs. First, flow simulation was conducted to determine an economical mesh size at an HRT of 248 s. Then, with respect to the total suspended solids (TSS) in the RBFT system and the physical properties of the flocs, two-way coupling of the dense discrete phase model (DDPM) and discrete element model (DEM) methods was used to predict floc tracking in an HDVS. Additionally, the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with the Reynolds stress turbulence model (RSM) were solved using the finite volume method based on the semi-implicit method pressure-linked equations (SIMPLE) pressure correction algorithm in the computational domain. Finally, pilot-scale studies were conducted to verify the simulation models. Based on the simulation results, floc management in an RBFT system is briefly discussed. Due to limited research on the numerical simulation and operating conditions of an HDVS in an RBFT system, this article describes an original investigation of the modeling approach.																	2151-0032	2151-0040					2017	60	5					1737	1747		10.13031/trans.12415								WOS:000413277100028

Example analyses for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, suspended sediment, and total zinc in highway runoff were done by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with FHWA to simulate long-term annual loads for TMDL analyses with the stochastic empirical loading and dilution model known as SELDM. Concentration statistics from 19 highway runoff monitoring sites in Massachusetts were used with precipitation statistics from 11 long-term monitoring sites to simulate long-term pavement yields (loads per unit area). Highway sites were stratified by traffic volume or surrounding land use to calculate concentration statistics for rural roads, low-volume highways, high-volume highways, and ultraurban highways. The median of the event mean concentration statistics in each traffic volume category was used to simulate annual yields from pavement for a 29-or 30-year period. Long-term average yields for total nitrogen, phosphorus, and zinc from rural roads are lower than yields from the other categories, but yields of sediment are higher than for the low-volume highways. The average yields of the selected water quality constituents from high-volume highways are 1.35 to 2.52 times the associated yields from low-volume highways. The average yields of the selected constituents from ultraurban highways are 1.52 to 3.46 times the associated yields from highvolume highways. Example simulations indicate that both concentration reduction and flow reduction by structural best management practices are crucial for reducing runoff yields.																	0361-1981	2169-4052					2017		2638					104	112		10.3141/2638-12								WOS:000413522400012

The potential role of night-time lighting in attracting terrestrial insects as food for Oreochromis mossambicus and Clarias gariepinus	TROPICAL ZOOLOGY												This study investigated the potential of night-time lighting in enhancing the utilization of aerial insects by Oreochromis mossambicus and Clarias gariepinus. Six treatments L-0 (Light with no fish), N-0 (No light, with no fish), L-T (Light with O. mossambicus), N T (No light with O. mossambicus), L-C (Light with C. gariepinus) and N-C (No light with C. gariepinus) were randomly assigned to aquadams and replicated three times. Two hundred O. mossambicus (60 +/- 0.6 g) and 100 C. gariepinus (90 +/- 0.8 g) were stocked to assigned aquadams. Two other treatments designated F-T (O. mossambicus fed on pellets) and F-C (C. gariepinus fed on pellets), were added. SGR was higher (0.31 g/day) in O. mossambicus subjected to night-time lighting than those that were not (0.05 g/day). C. gariepinus under the night-time lighting also had a higher SGR (0.30 g/day) than the ones that were not (0.26 g/day). However, in both species the growth rate was lower when compared to those fed on commercial pellets. Oreochromis mossambicus benefited more from night-time lighting. The most abundant aerial insects were moths and beetles. The serial slaughter method was used to determine the gastric evacuation rate of moths and beetles in O. mossambicus and C. gariepinus. Moths were evacuated faster (-0.235) than beetles (-0.108) in O. mossambicus. In C. gariepinus, the gastric evacuation of moths was also faster (-0.40) than beetles (-0.36). This implies digestion efficiency was higher in moths than beetles. Water physico-chemical variables were analysed once a week and they were not affected by night-time lighting.

The aim was to evaluate the physical-water properties of the soil in no-tillage, conventional tillage and native forest area. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in the layers: 0.00-0.10; 0.10-0.20; 0.20-0.30; 0.30-0.40 and 0.40-0.50 m. The experimental design was completely randomized in subdivided plots scheme; the plots were constituted by conventional planting system (CPS), no-tillage system (NTS) and native forest (NF), and the subplots were the soil layers. The attributes analyzed were total porosity, soil density, available water capacity and water retention curve in the soil. For each variable evaluated, the analysis of variance and the comparison of means (Tukey p> 0.05) were performed. The NTS and CPS provide changes in the physical properties of the soil and in the shape of the water retention curves in the soil. NTS and CPS do not influence soil density in the superficial layer (0.00-0.10 m). The no-tillage system causes higher subsurface compaction (0.10-0.20 m) and provides less retention of water in the soil when compared to CPS and NF, possibly these attributes vary according to the cultivation time.																	2316-6886					JAN-APR	2017	6	1					87	94										WOS:000413688800001

The digital filtering method has been used to separate the base flows of the Hanjiang, Tianhe, Duhe, Danjiang, Laoguan, and Qihe rivers. Based on daily discharge, base flow, and pollutant concentration data, the flux method was used to calculate the point source pollution load and non-point source pollution load. The results show that: (1) In the year 2013, the total inflow of the six rivers mentioned above accounted for 95.9% of the total inflow to the Danjiangkou Reservoir. The total pollution loads of chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and total phosphorus (TP) from the six rivers were 58.20 +/- 10 3 t and 1.863 +/- 10 3 t, respectively, and the non-point source pollution loads were 39.82 +/- 10 3 t and 1.544 +/- 10 3 t, respectively, indicating that the non-point source pollution is a major factor (with a contribution rate of 68.4% for CODMn and 82.9% for TP). (2) The Hanjiang River is the most significant contributor of pollution loads to the Danjiangkou Reservoir, and its CODMn and TP contribution rates reached 79.3% and 83.2%, respectively. The Duhe River took the second place. (3) Non-point source pollution mainly occurred in the wet season in 2013, accounting for 80.8% and 90.9% of the total pollution loads of CODMn and TP, respectively. It is concluded that the emphasis of pollution control should be placed on non-point source pollution. (C) 2017 Hohai University.

Although fewer parameters in GSA were adjusted, GSA has a slow convergence rate. In this paper, we change the constant acceleration coefficients to be the exponential function on the basis of combination of GSA and PSO (PSO-GSA) and propose an improved PSO-GSA algorithm (written as I-PSOGSA) for solving two kinds of classifications: surface water quality and the moving direction of robots. I-PSO-GSA is employed to optimize weights and biases of backpropagation (BP) neural network. The experimental results show that, being compared with combination of PSO and GSA (PSO-GSA), single PSO, and single GSA for optimizing the parameters of BP neural network, IPSO- GSA outperforms PSO-GSA, PSO, and GSA and has better classification accuracy for these two actual problems.																	1687-9120	1687-9139					2017									2131862	10.1155/2017/2131862								WOS:000411603700001

The MBG was run based on the principle of venturi tube in which water was circulated through a narrowed channel so that air was sucked into the device and pushed by the flowing water to create micro-sized bubble. The MBG aerator was tested on the aquaculture of tilapia fish to be compared to conventional aerator (the bubbler currently used in aquaculture experiments) and control (container with no aeration). The population of 150 tilapia fish of the average initial length of 6.44 cm was tested in each container. The water quality parameters (COD, pH, and TAN) and fish growth parameters (length and weight) were observed for 68 days. The results highlighted the promising potential of MBG as affordable aerator to be applied in intensive aquaculture. Although the dissolved oxygen level did not differ significantly with the conventional aerator, MBG aerator indicated faster degradation of organic content in the water and induced faster growth of the fish as measured by their length and weight.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1510-2				2017	1840								UNSP 110008	10.1063/1.4982338								WOS:000411454200080

Measures enacted to restore degraded freshwater ecosystems often involve the reintroduction of submerged plants and aquatic animals with beneficial ecological functions. In a mesocosm experiment, three treatments (planting with Vallisneria natans, introduction of the snail Bellamya aeruginosa and a combined treatment with both plants and snails) were compared with controls to evaluate their effects on trophic state. The total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations of planktonic and benthic algal samples were determined every two weeks, along with light intensity at the sediment surface. The plant-only treatment significantly reduced the TN levels and planktonic and benthic algal biomass and increased the light intensity at the sediment surface. The snail-only treatment reduced the concentrations of TN and reduced planktonic and benthic algal biomass. The combined treatment decreased the concentrations of TN and TP, reduced planktonic algal biomass and increased the light intensity on the sediment surface. The results indicate that while submerged plants and snails can both improve water quality, the most pronounced effect in aquatic ecosystems is achieved by their presence in combination. A combined reintroduction approach may provide enhanced benefits in restoring the eutrophic ecosystems, following the reduction of external nutrient loading.																	1961-9502						2017		418							44	10.1051/kmae/2017034								WOS:000411616600003

In general, most of the monitoring stations had relatively higher concentrations of N compounds in the bottom water compared to the surface water. In comparison with other selected study areas in Malaysia, the concentration of N compounds in Tasik Kenyir were low, most likely due to less anthropogenic activities around the lake. Based on the National Water Quality Standard (NWQS) classification for Malaysia, the N compound levels for both the surface and bottom waters of Tasik Kenyir can be considered at a natural level ( Class 1), indicating that the water is suitable for the conservation of the natural environment, for water supply with practically no treatment necessary, and for fishery activity including that for very sensitive aquatic species.																	0970-020X	2231-5039					2017	33	3					1325	1330		10.13005/ojc/330332								WOS:000411181300032

It is vital to simulate the flow patterns through hydraulic structures, but it is a challenging work to protect water quality and maintain continuous water transfer. A one-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was built to understand the flow and pollutant movement in this project. Preissmann four-point partial-node implicit scheme was used to solve the governing equations in this study. Water flow and pollutant movement were appropriately simulated and the results indicated that this water quality model was comparable to MIKE 11 and had a good performance and accuracy. Simulation accuracy and model uncertainty were analyzed. Based on the validated water quality model, six pollution scenarios (Q(1) = 10m(3)/s, Q(2) = 30m(3)/s, and Q(3) = 60m(3)/s for volatile phenol (VOP) and contaminant mercury (Hg)) were simulated for the MRP. Emergent pollution accidents were forecasted and changes of water quality were analyzed according to the simulations results, which helped to guarantee continuously transferring water for a large water transfer project.

Quality Assessment of Spring and Well Waters: An Approach Using Water Quality Index and Multivariate Statistical Analysis	AFRICAN REVIEW OF PHYSICS												The study involves assessment of physiochemical state of both spring and well water from hand-dug wells within Akeu Baba Isale community in Ibadan, Southwestern Nigeria. The aim is to assess suitability for domestic purposes and identify possible sources of pollution that may affect groundwater sources. Ten (10) water samples were collected and analyzed for physiochemical parameters. Parameters of interest are: pH, TDS, EC, major cations and anions as well as heavy metals of Pb2+, Zn2+ and Cue Geochemical assessment of water samples were carried out according to APHA standard while a hydro-chemical facies study was done using piper software. The obtained results of physiochemical analyses showed that pH of spring water is slightly acidic (6.5 -6.9) while that of well water is slightly alkaline (7.3 -8.0). It was also revealed that there were elevated concentrations of some analyzed parameters in most of sampled hand -dug wells. Heavy metals concentration in analyzed water samples lie within WHO/NSDWQ limits. Interpretation of piper diagram showed CaCl2 and CaHCO3 to be two prominent water types in the area while alkaline earth metals (Ca2+ and Mg2+) and strong acids (Cl-and SO42-) exceed alkalis and weak acids respectively. The value of Water Quality Index (WQI) of all analyzed water samples were found to lie in the range of 55.6 -101.2. These revealed their unfitness for drinking purpose. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified three (3) factors responsible for over 88% of the total variance in the data set. By utilizing PCA result, the main factors obtained showed that parameters influencing quality of groundwater within the study area are probably related to mineralization, point source pollution, dirty drainage and dissolution of rocks and soils. Pearson's correlation coefficient, among selected physiochemical parameters showed very strong association between EC and TDS. Periodic assessment of physiochemical status and WQI of water samples in the study area will provide an up to date quality status for drinking and consumption purposes.																	2223-6589						2017	12				SI		47	64										WOS:000411029100007						
J	Reshetniak, DY				Reshetniak, D. Y.			Methods for assessing anthropogenic threats to freshwater ecosystems biodiversity	DNIPROPETROVSK UNIVERSITY BULLETIN SERIES-GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY												The industrial and agricultural activities of mankind, which includes chemical pollution, building of dams and hydroelectric power stations and their use of the biomass of freshwater ecosystems, have had considerable impacts on freshwater ecosystems, the abundance of aquatic species, and the vital capacity of those species' populations. A variety of aquatic organisms are feasible indicators and they can be used for evaluation water quality through analysis of their population diversity, composition and abundance. The most significant threats for freshwater biodiversity and the integrity of aquatic ecosystems are activities in the watershed's terrestrial realm, disturbances occurring in aquatic and riparian environments and threats that affect freshwater organisms. There are changes of functional structure of biological community due to reducing biodiversity and the dominance of opportunistic species. A lot of changes in characteristics of biological communities can be assessed by using different kinds of evaluations, including the index of biological integrity, saprobity system and geographic information system technology. An effective predictor of great number of disturbances to freshwater ecosystems is the density of human population. Approaches that directly evaluate the level of threat to freshwater biodiversity typically use species composition and abundance data. Methods that indirectly assess the biotic community evaluate the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. For large-scale, resource-limited, time-constrained biodiversity conservation planning, the most appropriate method for assessing the impairment of freshwater systems is relativistic evaluation of biological integrity using geospatial data. For aquatic threat assessments, the most meaningful level of analysis is the drainage basin and its subbasins. The concept of ecoregions covers all freshwater ecosystems. This approach provides biologically meaningful units for further large-scale studies of existing and potential threats to biodiversity. The size of drainage basins can be defined from digital elevation models, which exist as global network in high quality resolution. At the level of drainage basin, using high-resolution remote sensing imagery is often feasible from a financial and workload perspective.																	2313-2159	2409-9864					2017	25	1					71	79		10.15421/111709								WOS:000410864700009

This study focused on the impacts of missing measured data on flow and non-point source pollution simulations by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. Both the missing rate and missing location of measured flow and total phosphorus were analyzed and discussed. And the extrapolation of parameters to ungauged catchment was discussed in a typical watershed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China. The results showed that an increasing missing rate would cause worse model performance especially in wet periods. Moreover, the calibrated watershed model could be used in ungauged catchment within an extrapolation idea, but the extrapolation of nonpoint source predictions showed poor perfor-mance. This study also indicated that watershed model could be used for ungauged catchment simulation if similar environments and other hu-man disturbance do not exist. This paper provides new guides for water quality monitoring and the usage of watershed models during ungauged periods. (C) 2017 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

J	Hall, LW; Killen, WD; Anderson, RD; Alden, RW				Hall, Lenwood W., Jr.; Killen, Willian D.; Anderson, Ronald D.; Alden, Raymond W., III			The influence of multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors on benthic communities in a mid-west agricultural stream	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The objective of this 3-year study was to characterize benthic communities and physical habitat in an agricultural stream in the mid-west area of the United States (Big Bureau Creek, Illinois). Concurrent basic water quality parameters and seven nutrients were measured in the water column. Sediment measurements from depositional areas were conducted for bifenthrin, Total Organic Carbon, grain size, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and eight metals. All parameters were measured at 12 sites annually during the late summer for a 3-year period (2014, 2015 and 2016). Univariate regressions, stepwise multiple regressions and canonical correlation statistical analyses were used to determine the relationship between various benthic metrics (i.e., taxa richness and abundance) and all the measured parameters for the 3-year database. Benthic communities comprising 108-110 taxa were collected annually, and were generally dominated by sensitive caddisflies and mayflies. These communities were rated as good to exceptional using the Ohio Invertebrate Community Index. Physical habitat for the various sites was rated as good using the Ohio Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index, thus suggesting that habitat is not a significant stressor that would likely impact resident benthic communities. Based on a comparison of measured in-stream total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations and criterion value exceedances, it appears that the in-stream nutrient concentrations could be potentially stressful to resident benthic biota. Metal concentrations were below established NOAA Threshold Effects Levels at all sites. Measured PCB concentrations were below levels of detection at all sites. Toxic units' (TUs) calculations based on using sensitive laboratory strains of Hyalella were less than 0.1 for bifenthrin, thus suggesting that bifenthrin sediment toxicity was unlikely. Thirty significant relationships reported between benthic metrics and the various environmental variables based on the 3-year database were as follows: 12 relationships with habitat metrics, 8 relationships with metals, 7 relationships with nutrients, 2 relationships with bifenthrin and 1 relationship with sediment characteristics. Relative habitat quality, habitat preferences, and ecological competition appear to be factors that shape the characteristics of the benthic communities of Big Bureau Creek, rather than stress imposed by toxicants (bifenthrin and metals), nutrients, or sediment characteristics. Complex relationships between benthic metrics and environmental variables are discussed.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	10					1008	1021		10.1080/10934529.2017.1328947								WOS:000409999100008	28609223

This research focuses on the land change associated with the development of shale oil and gas infrastructure in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in two geographically proximate and physically similar counties, Carroll County, OH, and Washington County, PA. Land-cover data used to measure feature-scale change were digitized from aerial photography and then used to update National Land Cover Dataset data used in the calculation of forest fragmentation for the entire study areas. The amount and pattern of land change was very similar between the two counties even though they are drawing oil and gas from different shale formations. Less than 1% of the total forest for each county was lost but the fragmentation impacts are amplified by the pattern of infrastructure on the landscape.																	1747-423X	1747-4248					2017	12	5					338	350		10.1080/1747423X.2017.1331274								WOS:000410841000002

Many rivers have been polluted because of the rapid growth in industrialization to support the country's growing population and economy. Domestic and industrial sewage, agricultural wastes have polluted the rivers and will affect the water quality. Based on the Malaysia Environment Quality Report 2007, the Department of Environment (DOE) has described that one of the major pollutants is Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Data from DOE in 2004, based on BOD, 18 river basins were classified polluted, 37 river basins were slightly polluted and 65 river basins were in clean condition. In this paper, two models are fitted the data of rivers in Johor state namely Streeter-Phelps model and nonlinear regression (NLR) model. The BOD concentration data for the two rivers in Johor state from year 1981 to year 1990 is analyzed. To estimate the parameters for the Streeter-Phelps model and NLR model, this study focuses on the weighted least squares and Gauss-Newton method respectively. Based on the value of Mean Square Error, NLR model is a better model compared to Streeter-Phelps model.																	0094-243X		978-0-7354-1550-8				2017	1870								UNSP 060014	10.1063/1.4995941								WOS:000410777800118

In this paper, we simulate the effects of effluent released from a marine shrimp aquaculture farm into Sg Setiu, focusing on two critical water quality parameters i.e. DO (dissolved oxygen) and BOD (biochemical oxygen demand). DO is an important constituent in a river in sustaining water quality, with levels of DO below 5 mg/L deemed undesirable. DO levels can be depressed by the presence of BOD and other organics that consume DO. Water quality simulations in conjunction with management of effluent treatment can suggest mitigation measures for reducing the adverse environmental impact. For this purpose, an in-house two-dimensional water quality simulation model codenamed TUNA-WQ will be used for these simulations. TUNA-WQ has been undergoing regular updates and improvements to broaden the applicability and to improve the robustness. Here, the model is calibrated and verified for simulation of DO and BOD dynamics in Setiu River (Sg Setiu). TUNA-WQ simulated DO and BOD in Setiu River due to the discharge from a marine shrimp aquaculture farm will be presented.

J	Rytwo, G				Rytwo, Giora			Hybrid Clay-Polymer Nanocomposites for the Clarification of Water and Effluents	RECENT PATENTS ON NANOTECHNOLOGY												Background: Freshwater resources will not be able to meet all requirements and water should not be considered a self-renewable, low cost resource. Thus, the needs for increased amount of water imply adopting several approaches that include intercepting and transferring water, desalination and water re-use. In all three approaches removal of turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) is a crucial step, as one of the essential parameters limiting water quality. This paper reviews a series of patents focusing on the use of clay-polymer nanocomposites to obtain very fast and efficient turbidity and suspended solids removal in water and effluents. Method: The rational beyond the use of nanoparticles based on an anchoring denser core (for example a clay mineral) to which chains of a polyelectrolyte with charge that opposes the colloidal charges, is that it induces fast formation of neutralized flocs, that are denser than organic colloids. In such a way all three colloidal stability factors (size, charge and density) are addressed achieving very fast clarification. Results: This paper summarizes several applications and examples of the procedure: removal of algae or microbes in surface water, clarification of saline effluents or sea water before desalination, and almost complete removal of turbidity and suspended solids in several industrial very turbid effluents. In all cases, clarification is obtained in seconds by the formation of 20-500 mu m flocs, and their further separation by sedimentation or filtration, within a very wide pH range (3-11). Conclusion: Clay polymer nanocomposites can offer very effective clarification yielding reduction of more than 90% of the turbidity and the suspended solids in water or effluents, including in some cases deactivation of microorganisms that could offer an environmentally oriented alternative to chlorination. The good performance observed is presumably due to the broad versatility that stems from the use of different polymers and clays, and even different clay-polymer ratios yielding a wide range of charges.

Various studies demonstrate that the implementation of green roof technology can moderate environmental problems, through the reduction of heat flux and solar reflectivity, the minimisation of buildings' energy consumption, the air pollution removal, the storm water runoff reduction, the air cooling and the effective management of the urban heat island effect. In this framework, the aim of this study is to assess the green roof potential and the quantification of its benefits over Thessaloniki, Greece's second largest city. In order to do so, very high spatial resolution satellite image and natural colour orthoimagery were used along with a geographical object-based image analysis approach. Carbon sequestration potential, rainwater retention and energy conservation were estimated based on coefficients adopted after a comprehensive literature review and actual dynamic energy simulations.
