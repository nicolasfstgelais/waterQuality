J	Lin, HC; Huang, YH; Fujimoto, N				Lin, Han Chien; Huang, Yu-Hun; Fujimoto, Noboru			Influence of Time Variation of CCA and ACQ in Water on Fish Using Charcoal Adsorbability	JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY												The effect of charcoal adsorbability on the contents of heavy metal ions, including Cr, As, and Cu, in water, as well as the fish liver, gill and scales after the time variation of wood preservatives CCA and ACQ in water were evaluated. The time dependent pH value of charcoals in water with different preservatives was 7.97-8.59. Bamboo charcoal had better adsorption for the Cu content, but for the Cr and As contents it had poor adsorbability. Bamboo activated carbon had preferable adsorption for both Cr and Cu contents, yet it had insignificant adsorbability for the As content. The Cr ion content in the fish scales was with a decreased tendency and the Cu ion content in the fish liver was decreased due to the charcoal adsorbability. However, the Cr ion content in the fish liver and gills was no significant difference before and after a period of time. For the As ion content in fish liver, gills, and scales, there were no obvious change. According to the water quality result, the Cu ion content was decreased slightly, but the As ion content was increased slightly and higher than Cr ion content. In the scope of this study, the charcoal adsorbability can prevent water environments from acidifying, and the Cr and Cu contents can be adsorbed, as well as the adsorbability of bamboo activated carbon was better than that of bamboo charcoal.																	0023-6152					FEB	2017	62	1					131	136										WOS:000400205800021

The main pollutants far exceed their threshold capacities, resulting in deterioration of the function and ecosystem of the river. Therefore, the estimation of the water environment capacity in this river is essential. There are many approaches to address this issue. However, due to a lack of input data and information, researchers are now facing many difficulties in finding a suitable tool for their analysis. This paper introduces a useful model in order to overcome this difficulty. The input data of the areas along the Cau River, such as hydrometeorology data and pollutant sources were collected for the year 2014. Subsequently, water quality component parameters, including total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), total suspended solid (TSS), carbon oxygen demand (COD), and biochemical oxygen demand over five days (BOD5) that corresponded to different confidence probabilities of surface water discharge, were then computed at some assessment points using the Streeter-Phelps model. Finally, the water environment capacity of this river was assessed by comparing the computed results with the standard values. The results show that most values of the water quality parameters (TP, TN, TSS, COD, and BOD5) in the sub basins of the Cau River (at assessment points No.1, 2, 3 and 4) far exceeded the standard values, which indicated that the water in the sub basins was heavily polluted and had low self cleaning capacities. This could be the contribution of pollutant loads from sub basins exceeded the standard values. The results serve as useful tools by which managers and authorities can set better goals for different hydrological periods, especially in areas dominated by pollutant sources. They also provide researchers with useful input data and information to help them deal with the environmental issues regarding the Cau River Basin.																	0023-6152					FEB	2017	62	1					163	169										WOS:000400205800025

Wastewater from SWF and DWF canals is used for pisciculture at the East Calcutta Wetland (ECW) for nearly a century. A wastewater fed pisciculture pond was selected to study the efficiency of the pond in treatment of wastewater. Monthly changes of hydraulic variables viz. inflow and outflow rates, depth, hydraulic loading rates, detention time of water at the pond were estimated. The monthly and seasonal changes of removal efficiency (RE) of TDS, TSS, alkalinity, hardness, phosphate, nitrate, BOD, COD, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn and Pb and dependence of the RE values upon hydraulic variables, physicochemical and biological factors were also explored. The hydraulic variables (water depth, inflow volumes, hydraulic loading rate and detention time) revealed a definite seasonal fluctuation pattern influenced primarily by rainfall. Efficient reduction of BOD, COD and the elements from the fishpond was recorded. Most of the factors showed higher mean seasonal removal efficiencies during monsoon and post-monsoon. The ameliorative efficiency of the wastewater-fed fish pond proved to be quite good when compared to natural and constructed wetlands. The average detention time of wastewater at the pond was calculated to be about 34 days and the period would be essential for the pond to ameliorate the pollutant load of the raw composite wastewater at the ECW.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				FEB	2017	16	2					361	371										WOS:000400161900011

From that moment, the Kolubara River flowed through the Pestan's riverbed (its right tributary), and the bank erosion became stronger, resulting in the lateral migration of the river course on one hand and land loss, land use changes, and economic consequences on the other hand. The economic effects caused by bank erosion were analysed both via the loss of land and the reduction in the volume of agricultural production. In the period 1967-2010, bank erosion caused a land loss of 67.3 ha, including 39.6 ha of arable land. The total value of the land loss by 2010 was 80,560 USD, and the total loss in agricultural production was 634,240 USD (1982=100). The second aim of this study was to investigate the costs and benefits of bank protection using the method of bank revetment construction at the moment bank erosion became more intense and during the latest phases. The results of this research suggest that any delay in the investment in Kolubara River bank protection could be adverse. If the bank revetment along the endangered river banks was built in 1967, all investments would have been recovered through income from agricultural production and selling the lost land by 2010. The results should provide information for river engineering, environmental planners and policy makers who must deal with decisions regarding planning and the protection of bank erosion.

However, studies of the planktonic community from the viewpoint of functional groups in freshwater ecosystems have been limited, particularly for rotifers. Because rotifers have various trophi types determining their feeding strategies, thereby representing an ecological niche, their functional feeding groups can act as biological and ecological indicators in lakes and reservoirs where planktonic communities are dominant. We analyzed the patterns of spatial distribution of the rotifer community in various reservoirs and then its relationship with water quality through redundancy and regression analyses. Compared with taxon-based composition, the response of trophi-based composition appears simplistic and showed clearer tendency in relation with water-quality variables. Each trophi responded differently by the degree of eutrophication indicating that each trophi group is possibly affected by environments such as the combinations of water-quality variables in different ways.																	1976-8354	2151-2485				FEB	2017	21	2					133	140		10.1080/19768354.2017.1292952								WOS:000399657000008						
J	Yu, WC; Kuo, SL; Fu, YC				Yu, Wu-Chou; Kuo, Shu-Lung; Fu, Yi-Ching			The application of multivariate statistical analysis to the analysis of characteristics and assessment methods of heavy Metal soil contamination in Taiwan	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												This research uses data from heavy metal soil monitoring collected in 23 countries and cities across Taiwan by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), Taiwan. Multivariate statistical analysis methods are applied to investigate the relationships among the variables of the eight major heavy metals, hoping to find the principal factors that affect soil contamination and the contamination tendency in Taiwan. The discussion of relationships among the eight heavy metals (i.e. chromium (Cr), Ni (nickel), Cu (copper), Zn (zinc), Hg (mercury), Cd (cadmium), As (arsenic), and Pb (lead)) can reflect the difference in the contaminations in, affected areas and contamination level assessment models. The results of the factor analysis show that the principal factors affecting the contamination mechanism of the eight heavy metals can be simplified into two : (1) Highly oxidizing pollutants comprised of Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn. The loading capacity order from high to low is Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn, which corresponds to several rules on the periodic table. (2) The semiconductor potential pollutant factor comprised of Cd, As, and Pb. The factors, either the transition metal Cd or the typical elements, As and Pb, all have something to do with the formation of a compound semiconductor. The major mechanism for semiconductor formation is the metallic bond. As for the cluster analysis, five clusters are first divided according to the contamination characteristics. Discriminant analysis is used to classify the type of a new sample with an accuracy as high as 96.87%. This means that the clustering for the cluster analysis is acceptable. The research findings can serve as reference material for relevant entities in the planning and application of soil remediation strategies.																	0019-4522					FEB	2017	94	2					221	228										WOS:000399627900013

Indicator macroinvertebrate species in a temporary Mediterranean river: Recognition of patterns in binary assemblage data with a Kohonen artificial neural network	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Current classifications used in bioassessment programs, as defined by the Water Framework Directive (WFD), do not sufficiently capture the variability present in temporary Mediterranean streams. This may result in inaccurate evaluation of the water quality biological metrics and difficulties in setting reference conditions. The aim of the study was to examine if aquatic invertebrate data of increased taxonomical resolution but expressed on a binary abundance (frequent/rare) scale and referring to good bioindicator species only suffice to indicate clear gradients in water courses with high natural variability such as intermittent Mediterranean streams. Invertebrate samples were collected from 74 sites in the Quarteira River basin, located in southern Portugal. Their classification with the use of a Kohonen artificial neural network (i.e., self-organising map, SOM) resulted in five categories. The variables that drove this categorization were primarily altitude, temperature and conductivity, but also type of substrate, riparian cover and percentage of riffles present. According to the indicator species analysis (ISA), almost all the studied taxa were significantly associated with certain SOM categories except for the category that included sites with disrupted flow regime. The SOM and ISA allowed us to effectively recognize biotic and abiotic patterns. Combined application of both methods may thus greatly enhance the effectiveness and precision of biological surveillance and establish reference sites for specific channel units in streams with high natural variability such as intermittent Mediterranean streams.

Modeling the impact of highland settlements on ecological disturbance of streams in Choke Mountain Catchment: Macroinvertebrate assemblages and water quality	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Human disturbances of waterways in Ethiopian highlands have increased throughout the last century due to population growth and increased land use. Despite this, there is a lack of knowledge on macroinvertebrate responses to human disturbances and the application of biological monitoring in tropical highland waterways in general. In this study, we have evaluated the human impact on the ecological integrity of the Chemoga River catchment in the Choke mountain watershed in the northwestern region of the Ethiopian Blue Nile highlands. During wet and dry seasons the water quality and macroinvertebrate assemblages were assessed. Multivariate statistics and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) were used to identify factors influencing macroinvertebrate community structures in highland streams in the northwest regions of Ethiopia. A total of 66 taxa of benthic macroinvertebrates were recorded, among which Diptera (38%) and Coleoptera (21%) were the most dominant. The results revealed a severe decrease in the ecological integrity of the Chemoga River in terms of macroinvertebrate composition at higher altitude. The ordination and cluster analysis clearly indicates extremely low macroinvertebrate diversity at sites where human impact is severe and a strong effect of altitude. These results highlight the need to protect the highland waterways of the Blue Nile area and that of similarly degraded watersheds in the Ethiopian highlands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

M.; Melo, Adriano S.; Moreira, Marcelo P.; Hamada, Neusa			Effects of urbanization on stream benthic invertebrate communities in Central Amazon	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Urbanization and its physical and chemical effects on aquatic environments influence invertebrate communities negatively. Yet, it is not clear how urbanization affects inter-annual variation of invertebrate assemblages in streams. We 1) evaluated urbanization effects on the ecological conditions (biotic and abiotic) of streams in Manaus and 2) analyzed invertebrate community variation over time (between 2003 and 2010). Data on abiotic variables and invertebrates from 2003 were obtained from a previous study. In 2010 we sampled abiotic variables and invertebrate communities in the same low-order urban streams sampled in 2003 (n = 40). We recorded high values of total nitrogen, total phosphorous, deforestation, total impervious area (TIA), water temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity in the most urbanized streams, as compared to the least-impacted ones. In contrast, the least-impacted streams had high dissolved oxygen concentrations. Water quality was poorer in 2010 than in 2003: oxygen concentration was lower and total nitrogen, total phosphorous, deforestation, and TIA significantly higher in 2010. We recorded higher inter-annual variation of abiotic variables in the most-impacted streams as compared to the least-impacted streams. EPT (%, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) and richness metrics decreased with urbanization. On the other hand, % OP (percent of Oligochaeta and Psychodidae) increased with urbanization. Observed and EPT richness and% OP increased between 2003 and 2010. On the other hand, rarefied richness decreased between years. Increases of observed and EPT richness between 2003 and 2010 were related to low inter-annual variability in streams conditions; however, differences of% OP and rarefied richness were not related to inter-annual variability in environmental conditions. The degree of urbanization did not explain the magnitude of the within-stream difference of invertebrate communities between 2003 and 2010. The increased effects of urbanization represented by the abiotic variables sampled and the reduction of invertebrate richness and increased dominance of tolerant taxa indicate that public policy is not enough to protect or mitigate human impacts on the urban water systems under study.

They are usually underpinned by an Ecosystem Health Index (EHI) that combines various individual indicators to produce an overall ecosystem health "score". As a result of public water quality concerns, an integrated means of monitoring and reporting on aquatic ecosystem health was needed for the Fitzroy Basin in central Queensland, Australia. The Fitzroy Partnership for River Health was formed to address this need, and developed an EHI and report card for the Basin using existing monitoring data collected from various third parties including regulated companies operations and government. At 142,000 square kilometres, the Fitzroy Basin is the largest catchment draining to the World Heritage Listed Great Barrier Reef. The Fitzroy Basin provides an example of how to deliver an effective aquatic ecosystem health reporting system in a large and complex river basin. We describe the methodology used to develop an adaptive EHI for the Fitzroy Basin that addresses variability, complexity and scale issues associated with reporting across large areas. As well, we report how to manage the design and reporting stages given limitations in data collection and scientific understanding. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, a system was developed to assess the structure and functioning of three important marine habitat types in the Estonian sea area: sandbanks (HD code 1110), mudflats (1140), and reefs (1170). The assessment system includes a list of ecological criteria and favourable reference values together with procedural rules and field sampling locations. The habitat types listed in the HD are broadly defined and may encompass different communities depending upon distinct environmental gradients. By considering these environmental gradients the habitat types reefs and sandbanks were zoned and the assessment criteria and corresponding favourable reference values were defined separately for each zone. A set of several metrics like benthos indices, community variables, presence of sensitive or typical species, proportions of functional or taxonomic groups were tested as potential criteria for determining habitat quality. The most appropriate criteria were selected for incorporation into the assessment system based on ecological eligibility, suitability to local conditions, occurrence rates of benthic species, responses to disturbances, statistical properties of distribution of measured values, and practical considerations. Extensive benthos database (records from the whole Estonian sea area, 1995-2014) was used to calculate values of criteria to support the selection of criteria and to derive reference values. In order to fully take into account their crucial role in maintaining the structure and functioning of habitats, the criteria on habitat-forming species were assigned higher hierarchical order in the assessment scheme compared to other criteria. Special field works were carried out to assess the status of the three habitat types in 2015. The quality of all three monitored habitats was assessed to be in a favourable status. Additionally, the distributions of the three habitat types were mapped. To date, this is the first study in the Baltic Sea region that formulates HD compliant explicit criteria, reference values, and assessment procedures for several marine habitat types. The main challenges of the study were to derive assessment criteria and favourable reference values that are ecologically relevant and practically feasible. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental characterization of a Mediterranean protected shallow brackish coastal aquatic system, Klisova Lagoon, Western Greece: a case study	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The Klisova lagoon aquatic system belongs to the wetland of Messolonghi - Aetoliko - Klisova Lagoon Complex, located in the western Greece and represents one of the most important Mediterranean lagoon systems, as it is protected by international conventions and is listed in the Natura 2000 European Network. Water physicochemical parameters such as pH, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients definition, TOC, TN and bacteriological indicators (E.coli and Enterococcus spp.) were analyzed in a time period of 1 year monthly monitoring in five sampling sites along the lagoon. The geographical distribution of these parameters show a clear zonation and partition of the lagoon as the result of: (a) the discharging of poorly treated wastes into the lagoon of Mesolonghi city waste water treatment plant and (b) the interplay between sea water influence via the lagoon inlet and the fresh water inflow via lagoon's perimeter channels. The lagoon is characterized by seasonal hypoxic conditions, which are responsible for several ecological socks in the past including fish mortalities. The system is threatened by human interference and sedimentological processes such as the longshore drifting and siltation of the lagoon inlet. Measurements should immediately be taken in order to prevent further downgrading of the water quality.																	1400-0350	1874-7841				FEB	2017	21	1					115	125		10.1007/s11852-016-0476-2								WOS:000399030200010

Hence it is important to develop an eco-friendly and cost effective technology to treat the dyes contaminated wastewater. In this research, laccase enzyme mediated biodegradation of toxic textile dyes such as congo red and gentian violet was investigated using novel, newly isolated laccase producing Pseudomonas stutzeri MN1 and Acinetobacter baumannii MN3. Response surface methodology (RSM) with full factorial central composite design (CCD) was applied to optimize pH (pH 6.0-10.0), starch (1-3%) and yeast extract (0.1-0.3%). The RSM results show that a maximum of 29.41 U/mL and 41.76 U/mL laccase activity was achieved by MN1 and MN3, respectively under optimum conditions (pH 8.0, 2% starch and 0.2% yeast extract). The congo red decolorization studies by MN1, MN3 and mixed consortia (MN1 + MN3) showed 84%, 89% and 97% decolourization efficiency, respectively. The gentian violet was decolorized up to 83%, 90% and 95% by MN1, MN3 and mixed consortia (MN1 + MN3), respectively. Phytotoxicity assay showed100% germination of Vigna radiata in presence of decolorized synthetic congo red and gentian violet. Crude extract of laccase decolorized congo red and gentian violet up to 70% and 84% respectively within 24 h.

Results showed that clays are more efficient in removing fluoride followed by polymers and then plant materials. Langmuir adsorption isotherm best explained the adsorption mechanism with higher correlation coefficient (R-2) values in all the cases. Maximum removal of fluoride, 88.543mg/g, was attained in case of clays (GC). Kinetics study favored the pseudo second order kinetics.

Elemental properties, hydrology, and biology interact to shape concentration-discharge curves for carbon, nutrients, sediment, and major ions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												To investigate the prevalence and cause of concentration-discharge (C-Q) relationships for carbon, nutrients, major ions, and particulates, we analyzed 40 years of water quality data from 293 monitoring stations in France. Catchments drained diverse landscapes and ranged from 50 to 110,000 km2, together covering nearly half of France. To test for differences during low and high flows, we calculated independent C-Q slopes above and below the median discharge. We found that 84% of all catchment-element combinations were chemodynamic for at least half of the hydrograph and 60% of combinations showed nonlinear C-Q curves. Only two or three of the nine possible C-Q modalities were manifest for each parameter, and these modalities were stable through time, suggesting that intrinsic and extrinsic elemental properties (e. g., solubility, reactivity, and source dynamics) set basic C-Q templates for each parameter, which are secondarily influenced by biological activity during low flows, and the interaction between hydrology and catchment characteristics at high flows. Several patterns challenged current C-Q views, including low-flow chemostasis for TSS in 66% of catchments, low-flow biological mediation of NO23 in 71% of catchments, and positive C-Q for dissolved organic carbon independent of catchment size in 80% of catchments. Efforts to reduce nutrient loading decreased phosphorus concentration and altered C-Q curves, but NO23 continued to increase.

Water quality data for national-scale aquatic research: The Water Quality Portal	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Aquatic systems are critical to food, security, and society. But, water data are collected by hundreds of research groups and organizations, many of which use nonstandard or inconsistent data descriptions and dissemination, and disparities across different types of water observation systems represent a major challenge for freshwater research. To address this issue, the Water Quality Portal (WQP) was developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Water Quality Monitoring Council to be a single point of access for water quality data dating back more than a century. The WQP is the largest standardized water quality data set available at the time of this writing, with more than 290 million records from more than 2.7 million sites in groundwater, inland, and coastal waters. The number of data contributors, data consumers, and third-party application developers making use of the WQP is growing rapidly. Here we introduce the WQP, including an overview of data, the standardized data model, and data access and services; and we describe challenges and opportunities associated with using WQP data. We also demonstrate through an example the value of the WQP data by characterizing seasonal variation in lake water clarity for regions of the continental U.S. The code used to access, download, analyze, and display these WQP data as shown in the figures is included as supporting information. Plain Language Summary The Water Quality Portal (http://www.waterqualitydata.us/) makes available more than 297,000,000 water quality records from all 50 states. Users can search for records at, upstream or downstream of their favorite river or lake location. Water quality Big Data is accompanied with opportunities and challenges for computing, data analysis, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

Data are obtained by monthly sampling of water contaminants, in order to monitor discharges from the land to the sea. We are interested in the multivariate time series of ammonia, nitrate, and phosphorus. The time series may present issues that make their analysis complex: non-linearity, non-normality, weak dependency, seasonality, and missing values. The goals of this work are the classification of the observations into a small set of homogeneous groups representing ordered categories of pollution, the detection of change-points, and the modeling of data heterogeneity. These aims are pursued by developing a novel spatio-temporal hidden Markov model, whose hierarchical structure was motivated by the data set to study: the observations are displayed on a cylindrical lattice and driven by an anisotropic and inhomogeneous hidden Markov random field. As a result, four hidden states were selected, showing that catchments could be grouped spatially, with a strong relationship with the dominating land use. This method represents a useful tool for water managers to have a nationwide picture in combination of temporal dynamics.

Scott			Comparison of Risk Predicted by Multiple Norovirus Dose-Response Models and Implications for Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment	RISK ANALYSIS												The application of quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs) to understand and mitigate risks associated with norovirus is increasingly common as there is a high frequency of outbreaks worldwide. A key component ofQMRAis the dose-response analysis, which is the mathematical characterization of the association between dose and outcome. For Norovirus, multiple dose-response models are available that assume either a disaggregated or an aggregated intake dose. This work reviewed the dose-response models currently used in QMRA, and compared predicted risks from waterborne exposures (recreational and drinking) using all available dose-response models. The results found that the majority of published QMRAs of norovirus use the F-1(1) hypergeometric dose-response model with alpha = 0.04, beta = 0.055. This dose-response model predicted relatively high risk estimates compared to other dose-response models for doses in the range of 1-1,000 genomic equivalent copies. The difference in predicted risk among dose-response models was largest for small doses, which has implications for drinking water QMRAs where the concentration of norovirus is low. Based on the review, a set of best practices was proposed to encourage the careful consideration and reporting of important assumptions in the selection and use of dose-response models in QMRA of norovirus. Finally, in the absence of one best norovirus dose-response model, multiple models should be used to provide a range of predicted outcomes for probability of infection.																	0272-4332	1539-6924				FEB	2017	37	2					245	264		10.1111/risa.12616								WOS:000397776100008	27285380

Assessing the spatial pattern of a river water quality in southern Brazil by multivariate analysis of biological and chemical indicators	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												This study assessed the genotoxicity and chemical quality of the Rio dos Sinos, southern Brazil. During two years, bimonthly, cuttings of Tradescantia pallida var. purpurea with flower buds were exposed to river water samples from Caraa, Santo Antonio da Patrulha, Taquara and Campo Bom, which are municipalities located in the upper, middle and lower stretches of the Rio dos Sinos basin. Simultaneously, chemical parameters were analyzed, rainfall data were surveyed and negative (distilled water) and positive (0.1% formaldehyde) controls were made. Micronuclei (MCN) frequencies were determined in tetrads of pollen grain mother cells. From the upper stretch toward the lower, there was an increase in the frequency of MCN and in concentrations of chemical parameters. Cadmium, lead, copper, total chromium and zinc were present at the four sites and a concentration gradient was not demonstrated along the river. The multivariate analysis revealed that two principal components exist, which accounted for 62.3% of the observed variances. Although genotoxicity was observed in Santo Antonio da Patrulha, the water presented higher mean values for most of the assessed parameters, in the lower stretch, where urbanization and industrialization are greater. The spatial and temporal pattern of water quality observed reinforces the importance of considering the environmental factors and their effects on organisms in an integrated way in watercourse monitoring programs.

The MPH algorithm produced a slight underestimation of CHL in the pixels classified as cyanobacteria (83% of the total) and a strong overestimation in those classified as eukaryotic phytoplankton (17%). In situ biomass data showed that the binary classification of MPH was not appropriate for mixed phytoplankton populations, producing also unrealistic discontinuities in the CHL maps. We recalibrated MPH using our matchup data set and found that a single calibration curve of third degree fitted equally well to all matchups regardless of how they were classified. As a modification to the former approach, we incorporated the Phycocyanin Index (PCI) in the formula, thus taking into account the gradient of phytoplankton composition, which reduced the CHL retrieval errors. By using in situ biomass data, we also proved that PCI was indeed an indicator of cyanobacterial dominance. We applied our recalibration of the MPH algorithm to the whole MERIS data set (2002-2012). Results highlight the usefulness of the MPH algorithm as a tool to monitor eutrophication. The relevance of this fact is higher since MPH does not require a complete atmospheric correction, which often fails over such waters. An adequate flagging or correction of sun glint is advisable though, since the MPH algorithm was sensitive to sun glint.

Evidence from Kisii, Kenya	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Information about the quality of rural drinking water sources can be used to manage their safety and mitigate risks to health. Sanitary surveys, which are observational checklists to assess hazards present at water sources, are simpler to conduct than microbial tests. We assessed whether sanitary survey results were associated with measured indicator bacteria levels in rural drinking water sources in Kisii Central, Kenya. Overall, thermotolerant coliform (TTC) levels were high: all of the samples from the 20 tested dug wells, almost all (95%) of the samples from the 25 tested springs, and 61% of the samples from the 16 tested rainwater harvesting systems were contaminated with TTC. There were no significant associations between TTC levels and overall sanitary survey scores or their individual components. Contamination by TTC was associated with source type (dug wells and springs were more contaminated than rainwater systems). While sanitary surveys cannot be substituted for microbial water quality results in this context, they could be used to identify potential hazards and contribute to a comprehensive risk management approach.

Samples of waters were taken from eight wells located in depth groundwater bodies, code R0Ji05 and ROJi08 in order to determine the mineral and nutrient contents. All the indicators monitored were taken into account for assessing the mineralization degree ofgroundwater. The values of monitored indicators of groundwater were within the allowed limits for drinking water according to Law 458/2002 amended by Law na 311/2004 regarding the drinking water quality with the exception of sulfur content. The values of nutrient content exceeded the allowed limits for sulphates, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium.																	0034-7752					FEB	2017	68	2					221	225										WOS:000397043100005

The agricultural importance and the high productivity of this region are provided by the aggressive use of chemical fertilizers. For this reason, we have decided to conduct this study considering that all water bodies - superficial waters and groundwaters - record significant amounts of NO3-,NO2-, NH4- heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn and Hg) and other major chemical elements. The.2 campaign of collecting the 30 water samples took place in the month of May 2016. The chemical analyses were conducted in the Lacip ain-Mlila laboratory in Algeria. Findings show a contamination of groundwater by nitrates and lead; values exceed the maximum limits approved by World Health Organization (WHO). TDS were also found in high concentrations, which limit the use of water for some agricultural cultures, but which can be admissible for certain salinity -resistant species.																	0034-7752					FEB	2017	68	2					420	423										WOS:000397043100049

Macrophyte communities are good bioindicators, thus they can be used to assess the effectiveness of restoration. The aim of the study was to determine the dynamics and patternof macrophyte recovery as a result of the restoration measures in a degraded shallow urban lake characterized by strong cyanobacterial blooms. Annual changes in the composition and areal coverage of littoral macrophyte phytocoenoses, and in the Ecological State Macrophyte Indexwere recorded using a GPS and the ArcGIS programme and analysed in relation to changes in water quality for three years following restoration measures (phosphorus inactivation, aeration, and biomanipulation). The shifts were statistically significant in the first two for total nitrogenconcentrationand three years for chlorophyll aconcentration, whereas total phosphorus concentration only decreased significantly in the third year. Changes in water transparency were not significant. The ecological status of the lakewas good or moderate. A characteristic pattern of recovery was observed. Phytocenotic richness increased (from 9 to 12 communities) and total phytolittoral area decreased (from 42 to 37 ha, i.e. 12%) during restoration efforts. The area of hypereutrophic plant communities (Ceratophyl-letumdemersi, Hydrocharitetummorsus-ranae, Typhetumangustifoliae) decreased, the former submerged community returned (Potametumlucends) and the area of some existing communities (e.g. nympheids) increased. Slow return of elodeidswas caused by low transparency andlack of submerged vegetation propagules, which are the most probable limiting factors of the recolonization process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effluents of the Montpellier wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) represented the main nutrient input. To improve the water quality of these lagoons, this WWTP was renovated and upgraded and, since the end of 2005, its effluents have been discharged 11km offshore into the Mediterranean (total investment Euro150M). Possibilities of ecosystem restoration as part of a conservation programme were explored by a focus group of experts. Their tasks were: (i) to evaluate the impact of the reduction of the nutrient input; (ii) if necessary, to design additional measures for an active restoration programme; and (iii) to predict ecosystem trajectories for the different cases. Extension of Magnoliophyta meadows can be taken as a proxy for ecosystem restoration as they favour the increase of several fish (seahorse) and bird (ducks, swans, herons) species, albeit they represent a trade-off for greater flamingos. Additional measures for active ecosystem restoration were only recommended for the most impaired lagoon Mejean, while the least impaired lagoon Ingril is already on a trajectory of spontaneous recovery. A multiple contingent valuation considering four different management options for the Mejean lagoon was used in a pilot study based on face-to-face interviews with 159 respondents. Three levels of ecosystem restoration were expressed in terms of recovery of Magnoliophyta meadows, including their impact on emblematic fish and avifauna. These were combined with different options for access (status quo, increasing access, increasing access with measures to reduce disturbance). The results show a willingness of local populations to pay per year about Euro25 for the highest level of ecological restoration, while they were only willing to allocate about Euro5 for additional footpaths and hides.

The Relationship Between Iron Oxides/Oxyhydroxides and Toxic Metal Ions in Drinking Water Distribution Systems A Review	CORROSION												Iron (Fe) oxides/oxyhydroxides in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS), produced by electrochemical, chemical, and biological reactions, can adsorb toxic metal ions, including strontium, lead, arsenic, and vanadium that, if desorbed, generate pulses of drinking water with elevated toxic metal ion concentrations. To illustrate that potential, sorption data for strontium ( cation) and vanadium (oxyanion) in functioning DWDS are reviewed. In addition, the influence of flow/no flow on adsorption and desorption of strontium in a model DWDS is included. The reactions that influence adsorption and desorption within a DWDS are extremely complicated and poorly understood. The sorption capacity of Fe oxhydroxides varies with surface area, which in turn varies with source water and disinfectant. Desorption and release can be triggered by changes in source water, disinfection chemicals, or flow. Because of the interrelatedness of adsorption/desorption and Fe corrosion products, subtle changes in DWDS operating procedures can trigger major changes in water quality.																	0010-9312	1938-159X				FEB	2017	73	2					138	143		10.5006/2162								WOS:000394444800003

The present study provides a deeper understanding of the impact of seasonal change on the co-occurrence of As and F-, as both contaminants vary with climatic patterns. Groundwater samples were collected in pre- and post-monsoon seasons (n = 40 in each season) from the Brahmaputra flood plains (BFP) in northeast India to study the effect of season on As and F- levels. Weathering is a key hydrogeochemical process in the BFP and both silicate and carbonate weathering are enhanced in the post-monsoon season. The increase in carbonate weathering is linked to an elevation in pH during the post-monsoon season. A Piper diagram revealed that bicarbonate-type water, with Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ cations, is common in both seasons. Correlation between Cl- and NO3- (r = 0.74, p = 0.01) in the post-monsoon indicates mobilization of anthropogenic deposits during the rainy season. As was within the 10 mu g L-1 WHO limit for drinking water and F- was under the 1.5 mu g L-1 limit. A negative correlation between oxidation reduction potential and groundwater As in both seasons (r = -0.26 and -0.49, respectively, for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon, p = 0.05) indicates enhanced As levels due to prevailing reducing conditions. Reductive hydrolysis of Fe (hydr) oxides appears to be the predominant process of As release, consistent with a positive correlation between As and Fe in both seasons (r = 0.75 and 0.73 for pre- and post-monsoon seasons, respectively, at p = 0.01). Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis revealed grouping of Fe and As in both seasons. F- and sulfate were also clustered during the pre-monsoon season, which could be due to their similar interactions with Fe (hydr) oxides. Higher As levels in the post-monsoon appears driven by the influx of water into the aquifer, which drives out oxygen and creates a more reducing condition suitable for reductive dissolution of Fe (hydr) oxides. An increase in pH promotes desorption of As oxyanions AsO43- (arsenate) and AsO33- (arsenite) from Fe (hydr) oxide surfaces. Fluoride appears mainly released from F--bearing minerals, but Fe (hydr) oxides can be a secondary source of F-, as suggested by the positive correlation between As and F- in the pre-monsoon season.

Hydrogeochemical studies were carried out in this area with the objective of identifying the geochemical processes influencing water quality and suitability of surface and groundwater for agricultural and domestic uses. Sixty-one groundwater and four surface water samples were collected from boreholes, dams and rivers and analysed for Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-, Fe-tot, PO43-, Mn-tot, NH4+, NO3-, NO2-. In addition, pH, total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, total hardness, turbidity, colour, salinity and dissolved oxygen were analysed. Chloro-alkaline indices 1 and 2, and characterization of weathering processes suggest that the chemistry of groundwater is dominated by the interaction between water and rocks. Cation exchange and silicate weathering are the dominant processes controlling the chemical composition of the groundwater in the area studied. Mineral saturation indices indicate the presence of at least three groups of groundwater in the Vea catchment with respect to residence time. The meteoric genesis index suggests that 86% of the water samples belong to the shallow meteoric water percolation type. The findings further suggest that the groundwater and surface water in the basin studied are mainly Ca-Mg-HCO3 water type, regardless of the geology. Compared to the water quality guidelines of WHO, the study results on sodium absorption ratio, sodium percentage, magnesium hazard, permeability index and residual sodium carbonate indicate that groundwater and surface water in the Vea catchment are generally suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes.

The temporal trends from 1993 to 2012 in the concentrations of NO3-N and Cl from more than 3900 wells were estimated using the Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope analysis and compared with the land use change trend for the period 1995-2009. The results indicate that the upward trends in NO3-N were associated with the expansion of agricultural lands, whereas Cl trends were considered to be affected by other factors in addition to the land use changes. In the mid-mountainous region, the deterioration in the groundwater quality by the both NO3-N and Cl was expected due to the continuous expansion of agricultural lands. In the lowland area, the NO3-N and Cl components showed different trends depending on the regions. In the eastern area, increasing trends in NO3-N were observed due to the development of new agricultural areas, while the Cl concentration was observed to decrease as a result of the regulation on groundwater extraction to reduce seawater intrusion. Our study highlights that a comprehensive interpretation of trends in NO3-N and Cl and land use changes for long-term periods can provide useful insights to prepare for suitable groundwater management plans in the whole island perspective.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	4							176	10.1007/s12665-017-6466-3								WOS:000394965100038

Distribution of rare earth elements, thorium and uranium in streams and aquatic mosses of Central Portugal	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The distribution of 14 rare earth elements, Th and U was studied in streams of the study area at 21 sites. Aquatic mosses are known to accumulate even metabolically nonessential or toxic metals in concentrations much higher than their aqueous environment due to their unique morphology and physiology. Thus, the capacity of metal amplification in four aquatic mosses (Fontinalis squamosa, Brachythecium rivulare, Platyhypnidium riparioides and Thamnobryum alopecurum) was also evaluated as a potential bioindicator/biomonitoring tool. Thirteen REEs (0.001-2.81 mu g L-1) and U were detected in the stream water. Mean content of lighter rare earth elements (LREEs) was higher than that of heavier rare earth elements (HREEs). Fourteen REEs and two actinides were detected in moss samples, including Yb and Th which were below detection level in water samples. LREE uptake (0.17-12.2 mg kg(-1)) was greater than HREE uptake (0.02-0.78 mg kg(-1)) in all mosses. Uptake of LREEs was observed in the order: B. rivulare > T. alopecurum > F. squamosa > P. riparioides and that of HREEs in the order: T. alopecurum > B. rivulare > F. squamosa > P. riparioides. Mean U content (0.68-1.62 mg kg(-1)) in the mosses was found in the order: B. rivulare > F. squamosa > T. alopecurum > P. riparioides. Th content ranged from 0.4 to 2.36 mg kg(-1) in the order: B. rivulare > T. alopecurum > P. riparioides > F. squamosa. One-way ANOVA indicated a statistically significant difference (P <= 0.01) in mean concentrations of all elements (individually) in moss samples except for U. Highest bioconcentration factors of six REEs each were observed in B. rivulare (La, Ce, Sm, Eu, Tb and Dy) and T. alopecurum (Nd, Gd, Ho, Er, Tm and Lu).

Germany does not face a significant water shortage problem, but it has three main challenges: protection of water quality, ensuring public water supply and public wastewater disposal, and protecting the public and infrastructure from floods. Capacity development is a key issue to overcome the challenges of water resources in any country including Germany. Engineers, technicians, and mechanics need to upgrade their knowledge on a regular basis to deal with the complex management and rapid technological developments. In order to create efficient training schemes, the Vocational Training Working Group of Global Water Partnership (GWP), part of the GWP Capacity Development Task Force, has worked on the definition of fundamental job profiles for the Water and Sanitation Sector (WASS). To cover all technical functions of the industrial water cycle, it was necessary to identify around thirty occupations. Then, a competence-based training approach was adopted. Additionally, an assessment approach was also developed based on comparing the level of competence of the workers to a standard level of competence for each job. The RWTH Aachen University with its partners have developed another game based approach (SeCom2.0) based on serious gaming technology to enable water professionals dealing with flood risk management to be trained on different flood situations in a virtual environment. SeCom2.0 has three main components that are connected by a database layer. In addition to the serious games component, there is a collaboration component and a learning management system. For nearly 100 members from the flood competence centre (HochwasserKompetenzCentrum) in Cologne, Germany gave input to simulate the real flooding scenarios, and the learners will have to deal with a flood scenario by protecting the city in a given time and using a given resources and tools. This work concluded that both competence-based and game-based approaches could be significantly improved by blending both approaches. This will improve the process of training; for example, the competence-based approach can be enriched by using game- based simulation by introducing the trainees to a simulation of different technologies in water utilities. This can save resources and money and enrich the training. More importantly is modifying the game-based approach using the approach of competence-based to focus on specific competencies and to make use of the competence standards in its assessment component. The first section of this introduces and categorizes water challenges in Germany. In the second and third section, the two approaches are introduced in details. The competence-based approach is introduced to the WASS while the games-based to the flood risk management. Finally, a conclusion and recommendations are illustrated.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	3							131	10.1007/s12665-017-6416-0								WOS:000394967300011

Four distinct DOM components were identified: two main components regarding terrestrial humic-like materials (C1 and C2), one about terrestrial fulvic/humic-like materials (C3), and one related to autochthonous tryptophanlike materials (C4). The dominance of terrestrial fluorescence materials in DOM indicated that terrestrial inputs have critical effects on the surveyed lakes. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Corresponding Analysis (CCA) were applied to analyze DOM components and their relationship with the environmental variables. PCA graphs showed that there were spatial differences in DOM fluorophores among lakes with various environments. Components C1, C2, and C4 were correlated positively with PC1 axis (factor 1), while C3 was opposite. Component C1 and C3 showed positive correlations with PC2 axis (factor 2). The CCA and Pearson correlation analysis showed that sediment DOC was correlated significantly with sediment variables (TN, OM, and conductivity), water quality variables (TN, PO43-, and Chl a), and DOM components C1 and C3. All DOM components were related significantly to different environment variables, including water quality variables especially nutrient elements (NO3-, TN, Chl a, and DOC) and sediment variables (OM, NH4+, and HCl-P). The relationship between DOC and the lake comprehensive nutritive index TLI was marginally significant.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				FEB	2017	76	4							142	10.1007/s12665-017-6427-x								WOS:000394965100004						
J	Peng, RC; Yu, P; Luo, YB				Peng, Ruichao; Yu, Ping; Luo, Yunbai			Coke Plant Wastewater Posttreatment by Fenton and Electro-Fenton Processes	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												After conventional biological treatment processes, effluents of the coking industry contain high concentration of nonbiodegradable and refractory organic matters, which should be treated to satisfy the discharge water quality standards (chemical oxygen demand [COD] < 150 mg/L, NH3-N< 25 mg/L). In this study, post-treatment of coke plant wastewater was treated by the direct Fenton and anodic electro-Fenton (EF-Feox) methods. COD and total organic carbon (TOC) values were selected as the target parameters. COD and TOC removal efficiency was investigated through changing some operating parameters such as initial pH, initial H2O2 concentration, and current density. Under the optimum operating conditions of each progress, COD and TOC were removed more efficiently in the EF-Feox system (90% and 84.4%) compared with that in the Fenton method (61.96% and 48.12%). Influence of H2O2 feeding on removal efficiency was also investigated in this study. Results indicated that gradual addition of H2O2 instead of initial addition was a simple and convenient means of removing COD and TOC effectively. Furthermore, settling characteristics of waste sludge under different operating conditions was studied. In general, the EF-Feox process can be a promising and reasonable method in the post-treatment of coking wastewater.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				FEB	2017	34	2					89	95		10.1089/ees.2015.0520								WOS:000394186600004

Monetized as cost, attributable disease burden estimates can be useful for environmental management decisions. OBJECTIVES: We characterize the disease burden attributable to water recreation using data from two cohort studies using a cost of illness (COI) approach and estimate the largest drivers of the disease burden of water recreation. METHODS: Data from the NEEAR study, which evaluated swimming and wading in marine and freshwater beaches in six U. S. states, and CHEERS, which evaluated illness after incidental- contact recreation (boating, canoeing, fishing, kayaking, and rowing) on waterways in the Chicago area, were used to estimate the cost per case of gastrointestinal illness and costs attributable to water recreation. Data on health care and medication utilization and missed days of work or leisure were collected and combined with cost data to construct measures of COI. RESULTS: Depending on different assumptions, the cost of gastrointestinal symptoms attributable to water recreation are estimated to be $1,220 for incidental-contact recreation (range $338-$ 1,681) and $ 1,676 for swimming/wading (range $ 425-2,743) per 1,000 recreators. Lost productivity is a major driver of the estimated COI, accounting for up to 90% of total costs. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates suggest gastrointestinal illness attributed to surface water recreation at urban waterways, lakes, and coastal marine beaches is responsible for costs that should be accounted for when considering the monetary impact of efforts to improve water quality. The COI provides more information than the frequency of illness, as it takes into account disease incidence, health care utilization, and lost productivity. Use of monetized disease severity information should be included in future studies of water quality and health.

Modernizing Water Quality Criteria in the United States: A Need to Expand the Definition of Acceptable Data	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The development of water quality criteria (WQC) for the protection of aquatic life is a fundamental component of the Clean Water Actthe primary US legislation responsible for protecting aquatic ecosystems from pollution. Water quality criteria define acceptable levels of contamination in the environment and thus play an important role in society. Rules for how science is used to develop WQC were created in 1985. Most rely on only data and knowledge obtained through a single methodology, the single-species laboratory toxicity test. Since 1985, understanding of the fate and effects of environmental contaminants has advanced markedly from multiple perspectives and disciplines. However, many of these advances are routinely discarded in WQC development because they do not adhere to data limits imposed by the 1985 guidelines. The present Focus article outlines how multiple lines of inquiry have played important roles in improving understanding of the ecological implications of environmental contaminants. The authors focus on gains in understanding that would not have been possible through traditional toxicity bioassays alone and argue that more robust scientific understanding can be used to modernize WQC development. In particular, the present article highlights ways to increase the relevance of toxicity testing (at different spatiotemporal scales) and incorporate all relevant lines of evidence into WQC modernization.

The authors examined the toxicity of recently deposited sediments on juveniles of the freshwater mussel Epioblasma brevidens by collecting time-integrated sediment samples from the water column with sediment traps from 11 sites in the Clinch River basin, including 6 sites within an 88-km reach deemed a mussel zone of decline. Mussels were exposed to the riverine sediments and to 3 control sediments for 28 d; survival, shell length, and biomass were then assessed. Sediment treatment (i.e., river location) had a significant effect on mussel survival (p<0.01) and biomass (p=0.02) but did not affect length (p=0.37), and sediments from 2 of the tributaries were the most toxic. Inorganic and organic analyses of sediments indicated the presence of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at all sites. Manganese was negatively correlated with mussel survival and biomass, as was ammonia with survival and total organic carbon with biomass. Current land uses in the watershed indicate that fossil fuel mining and agriculture may be associated with elevated manganese and ammonia, respectively. The authors found that sediments collected with sediment traps over relatively short deployment durations can help elucidate recent contaminant influx and its potential for inducing toxicity in benthic organisms.

Diagnosis of potential stressors adversely affecting benthic invertebrate communities in Greenwich Bay, Rhode Island, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Greenwich Bay is an urbanized embayment of Narragansett Bay potentially impacted by multiple stressors. The present study identified the important stressors affecting Greenwich Bay benthic fauna. First, existing data and information were used to confirm that the waterbody was impaired. Second, the presence of source, stressor, and effect were established. Then linkages between source, stressor, and effect were developed. This allows identification of probable stressors adversely affecting the waterbody. Three pollutant categories were assessed: chemicals, nutrients, and suspended sediments. This weight of evidence approach indicated that Greenwich Bay was primarily impacted by eutrophication-related stressors. The sediments of Greenwich Bay were carbon enriched and low dissolved oxygen concentrations were commonly seen, especially in the western portions of Greenwich Bay. The benthic community was depauperate, as would be expected under oxygen stress. Although our analysis indicated that contaminant loads in Greenwich Bay were at concentrations where adverse effects might be expected, no toxicity was observed, as a result of high levels of organic carbon in these sediments reducing contaminant bioavailability. Our analysis also indicated that suspended sediment impacts were likely nonexistent for much of the Bay. This analysis demonstrates that the diagnostic procedure was useful to organize and assess the potential stressors impacting the ecological well-being of Greenwich Bay. This diagnostic procedure is useful for management of waterbodies impacted by multiple stressors. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:449-462.

The FM-based diet (0FC) was replaced by substituting protein from FC for 100 (100FC), 200 (200FC), 300 (300FC), 400 (400FC), 500 (500FC) or 600 (600FC) g kg(-1) of the FM, and a commercial diet (CD) for carnivorous fish was included for comparison. The experiment was conducted indoors under completely randomized design (8 treatments x 3 replications x 60 fish per pond) over a 6-month trial. There were no significant differences in water quality during the experiment. The fish fed with 500FC had superior growth performance and feed utilization. This dietary treatment gave similar levels to all observed specific activities of digestive enzymes as did baseline 0FC. Survival, carcass composition, hematological parameters and liver histopathology were not negatively impacted by this protein replacement level. Economic analysis also supports the use of this by-product as a potent protein replacer in striped snakehead diet. Findings from the current study indicate that a 500 g kg(-1) protein replacement of FM by FC is near optimal for striped snakehead, and similar use of it in the aquafeed of other species appears worth further studies.																	0920-1742	1573-5168				FEB	2017	43	1					217	228		10.1007/s10695-016-0281-8								WOS:000394183300019	27589981					
J	Malaza, N				Malaza, Ntokozo			Hydrogeochemical assessment of groundwater quality in the Soutpansberg Basin around Tshikondeni, Limpopo Province, South Africa	GEOCHEMISTRY-EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS												The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of anthropogenic and natural sources of contamination on the groundwater quality of the unconfined aquifer system of the Soutpansberg Basin around Tshikondeni. Fifteen groundwater samples were collected and analysed for physical and chemical parameters. Groundwater samples were analysed for pH, EC, TDS, major cations (Na+, Ca+2 , K+, and Mg+2), major anions (Cl-, SO4-2, NO3-, CO3- and HCO3-). Groundwater in this area was found to be above the desirable Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) and World Health Organisation (WHO) limits for domestic and irrigation purposes. After the physicochemical analysis of ground water, samples shows that, the type of water that predominates in the study area is Na+- K+- Ca+2- Mg+2 type during the summer of the year 2008, based on hydro-chemical facies. Interpretation of hydro-geochemical data suggests that leaching of ions followed by weathering and anthropogenic impact (mainly mining and agricultural activities) control the chemistry of groundwater in the study area. Groundwater suitability for drinking purpose was also evaluated by the synthetic pollution index (SPI), it suggested that most of the samples fall in seriously polluted categories. The calculated values of SAR, Na%, RSC, PI, and MH have shown that except at few locations, most of groundwater samples are not suitable for agricultural and domestic purposes.																	1467-7873	2041-4943				FEB	2017	17	1					35	41		10.1144/geochem2016-433								WOS:000396751700003

This paper describes and discusses geotechnical testing in the design process from a consulting practitioner's perspective. This study focuses on the Packer testing planning, procedure, results & interpretation. Packer test system is an optimum method for obtaining values of hydraulic conductivity in wells that are difficult to analyse using conventional slug test systems. Packer tests are carried out to assess the variability of a borehole as it intersects various hydrogeological units. It gives vertical distribution of hydraulic properties and water quality in the aquifer and usually cheaper than a nest of wells and gives more continuous record and this knowledge can often be essential for a proper design. The role, objectives, types and interpretation of testing, limitations and recommended good practices as part of the geotechnical design process are outlined through the examination of test data from a case record.																	0960-3182	1573-1529				FEB	2017	35	1					29	44		10.1007/s10706-016-0112-9								WOS:000397242800002

Reoccupation and Site Selection in the Deserts of Post-Soviet Kazakhstan	HUMAN ECOLOGY												This study explores the drivers of site selection amongst livestock owners under conditions of increasing animal numbers following a low point in the 1990s. Our major goal was to understand whether livestock owners are acting as 'optimal foragers,' targeting areas of highest forage availability as they colonise previously empty areas. The results presented here suggest that they do not. Initially, distance from home settlement was the dominant determinant of site occupancy, with closer sites occupied earlier regardless of other characteristics. Some owners remained on depleted vegetation for longer than would be predicted under conditions of optimal foraging, indicating that distance-related costs constrained resource matching. In the latter period, increases in livestock wealth encouraged the occupation of distant sites exhibiting higher vegetation density and water quality, but some owners still occupied highly depleted sites. Improved transport and water supply infrastructure are needed if pastoralists are to optimise resource use across the landscape.

Forest roads, their construction and logging activities can have various effects on streams and the groundwater. These are presented and analysed in this literature review which encompasses the current research and publications as well as the legal framework. Generally, two aspects can be highlighted: on the one hand, the impacts of erosion and sediment loads on water quality, and on the other hand, the influence on the flow regime, the stream network and the water budget. Recent studies show that these effects can be minimised if Best Management-Practices are considered. In general, very few studies that analyse the impacts of forestry operations on karst areas and on the groundwater can be found.																	1439-1783					FEB	2017	61	1					6	26		10.5675/HyWa_2017.1_1								WOS:000395806500002

Statistical Framework to Assess Water Quality for Irrigation and Drainage Canals	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												The rapid pace of economic growth in Egypt has been accompanied by resource depletion and environmental degradation. Consequently, management action and regular assessment to meet the challenges are essential. The aim of this work is to introduce a statistical framework to assess water quality for irrigation and drainage canals in accordance to monitoring objectives that deal with pollutant concentrations and loads. The water quality/quantity data collected from 2000 to 2013 for the El-Salam Canal and the Hadus Drain in Egypt were used as case studies. A framework that includes a series of statistical tools was employed to facilitate better handling of the collected data and then transform it into fruitful information. These tools included descriptive statistics, frequency/percentile analysis and presenting pollutant loads through boxplot analysis. Finally, hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to classify the monitoring locations into a number of groups that have similar water quality conditions. The success in applying the proposed framework to the El-Salam Canal and Hadus Drain data showed its effectiveness and applicability to check compliance with water quality standards and allocate waste loads from different sources as well as classifying water quality status.

These measures include a broad variety of actions, including using different types of vegetation intended to solve individual or groups of problems, e.g. improving water quality, protecting the soil from water and wind erosion, and increasing biodiversity. The factors on which the decision concerning the location where the biotechnical measures will be applied would be made mainly depend on the vulnerability of the drainage system. Estimation of the suitability of localities for biotechnical measures would include identifying key factors and appropriately evaluating them, using GIS technology for spatial analysis, and an objective determination of the weight criteria based on entropy. As a result of the process described, optimal locations for the application of biotechnical measures were obtained, and findings show that utilization of these measures in Vojvodina has a significant and positive potential in water management, agriculture and forestry in both ecological and economic senses.

A formal Bayesian approach is adopted for the calibration and the uncertainty analysis of a commonly used wash-off model under (1) the unverified assumption of homoscedastic, independent, and normally distributed residuals; and (2) using a more correct heteroscedastic and autoregressive error model. The results obtained for each of these approaches are compared, and the uncertainty associated with water quality modeling is later propagated through a conceptual best management practices (BMP) model for various stormwater management scenarios so as to assess the effect of this uncertainty for BMP modeling and clarify the benefits of a robust description of error structure. This study indicates that the violation of the statistical assumptions about the residuals may result in unreliable estimation of model parameters and total predictive uncertainty. However, the effect of the uncertainty in the intraevent variability of concentrations in runoff is found to have only a limited effect on the outputs of the BMP model, regardless of the error model adopted for calibration.

Using a High-Capacity Chemically Activated Cow Bone to Remove Fluoride: Field-Scale Column Tests and Laboratory Regeneration Studies	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												In this study, a novel material, chemically activated cow bone (CAB), was further evaluated for fluoride removal via laboratory batch and field column studies using fluoride-impacted groundwaters in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Regeneration of the exhausted CAB was evaluated using 0.05 M NaOH and 0.01 M Ca(OH)(2) solutions. Water-quality parameters were analyzed to ensure that the CAB-treated water is safe for human consumption. The study indicated that the CAB produced in the laboratory and field showed fourfold improvement in fluoride removal capacity as compared to thermally activated cow bone (commonly known as bone char). The study also showed that more than 92% adsorption capacity of the exhausted CAB media can be regained using 0.05 M NaOH and 0.01 M Ca(OH)(2) solutions. The water-quality analysis conducted on the highly fluoride-impacted drinking waters treated using CAB media were found to be safe for public consumption. Therefore, these results further reinforce that CAB media can be used to provide access to safe drinking water for communities living in highly fluoride-impacted areas in developing countries and beyond.

It is shown that the processes of the COD and the NH3-N's concentration over time are quite consistent with the first-order kinetic equation and the degradation coefficients increase with the increase of the flow velocity. When the flow velocity varies from 0 m.s(-1) to 0.87 m.s(-1), the degradation coefficients of the COD and NH3-N increase from 0.011 d(-1) to 0.071 d(-1) and 0.038 d(1) to 0.258 d(-1), respectively. Moreover, the COD and NH3-N's degradation coefficients both have excellent correlation with the reaction time. There is a good linear relationship between the COD degradation coefficient and the flow velocity as well as a good power exponential function between the NH3-N degradation coefficient and the flow velocity. The comparative analysis of the Youth canal prototype monitoring and the calculation results shows that the quantitative formula obtained from the indoor water channel experiments gives results very close to the prototype observation results, which could reflect the degradation of pollutants in river water with varying flow velocity.																	1001-6058	1878-0342				FEB	2017	29	1					118	123		10.1016/S1001-6058(16)60723-0								WOS:000394480900012

Hydrological and environmental controls of the stream nitrate concentration and flux in a small agricultural watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Nitrate exports from diffuse sources constitute a major cause of eutrophication and episodic acidification in inland aquatic systems, and remedial action requires the identification of the influencing factors associated with these nitrate exports. This paper examines the combined effects of watershed complexity on nitrate concentration and flux in terms of the hydrological and environmental factors in heterogeneous nested subwatersheds in the Danjiangkou Reservoir Area (DRA), China. We established 15 sampling sites in the main stream and tributaries and conducted biweekly sampling in 2008-2012 to monitor the nitrate exports. The hydrological and environmental indices within the watershed were divided into sub watersheds and considered as potential influencing factors. In consideration of the high co-linearity of these influencing factors, we used partial least squares regression (PLSR) to determine the associations between the stream nitrate concentration or flux and 26 selected watershed characteristics. The number of components was unequal for the nitrate concentration and flux models. The optimal models explained 66.4%, 60.0% and 59.9% of the variability in nitrate concentration and 74.7%, 67.1% and 58.0% of the variability in nitrate flux annually, in the dry season, and in the wet season, respectively. According to the variable importance in the projection (VIP) values, the dominant first-order factors for the nitrate concentration were as follows: the areal percentages of agricultural, forest and residential areas; followed by the slope; the largest patch index (LPI); the flow path gradient (FPG); the slope gradient variance (SGV); and the splitting index (SPLIT). In addition to these factors, the runoff coefficient (RC), flashiness index (FI), and patch density (PD) affected the changes in the nitrate flux. This study illustrates the influence of hydrological and environmental factors on seasonal water quality and can serve as guidelines for better watershed modeling and effective water quality management.

Infiltration capacity of roadside filter strips with non-uniform overland flow	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The side slope to a roadside swale (drainage ditch) constitutes a filter strip that has potential for infiltration of road runoff, thereby serving as a stormwater quantity and quality control mechanism. A total of thirty-two tests were performed during three seasons in four different highways located in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, MN to analyze the infiltration performance of roadside filter strips and the effect of fractional coverage of water on infiltration. Three different application rates were used in the experiments. All the tests showed that water flow on the lateral slope of a roadside swale is concentrated in fingers, instead of sheet flow, at the typical road runoff intensities for which infiltration practices are utilized to improve surface water quality. A linear relationship between flux of water from the road and fraction of wetted surface was observed, for the intensities tested. The average percentage infiltration of the medium road runoff rate (1.55 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) experiments performed in fall was 85% and in spring 70%. For the high road runoff rate (3.1 x 10(-4) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) tests the average amount of water infiltrated was 47% and for the low road runoff rate (7.76 x 10(-5) m(2)/s, without direct rainfall) tests it was 69%, both set of tests performed in spring and summer. The saturated hydraulic conductivity of swale soil was high, relative to the values typical of laboratory permeameter measurements for these types of soils. This is believed to be due to the macropores generated by vegetation roots, activity of macrofauna (e.g. earthworms), and construction/maintenance procedures. The trend was to have more infiltration when the saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher and for a greater side slope length, as expected. The vegetation, type of soil and length of the side slope are important to consider for constructing and maintaining roadside swales that will be efficient as stormwater control measures. These measurements indicate that the filter strip portion of a roadside swale typically infiltrates a substantial fraction of road runoff. However, the measurements do not incorporate the influence of direct rainfall upon the infiltration into filter strips. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The Ray catchment in the upper Thames basin, UK, was extensively monitored using in-situ, high-resolution (15 min) flow and water quality instrumentation. Dissolved oxygen, ammonium, turbidity and specific conductivity are used to characterise the water quality dynamics. The impact of the Swindon sewage treatment works (SSTW) on water chemistry at the catchment outlet is considerable. Hydrological and water-quality response varies considerably during the events, with the rural catchments exhibiting a much slower hydrological response compared to urban areas. A simple hydrological model (TETIS) was developed to provide insight into water sources in nested subcatchments, highlighting the disparity of the hydrological dynamics across contrasting land-uses during events. The variation in stormwater runoff sources impacts water quality signals with urban sites contributing to dilution dynamics in ammonium, whereas the more rural site experiences a peak in ammonium during the same event. Dissolved oxygen concentrations vary on a rural-urban gradient and experience a notable sag at the Water Eaton outlet (4.4 mg/I) during the events, that would have resulted in significant ecological harm had they occurred during the summer in warmer temperatures. The water-quality legacy of these storms in the wider context of the hydrological year is somewhat negligible, with markedly poorer water quality signals being observed during the summer months of 2014. Although ammonium concentrations during the events are elevated (above the 'good' status threshold under the WFD), higher values are observed during spring and summer months. The high flows actually appear to flush contaminants out of the Ray and its subcatchments, though the urban sites demonstrate a resupply dynamic during interim dry periods. Data suggest winter storms following dry spells in urban catchments cause some short-lived and spatially extensive deteriorations in water quality. More chronic effects, although prolonged, are only seen downstream of SSTW. These are indicative of capacity of infrastructure being reached, and from the data do not appear to be severe enough to cause ecological harm. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two SWAT models were created over two discrete time periods (1981-1990 and 2005-2014) for each watershed. National Land Cover Datasets 1992 and 2011 were, respectively, ingested into 1981-1990 and 2005-2014 models, along with corresponding weather data, to enable comparison of annual and seasonal runoff, soil water content, evapotranspiration (ET), water yield, and percolation between these two decades. Simulation results based on the calibrated models showed that surface runoff, soil water content, water yield, and percolation increased in all three watersheds. Elevated ET was also apparent, except in Skunk Creek watershed. Differences in annual water balance components appeared to follow changes in land use more closely than variation in precipitation amounts, although seasonal variation in precipitation was reflected in seasonal surface runoff. Subbasin-scale spatial analyses revealed noticeable increases in water balance components mostly in downstream parts of Bad River and Skunk Creek watersheds, and the western part of Upper Big Sioux River watershed. Results presented in this study provide some insight into recent changes in hydrological processes in South Dakota watersheds.

J	Radcliffe, DE; Mukundan, R				Radcliffe, D. E.; Mukundan, R.			PRISM vs. CFSR Precipitation Data Effects on Calibration and Validation of SWAT Models	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Precipitation is one of the most important drivers in watershed models. Our objective was to compare two sources of interpolated precipitation data in terms of their effect on calibration and validation of two Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models. One model was a suburban watershed in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. The precipitation sources were Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data on a 4-km grid and climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) data on a 38-km grid. The PRISM data resulted in a better fit to the calibration data (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency [NSE]=0.64, Kling-Gupta efficiency [KGE]=0.74, p-factor=0.84, and r-factor=0.43) than the CFSR data (NSE=0.47, KGE=0.53, p-factor=0.67, and r-factor=0.39). Validation results were similar. Sensitive parameters were similar in both the PRISM and CFSR models, but fitted values indicated more rapid groundwater flow to the streams with the PRISM data. The same comparison was made in the Big Creek watershed located approximately 1,000km away, in central Louisiana. Results were similar with a more responsive groundwater system indicating PRISM data may produce better predictions of streamflow because of a more accurate estimate of rainfall within a watershed or because of a denser grid. Our study implies PRISM is providing a better estimate than CFSR of precipitation within a watershed when rain gauge data are not available, resulting in more accurate simulations of streamflows at the watershed outlet.

Testing of the Modified Streambank Erosion and Instream Phosphorus Routines for the SWAT Model	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												In some watersheds, streambanks are a source of two major pollutants, phosphorus (P) and sediment. P originating from both uplands and streambanks can be transported and stored indefinitely on floodplains, streambanks, and in closed depressions near the stream. The objectives of this study were to (1) test the modified streambank erosion and instream P routines for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in the Barren Fork Creek watershed in northeast Oklahoma, (2) predict P in the watershed with and without streambank-derived P, and (3) determine the significance of streambank erosion P relative to overland P sources. Measured streambank and channel parameters were incorporated into a flow-calibrated SWAT model and used to estimate streambank erosion and P for the Barren Fork Creek using modified streambank erosion and instream P routines. The predicted reach-weighted streambank erosion was 40kg/m vs. the measured 42kg/m. Streambank erosion contributed 47% of the total P to the Barren Fork Creek and improved P predictions compared to observed data, especially during the high-flow events. Of the total P entering the stream system, approximately 65% was removed via the watershed outlet and 35% was stored in the floodplain and stream system. This study successfully applied the SWAT model's modified streambank erosion and instream P routines and demonstrated that streambank-derived P can improve P modeling at the watershed scale.

It is expected to improve code development and maintenance; support data availability, analysis, and visualization; and enhance the model's capabilities in terms of the spatial representation of elements and processes within watersheds. The most important change is the implementation of landscape units and flow and pollutant routing across the landscape. Also, SWAT+ offers more flexibility than SWAT in defining management schedules, routing constituents, and connecting managed flow systems to the natural stream network. To test the basic hydrologic function of SWAT+, it was applied to the Little River Experimental Watershed (Georgia) without enhanced overland routing and compared with previous models. SWAT+ gave similar results and inaccuracies as these models did for streamflow and water balance. Taking full advantage of the new capabilities of SWAT+ regarding watershed discretization and landscape and river interactions is expected to improve simulations in future studies. While many capabilities of SWAT have already been enhanced in SWAT+ and new capabilities have been added, the model will continue to evolve in response to advancements in scientific knowledge and the demands of the growing worldwide user community.

Estimation of Catchment Nutrient Loads in New Zealand Using Monthly Water Quality Monitoring Data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Causes of variation between loads estimated using alternative calculation methods and their repeatability were investigated using 20years of daily flow and monthly concentration samples for 77 rivers in New Zealand. Loads of dissolved and total nitrogen and phosphorus were calculated using the Ratio, L5, and L7 methods. Estimates of loads and their precision associated with short-term records of 5, 10, and 15years were simulated by subsampling. The representativeness of the short-term loads was quantified as the standard deviation of the 20 realizations. The L7 method generally produced more realistic loads with the highest precision and representativeness. Differences between load estimates were shown to be associated with poor agreement between the data and the underlying model. The best method was shown to depend on the match between the model and functional and distributional characteristics of the data, rather than on the contaminant. Short-term load estimates poorly represented the long-term load estimate, and deviations frequently exceeded estimated imprecision. The results highlight there is no single preferred load calculation method, the inadvisability of unsupervised load estimation and the importance of inspecting concentration-flow, unit load-flow plots and regression residuals. Regulatory authorities should be aware that the precision of loads estimated from monthly data are likely to be optimistic with respect to the actual repeatability of load estimates.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				FEB	2017	53	1					158	178		10.1111/1752-1688.12492								WOS:000394779000013

Numerical and Qualitative Contrasts of Two Statistical Models for Water Quality Change in Tidal Waters	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Two statistical approaches, weighted regression on time, discharge, and season and generalized additive models, have recently been used to evaluate water quality trends in estuaries. Both models have been used in similar contexts despite differences in statistical foundations and products. This study provided an empirical and qualitative comparison of both models using 29years of data for two discrete time series of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the Patuxent River estuary. Empirical descriptions of each model were based on predictive performance against the observed data, ability to reproduce flow-normalized trends with simulated data, and comparisons of performance with validation datasets. Between-model differences were apparent but minor and both models had comparable abilities to remove flow effects from simulated time series. Both models similarly predicted observations for missing data with different characteristics. Trends from each model revealed distinct mainstem influences of the Chesapeake Bay with both models predicting a roughly 65% increase in chl-a over time in the lower estuary, whereas flow-normalized predictions for the upper estuary showed a more dynamic pattern, with a nearly 100% increase in chl-a in the last 10years. Qualitative comparisons highlighted important differences in the statistical structure, available products, and characteristics of the data and desired analysis.

Vanishing Springs in Nepalese Mountains Assessment of Water Sources, Farmers' Perceptions, and Climate Change Adaptation	MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT												The Thulokhola watershed of the Nuwakot district in the midhills region of Nepal can be considered typical of climate change-related stresses in the region. To assess the status of water resources and document farmers' perceptions of and adaptation to climate change impacts in this watershed, we invited community groups to monitor water quality and conducted 6 focus group meetings, 3 participatory rural appraisals, and spring and household surveys in 2011 and 2012. Historical precipitation data from a nearby weather station and discharge data for the Tadi Khola, the nearest major river, were also analyzed. The spring survey results confirmed farmers' perceptions and showed that 73.2% of the springs used as water sources had a decreased flow and 12.2% had dried up over the past 10 or more years, as recognized by local residents. In response to the severe decline of precipitation and the drying up of springs, local communities have implemented some climate change adaptation measures, such as constructing water tanks at water sources, using pipes to transport drinking water, diverting water from other springs, digging deeper wells, and traveling farther to wash clothes and fetch drinking water. To enhance drinking water supplies and ensure the agricultural, ecological, and environmental integrity of the watershed, initiatives such as comprehensive research on springs and groundwater hydrology, a spring rejuvenation program, and community capacity building for water sustainability and climate change adaptation are suggested.																	0276-4741	1994-7151				FEB	2017	37	1					35	46		10.1659/MRD-JOURNAL-D-16-00039.1								WOS:000395382000005						
J	Dong, FX; Mitchell, PD; Davis, VM; Recker, R				Dong, Fengxia; Mitchell, Paul D.; Davis, Vince M.; Recker, Ross			Impact of atrazine prohibition on the sustainability of weed management in Wisconsin maize production	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: Controversy has surrounded atrazine owing to its susceptibility to leaching and run-off, with regular calls for a ban or restrictions on its use. In the context of a decreasing trend in the percentage of US maize using no-till since 2008, coinciding with the trend of glyphosate-resistant weeds becoming problematic in the Midwestern United States, we empirically examine how atrazine use restrictions have impacted the diversity of weed management practices used by Wisconsin maize farmers. RESULTS: Using survey data from farms inside and outside atrazine prohibition areas, we found that prohibiting atrazine did not directly impact tillage practices, but rather it increased the adoption of herbicide-resistant seed, which then increased adoption of conservation tillage systems. We also found that prohibiting atrazine and using herbicide-resistant seed reduced the number of herbicide sites of action used. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that prohibiting atrazine reduced the diversity of weed management practices, which increased the risk of herbicide resistance. Our concern is that a regulatory policy to address one issue (atrazine in groundwater) has induced farmer responses that increase problems with another issue (herbicide-resistant weeds) that longer term will contribute to water quality problems from increased soil erosion and offset the initial benefits.

Coastal river plumes: Collisions and coalescence	PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY												Plumes of buoyant river water spread in the ocean from river mouths, and these plumes influence water quality, sediment dispersal, primary productivity, and circulation along the world's coasts. Most investigations of river plumes have focused on large rivers in a coastal region, for which the physical spreading of the plume is assumed to be independent from the influence of other buoyant plumes. Here we provide new understanding of the spreading patterns of multiple plumes interacting along simplified coastal settings by investigating: (i) the relative likelihood of plume-to-plume interactions at different settings using geophysical scaling, (ii) the diversity of plume frontal collision types and the effects of these collisions on spreading patterns of plume waters using a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, and (iii) the fundamental differences in plume spreading patterns between coasts with single and multiple rivers using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. Geophysical scaling suggests that coastal margins with numerous small rivers (watershed areas < 10,000 km(2)), such as found along most active geologic coastal margins, were much more likely to have river plumes that collide and interact than coastal settings with large rivers (watershed areas > 100,000 km(2)). When two plume fronts meet, several types of collision attributes were found, including refection, subduction and occlusion. We found that the relative differences in pre-collision plume densities and thicknesses strongly influenced the resulting collision types. The three-dimensional spreading of buoyant plumes was found to be influenced by the presence of additional rivers for all modeled scenarios, including those with and without Coriolis and wind. Combined, these results suggest that plume-to-plume interactions are common phenomena for coastal regions offshore of the world's smaller rivers and for coastal settings with multiple river mouths in close proximity, and that the spreading and fate of river waters in these settings will be strongly influenced by these interactions. We conclude that new investigations are needed to characterize how plumes interact offshore of river mouths to better understand the transport and fate of terrestrial sources of pollution, nutrients and other materials in the ocean.																	0079-6611					FEB	2017	151						245	260		10.1016/j.pocean.2016.11.008								WOS:000395609900016

Multi-Year Microbial Source Tracking Study Characterizing Fecal Contamination in an Urban Watershed	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Microbiological and hydrological data were used to rank tributary stream contributions of bacteria to the Little Blue River in Independence, Missouri. Concentrations, loadings and yields of E. coli and microbial source tracking (MST) markers, were characterized during base flow and storm events in five subbasins within Independence, as well as sources entering and leaving the city through the river. The E. coli water quality threshold was exceeded in 29% of base-flow and 89% of storm-event samples. The total contribution of E. coli and MST markers from tributaries within Independence to the Little Blue River, regardless of streamflow, did not significantly increase the median concentrations leaving the city. Daily loads and yields of E. coli and MST markers were used to rank the subbasins according to their contribution of each constituent to the river. The ranking methodology used in this study may prove useful in prioritizing remediation in the different subbasins.

Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), and fluorescence spectroscopy are also capable of quantifying organic content, although the mechanisms of quantification and the organic fractions targeted differ for each test. This study explores correlations between BOD5 and these alternate test procedures using facility influent, primary effluent, and facility effluent samples from a full-scale water resource recovery facility. Relative reductions of the water quality parameters proved to be strong indicators of their suitability as surrogates for BOD5. Suitable correlations were generally limited to the combined datasets for the three sampling locations or the facility effluent alone. COD exhibited relatively strong linear correlations with BOD5 when considering the three sample points (r = 0.985) and the facility effluent alone (r = 0.914), while TOC exhibited a suitable linear correlation with BOD5 in the facility effluent (r = 0.902). Exponential regressions proved to be useful for estimating BOD5 based on TOC or fluorescence (r > 0.95).																	1061-4303	1554-7531				FEB 1	2017	89	2					168	177		10.2175/106143016X14504669768976								WOS:000397280800007	27074790

The hydrogeochemical study is conducted by collecting and analyzing the groundwater samples from July and September of 2013. The studied system contains three major groundwater types, namely Ca-Mg-HCO3, Na-Cl, and non-dominant water, based on the analysis of the major ions. The main processes contributing to chemical compositions in the groundwater are the dissolution along the flow path, dedolomitisation, ion exchange reactions, and the mixing with wastewater. According to the computed water quality index (WQI) ranging from 25.45 to 194.35, the groundwater in the plain can be categorized into "excellent water", "good water", and "poor water". There is a resemblance between the spatial distribution of the WQI and hydrochemical water types in the Piper diagram. The "excellent" quality water broadly coincides with the Ca-Mg-HCO3 water type. The "poor" water matches with the Na-Cl water type, and the "good" quality water coincides with blended water. The results indicate that this aquifer suffers from intense human activities which are forcing the aquifer into a critical condition.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				FEB	2017	31	3					765	780		10.1007/s11269-016-1390-y								WOS:000395000500003						
J	Shi, W; Xia, J				Shi, Wei; Xia, Jun			Combined risk assessment of nonstationary monthly water quality based on Markov chain and time-varying copula	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Water quality risk management is a global hot research linkage with the sustainable water resource development. Ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N) and permanganate index (CODMn) as the focus indicators in Huai River Basin, are selected to reveal their joint transition laws based on Markov theory. The time-varying moments model with either time or land cover index as explanatory variables is applied to build the time-varying marginal distributions of water quality time series. Time-varying copula model, which takes the non-stationarity in the marginal distribution and/or the time variation in dependence structure between water quality series into consideration, is constructed to describe a bivariate frequency analysis for NH3-N and CODMn series at the same monitoring gauge. The larger first-order Markov joint transition probability indicates water quality state Class V-w, Class IV and Class III will occur easily in the water body of Bengbu Sluice. Both marginal distribution and copula models are nonstationary, and the explanatory variable time yields better performance than land cover index in describing the non-stationarities in the marginal distributions. In modelling the dependence structure changes, time-varying copula has a better fitting performance than the copula with the constant or the time-trend dependence parameter. The largest synchronous encounter risk probability of NH3-N and CODMn simultaneously reaching Class V is 50.61%, while the asynchronous encounter risk probability is largest when NH3-N and CODMn is inferior to class V and class IV water quality standards, respectively.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	3					693	704		10.2166/wst.2016.553								WOS:000394350100021	28192363

Therefore, a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of a data set and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for forecasting purposes was used. The results obtained were compared with those obtained by using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The proposed methodology was applied to four absorbance time series data sets composed by a total number of 5705 UV-Vis spectra. Absolute percentage errors obtained by applying the proposed PCA/ANN methodology vary between 10% and 13% for all four study sites. In general terms, the results obtained were hardly generalizable, as they appeared to be highly dependent on specific dynamics of the water system; however, some trends can be outlined. PCA/ANN methodology gives better results than PCA/DFT forecasting procedure by using a specific spectra range for the following conditions: (i) for Salitre wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) (first hour) and Graz West R05 (first 18 min), from the last part of UV range to all visible range; (ii) for Gibraltar pumping station (first 6 min) for all UV-Vis absorbance spectra; and (iii) for San Fernando WWTP (first 24 min) for all of UV range to middle part of visible range.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	4					765	774		10.2166/wst.2016.524								WOS:000395820000002	28234277

Performance evaluation of 388 full-scale waste stabilization pond systems with seven different configurations	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Waste stabilization ponds (WSPs) and their variants are one the most widely used wastewater treatment systems in the world. However, the scarcity of systematic performance data from fullscale plants has led to challenges associated with their design. The objective of this research was to assess the performance of 388 full-scale WSP systems located in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia and the United States through the statistical analysis of available monitoring data. Descriptive statistics were calculated of the influent and effluent concentrations and the removal efficiencies for 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), ammonia nitrogen (N-Ammonia), and either thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) or Escherichia coli for each WSP system, leading to a broad characterization of actual treatment performance. Compliance with different water quality and system performance goals was also evaluated. The treatment plants were subdivided into seven different categories, according to their units and flowsheet. The median influent concentrations of BOD5 and TSS were 431 mg/L and 397 mg/L and the effluent concentrations varied from technology to technology, but median values were 50 mg/L and 47 mg/L, respectively. The median removal efficiencies were 85% for BOD5 and 75% for TSS. The overall removals of TTC and E. coli were 1.74 and 1.63 log10 units, respectively. Future research is needed to better understand the influence of design, operational and environmental factors on WSP system performance.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				FEB	2017	75	4					916	927		10.2166/wst.2016.532								WOS:000395820000017	28234292

This study investigated the use of information on ionic composition as a fingerprint to identify the source land-use of stormwater runoff. We used 12 ionic species in stormwater runoff monitored for a total of 20 storm events at five sites with different land-use compositions during the 2012-2014 wet seasons. A stepwise forward discriminant function analysis (DFA) with the jack-knifed cross validation approach was used to select ionic species that better discriminate the land-use of its source. Of the 12 ionic species, 9 species (K+, Mg2+, Na+, NH4+, Br-, Cl-, F-, NO2-, and SO42-) were selected for better performance of the DFA. The DFA successfully differentiated stormwater samples from urban, rural, and construction sites using concentrations of the ionic species (70%, 95%, and 91% of correct classification, respectively). Over 80% of the new data cases were correctly classified by the trained DFA model. When applied to data cases from a mixed land-use catchment and downstream, the DFA model showed the greater impact of urban areas and rural areas respectively in the earlier and later parts of a storm event.

Evaluation of leached metals in recovered aluminum coagulants from water treatment slurry	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The water treatment industry consumes large quantities of coagulant and produces huge amounts of slurry. The cost of alum used in water treatment, stringent regulations and negative impacts of sludge disposal are the motive to do integrated research studies on the technical feasibility of aluminum coagulant recovery from sludge using acidification. This work studied the leaching of iron, manganese, and chromium as the most extracted metals with aluminum during sludge acidification; furthermore, these metals have a great impact on the recovered coagulants' efficiency and treated water quality. The sludge used was collected from El-Sheikh Zayd water treatment plant in Egypt, then dried and ground; afterward, the effect of acid concentration, sludge mass, temperature, mixing speed and mixing time was studied. In addition, it was noticeable that the efficiency of sulfuric acid in leaching iron, manganese and chromium is higher than that of hydrochloric acid. Also, higher leaching for the three metals was obtained in all the experiments using higher acid concentration, elevated temperature, and rotational speed. Finally, the leached metals in recovered aluminum coagulants will not limit its application to water and wastewater treatment, as their concentrations are still very low if compared with aluminum, even with the highest leaching efficiency.

Generalized Swimmer's Itch	AKTUELLE DERMATOLOGIE												We report on a patient who presented with an exanthematic rash after he went fishing with total body water exposure for several times. Cercaria dermatitis is a worldwide disseminated disease, which is caused by the infestation of cercaria organisms during swimming in contaminated waters. Clinical signs include pruritic papular and urticarial alterations of the skin. After recurrent exposures systemic symptoms may develop. Because of the self-limited course of disease only symptomatic treatment is necessary. Since regular controls by federal agencies help to maintain a good water quality in Germany, swimmer's itch or cercaria dermatitis is a quite rare disease in our country.																	0340-2541	1438-938X				FEB	2017	43	1-2					37	39		10.1055/s-0042-122211								WOS:000397093700017						
J	Jaddi, NS; Abdullah, S				Jaddi, Najmeh Sadat; Abdullah, Salwani			A cooperative-competitive master-slave global-best harmony searchfor ANN optimization and water-quality prediction	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING												The artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the most accurate and commonly used machine-learning techniques and can learn even complex data by employing metaheuristic algorithms. Harmony search(HS) is a metaheuristic algorithm that imitates the process by which musicians tune their instruments to achieve perfect harmony. Global-best harmony search(GHS) is an effective variant of the HS algorithm that borrows the concept of gbest (globalbest) from particle-swarm optimization (PSO) to improve the performance of HS. Employing a multi-population technique improves the convergence of the algorithm. The master-slave technique is one of the most powerful multi-population techniques. This paper proposes a cooperative-competitive master-slave multi-population GHS (CC-GHS) to train the ANN. To provide the proposed CC-GHS algorithm with strong abilities in both exploration and exploitation, a competitive master-slave strategy (Com-GHS) is interacted with a cooperative master-slave strategy(Coo-GHS). A probabilistic variable is employed to achieve a good balance between cooperativeness and competitiveness. The method is tested on benchmark classification and time-series prediction problems, and statistical analyses demonstrate the ability of the proposed method. The CC-GHS is also applied to are a lworld water-quality prediction problem with promising results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Srinivasa			Principal component and multivariate statistical approach for evaluation of hydrochemical characterization of fluoride-rich groundwater of Shaslar Vagu watershed, Nalgonda District, India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												In order to assess the impact of fluoride-rich groundwater of Shasilair Vagu watershed on groundwater regime, more than hundred groundwater samples for pre- and post-monsoon seasons were collected from bore wells/dug wells and analyzed for major ions. Water quality analysis of major ion chemistry shows elevated concentration of fluoride in groundwater samples. The fluoride concentration ranges from 1.4 to 5.9 mg/l and 1.5 to 5.8 mg/l in pre- and post-monsoons, respectively. The result clearly shows that the seasonal variation of fluoride in groundwater is due to recharge of rain water during monsoon. The water quality data was analyzed by hydrochemical facies ( Piper diagram), Gibbs plot, and various plots. Plots of Na versus Cl, Ca versus SO4, and ( Na+Cl)-(SO4+HCO3) versus (Na+K-Cl) shows positive and negative values, indicating that their source of high concentration are aquifer, evapotranpiration, and other anthropogenic sources. Saturation index of halite and gypsum shows that all groundwater samples were undersaturated and suggests that carbonate minerals influence the concentration. Using multivariate statistical techniques, viz., principal component ( factor analysis and cluster analysis), the analysis brought out impact of intensity of excess use of fertilizers and excess withdrawal of groundwater regime. Multivariate statistical techniques are potential tools and provide greater precision for identifying contaminant parameter linkages.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				FEB	2017	10	4							83	10.1007/s12517-017-2863-x								WOS:000396880600010

Abiotic habitat thresholds for salmonid over-summer survival in intermittent streams	ECOSPHERE												Intermittent streams lose surface flow during part of the year but can provide important habitat for imperiled fishes in residual pools. However, extended intermittency can drive high mortality as pool contraction decreases pool quality, and some pools dry completely. We evaluated the influence of a suite of abiotic habitat characteristics on the over-summer survival of two imperiled salmonid fishes (coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch; steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) at four study sites on two tributaries of Salmon Creek (Sonoma County, California, USA) from 2012 to 2014, during deepening drought conditions. Study sites spanned an intermittency gradient from continuous flow to near-dry conditions, and included alluvial and bedrock stream reaches. We estimated over-summer survival at the pool scale from fish presence-absence data based on paired early-late summer snorkel surveys. We measured pool dimensions and water quality parameters monthly (more frequently during summer dry down) and, in 2013 and 2014, recorded water quality with continuous loggers in selected pools. We performed: (1) logistic regression in a generalized linear modeling framework to identify factors limiting over-summer survival and (2) classification trees using the random forests ensemble learning method to identify abiotic thresholds for sustaining sal-monids. Results suggested that different factors governed mortality of the two species. Coho salmon, which tended to survive in large, deep pools, were limited by minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In contrast, steelhead trout, which tended to survive in pools with large surface area, were sensitive to pool geometry and temperature. Both species persisted for weeks in large pools with low DO levels, including in pools where at least part of the water column reached sublethal or lethal levels. Our results suggest that shallow, lateral hyporheic flow may be important for maintaining DO and temperatures suitable for sustaining salmonids in isolated pools, whereas groundwater discharge originating from deeper flow paths may generate low-DO conditions that inhibit salmonid persistence. Geomorphically complex watersheds with a variety of pool geometries and high rates of lateral hyporheic exchange are those most likely to serve as "sanctuary reaches" for imperiled Pacific salmonid populations in semi-arid regions in the context of a changing climate.

This study assessed preferences for provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services, specifically, climate regulation (carbon sequestration), nutrient control (water quality), and agricultural and forest productivity, and the willingness to pay for protection of these ecosystem services by residents in the Suwannee River Basin of Florida, as assessed through a household mail survey and choice experiment. A conditional logit model was used to evaluate preferences and marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) under different scenarios. Survey respondents identified nutrient control (water quality) as the most important service, while agricultural and forestry production was somewhat important, and climate regulation/carbon sequestration was the least important. Respondents expressed the highest level of trust in local government agencies to implement ecosystem service protection programs, and welcomed the implementation of such programs anywhere in the basin, but not close to their home. The average MWTP was extremely low ( < $2/household/year) when compared to other studies, and suggests that respondents have many competing interests for their discretionary spending in relation to environmental amenities.																	2212-0416					FEB	2017	23						228	237		10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.12.015								WOS:000396986200022						
J	Lee, YE; Jo, JH; Kim, SM; Yoo, YS				Lee, Ye-Eun; Jo, Jun-Ho; Kim, Sun-Min; Yoo, Yeong-Seok			Recycling Possibility of the Salty Food Waste by Pyrolysis and Water Scrubbing	ENERGIES												Salty food waste is difficult to manage with previous methods such as composting, anaerobic digestion, and incineration, due to the hindrance of salt and the additional burden to handle high concentrations of organic wastewater produced when raw materials are cleaned. This study presents a possibility of recycling food waste as fuel without the burden of treatment washing with water by pyrolyzing and scrubbing. For this purpose, salty food waste with 3% NaCl was made using 10 materials and pyrolysis was conducted at temperature range between 200-400 degrees C. The result was drawn from elementary analysis (EA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) analysis, water quality analysis and calorific value analysis of char, washed char, and washing water. The result of the EA showed that NaCl in food waste could be volatilized at a low pyrolysis temperature of 200-300 degrees C and it could be concentrated and fixed in char at a high pyrolysis temperature of 300-400 degrees C. The XPS analysis result showed that NaCl existed in form of chloride. Through the Na content result of the AAS analysis, NaCl remaining in char after water scrubbing was determined to be less than 2%. As the pyrolysis temperature increased, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) value of scrubbing water decreased rapidly, but the total phosphorus and nitrogen contents decreased gradually. The cleaned pyrolysis char showed an increase of higher heating value (HHV) approximately 3667-9920 J/g due to the removal of salt from the char and, especially at 300-400 degrees C, showed a similar HHV with normal fossil fuels. In conclusion, salty food waste, which is pyrolyzed at a temperature of 300-400 degrees C and cleaned by water, can be utilized as high-energy refuse derived fuel (RDF), without adverse effects, due to the volatilization of Cl and an additional process of contaminated water.				li, liang/G-8974-2018													1996-1073					FEB	2017	10	2							210	10.3390/en10020210								WOS:000395469200064

The increased economic, industrial, and domestic developments may affect the environmental quality of water and halicutic resources. In this study, we evaluated the seasonal (dry and wet seasons) biogeochemical state of the Saigon River during two snapshot campaigns conducted along the river basin upstream from HCMC; the Saigon River was characterized by slightly acidic (pH 5.7-7.7) and oxygen-depleted water (dissolved oxygen (DO), 0.36-5.18 mg l(-1)). Nutrients (N-NH4 = 0.01-2.41, N-NO3 = 0.14-2.72, and P-PO4 = similar to 0-0.42 mg l(-1)), DOC (2.2-8.0 mg l(-1)), POC, and trace metal(oid) (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Hg) concentrations were low showing a good quality of the upstream river. In the urban center area, DO dropped to 0.03 mg l(-1) accompanied with a rise of nutrient concentrations (e.g., N-NH4, up to 17.7 mg l(-1)) likely originating from wastewater discharges. Trace metal concentrations also rose sharply (e.g., Cr and Hg rose up to 10-fold higher) in both water and sediments but remained under the World Health Organization (WHO) and Vietnamese concentration guidelines. In the downstream estuarine area, the intrusion of marine waters diluted water flowing from HCMC, leading water quality to return close to the state observed upstream from HCMC. In general, levels of nutrient and metal contaminations along the Saigon River during both seasons appear moderate regarding to Vietnamese and WHO guidelines although the urban area is highlighted as the major contributor for metal(oid) emissions. Finally, we showed that apart from wastewater and industrial discharges that affect the river quality, metal(oid) partitioning between solid and solution is controlled by the change in water geochemistry along the continuum during both seasons, such as DO (e.g., for As and Cr) and pH (e.g., for Pb) which drives their sorption/dissolution dynamics.

In the tidal Garonne River, its main tributary, episodes of low (< 5 mg L-1) to hypoxic (< 2 mg L-1) dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations have been occasionally recorded close to Bordeaux, about 100 km from the mouth. Projected long-term environmental changes (increase in temperature and population, decrease in river discharge) suggest the establishment of summer chronic oxygen deficiency in the tidal Garonne River in the next decades. Assessing and managing the risk of hypoxia on such a large, hyper-turbid fluvio-estuarine system is complex, due to the different forcing factors (temperature, river discharge, turbidity, urban wastes) acting over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. In this context, we show the interest of a real-time, high-frequency monitoring of the water quality, the MAGEST network, which continuously records since 2005 temperature, salinity, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen in surface waters in Bordeaux. Through the analysis of the 10-year DO records, we demonstrate the interest of a high-frequency, long-term database to better document DO variability and to define the controlling factors of DO concentrations. This real-time monitoring is also of great interest for the development of manager's oriented tools and the follow-up of DO objectives in the tidal Garonne River.

Low C/N ratio raw textile wastewater reduced labile C and enhanced organic-inorganic N and enzymatic activities in a semiarid alkaline soil	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Application of raw and treated wastewater for irrigation is an extensive practice for agricultural production in arid and semiarid regions. Raw textile wastewater has been used for cultivation in urban and peri-urban areas in Pakistan without any systematic consideration to soil quality. We conducted a laboratory incubation study to investigate the effects of low C/N ratio raw textile wastewater on soil nitrogen (N) contents, labile carbon (C) as water-soluble C (WSC) contents, and activities of urease and dehydrogenase enzymes. The 60-day incubation study used an alkaline clay loam aridisol that received 0 ( distilled water), 25, 50, and 100% wastewater concentrations, and microcosms were incubated aerobically under room temperature at 70% water holding capacity. Results revealed that raw wastewater significantly ( p < 0.05) changed soil N pools and processes, WSC contents, and enzymatic activities. The organic and inorganic N species increased with increasing wastewater concentrations, whereas WSC contents followed an opposite trend. The highest NH4 (+)- N and NO3 (-) -N contents were observed in soil treated with 100% wastewater. The extractable organic N (EON) contents always represented > 50% of the soil total Kjeldahl N (TKN) contents and served as the major N pool. However, nitrification index ( NO3- -N/NH4+-N ratio) decreased at high wastewater concentrations. A significant negative correlation was observed between EON and WSC ( p < 0.05) and between net nitrification and WSC/EON ratio ( p < 0.01). In contrast, nitrification index and WSC contents were correlated, positively suggesting WSC potentially controlling N turnover in nutrient-poor aridisol. We found significant ( p < 0.0001) positive correlations of soil urease and dehydrogenase enzymatic activities with soil-extractable mineral N contents indicating coupled N cycling and soil biological activity. Higher production and accumulation of soil NO3 (-)- N and EON contents in concentrated wastewater-treated soil could pose an ecological concern for soil fertility, biological health, and water quality. However, the EON could lead to mineral N pool but only if sufficient labile C source was present. The effects of wastewater irrigation on soil N cycling need to be assessed before it is recommended for crop production.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					3456	3469		10.1007/s11356-016-8102-2								WOS:000397004600021	27873113

Use of major ions to evaluate the hydrogeochemistry of groundwater influenced by reclamation and seawater intrusion, West Nile Delta, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The aim of this research is to evaluate the groundwater geochemistry in western Nile Delta area as an example of an aquifer influenced by reclamation and seawater intrusion. To conduct this study, 63 groundwater samples and one surface water sample from El Nubaria Canal were collected. To estimate the origin of dissolved ions and the geochemical processes influencing this groundwater, integration between land use change, pedological, hydrogeological, hydrogeochemical, and statistical approaches was considered. Results suggest that the groundwater flow regime changed from northeast and southwest directions around El Nubaria canal before 1966 to northern and northeastern directions due to newly constructed channel network. Soil salinity and mineral contents, seepage from irrigation canal, and seawater intrusion are the main factors controlling the groundwater chemistry. Statistically, the groundwater samples were classified into eight groups, one to four for the deep groundwater and five to eight for the shallow groundwater. The deep groundwater is characterized by two groups of chemicals (SO4-HCO3-Mg-Ca-K and Cl-Na), while the shallow groundwater groups of chemicals are Na-Cl-SO4 and K-HCO3-Ca-Mg. Both shallow groundwater and deep groundwater are mostly saturated with respect to carbonate minerals and undersaturated with respect to chloride minerals. Sulfate minerals are above the saturation limit in the shallow groundwater, but in the deep samples, these minerals are under the saturation limit. Ion exchange, carbonate production, mineral precipitation, and seawater intrusion are the geochemical processes governing the groundwater chemistry in the study area.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					3675	3704		10.1007/s11356-016-8056-4								WOS:000397004600040	27888479

The average monthly dry deposition flux of aerosols was 15.18 g/m(2), with a range of 5.78-47.56 g/m(2). The maximum flux season was winter, followed by summer, autumn, and spring. Zn and Pb pollution in this area was serious, and some of the sample sites had Cr, Co, Ni, and Cu pollution. Deposition fluxes of Zn/Pb in winter and summer reached 99.77/143.63 and 17.04/33.23 g/(hm(2) month), respectively. Principal component analysis showed two main components in the dry deposition; the first was Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn, and the other was Pb and Cd. Principal sources of the trace elements were iron mining and other anthropogenic activities in the surrounding areas and mountainous area north of the reservoir. Mineralogy analysis and microscopic conformation results showed many iron minerals and some unweathered minerals in dry deposition and atmospheric particulate matter, which came from an iron ore yard in the northern mountainous area of Miyun County. There was possible iron-rich dry deposition into Miyun Reservoir, affecting its water quality and harming the health of people living in areas around the reservoir and Beijing.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					3829	3842		10.1007/s11356-016-8043-9								WOS:000397004600053	27900624

PSWM operation reduced the temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) differences between upper and lower water levels. Concentrations of NH4+-N, NO2--N, TN, TP, COD and TSS increased rapidly and reached maximums at 12 h. The density and biomass of phytoplankton and levels of chlorophyll a reached maximums after 40 h of PSWM operation. In a 165-day study, the mean concentrations of NH4+-N, NO2--N and the available phosphorous (AP) in the PSWM ponds were significantly lower than in the control ponds, but the TP was significantly greater than the control ponds. Compared with the test began, the thickness of the sediment in PSWM ponds declined by 12.4 +/- 4.3 cm, the control ponds increased by 5.0 +/- 2.3 cm and the TN and AP levels in sediment significantly declined. PSWM treatment increased the production of bream and silver carp by 30 and 25%, respectively, and the feed coefficient was reduced by 24.2%. Use of PSWM in bream aquaculture ponds improved water quality, reduced sediment, reduced aquaculture pollution emissions and increased production.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	4					4040	4047		10.1007/s11356-016-8144-5								WOS:000397004600073	27928749

Throughout recorded history, the Lower Yellow River (LYR) experienced many catastrophic flood and drought events. To regulate the LYR, a reservoir was constructed at Xiaolangdi that became operational in the early 2000s. An annual water-sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) was then implemented, aimed at flood control, sediment reduction, regulated water supply, and power generation. This study examines the eco-environmental and socioenvironmental impacts of Xiaolangdi Reservoir. In retrospect, it is found that the reservoir construction phase incurred huge financial cost and required large-scale human resettlement. Subsequent reservoir operations affected the local geological environment, downstream riverbed erosion, evolution of the Yellow River delta, water quality, and aquatic biodiversity. Lessons from the impact assessment of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir are summarized as follows: (1) The construction of large reservoirs is not merely an engineering challenge but must also be viewed in terms of resource exploitation, environmental protection, and social development; (2) long-term systems for monitoring large reservoirs should be established, and decision makers involved at national policy and planning levels must be prepared to react quickly to the changing impact of large reservoirs; and (3) the key to solving sedimentation in the LYR is not Xiaolangdi Reservoir but instead soil conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin. Proper assessment of the impacts of large reservoirs will help promote development strategies that enhance the long-term sustainability of dam projects.

The publications referencing NPS pollution were analyzed including the following aspects: document type, publication language, publication output and characteristics, subject category, source journal, distribution of country and institution, author keywords, etc. The results indicate that the study of NPS pollution demonstrated a sharply increasing trend since 1991. Article and English were the most commonly used document type and language. Environmental sciences and ecology, water resources, and engineering were the top three subject categories. Water science and technology ranked first in distribution of journal, followed by Science of the total environment and Environmental Monitoring and Assessment. The USA took a leading position in both quantity and quality, playing an important role in the research field of NPS pollution, followed by the UK and China. The most productive institution was the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Chinese Acad Sci), followed by Beijing Normal University and US Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service (USDA ARS). The analysis of author keywords indicates that the major hotspots of NPS pollution from 1991 to 2015 contained "water,"Bmodel," "agriculture," "nitrogen," "phosphorus," etc. The results provide a comprehensive understanding of NPS pollution research and help readers to establish the future research directions.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	5					4352	4366		10.1007/s11356-016-8130-y								WOS:000397007200012	27928755

The severe AMD pollution and the incipient state of remediation strategies implemented in this region, coupled with the proximity of the deadline for compliance with the European Water Framework Directive (WFD), urge to develop a restoration and water resources management strategy. Furthermore, despite the presence of some reservoirs with acid waters in the Odiel basin, the construction of the Alcolea water reservoir has already started. On the basis of the positive results obtained after more than 10 years of developing a specific passive remediation technology (dispersed alkaline substrate (DAS)) for the highly polluted AMD of this region, a restoration strategy is proposed. The implementation of 13 DAS treatment plants in selected acid discharges along the Odiel and Oraque sub-basins and other restoration measurements of two acidic creeks is proposed as essential to obtain a good water quality in the future Alcolea reservoir. This restoration strategy is also suggested as an economically and environmentally sustainable approach to the extreme metal pollution affecting the waters of the region and could be considered the starting point for the future compliance with the WFD in the Odiel River Basin.

This study investigated the stream health in the context of the presence or absence of sensitive species, their diversity, and their taxa richness. The water and macroinvertebrate samples were collected from 17 different locations from upstream and downstream of the river by using random sampling method. Macroinvertebrate samples were obtained using kick net (500-mu m mesh size) and hand-picking method (NYSDEC). A total of 710 counts including 41 families of macroinvertebrates were recorded comprising of 7 orders including: Ephemeroptera (46%) being the most dominant group, Plecoptera (33%), Trichoptera (5%), Chironomidae (Diptera) (14%), Heteroptera (1%), and Coleoptera (1%). Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera (EPT) were found in abundance at the main source, Qarchanai, Dhee, and Tourqeen Nullah, as compared to the other locations of the stream. The most dominant macroinvertebrate was Ephemeroptera whose relative abundance is Pi = 0.49 by using the Shannon index. However, different statistical tools, including principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis (CA), ANOVA, and linear regression model, show a strong correlation between water quality and macroinvertebrates. The overall results of the biological indicators showed better ecological health at downstream compared to upstream. This study will provide basic information and understanding about the macroinvertebrates for future researchers, and the data will be helpful for upcoming research programs on alpine streams for the discovery and occurrences of macroinvertebrates and associated fauna.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	5					4685	4698		10.1007/s11356-016-8186-8								WOS:000397007200038	27975201

The Madrid region, covered by the population-based multicasecontrol (MCC-Spain) study, includes two drinking water supply areas. The different sources of the water, coupled together with the possible differences in water management, mean that there may be differences in drinking water quality. In the context of the MCC study, our aims were to describe contaminant concentrations in tap water drawn from various sampling points distributed around the region, assess these concentrations by reference to guideline values and study possible differences between the two supply areas. Tap water samples were collected from 34 sampling points in 7 towns in the Madrid region (19-29 April 2010), and 23 contaminants (metals, nitrates, disinfection by-product and Mutagen X levels) were quantified. We undertook a descriptive analysis of the contaminant concentrations in the water and compared them between the two water supply areas (Wilcoxon test). We created maps representing the distribution of the concentrations observed at water sampling points and assessed the correlations (Spearman's coefficient) between the different parameters measured. The concentrations of the contaminants were below guideline values. There were differences between the two supply areas in concentration of nitrates (p value = 0.0051) and certain disinfection by-products. While there were positive correlations (rho > 0.70) among some disinfection by-products, no correlations were found in metals or nitrates. The differences in nitrate levels could be linked to differences in farming/industrial activities in the catchment areas and in disinfection by-products might be related to the existence of different treatment systems or bromine content in source waters.

Nitrogen losses through surface runoff were measured for five treatments, including CK without N application, C200, C300 simulating the conventional practices, CO200, and CO300. Optimum N rate was applied for C200 and CO200, and 30% of chemical fertilizer was substituted with organic fertilizer for CO200 and CO300 with respect to C200 and C300, respectively. Rice season had higher runoff coefficients than wheat season. Approximately 52% of total N was lost as NH4+-N in rice season, ranging from 21 to 83%, and in wheat season, the proportion of NO3--N in total N averaged 53% with a variation from 38 to 67%. The N treatments lost less total N in rice season (1.67-10.7 kg N ha-1) than inwheat season (1.72-17.1 kg N ha(-1)). These suggested that a key to controlling N runoff losses from rice-wheat rotation was to limit NO3--N accumulation in wheat season. In both seasons, N runoff losses for C200 and CO300 were lower than those for C300. CO200 better cut N losses than C200 and CO300, with 64 and 57% less N in rice and wheat seasons than C300, respectively. Compared with the conventional practices, optimum N inputs integrated with co-application of organic and chemical fertilizers could reduce N runoff losses with a better N balance under rice-wheat rotation.

Characteristics of the overflow pollution of storm drains with inappropriate sewage entry	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												To probe the overflow pollution of separate storm drains with inappropriate sewage entries, in terms of the relationship between sewage entries and the corresponding dry-weather and wet-weather overflow, the monitoring activities were conducted in a storm drainage system in the Shanghai downtown area (374 ha). In this study site, samples from inappropriately entered dry-weather sewage and the overflow due to storm pumps operation on dry-weather and wet-weather days were collected and then monitored for six water quality constituents. It was found that overflow concentrations of dry-weather period could be higher than those of wet-weather period; under wetweather period, the overflow concentrations of stormdrains were close to or even higher than that of combined sewers. Relatively strong first flush mostly occurred under heavy rain that satisfied critical rainfall amount, maximum rainfall intensity, and maximum pumping discharge, while almost no first flush effect or only weak first flush effect was found for the other rainfall events. Such phenomenon was attributed to lower in-line pipe storage as compared to that of the combined sewers, and serious sediment accumulation within the storm pipes due to sewage entry. For this kind of system, treating a continuous overflow rate is a better strategy than treating the maximum amount of early part of the overflow. Correcting the key inappropriate sewage entries into storm drains should also be focused.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	5					4902	4915		10.1007/s11356-016-8145-4								WOS:000397007200058	27988901					
J	Wang, JQ; Song, YZ; Wang, GX				Wang, Jinqi; Song, Yuzhi; Wang, Guoxiang			Causes of large Potamogeton crispus L. population increase in Xuanwu Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In July 2005, the first outbreak of cyanobacterial blooms, dominated by Microcystis, occurred in Xuanwu Lake, Nanjing, upon which clay flocculation was adopted to control algal blooms. The cyanobacterial blooms were restrained, after which Potamogeton crispus appeared in November 2005 and spread rapidly in the whole lake. Since then, large populations of P. crispus have occurred in Xuanwu Lake annually in winter for the last 10 years. To determine the reasons for the occurrence of P. crispus populations in Xuanwu Lake during 2005-2006, water quality indices were monitored regularly. The data collected included dissolved oxygen, transparency, pH, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus content. Data analysis indicated that the transparency was improved by 179.5 % after clay flocculation, dissolved oxygen content increased by 24.1 %; total nitrogen and total phosphorus content decreased by 54.1 and 74.5 %, respectively, and pH fell from 9.1 to 8.7, all of which can be attributed to the emergency control measures for the cyanobacterial bloom. Data analysis also indicated that the improved water transparency after clay flocculation was the key factor in turion sprouting and seedling propagation of P. crispus. The ameliorative light intensity and favorable nutrient level all promoted the growth of seedlings of P. crispus and later quick colonization. It is suggested that ecological restoration of macrophytic and algal lakes be conducted by some physical or chemical means to improve transparency, reduce nutrient concentration, and adjust water pH, with the purpose of improving water quality for germination and growth of aquatic plants.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	6					5144	5151		10.1007/s11356-016-6514-7								WOS:000397013000007	27023812

A water crisis is marked by a severe shortage of water resources and deteriorating water quality. As an important component of water resources, lake water quality has deteriorated rapidly in the context of fast urbanization and climate change. This deterioration has altered the water ecosystem structure and influenced lake functionality. To curb these trends, various strategies and procedures have been used in many urban lakes. Among these procedures, accurate and responsive water environment monitoring is the basis of the forecasting and prevention of large-scale cyanobacteria outbreaks and improvement of water quality. To dynamically monitor and predict the outbreak of cyanobacteria in Dianchi Lake, in this study, wireless sensors networks (WSNs) and the geographic information system(GIS) are used tomonitor water quality at the macro-scale and meso-scale. Historical, real-time water quality and weather condition data were collected, and a combination prediction model (adaptive grey model (AGM) and back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN)) was proposed. The correlation coefficient (R) of the simulation experiment reached 0.995. Moreover, we conducted an empirical experiment in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan, China using the proposed method. R was 0.93, and the predicting error was 4.77. The results of the experiment suggest that our model has good performance for water quality prediction and can forecast cyanobacteria outbreaks. This system provides responsive forewarning and data support for lake protection and pollution control.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2017	24	6					5335	5348		10.1007/s11356-016-8155-2								WOS:000397013000025	28013462

In this study, the effect of hybrid membrane-activated carbon processes on the performance of nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane systems treating mixed oil and gas field produced water was investigated. Different pre-treatment alternatives including combinations of microfiltration unit and powdered activated carbon (PAC) or granular activated carbon (GAC) systems were applied prior to nanofiltration and reverse osmosis processes. RESULTS: The activated carbon process increased chemical oxygen demand (COD) and conductivity removal efficiencies due to the organic matter and ion adsorption capacity of activated carbon. PAC addition gave the best removal efficiencies for COD, whereas highest conductivity removals were obtained in studies with GAC addition. CONCLUSION: Differences obtained in the performance of different pre-treatment alternatives based on targeted pollutants and membrane characteristics confirmed synergetic/antagonistic effects between pre- and final membrane treatment.

The variability of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and food particles, estimated by the concentration of chlorophyll-a, was measured with in situ water-quality probes. Over a full seasonal cycle, oysters exposed to high-turbidity (HT) conditions exhibited a lower gillto- palp (G:P) ratio, compared with those exposed to low-turbidity (LT) conditions. Seasonal variations in the G: P ratio were observed at the LT site in relation to the spring phytoplanktonic bloom, but differed from those that had been observed previously. In fact, palp enlargement and gill narrowing (lower seasonal G:P ratio) suggest that oysters improved their pre-ingestive selection efficiency as a priority, rather than their filtering capacity. This result indicates that suspension-feeding bivalves do not have independent plastic responses of their foraging structures to either SPM quality or quantity, and that the direction of variations in the G:P ratio depends on the combination of these two factors. At the HT site, no seasonal pattern was observed in the G:P ratio. This can be explained by the strong hourly variations in SPM and chlorophyll-a, associated with tidal cycles, with daily variations that can be similar to those observed over a year. Reciprocal transplantations showed that oysters originating from the same site can differ in their feeding apparatus morphology when they grow in different environments and that temporal variations in the G:P ratio of oysters transplanted to a new environment converge towards that of individuals that have spent their entire life in this environment. Variations in the relative gill and palp sizes of C. gigas appear therefore to be partly the consequence of reversible phenotypic plasticity in response to spatial and temporal variations in SPM quantity and quality. The results also suggest that the limits and dynamics of gill and palp plasticity are dependent on the origin of oyster populations. Considering its role in the exploitation of different trophic conditions, and consequently in the biological performances (growth and reproduction), plasticity in the feeding apparatus morphology of C. gigas could be a determinant in the establishment of invasive populations in new ecosystems or in the management of farmed oysters.

Water Quality and Plankton Communities in Hybrid Catfish (female Channel Catfish, Ictalurus punctatus x male Blue Catfish, Ictalurus furcatus) Ponds After Partial Fish Harvest	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY												Twelve 0.4-ha ponds were stocked with 10,000 hybrid catfish fingerlings in March 2015. Six ponds were partially harvested in August to remove fish larger than similar to 0.57 kg. All remaining fish were removed in October and November. Partial harvest of faster-growing fish removed similar to 26% of the fish initially stocked; feeding rate (and therefore external nutrient loading) was reduced by about the same amount. However, reduced nutrient loading after partial fish harvest had nomeaningful effects on water quality, phytoplankton biomass, phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure, or supplemental aeration. Lack of ecosystem change was caused by persistent internal recycling of nutrients added to the system before partial harvest and continued high (albeit reduced) external nutrient loading after partial harvest. Decisions to employ partial fish harvest to manage single-cropped hybrid catfish ponds should be based on economic considerations and risk reduction rather than the expectation that fish biomass reduction will improve water quality.																	0893-8849	1749-7345				FEB	2017	48	1					46	56		10.1111/jwas.12348								WOS:000397021200005

In this research, three techniques, multilayer perceptron (MLP), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and generalized regression neural network (GRNN), are applied to determine the coagulant dosage at Bansong drinking WTP. Each model is developed based on 8,760 historical data sets with hourly resolution for a whole year. Several statistical properties are determined to obtain the best-fit model from each method. The top performing models of each method are evaluated by external validation indices and absolute relative error according to nine turbidity zones. From the result, MLP and ANFIS models meet all conditions of validation indices, but GRNN cannot. The MLP shows the best result for high turbidity zones over 20 NTU as well as for overall performance. Meanwhile, ANFIS provides consistent results and better performance than MLP for low turbidity zones which have higher disorder of coagulant dosage data. The GRNN shows high accuracy for the highest turbidity zone which occurs during the rainy season. It is concluded that MLP, ANFIS, and GRNN can support operators effectively for real-time determination of coagulant dosage.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				FEB	2017	66	1					49	61		10.2166/aqua.2016.022								WOS:000396920500005

This research is on the premise of meeting water demand, pressure and water quality considering the states of valve opening and closing, the states of pump opening and closing, and the pump speed as solution space. The optimization objectives are to minimize the network leakage and power consumption and to find the optimal valve closing scheme for network partitioning and the optimal pump scheduling scheme. NSGA-II algorithm is employed for solving the optimization problem. The obtained network partitioning and pumping scheduling solutions are applied to a real water network in Changping town, and the results prove that this method can simultaneously reduce the power consumption and network leakage.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				FEB	2017	66	1					62	74		10.2166/aqua.2016.034								WOS:000396920500006

In this survey. 13 induced polarisation profiles 500-800 m long and 26 magnetic profiles 400-800 m long were acquired. In addition, two boreholes were drilled to help in the interpretation of the geophysical data. The study was carried out with the aim of determining the risk posed by the waste deposit to the quality of the soil and the ground water system, which is the main potable water supply for the Secondary School, the University Teaching Hospital and the Veterinary School, situated within the catchment area of the site. Full-decay 2-D time-domain induced polarisation inversions in terms of Cole-Cole parameters were used for interpreting the induced polarisation data. The chargeability, resistivity and normalised chargeability distributions, together with the magnetic results, aided in a full characterisation of the site geology, the waste and the associated pollution plume. In particular, clear contrasts in resistivity and the polarisation parameters were found between the saprolite layer and the granitic bedrock, which are the main lithological units of the area. Furthermore, it was found that the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology waste deposit is characterised by a low-chargeability and low-resistivity signature and that the low-resistivity area spreads out from the waste deposit into the permeable saprolite layer, indicating the presence of a leachate plume. A fracture zone in the granitic bedrock beneath the waste deposit, which is a potential conduit for leachate contamination of the ground water system, was also identified. The study thus provides the information needed for assessing the future impact of the waste on the water quality in the area and for designing risk-mitigation actions.

The effect of stocking density ratio of fish on water plant productivity in aquaponics culture system. Nusantara Bioscience 8:xxxx. This study aims to determine the productivity of water plants at various stocking density ratios in the aquaponic culture system. This study is conducted experimentally using the Completely Randomized Design with the differences in the treatment of stocking density ratio, each repeated five times. The treatments of the stocking density ratio of both the catfish fry and the Nile tilapia fry include:A (75:75 fry/m(2)), B (100:50 fry/m(2), and C (125:25 fry/m2). The observed parameters are 1) plant productivity including measuring the growth of water spinach and growth rate, covering weight gain, stem length and number of leaves, and 2) water quality, including dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate and phosphate. The data of plant productivity is analyzed descriptively while the water quality is analyzed using ANOVA. The result of this study shows that the stocking density ratio significantly affects the productivity of water plants and the water quality of the media. The highest productivity of water spinach productivity occurs at the stocking density ratio of 75 catfish fry/m2:75 Nile tilapia fry m2, at which the average stem length is 59.14 cm, average number of leaves is 13.67, and the harvest weight is 465 g. Fish stocking density ratio also affects the quality of water, where the synergy between fish farming and water plant growing results in the better water quality compared to fish farming without water plant. The highest quality of water is achieved at the stocking density ratio of 100 catfish fry/m2:50 Nile tilapia fry/m(2).																	2087-3948	2087-3956				FEB	2017	9	1					31	35		10.13057/nusbiosci/n090106								WOS:000397250000006

This study aims to improve the water quality in Nile tilapia and catfish polyculture by applying the aquaponics system. The results show that several water quality parameters increase, such as dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and nitrate. Meanwhile, Orthophosphate tends to be similar both in aquaponics system and control. The study is conducted experimentally by using completely randomized design. The cultured fish are catfish and Nile tilapia while the aquatic plants are water spinach and lettuce. At the end of the study the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the aquaponics system ranges from 5.3 to 7.6 mg/L, while in the media control ranges from 4.2 to 4.3 mg/L. Average concentrations of ammonia, nitrate and orthophosphate in the aquaponics system range from 0.003 to 0.25 mg/L, 10.0 to 50.7 mg/L and 3.0 mg/L-5.0 mg/L respectively. Meanwhile, in media control, concentration of those three parameters are 0.003 to 0.35 mg/L, 10.0 to 60.0 mg/L and 3.0 to 5.0 mg/L respectively. Based on this study, it is concluded that the polyculture water quality can be improved through the application of the aquaponics system.																	2087-3948	2087-3956				FEB	2017	9	1					83	85		10.13057/nusbiosci/n090114								WOS:000397250000014						
J	Nhiwatiwa, T; Dalu, T				Nhiwatiwa, Tamuka; Dalu, Tatenda			Seasonal variation in pans in relation to limno-chemistry, size, hydroperiod, and river connectivity in a semi-arid subtropical region	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH												Seasonal pans are hydrologically dynamic, with significant changes in water volume and depth in response to high evaporation, infiltration rates and inundation events. Intra-seasonal and inter-seasonal changes in endorheic and floodplain pans in relation to limnology, size, hydroperiod, and river connectivity were studied over two rainfall seasons across 36 pans at the Save Valley Conservancy. In the study region, floodplain pans were identified as pans that had connectivity with the Save River, while the endorheic pans (large and small) were hydrologically isolated basins. Seasonal trends for physicochemical variables were initial low and gradual increased for both rainfall seasons. Significant interseasonal differences for several physico-chemical variables were observed. No significant differences in physico-chemical variables were observed between large and small endorheic pans, with the except for vegetation cover, which was higher in large pans. Floodplain pans differed from the endorheic systems in pH, conductivity, nutrients and suspended solids. Connectivity was found to be insignificant, as connections between these systems were probably too infrequent. Seasonal pans were uniquely distinguished by their morphometric, physico-chemical and hydrological characteristics. Inevitably, they are vulnerable to climate change with the extent of their resilience currently unknown. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Burgin, S				Burgin, Shelley			Indirect Consequences of Recreational Fishing in Freshwater Ecosystems: An Exploration from an Australian Perspective	SUSTAINABILITY												Recreational fishing in freshwater ecosystems is a popular pastime in Australia. Although most native fish are endemic, the fauna is depauperate compared to any landmass of similar size. With commercial fishing no longer a major industry in the country's freshwaters, the future sustainability of these ecosystems will depend heavily on the actions of recreational fishers. However, there has been limited focus on the consequences of recreational fishing in freshwaters. There is particularly a dearth of information on the indirect consequences of fishers on the waterbodies they depend on for their sport. After outlining the respective trends in commercial and recreational fishing in Australia as a basis for placing the sport in context, the indirect impacts of fishers on water quality, movement (walking, off-road vehicles), the introduction/translocation of fauna (particularly fish), the dispersal of flora and the transmission of fish disease and pathogens are reviewed. It is concluded that with the decline of commercial fishing, the competition between commercial fin-fishing and recreational fishing is negligible, at least throughout most of the country. It is also concluded that each of the issues addressed has the potential to be detrimental to the long-term sustainability of the freshwater ecosystems that the fishers depend on for their recreation. However, information on these issues is scant. This is despite the current and predicted popularity of freshwater recreational fishing continuing to increase in Australia. Indeed, there has been insufficient quantitative assessment of the impacts to even determine what is required to ensure a comprehensive, adequate and representative protection of these freshwater ecosystems. To underpin the sustainability of inland recreational fishing in the country, it was concluded that research is required to underpin the development and implementation of appropriate policies. The alternative is that the integrity and biodiversity loss of these ecosystems will ultimately result in their collapse before the indirect consequences of recreational fishing have been directly assessed and appropriately protected. However, the lack of protection of wetlands is not restricted to Australia; there is a deficit of freshwater protected areas worldwide.																	2071-1050					FEB	2017	9	2							280	10.3390/su9020280								WOS:000395590500122

A Framework for Building Efficient Environmental Permitting Processes	SUSTAINABILITY												Despite its importance as a tool for protecting air and water quality, and for mitigating impacts to protected species and ecosystems, the environmental permitting process is widely recognized to be inefficient and marked by delays. This article draws on a literature review and interviews with permitting practitioners to identify factors that contribute to delayed permit decisions. The sociopolitical context, projects that are complex or use novel technology, a fragmented and bureaucratic regulatory regime, serial permit applications and reviews, and applicant and permitting agency knowledge and resources each contribute to permitting inefficiency when they foster uncertainty, increase transaction costs, and allow divergent interests to multiply, yet remain unresolved. We then use the interviews to consider the potential of a collaborative dialogue between permitting agencies and applicants to mitigate these challenges, and argue that collaboration is well positioned to lessen permitting inefficiency.

In this study, a new total emission control (TEC) method was proposed with an emphasis on the concept of water environmentally sensitive areas (WESAs). This method was verified in Wujiang District and the techniques can be concluded in three steps: (1) a 1-D mathematical model for the study area was established and the model was calibrated using field measurement data; (2) based on an analysis of administrative planning and regulations, WESAs were identified as the main controlling objectives for emission control calculations. The weighting coefficient of local pollution sources was investigated to discuss the effectiveness of TEC on water quality improvement at WESAs; and (3) applying the river network mathematical model, water quality along the river segments was simulated under different pollution control plans. The results proved the effectiveness of TEC in the study area and indicated that a 14.6% reduction in the total amount of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), as well as a 31.1% reduction in the total amount of chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), was essential in order to meet the water quality standard in the WESAs.																	2071-1050					FEB	2017	9	2							301	10.3390/su9020301								WOS:000395590500143

This study evaluated the situation of fluoridation of public water supply in the city of Lages, of the State of Santa Catarina, systematizing data from 10 years of external control (2004-2013). Monthly, every other day, 67 water samples from 11 points of supply were collected, totaling 737 samples. To determine the fluoride concentration in the water samples, an electrometric method was used. After analysis, the samples were classified according to the criteria of Ordinance n 635/Bsd of 26/12/1975 (adequate or inadequate) and the criteria proposed by the Ministry of Health Collaborating Centre for Surveillance of Oral Health (CECOL) of the University of Sao Paulo (benefits and health risks of the population). Of the samples analyzed, 58.6% had adequate levels of fluoride and 51.1% had maximum benefit and low risk, according to each criterion. Of the inadequate samples of fluoride concentration, 34.7% stood at levels above 1.0 mg L-1 and 6.7% at low levels of fluoride in water (< 0.7 mg L-1). For CECOL criteria, 45% of the samples were characterized by moderate to very high risk of developing fluorosis (fluoride content between 0.95 and = 1.45 mg. L-1). It is recommended to adopt effective measures to ensure that the population ingests treated water quality, including appropriate levels of fluoride in the water and the maintenance of health surveillance by the Public Health authorities.																	2317-269X					FEB	2017	5	1					91	96		10.22239/2317-269X.00833								WOS:000397259500013

The results were submitted to multivariate data analysis. The principal component analysis of 12 variable medians (pH, conductivity, Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, ClO3-, NO3-, PO43-, SO42-) from 88 municipalities indicated Ibitinga as the locality with the public water supply having physicochemical characteristics unique in the region, characterized by higher relative concentrations of sulphate, chloride, lithium, and sodium, and higher values of pH and conductivity. Additionally, Ibitinga was the only municipality that systematically presented bromide in the water composition. A second principal component analysis on 79 samples of Ibitinga has indicated a sample with higher concentrations of chloride and sulphate, and 4 samples where the presence of nitrate was characteristic. Hierarchical cluster analysis exhibited the clustering of these groups produced in two component analysis. Validation of methods based on ion chromatography is also presented.

However, the sources of water used by this growing packaged water industry and the implications for water resource management and transport-related environmental impacts have not been described. This study aimed to assess the spatial distribution of regulated packaged water production in Ghana, both in relation to demand for natural mineral water and hydrogeological characteristics. A total of 764 addresses for premises licensed to produce packaged water from 2009 to 2015 were mapped and compared to regional sachet water consumption and examined beverage import/export data. We found evidence to suggest that packaged water is transported shorter distances in Ghana than in developed countries. Groundwater abstraction for packaged water is low relative to piped water production and domestic borehole abstraction nationally, but may be locally significant. For natural mineral water, producers should be able to address the most widespread water quality hazards (including high salinity, iron and nitrates) in aquifers used for production through reverse osmosis treatment. In future, packaged water producer surveys could be used to quantify unregulated production, volumes of piped versus groundwater abstracted and treatment processes used.

Changes in climate result in changes in streamflow and rising water temperatures, which impact biochemical reaction rates and increase stratification in lakes and reservoirs. Using two water quality modeling systems (the Hydrologic and Water Quality System; HAWQS and US Basins), five climate models, and two greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policies, we assess future water quality in the continental U.S. to 2100 considering four water quality parameters: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. Once these parameters are aggregated into a water quality index, we find that, while the water quality models differ under the baseline, there is more agreement between future projections. In addition, we find that the difference in national-scale economic benefits across climate models is generally larger than the difference between the two water quality models. Both water quality models find that water quality will more likely worsen in the East than in the West. Under the business-as-usual emissions scenario, we find that climate change is likely to cause economic impacts ranging from 1.2 to 2.3 (2005 billion USD/year) in 2050 and 2.7 to 4.8 in 2090 across all climate and water quality models.

Stormwater discharge into water bodies significantly contributes to environmental pollution. The choice of suitable treatment technologies is dependent on the pollutant concentrations. Wastewater quality indicators such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and total dissolved solids (TDS) give a measure of the main pollutants. The aim of this study is to provide an indirect methodology for the estimation of the main wastewater quality indicators, based on some characteristics of the drainage basin. The catchment is seen as a black box: the physical processes of accumulation, washing, and transport of pollutants are not mathematically described.Two models deriving from studies on artificial intelligence have been used in this research: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Regression Trees (RT). Both the models showed robustness, reliability, and high generalization capability. However, with reference to coefficient of determination R-2 and root-mean square error, Support Vector Regression showed a better performance than Regression Tree in predicting TSS, TDS, and COD. As regards BOD5, the two models showed a comparable performance. Therefore, the considered machine learning algorithms may be useful for providing an estimation of the values to be considered for the sizing of the treatment units in absence of direct measures.

In order to decrease clogging and increase system capacity, OCWD is testing the ability of riverbed filtration to reduce suspended solids concentrations and improve recharge rates. Riverbed filtration is achieved through a shallow subsurface collector system placed approximately one meter below the surface. Filtered water from the collector system is conveyed by gravity to the receiving recharge basin. Initial results show that riverbed filtration is highly effective in removing suspended solids in the recharge water, which in turn also greatly increases the recharge capacity of the receiving basin. Some other water quality benefits are also achieved. Data collected thus far indicate that it will be cost-effective to use this approach at a larger scale to capture and recharge increased quantities of storm flow obtained from the Santa Ana River.

J	Jeppesen, E; Sondergaard, M; Liu, ZW				Jeppesen, Erik; Sondergaard, Martin; Liu, Zhengwen			Lake Restoration and Management in a Climate Change Perspective: An Introduction	WATER												Lakes all around the globe are under severe pressure due to an increasing anthropogenic impact from a growing population in a more developed world. Accordingly, today, many lakes are highly eutrophic and suffer from severe blooms of often toxic cyanobacteria and may become even more eutrophic in the future unless strong lake management actions are taken. Recent research has further shown that global warming and subsequent changes in water use will further exacerbate the eutrophication process in lakes. There is therefore a growing demand for lake restoration and insight into sustainable lake management. The measures to be taken, however, depend on the climate and other local conditions. This special issue addresses lake restoration and management with special emphasis on the restoration of eutrophicated lakes within a climate change perspective. The papers included collectively highlight that the ongoing climate change affects lake water quality by (1) changes in external and internal nutrient loading; (2) higher frequency of extreme events (such as hurricanes); (3) temperature-induced changes in biota, biotic interactions; and (4) water level. Lower nutrient loading is therefore needed in a future warmer world to achieve the same ecological state as today. Several papers discuss lake restoration methods within a climate change perspective and show practical results, notably of various attempts of biomanipulation. Finally, some papers discuss the effects of other anthropogenic stressors and their interaction with climate.																	2073-4441					FEB	2017	9	2							122	10.3390/w9020122								WOS:000395435800052

A typical MAR procedure consists of the infiltration of surface water into a Quaternary glaciofluvial esker with subsequent withdrawal of the MAR treated water from wells a few hundred meters downstream. The infiltrated water should have a residence time of at least approximately one month before withdrawal to provide sufficient time for the subsurface processes needed to break down or remove humic substances. Most of the Finnish MAR plants do not have pretreatment and raw water is infiltrated directly into the soil. The objectives of this paper are to present MAR experiences and to discuss the need for and choice of pretreatment. Data from basin, sprinkling, and well infiltration processes are presented. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations of the raw waters presented here varied from 6.5 to 11 mg/L and after MAR the TOC concentrations of the abstracted waters were approximately 2 mg/L. The overall reduction of organic matter in the treatment (with or without pretreatment) was 70%-85%. Mechanical pretreatment can be used for clogging prevention. Turbidity of the Finnish lakes used as raw water does not necessitate pretreatment in basin and sprinkling infiltration, however, pretreatment in well infiltration needs to be judged separately. River waters may have high turbidity requiring pretreatment. Biodegradation of NOM in the saturated groundwater zone consumes dissolved oxygen. Thus, a high NOM concentration may create conditions for dissolution of iron and manganese from the soil. These conditions may be avoided by the addition of chemical pretreatment. Raw waters with TOC content up to at least approximately 8 mg/L were infiltrated without any considerations of chemical pretreatment, which should be evaluated based on local conditions.																	2073-4441					FEB	2017	9	2							138	10.3390/w9020138								WOS:000395435800068

However, they do not always achieve the intended strategic goals. This paper analyzes how managerial styles interact with sophisticated management information systems to achieve different water strategic priorities. How proactive vs. reactive managerial styles moderate the effects of management information systems on water cost saving and water quality enhancement is analyzed. Relationships are explored using data collected from 122 general services directors in Spanish public hospitals. The findings show a positive effect of sophisticated management information systems on the achievement of water policies focused on cost saving and quality enhancement. Results also show a different moderated effect of managerial styles; thus, sophisticated management information systems with a proactive managerial style facilitate managers to achieve better water quality policies rather than water cost saving policies.																	2073-4441					FEB	2017	9	2							UNSP 107	10.3390/w9020107								WOS:000395435800037						
J	Rosen, T; Christianson, L				Rosen, Timothy; Christianson, Laura			Performance of Denitrifying Bioreactors at Reducing Agricultural Nitrogen Pollution in a Humid Subtropical Coastal Plain Climate	WATER												Denitrifying bioreactors are an agricultural best management practice developed in the midwestern United States to treat agricultural drainage water enriched with nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N). The practice is spreading rapidly to agricultural regions with poor water quality due to nutrient enrichment. This makes it imperative to track bioreactor NO3-N reduction efficiency as this practice gets deployed to new regions. This study evaluated the application and performance of denitrifying bioreactors in the humid subtropical coastal plain environment of the Chesapeake Bay catchment to provide data about regionally specific NO3-N reduction efficiencies. NO3-N samples were taken before and after treatment at three denitrifying bioreactors, in addition to other nutrients (orthophosphate-phosphorus, PO4-P; ammonium-nitrogen, NH4-N; total nitrogen, TN; total phosphorus, TP) and water quality parameters (dissolved oxygen, DO; oxidation reduction potential, ORP; pH; specific conductance, SPC). Total removal ranged drastically between bioreactors from 10 to 133 kg N, with removal efficiencies of 9.0% to 62% and N removal rates of 0.21 to 5.36 g N removed per m(3) of bioreactor per day. As the first bioreactor study in the humid subtropical coastal plain, this data provides positive proof of concept that denitrifying bioreactor is another tool for reducing N loads in agricultural tile drainage in this region.																	2073-4441					FEB	2017	9	2							112	10.3390/w9020112								WOS:000395435800042

Future predictions of oxygen deficits are paramount for maintaining water quality. Oxygen demands depend greatly on a waterbody's attributes. A large sediment-water interface relative to volume means sediment oxygen demand has greater influence in shallow systems. In shallow, ice-covered waterbodies the potential for winter anoxia is high. Water quality models offer two options for modelling sediment oxygen demand: a zero-order constant rate, or a sediment diagenesis model. The constant rate is unrepresentative of a real system, yet a diagenesis model is difficult to parameterise and calibrate without data. We use the water quality model CE-QUAL-W2 to increase the complexity of a zero-order sediment compartment with limited data. We model summer and winter conditions individually to capture decay rates under-ice. Using a semi-automated calibration method, we find an annual pattern in sediment oxygen demand that follows the trend of chlorophyll-a concentrations in a shallow, eutrophic Prairie reservoir. We use chlorophyll-a as a proxy for estimation of summer oxygen demand and winter decay. We show that winter sediment oxygen demand is dependent on the previous summer's maximum chlorophyll-a concentrations.

The main objective of the present paper is to estimate the total NO3 flux to coastal water bodies due to groundwater discharge in the volcanic Azores archipelago (Portugal). Therefore, 78 springs discharging from perched-water bodies have been monitored since 2003, corresponding to cold (mean = 14.9 degrees C) and low mineralized (47.2-583 mu S/cm) groundwater from the sodium-bicarbonate to sodium-chloride water types. A set of 36 wells was also monitored, presenting groundwater with a higher mineralization. The nitrate content in springs range between 0.02 and 37.4 mg/L, and the most enriched samples are associated to the impact of agricultural activities. The total groundwater NO3 flux to the ocean is estimated in the range of 5.23 x 10(3) to 190.6 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/a (Sigma = similar to 523 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/a), exceeding the total flux associated to surface runoff (Sigma = similar to 281 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/a). In the majority of the islands, the estimated fluxes are higher than runoff fluxes, with the exception of Pico (47.2%), Corvo (46%) and Faial (7.2%). The total N-NO3 flux estimated in the Azores (similar to 118.9 x 10(3) mol/km(2)/a) is in the lower range of estimates made in other volcanic islands.

This article presents results of studies on three granular mixtures were used for remediation of lead (Pb2+) contaminated groundwater using PRBs. The mixtures were composed of pumice, perlite and lime in different proportions. Several column experiments were conducted for evaluation of performance of the mixtures for lead removal. The experiments were carried out for over 50 days to evaluate the long-term performance of the PRBs. It was found out that pumice-perlite mixture with a weight proportion of 1 : 1 and pumice-lime perlite mixture with a weight proportion of 2 : 2 : 1 can be used as effective reactive media for lead removal. The removal efficiency of the proposed mixtures was 99.9%. The permeability of the reactive media was relatively constant over 53 days continuous experiments and the results demonstrated that the mentioned mixtures have acceptable performance to maintain hydraulic conductivity of PRBs.

Testing is commonly used to verify the quality, safety, reliability, efficiency, and environmental sustainability of products and services. In Brazil, the National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (Inmetro) is responsible for accrediting the facilities that undertake testing and calibration activities. Typical accredited testing services include: water quality, clinical tests, emissions tests, and vehicle safety tests. Undertaking fraudulent behavior when testing processes can result in products that are dangerous to the ordinary citizen and to the environment. Further, fraudulent behavior produces unfair competition between concurrent organizations. This paper presents a method to detect possible fraudulent behavior in accredited testing facilities. The proposed technique combines the bootstrap method and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, to investigate several fraudulent aspects at once. To validate the proposed method, we use a Brazilian real-world dataset with real cases of fraud. The proposed technique successfully detects the accredited testing facilities with fraudulent behavior.																	0949-1775	1432-0517				FEB	2017	22	1					21	27		10.1007/s00769-016-1245-5								WOS:000394450300002						
J	Sen, ZK; As-Sefry, S; Al-Harithy, S				Sen, Zekai; As-Sefry, Saleh; Al-Harithy, Saad			Strategic management of groundwater resources in the Arabian Peninsula: Wadi Na'man case	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Groundwater resources management in arid regions needs a special considerations, where each stage is affected by a wide variety of technical, social, and economic considerations, and therefore, in an integrated analysis, the foundation stone is the strategic planning, which should include ingredients of basic field data and their simple interpretations, identification of relevant parameters, sub-regions of water priority, and risk assessments. In arid regions, Quaternary deposit aquifer potentiality within any catchment (wadi) is partitioned into subdivisions for strategic planning according to rainfall pattern, morphology, geology, recharge features, and water quality. The climatologic, hydrologic, morphologic, geophysical, and hydrogeological factors combined together lead to a proper assessment of the water availability, abstractability, and recharge possibility in the area. In this paper, rather than deterministic classical approaches, uncertainty in the nature of different factors is explored during the assessment through simple risk concepts. Hence, each key factor (storativity, transmissivity porosity, saturation, and unsaturation thicknesses) is attached with respective risk values leading to groundwater volume calculations. The scenarios of possible strategic groundwater resources management are given on the human population and time bases. The application is presented for one of the major wadis, Wadi Na'man, in the central western part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				FEB	2017	10	3							50	10.1007/s12517-016-2824-9								WOS:000394012200001						
J	Thulsiraj, V; Zimmer-Faust, AG; Jay, JA				Thulsiraj, Vanessa; Zimmer-Faust, Amity G.; Jay, Jennifer A.			Use of Viability-Based Methods for Improved Detection of Recent Fecal Contamination in a Microbial Source Tracking Study Near Tijuana, Mexico	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Current microbial source tracking methods heavily rely on the use of quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays to differentiate human and non-human sources of fecal contamination. However, traditional qPCR measures DNA from viable, viable but not culturable (VBNC), and dead cells, which may confound the use of this technique for detecting recent fecal contamination from waters receiving treated sewage effluent. In this study, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), six host-associated markers, and two viability-based methods for rapid detection and assessment of fecal contamination were used in a microbial source tracking study to identify sources impairing water quality and sediments within the San Antonio de los Buenos watershed in Tijuana, Mexico. Horse- and gull-associated markers were detected in 4 and 8% of samples tested, respectively. The human-and dog-associated markers were positive in 74 and 63% of watershed samples and 92 and 75% of storm drain samples, respectively. Propidium monoazide (PMA) successfully inhibited amplification of DNA from dead cells in environmental creek waters that receive large volumes of treated waste-water effluent. Accordingly, PMA-qPCR measurements were more comparable to measurements made by culture-based methods (IDEXX). The covalently linked immunomagnetic separation/adenosine triphosphate (Cov-IMS/ATP) method showed a strong linear relationship to culture methods when compared to measurements made by the qPCR Entero1a assay. Both the PMA-qPCR and the Cov-IMS/ATP methods show promise for improved assessment of water quality and recent fecal contamination in sewage impacted waters, including areas receiving discharge from wastewater treatment plants, where measurement by qPCR does not effectively differentiate between DNA from live and dead cells. This study serves as an important positive control for non-point source pollution studies.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2017	228	2							63	10.1007/s11270-016-3204-5								WOS:000394351400011

Baseline Monitoring of Mercury Levels in Environmental Matrices in the Limpopo Province	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Mercury (Hg) speciation and bioavailability were studied in surface water, surface sediment and freshwater fish samples collected upstream and downstream of the Medupi (currently under construction) and Matimba power stations in the Waterberg area, Limpopo Province. The initial survey was conducted in May 2010 and continued periodically/seasonally until October 2014. This study was designed to provide an overall description of the levels of Hg in areas potentially impacted by emissions from the coal-fired power station and provide the necessary information to enhance the understanding of the factors regulating the fate and transport of Hg in the environment. Percent loss on ignition (LOI) and ancillary water quality measurements were also carried out. In this study, the total mercury (TotHg) concentrations ranged between 0.92 and 29.13 ng/L, and 0.13 and 8.00 ng/L for methylmercury (MeHg) in water. Total Hg concentrations ranged between 0.50 and 28.60 ng/g, while the MeHg concentration ranged between 0.08 and 2.22 ng/g in sediments. Mercury concentrations in fish ranged between 40 and 1200 ng/g for TotHg, and 13.42 and 600 ng/g for MeHg. Methylmercury concentrations in freshwater fish sampled exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency criteria (300 ng/g) in 10% of the total fish sampled and 5% exceeded the WHO guideline (500 ng/g).																	0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2017	228	2							57	10.1007/s11270-016-3230-3								WOS:000394351400005

In this study, decomposition of emergent aquatic plant (cattail) litter was investigated under different conditions to determine the influencing level of the decomposition process on the water quality. Different litter addition rates (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 g L-1), temperature changes, sediment additions, and kinestates (static and dynamic conditions) were selected as the influencing factors for the decomposition process. The results suggested that the decomposition process could be all accelerated when conducted at a higher litter addition rate, under a cold condition, with sediment addition or on dynamic condition, respectively. Additionally, the maximum ratio of releasing carbon to nitrogen (C/N) was increased when the decomposition process was conducted with a higher litter addition rate, under a cold condition (31.0), with sediment addition (24.6) and on a dynamic condition (28.0), respectively, and the C/N ratios were all higher than that with only 0.5 g L-1 litter addition (24.5), suggesting that lowering of water temperature, sediment addition, and increasing of oxygen might also enhance the C/N. The high C/N released during the decomposition process implied that the cattail litter might be utilized as the potential organic carbon source for nitrogen removal in the CW system.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2017	228	2							70	10.1007/s11270-017-3257-0								WOS:000394351400018						
J	Pierce, G; Gonzalez, S				Pierce, Gregory; Gonzalez, Silvia			Mistrust at the tap? Factors contributing to public drinking water (mis) perception across US households	WATER POLICY												How individuals perceive the safety of their public drinking water influences whether they reach for the tap to quench their thirst, or an alternative such as bottled water or a sugary drink. In turn, mistrust of drinking water quality and subsequent reliance on alternative beverage sources can adversely impact health, welfare and the environment. Using data from the 2013 American Housing Survey, we provide the first national, rigorous assessment of individuals' perception of their public drinking water supply. We found strong evidence that perception of water quality is most influenced by individual and household indicators of socioeconomic status-education level, household income, racial or ethnic minority status, and most importantly foreign-born nativity, especially from Latin America. By contrast, our findings provide little indication that perception is tied to known built environment or neighborhood risk factors affecting water safety and quality. We outline the implications of our findings for proponents of enhanced tap water consumption, including public drinking water systems, county public health agencies, and particularly for environmental justice non-profits.																	1366-7017					FEB	2017	19	1					1	12		10.2166/wp.2016.143								WOS:000394341200001

Although approximately 71% of the world is covered in water, only 2.5% of this is fresh water; hence, fresh water is a valuable resource that must be carefully monitored and maintained. In developing countries, 80% of people are without access to potable water. Cholera is still reported in more than 50 countries. In Africa, 75% of the drinking water comes from underground sources, which makes water monitoring an issue of key concern, as water monitoring can be used to track water quality changes over time, identify existing or emerging problems, and design effective intervention programs to remedy water pollution. It is important to have detailed knowledge of potable water quality to enable proper treatment and also prevent contamination. In this article, we review methods for water quality monitoring (WQM) from traditional manual methods to more technologically advanced methods employing wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for in situ WQM. In particular, we highlight recent developments in the sensor devices, data acquisition procedures, communication and network architectures, and power management schemes to maintain a long-lived operational WQM system. Finally, we discuss open issues that need to be addressed to further advance automatic WQM using WSNs.

The incineration process can concentrate metals in the incineration slags deposited in landfills. Emitted leachates contain a myriad of salts and metals; some of them in (nano) particulate form. In this study we collected the leachate from a Swiss landfill for municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) residues along with the slags deposited at this site (waste incineration bottom ashes and fly ash, sewage sludge incineration bottom ash) from which simulated leachates were prepared. Basic water quality analysis (pH, DOC, TSS, major ions) and natural, incidental or engineered particles suspended in the leachate were characterized by NanoSight (for general size range), serial filtration with ICP-MS analysis for element specific particle size quantification and TEM/EDX to visualize particle morphology and composition. Special priority was given to those elements that have engineered nanoparticulate counterparts (Ti, Zn, Ag, Cu, Fe and Ce) to give an indication of 1) the current concentration and form of these particles emitted from the landfill, 2) the potential presence of engineered nanoparticles already in the samples, and 3) trends in particle size (change) in the leachate from different slags to provide an indication on particle mobility. Zn, Ag, and Cu had appreciable concentrations associated with small particulate matter (nano and 0.1-0.45 mu m size fractions) in natural and laboratory prepared leachates, while Ti (nano) particles were most abundant in the landfill leachate. Multiple sampling dates suggested relatively steady particulate matter in the leachate for most elements, but analysis of differently aged bottom ash slags from municipal waste revealed differences with age, indicating the influence of slag weathering in metal mobilization. MSWI residues are inherently a complex mixture of stable and unstable materials that are subject to continuous and dynamic changes over time. Therefore, in this manuscript we placed an emphasis on understanding the geochemical processes that are associated with MSWI residue weathering and how this may dictate the likelihood of particulate metals leaching into groundwater.

The Jian River and Chaobai River are two reclaimed water intake areas which have elevated pH. This elevated pH has a marked effect on both the phytoplankton, species in water and vegetation on the shore. Understanding the main reasons causing pH elevation in river water has important implications for river ecosystem management and the improvement of water quality and can provide a theoretical basis for the direction of water quality improvement. For this reason, each biogeochemical and physical process influencing pH changes in water was quantified along the flow direction in the Wenyu to Chaobai reclaimed water diversion project, in which proton consumption and production by such processes were monitored and calculated at five monitoring sections. The calculations indicated that photosynthesis and denitrification were the primary reasons for the increase of pH in the Jian River and Chaobai River. Oppositely, carbonate precipitation and sediment decomposition restricted the increase of pH in both rivers. In addition, CO2 emission to the air also promoted a increase of pH in the Jian River, while CO2 absorption from the air restricted the increase of pH in the Chaobai River. NO3- nitrogen in reclaimed water was not efficiently removed and the reclaimed water flow condition in the intake area created favorable conditions for photosynthesis of algae breeding and denitrification by microorganisms. Therefore, biogeochemical and physical processes that promoted the increase of pH were greater than inhibiting processes and the pH gradually increased along the flow direction. The contribution rates of photosynthesis and denitrification for the increase of pH were 55.48 and 27.09%, respectively, in the Jian River and 78.08 and 21.92%, respectively, in the Chaobai River. In addition, CO2 emission contributed 17.43% of the increase in pH in the Jian River.

Hans			Macroporous Carbon Supported Zerovalent Iron for Remediation of Trichloroethylene	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING												Groundwater contamination with chlorinated hydrocarbons has become a widespread problem that threatens water quality and human health. Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs), which employ zerovalent iron, are effective for remediation; however, a need exists to reduce the economic and environmental costs associated with constructing PRBs. We present a method to produce zerovalent iron supported on macroporous carbon using only lignin and magnetite. Biochar-ZVI (BC-ZVI) produced by this method exhibits a broad pore size distribution with micrometer sized ZVI phases dispersed throughout a carbon matrix. X-ray diffraction revealed that pyrolysis at 900 degrees C of a 50/50 lignin-magnetite mixture resulted in almost complete reduction of magnetite to ZVI and that compression molding promotes iron reduction in pyrolysis due to mixing of starting materials. High temperature pyrolysis of lignin yields some graphite in BC-ZVI due to reduction of carbonaceous gases on iron oxides. TCE was removed from water as it passed through a column packed with BC-ZVI at flow rates representative of average and high groundwater flow. One-dimensional convection-dispersion modeling revealed that adsorption by biochar influences TCE transport and that BC-ZVI facilitated removal of TCE from contaminated water by both adsorption and degradation.

Gender discrimination is easy because males have yellow, females have blue colors and their spawning efficiency is good. Cichlid producers prefer kenyi cichlids in recent years due to reproduction performance and coloring of kenyi. In this study, effects of Spirulina-based diet and feeding frequency on coloration, seed production, growth and survival on kenyi cichlids (Maylandia lombardoi) were investigated for 112 days. The study was carried out in a recirculating system which has 100 L each tank and 12 fiberglass tanks with three replicates. Ten fish (3 months old, mean body weight 2.00 +/- 0.05 g and mean total length 4.51 +/- 0.42 cm) were randomly placed in each tank. Experimental groups were designed with commercial granule (C) and commercial granule Spirulina (S) feeds. In the present study, two feeding frequencies were applied: one feeding daily at 09:00 (namely C1, S1) and three times daily at 09:00, 12:00 and 17:00 (namely C3, S3). The growth and seed production of cichlid fed three times daily were significantly higher compared to fish fed one feeding daily, irrespective of feed source (P < 0.05). Moreover, the specific growth rate of cichlid fed Spirulina-based diet was significantly elevated compared to fish fed non-Spirulina-based diet. The Spirulina-based diets affected skin coloration giving a bluish hue and a typical chroma values for the females of kenyi cichlid. In conclusion, growth performance, seed production and skin coloration of kenyi cichlid fed Spirulina diets three times daily enhanced under the study condition.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				FEB	2017	25	1					121	134		10.1007/s10499-016-0017-x								WOS:000394249000009

The study was conducted with three treatments: (1) PR-propeller aspirator pump aerator; (2) VP-vertical pump aerator; and (3) BL-diffused air blower. The study was performed in a greenhouse with nine 35,000-L rectangular tanks. Water quality parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, settleable and suspended solids) were measured along the 33 experimental days. Moreover, samples were collected to quantify the microorganisms present in the tanks. At the end of the study, samples of the biofloc of each tank were collected to proximal analysis. Throughout the experiment, the temperature, pH, salinity and alkalinity were maintained within the recommended levels for L. vannamei. The propeller treatment showed a concentration of total ammonia above the recommended levels and lower densities of ciliates and flagellates, most likely because of inadequate biofloc formation in this treatment. The final weight was higher in the blower and propeller treatments. However, survival was lower in the propeller treatment compared to the other treatments. The results of this study suggest that diffused air systems (air blower) improve the formation of biofloc and growth performance of L. vannamei.

In the ornamental Siamese fighting fish business, stress is one of the major causes of fish injury, including collapse of the fins. To overcome this problem, attempts are being made to develop anaesthetic packaging, in which anaesthetic agents are coated onto low-density polyethylene (LDPE) packaging bags and released from the bags. The feasibility of using clove oil-incorporated methylcellulose-coated LDPE bag as a packaging material to induce an anaesthetic effect on Siamese fighting fish during transportation was also investigated. Based on a criterion of fish transportation within 2 days, concentrations of clove oil in anaesthetic-coated LDPE bag ranging from 0 to 11.67 mg L-1 were determined using an aqueous dilution method. Clove oil-incorporated methylcellulose-coated LDPE bags, filled with either 150 or 75 mL water and with equivalent anaesthetic concentrations, induced an anaesthetic effect in a similar manner. After 48 h of fish exposure, the water quality in clove oil-incorporated methylcellulose-coated LDPE bags was better than that of the control treatment. This study demonstrated that clove oil-incorporated methylcellulose-coated LDPE packaging bag could be successfully employed for transportation of Siamese fighting fish; in turn, this will minimize a dropped price when reaching the destination.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				FEB	2017	25	1					197	209		10.1007/s10499-016-0022-0								WOS:000394249000014

The proposed model was applied to 60 sites located in three reservoirs in the Paraiba river basin, Brazilian semi-arid region. Collections were made in December 2011. In each site, we collected one sample of benthic macroinvertebrates and one water sample for the determination of physical and chemical parameters. Characterization of the landscape was made through application of 10 physical habitat protocols on each site for the collected information on disturbance and subsequent calculation of disturbance metrics. The results showed the formation of two groups: group 1, consisting of 16 minimally altered sites, and group 2, with 44 severely altered sites. The proposed statistical model was sensitive enough to detect changes. In the minimally altered group, the Chironomids Aedokritus and Fissimentum were dominant, indicating a higher environmental quality, while Coelotanypus and Chironomus were abundant in severely altered sites with lower environmental quality. The conservation and management of reservoirs in semi-arid regions should be intensified in view of the need to maintain the environmental quality of these ecosystems.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2017	189	2							65	10.1007/s10661-016-5723-3								WOS:000393645800020	28110450

Concentrations of select dissolved trace elements and anthropogenic organic compounds in the Mississippi River and major tributaries during the summer of 2012 and 2013	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Mississippi River drainage basin includes the Illinois, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas rivers. These rivers drain areas with different physiography, population centers, and land use, with each contributing a different suites of metals and wastewater contaminants that can affect water quality. In July 2012, we determined 18 elements (Be, Rb, Sr, Cd, Cs, Ba, Tl, Pb, Mg, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the five major tributaries and in the Upper Mississippi River. The following summer, we determined both trace elements and 25 trace organic compounds at 10 sites in a longitudinal study of the main stem of the Mississippi River from Grafton, Illinois to Natchez, Mississippi. We detected wastewater contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds, throughout the river system, with the highest concentrations occurring near urban centers (St. Louis and Memphis). Concentrations were highest for atrazine (673 ng L-1), DEET (540 ng L-1), TCPP (231 ng L-1), and caffeine (202 ng L-1). The Illinois, Missouri, and Yazoo rivers, which drain areas with intense agriculture, had relatively high concentrations of Chl-a and atrazine. However, the Ohio River delivered higher loads of contaminants to the Mississippi River, including an estimated 177 kg day(-1) of atrazine, due to higher flow volumes. Concentrations of heavy metals (Ni, V, Co, Cu, Cd, and Zn) were relatively high in the Illinois River and low in the Ohio River, although dissolved metal concentrations were below US EPA maximum contaminant levels for surface water. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the rivers can be distinguished based on elemental and contaminant profiles.

J	Karikari-Yeboah, O; Addai-Mensah, J				Karikari-Yeboah, Ohene; Addai-Mensah, Jonas			Assessing the impact of preload on pyrite-rich sediment and groundwater quality	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Pyrite-rich sediments would, invariably, undergo redox reactions which would lead to acidic aqueous environment containing solubilized toxic metal species. When such sediments are subjected to preload, a technique employed by geotechnical engineers to improve the load-bearing capacity of highly compressible formation, transient flow of pore water, accompanied by acidity transfer, would occur as a response. Despite the concomitant environmental and socio-economic significance, to date, there has been limited interdisciplinary research on the underpinning geotechnical engineering and geo-environmental science issues for pyrite-rich sediments under preload. In this study, we investigate the effect of pyrite-rich sediment pore water transfer under preload surcharge on the receiving environment and the impact on the groundwater speciation and quality. Sediment samples were obtained at close depth intervals from boreholes established within pristine areas and those subjected to the preload application. Soil and pore water samples were subjected to solid/solution speciation, moisture contents, soil pH and the Atterberg Limits' analyses using standard analytical techniques and methods. Standpipes were also installed in the boreholes for groundwater sampling and in situ monitoring of water quality parameters. It is shown that the imposition of preload surcharge over pyritic sediment created a reducing environment rich in SO42-, iron oxide minerals and organic matter. This reducing environment fostered organic carbon catabolism to generate excess pyrite and bicarbonate alkalinity, which would invariably impact adversely on soil quality and plant growth. These were accompanied by increase in pH, dissolved Al, Ca, Mg and K species beneath the surcharge.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2017	189	2							58	10.1007/s10661-017-5771-3								WOS:000393645800013	28091885

Assessment of environmental loads of Cu and Zn from intensive inland shrimp aquaculture	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												An experiment was developed to simulate inland shrimp farming using diluted seawater (1.9 g L-1) containing 75 shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei) per square meter during a growth cycle of 120 days. In this study, the environmental loads of copper and zinc were estimated and compared to anthropogenic sources and shrimp aquacultures in other locations. Both metals resulted primarily from feeding, which accounted for 91.8% of Cu and 97.0% of Zn. Concentrations of Cu (110.8 +/- 11.8 mu g g(-1)) and Zn (69.0 +/- 0.7 mu g g(-1)) measured in the harvested shrimp had higher Cu and lower Zn concentrations compared to those reported for farmed shrimp from Brazil and Mexico. Clearly, organic sludge was the main route of removal for both metals (Cu 46.2%; Zn 92.6%). The annual environmental loads estimated for inland shrimp aquaculture were 598 +/- 74 g Cu ha(-1) and 5080 +/- 328 g Zn ha(-1).																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2017	189	2							69	10.1007/s10661-017-5783-z								WOS:000393645800024	28116601

However, emerging evidence points toward hyporheic exchange between sediment pore water and the overlying water column during baseflow periods as a source of FIOs is surface waters. The objective of this work was to (a) propose a mass balance-based technique for estimating changes of FIO concentrations in the same volume of water (or "slug") from the inlet to outlet of stream reaches in baseflow conditions and (b) to use such enumeration to estimate rate of the FIO release to stream water column. Concentrations of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and enterococci were measured in the slug while simultaneously monitoring the movement of a conservative tracer, Br that labeled the slug. Concentrations of E. coli in the slug were significantly larger (P = 0.035, P = 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively) at the outlet reach in all three replications, while enterococci concentrations were significantly larger in two of three replications (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.602). When estimated without accounting for die-off in water column, FIO net release rates across replications ranged from 36 to 57 cells m(-2) s(-1) and 43 to 87 cells m(-2) s(-1) for E. coli and enterococci, respectively. These release rates were 5 to 20% higher when the die-off in water column was taken into account. No diurnal trends were observed in indicator concentrations. No FIO sources other than bottom sediment have been observed during the baseflow period. FIOs are released into stream water column through hyporheic exchange during baseflow periods.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2017	189	2							51	10.1007/s10661-016-5763-8								WOS:000393645800006	28063117

Use of macroinvertebrate assemblages for assessing performance of stabilization ponds treating effluents from sugarcane and molasses processing	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Wastewater discharge from sugarcane processing is a significant pollutant of tropical aquatic ecosystems. For most developing countries, monitoring of the level of pollutants is done mostly through chemical analysis, but this does not reflect potential impacts on aquatic assemblages. In addition, laboratory facilities for accurate concentration measurements are often not available for regular monitoring programs. In this study, we investigated the use of benthic macroinvertebrates for biological monitoring in western Kenya. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled in stabilization ponds treating wastewater from sugarcane- and molassesbased processing plants to assess their composition and abundance in relation to different concentrations of chemical variables. Optimum concentrations and tolerance values were identified for various taxa, and a biotic index was developed that combined tolerance values (ranked between 0 and 10) for the various macroinvertebrate taxa. A succession in composition and distribution of macroinvertebrate taxa was observed from the inlet to the outlet of the pond systems. Diptera dominated in the first ponds that had high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and nutrients, while intolerant Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) appeared as the concentrations dropped in subsequent ponds. The effluent quality was classified as "good","fair," and "poor," corresponding with biotic index value ranges 0-3.50, 3.51-6.50, and 6.51-10, respectively. During validation, the index grouped sites with respect to levels of measured environmental variables. The study revealed that the developed biotic index would help in monitoring the quality of sugarcane processing and molasses effluents before release into recipient aquatic ecosystems, replacing the need for costly chemical analyses.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2017	189	2							79	10.1007/s10661-017-5786-9								WOS:000393645800034	28120206

Modeling anthropogenic boron in groundwater flow and discharge at Volusia Blue Spring (Florida, USA)	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Volusia Blue Spring (VBS) is the largest spring along the St. Johns River in Florida (USA) and the spring pool is refuge for hundreds of manatees during winter months. However, the water quality of the spring flow has been degraded due to urbanization in the past few decades. A three-dimensional contaminant fate and transport model, utilizing MODFLOW-2000 and MT3DMS, was developed to simulate boron transport in the Upper Florida Aquifer, which sustains the VBS spring discharge. The VBS model relied on information and data related to natural water features, rainfall, land use, water use, treated wastewater discharge, septic tank effluent flows, and fertilizers as inputs to simulate boron transport. The model was calibrated against field-observed water levels, spring discharge, and analysis of boron in water samples. The calibrated VBS model yielded a root-mean-square-error value of 1.8 m for the head and 17.7 mu g/L for boron concentrations within the springshed. Model results show that anthropogenic boron from surrounding urbanized areas contributes to the boron found at Volusia Blue Spring.

J	Roberts, PJW; Villegas, B				Roberts, Philip J. W.; Villegas, Beatriz			Modeling and Design of the Buenos Aires Outfalls	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING												Field studies, modeling, and the design of two major outfalls to discharge domestic wastewater from Buenos Aires, Argentina, into the Rio de la Plata are described. Extensive data were gathered from current profilers, Lagrangian drifters, meteorological stations, and water column profiling. The river is essentially freshwater and is the main water source for the city; it is tidally dominated, shallow, and well-mixed vertically. The data were used to develop a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of the river that closely simulated its major features. The wastewater disposal strategy and special design and modeling considerations of the outfalls and diffusers are discussed. The tidal currents will recirculate the wastewater back and forth over the diffuser several times before it is flushed away by the mean river flow. Because of the shallow water and low flushing currents, it is not possible to achieve the high near-field dilutions typical of deep-water marine outfalls, and other design constraints include the proximity to water intakes. Lagrangian particle-tracking modeling approaches were used to predict the fate and transport of the effluent and its dilution. The models reproduce near-field mixing at moderate to high current speeds and also reentrainment due to the reversing tide without the need for special model coupling. However, dilutions at low current speeds were corrected to account for the jet momentum and reentrainment. The near-field jet modeling to determine the riser and port designs is discussed. Bacterial impacts decreased rapidly with distance from the diffuser and no impacts on the shoreline or water intakes were predicted. The effects of sudestadas were also modeled and it was concluded that they will not significantly affect water quality for the proposed outfalls.																	0733-9429	1943-7900				FEB	2017	143	2								10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0001244								WOS:000394256200007

The spatial distribution, sources and ecological risk assessment for Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd), Chromium (Cr), Copper (Cu), Nickel (Ni), Lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn) were analyzed in this study. The results showed all tested metals had similar distribution patterns except Ni and Cr, with areas of high concentrations distributed in the southwest (WLFZ and watershed outlet) of the study area. Ni and Cr, which were highly positively correlated and present in high concentrations, were primarily distributed in the south and middle zones of the study area. Lower concentration areas of all metals were uniformly distributed west of the high-elevation zones and forest land. Factor analysis (FA) and factor analysis-multiple linear regression (FA-MLR) showed that the major sources of Cd were fertilizer and traffic sources, which together accounted for 87% of Cd. As, Zn and Cu levels were primarily supplied by industrial and domestic sources, accounting for 76% of As, 75% of Cu and 67% of Zn. Surface soils/sediments of the study watershed contaminated by Cd represent a high ecological risk, whereas other metals represent low ecological risks. The potential ecological risk index (PERI) analysis indicated that it had a low (wide-range) ecological risk and a moderate (small-range) ecological risk primarily distributed in the outlet of the study watershed. Fertilizers and traffic are the primary sources of Cd pollution, which should be more closely controlled for the purposes of water quality and ecological conservation.																	1672-6316	1993-0321				FEB	2017	14	2					325	335		10.1007/s11629-016-3838-1								WOS:000394156900008

Identification of Artificial Recharge Sites for Noyyal River Basin Using GIS and Remote Sensing	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The water is a nature's valuable gift to all life forms. Water quality and quantity plays a major role for the growth and development of community. Both natural and human factors influence the quality and quantity of water source. Depending upon the quality and quantity of groundwater it can be used for various purposes, such as drinking, agricultural and industrial. Due to revolution in industries and various anthropogenic sources in the past decades, groundwater has been polluted and depleted. Remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) has become one of the leading tools in the field of hydrogeological science, which helps in assessing, monitoring and conserving groundwater resources. GIS technology provides suitable alternatives for efficient management of large and complex databases. In recent years, the increasing use of satellite remote sensing data has made it easier to define the spatial distribution of different groundwater prospect classes on the basis of geomorphology and other associated parameters. Analysis of remotely sensed data along with Survey of India(SOI) topographical sheets and collateral information with necessary field checks helps in generating the base line information for artificial recharge. The artificial recharge sites were identified by integrating thematic maps of geology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density and lineament density of the study area. The study focuses on the development of remote sensing and GIS based analysis and methodology for identifying artificial recharge studies in Noyyal river basin.					arumaikkani, geetha selvarani/0000-0001-5779-6765												0255-660X	0974-3006				FEB	2017	45	1					67	77		10.1007/s12524-015-0542-5								WOS:000394243200007

In the present study, 29 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for physico-chemical parameters to determine the hydrochemical characteristics, groundwater quality, and human health risk in the study area. The dominant ions are Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO32-, and SO42. According to Gibbs plot, the predominant samples fall in the rock-water interaction field. A groundwater quality index (WQI) reveals that the majority of the samples falls under good to excellent category of water, suggesting that the groundwater is suitable for drinking and other domestic uses. The Ca-Mg-HCO3, Ca-HCO3, Ca-SO4-HCO3, and Ca-Mg-HCO3-SO4 water types are the dominant water types depending on the water-rock interaction in the investigation area. Risk of metals to human health was then evaluated using hazard quotients (HQ) by ingestion and dermal pathways for adults and children. It was indicated that As with HQ ingestion > 1 was the most important pollutant leading to non-carcinogenic concerns. It can be concluded that the highest contributors to chronic risks were As and Cr for both adults and children.																	1477-8920					FEB	2017	15	1					112	132		10.2166/wh.2016.148								WOS:000394230100011	28151445

Application of quantitative real-time PCR compared to filtration methods for the enumeration of Escherichia coli in surface waters within Vietnam	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												Surface water samples in Vietnam were collected from the Saigon River, rural and suburban canals, and urban run off canals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and were processed to enumerate Escherichia coli. Quantification was done through membrane filtration and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Mean log colony-forming unit (CFU)/100 ml E. coli counts in the dry season for river/suburban canals and urban canals were log 2.8 and 3.7, respectively, using a membrane filtration method, while using Taqman quantitative real-time PCR they were log 2.4 and 2.8 for river/suburban canals and urban canals, respectively. For the wet season, data determined by the membrane filtration method in river/suburban canals and urban canals samples had mean counts of log 3.7 and 4.1, respectively. While mean log CFU/100 ml counts in the wet season using quantitative PCR were log 3 and 2, respectively. Additionally, the urban canal samples were significantly lower than those determined by conventional culture methods for the wet season. These results show that while quantitative real-time PCR can be used to determine levels of fecal indicator bacteria in surface waters, there are some limitations to its application and it may be impacted by sources of runoff based on surveyed samples.																	1477-8920					FEB	2017	15	1					155	162		10.2166/wh.2016.173								WOS:000394230100014	28151448

Being able to quickly detect a system contamination event may be the single most influential factor to reduce possible contamination fallout. Consequently, major research has explored how to best protect a water distribution system (WDS) through strategic placement of fixed water quality monitoring stations. Although fixed monitoring stations within a wireless sensor network (WSN) are robust with respect to hydraulic conditions, the stations are expensive to place, and may not provide the highest spatial and temporal resolution of contamination detection. This work sets to build the understanding of a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) where inline mobile sensors function within water in pipes to monitor water quality and to wirelessly transmit data to fixed transceivers in real time. Mobile sensor behavior was modeled alongside contamination simulations and the deployment of fixed and mobile sensors was together optimized to minimize the affected population prior contamination event detection constrained by a total system cost. Results show a MWSN to be highly sensitive to sensor battery life, transceiver network coverage, and total system cost. Future obstacles for implementation of a MWSN are highlighted and discussed to be address in future work. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.

To help cities optimise the siting of GSI in the context of climate change, we developed a participatory decision support tool. Applied to a neighbourhood, this tool identified only a few sites where GSI would yield all secondary benefits and reduce climate change vulnerability. In the light of the need for large-scale implementation of GSI in cities, this finding raises the following questions: How can the potential benefits provided by a site be best identified? Are there potential synergies or antagonisms between benefits? How do they relate to vulnerability? Can a participatory decision-making process involving local stakeholders improve this process? Informed by the existing literature on balancing ecosystem services and vulnerability, these questions are addressed within a broader perspective of landscape design and urban planning.																	0142-6397	1469-9710				FEB	2017	42	2			SI		195	210		10.1080/01426397.2016.1228861								WOS:000393803800005

Our research investigated the feasibility of using secondary data sources to get an overview of determinants of health and health outcomes in different population strata of Cape Town, a large city of South Africa. Methods: The methodological approach of secondary-data analysis was similar in the different disciplines: Biological Anthropology, Public Health, Environmental Health, Mental Health, Palliative Care, Medical Psychology and Sociology at the University of Freiburg and Public Health at the University of Cape Town. The teams collected information on Cape Town through Internet searches and published articles. The information was extracted, analyzed, condensed, and jointly interpreted. Results: Data show the typical picture of a population in epidemiological and demographic transition exposed to often difficult social, mental, and physical environmental conditions. Comparison between low and higher socioeconomic districts demonstrated that the former had higher air pollution, poorer water quality, and deficient sanitary conditions in addition to sub-optimal mental health services and palliative care. Conclusion: Although important information gaps were identified, the data draw attention to critical public health interventions required in poor health districts, and to motivate for pro-equity policies.																	2047-7724	2047-7732				FEB	2017	111	1					7	22		10.1080/20477724.2016.1275463								WOS:000394047500002	28093045

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Denitrification within Depressional Wetlands of the Southeastern US Coastal Plain in an Agricultural Landscape	WETLANDS												Carolina Bays are depressional wetlands on the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. These wetlands are often the recipient of nutrient runoff from adjacent agricultural lands and there is potential for production of greenhouse gases during nitrification and denitrification processes occurring in the wetland sediments. Because of their saturated conditions, Carolina Bays may improve regional water quality through denitrification of soil nitrate. Three small bays in South Carolina were selected for denitrification and greenhouse gas analysis. A transect of four points was sampled within each Carolina Bay in May, July, September, and November over a two year period. Gas emissions were measured in-situ using a photoacoustic gas analyzer and soil samples were brought back to the lab for denitrification enzyme activity and microbial analysis. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) averaged 1.8 mg m(-2) d(-1), with a median of 0.47 (with a range of below detectable limits to 9.414 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Many measurement events of N2O were below detection and did not vary within the bays. The carbon dioxide emissions from Carolina Bays averaged 15.8 g m(-2) d(-1) and were largely controlled by temperature. Denitrification enzyme activity had a larger response to nitrate additions further into the bays. Gram + bacteria were also greater deeper into the bays, while Gram- and fungal populations were greater at the field/wetland interface. Manure application had some minor effects on DEA within the bays, but did not appear to increase gas emissions over the period measured.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2017	37	1					33	43		10.1007/s13157-016-0837-5								WOS:000394134600003

Only South Carolina and Georgia have statewide inventories. We developed and evaluated a novel way to identify and delineate Bays using Bay-dense Bladen County, NC as a testbed. We posited that Bay land use had changed in the past 40 years and that Bays comprise a small subset of their surrounding soils. We classified decadal Landsat images as forest, agriculture, urban, and water. We used 812 previously delineated Bays to identify common Bay soils. From areas with common Bay soils and land-use change, we identified 548 new Bays and delineated them using a semi-automated on-line digitization tool. We saved new Bays to a Google Fusion Table for download and integration within a GIS. To gauge accuracy, Bays were scored on soils, land-use change, wetland delineation, and landscape position. Potential errors included omission of some small Bays (3.3-14.6 % of total Bay area) and commission of misclassified Bays (11 % of 1360 Bays), an estimated overall accuracy of 74 to 86 %. With 1360 delineated Bays, we estimated that as many as 478 have not yet been identified. These are most likely < 5.76 ha.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2017	37	1					89	98		10.1007/s13157-016-0842-8								WOS:000394134600008

In this study, we analyzed physical and biogeochemical properties of water quality via multivariate statistical techniques. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) grouped HZB and XSB into two subareas of different pollution sources based on similar physical and biogeochemical properties. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified three latent pollution sources in HZB and XSB respectively and emphasized the importance of terrestrial inputs, coastal industries as well as natural processes in determining the water quality of the two bays. Therefore, proper measurement for the protection of aquatic ecoenvironment in HZB and XSB were of great urgency.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				FEB	2017	36	2					1	10		10.1007/s13131-017-0981-7								WOS:000393672200001

Leave-one-out cross validation is used to determine the statistical inference method. To minimize absolute average errors and error mean squares, stratified Kriging (SK) interpolation is applied to DIN and ordinary Kriging (OK) interpolation is applied to PO4-P. Ten percent of the sites is adjusted by considering their impact on the change in deviations in DIN and PO4-P interpolation and the resultant effect on areas with different water quality grades. Thus, seven redundant historical sites are removed. Seven historical sites are distributed in areas with water quality poorer than Grade IV at the north and south branches of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary and at the coastal region north of the Hangzhou Bay. Numerous sites are installed in these regions. The contents of various elements in the waters are not remarkably changed, and the waters are mixed well. Seven sites that have been optimized and removed are set to water with quality Grades III and IV. Optimization and adjustment of unrestricted areas show that the optimized and adjusted sites are mainly distributed in regions where the water quality grade undergoes transition. Therefore, key sites for adjustment and optimization are located at the boundaries of areas with different water quality grades and seawater.

However, the removal process of some organic micropollutants, such as triclosan (TCS), could be inhibited under anaerobic conditions. So, it is worth investigating the TCS removal performance at low-oxygen condition. In this study, simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND) process, with DO ranging from 0.30 to 0.80 mg L-1, was chosen to investigate. Results showed that the water quality of the effluent was deteriorated after TCS addition at the beginning, with removal efficiency of NH4 (+)-N dropped from almost 100 +/- 0.70 to 88.30 +/- 0.98% and COD decreased from 95.15 +/- 1.55 to 65.81 +/- 2.42 %. However, the performance recovered from the 3rd day and almost stabilized on the 14th day with the removal efficiencies of NH4 (+)-N were over 98.00 +/- 0.60 %, and COD was above 94.00 +/- 1.70 % in effluent. Besides, TCS removal efficiencies were more than 93.00 %, and the contributions for TCS removal by the water effluent, sludge sorption, and other effects including biodegradation were 6.46 +/- 2.25, 16.27 +/- 3.30, and 77.27 +/- 4.45 %, respectively. Although the results of absolute abundances of related genes showed no difference (P > 0.05), Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis presented the variation of microbial community after TCS addition, in which T-45 had the highest Shannon and Simpson diversity index, followed by T-0 and T-2. Relative abundances of alpha and beta-Proteobacteria, which were related to TCS biodegradation, were increased. Compared with Bacteroidetes in T-0, the abundance of Bacteroidetes took up more than 15.6 % in T-45, which should play a more important role under low-oxygen conditions with TCS addition.																	0175-7598	1432-0614				FEB	2017	101	4					1653	1660		10.1007/s00253-016-7952-3								WOS:000393687400029	27826723

The toxicity evaluation is typically based on determining the EC50 at specific time points which may lead to overlooking the dynamic nature of luminescence response and limits information regarding the possible mechanisms of action of target compounds. This study investigated various approaches (standard, integral, and luminescence rate inhibition) to evaluate the chronic toxicity of three target compounds (atrazine, trimethoprim, and acetamiprid) using a 96-well plate based method. The chronic toxicity assay and the methods used for EC50 calculation provided in this work resulted in a high-throughput method of chronic toxicity testing and indicated lower EC50 than the values provided by the standard short term methods, indicating higher toxicity. This study emphasizes the need for additional chronic toxicity testing to further evaluate the toxicity of compounds or unknown samples.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				FEB	2017	98	2					196	203		10.1007/s00128-016-2008-z								WOS:000394130000010	28028550					
J	Ekstrom, JA; Bedsworth, L; Fencl, A				Ekstrom, Julia A.; Bedsworth, Louise; Fencl, Amanda			Gauging climate preparedness to inform adaptation needs: local level adaptation in drinking water quality in CA, USA	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Understanding resource managers' perceptions of climate change, analytic capacity, and current adaptation activities can provide insight into what can help support adaptation processes at the local level. In California, where a major drought currently demonstrates some of the hardships that could be regularly encountered under a changing climate, we present results from a survey of drinking water utilities about the perceived threat, analytic capacity, and adaptation actions related to maintaining water quality in the face of climate change. Among surveyed utilities (n = 259), awareness is high in regard to climate change occurring and its potential impacts on water quality globally, but perceived risk is lower with regard to climate impacts on local drinking water quality. Just over half of surveyed utilities report at least some adaptation activity to date. The top three variables that most strongly correlated with reported adaptation action were (1) perceived risk on global and local water quality, (2) surface water reliance, and (3) provision of other services beyond drinking water. Other tested variables significantly correlated with reported adaptation action were (4) degree of impact from the current drought and (5) communication with climate change experts. Findings highlight that smaller groundwater-reliant utilities may need the most assistance to initiate climate adaptation processes. Trusted information sources most frequently used across respondents were state government agencies, followed by colleagues in the same utilities. The finding that frequently used sources of information are similar across utilities presents a promising opportunity for training and disseminating climate information to assist those systems needing the most support.

Abstraction can alter the hydrological regime of streams and rivers, reduce in-stream habitats, change water quality and affect fluvial communities. It can also impair ecosystem functioning, although this aspect has been seldom assessed. We experimentally tested the effect of water abstraction on stream functioning in a headwater mountain stream using a before and after control-impact (BACI) design. We quantified changes in water physicochemical properties, biofilm biomass and activity (exo-enzymes and metabolism), and ecosystem processes (nutrient cycling, organic matter retention and breakdown). Water abstraction did not affect water physicochemical properties, but reduced the biomass and the alkaline phosphatase activity of biofilm per surface unit, the areal uptake of nutrients, and the travel distance of organic matter. It did not affect the biofilm metabolism and breakdown of submerged leaf litter, but decreased the total breakdown. The impacts were larger when analysed per unit of channel length. All variables, except benthic chlorophyll-a, were significantly reduced by abstraction, due to the contraction of the wetted channel. The decrease in the biomass and activity of biofilm, as well as in nutrient uptake and total organic matter breakdown observed in this study could increase nutrient concentration in downstream reaches and reduce the energy transfer to higher trophic levels. Ecosystem services of permanent headwater streams are likely to be compromised with the reduction of wetted-channel width.

Pelagic phytoplankton community change-points across nutrient gradients and in response to invasive mussels	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Phytoplankton communities can experience nonlinear responses to changing nutrient concentrations, but the nature of species shifts within phytoplankton is not well understood and few studies have explored responses of pelagic assemblages in large lakes. Using pelagic phytoplankton data from the Great Lakes, we assessed phytoplankton assemblage change-point responses to nutrients and invasive Dreissena, characterising community responses in a multi-stressor environment and determine whether species responses to insitu nutrients can be approximated from nutrient loading. We demonstrate assemblage shifts in phytoplankton communities along major stressor gradients, particularly prominent in spring assemblages, providing insight into community thresholds at the lower end of the phosphorus gradient and species-stressor responses in a multi-stressor environment. We show that responses to water nutrient concentrations could not be estimated from large-scale nutrient loading data likely due to lake-specific retention time and long-term accumulation of nutrients. These findings highlight the potential for significant accumulation of nitrates in ultra-oligotrophic systems, nonlinear responses of phytoplankton at nutrient concentrations relevant to current water quality standards and system-specific (e.g. lake or ecozone) differences in phytoplankton responses likely due to differences in nutrient co-limitation and effects of dreissenids.

Coal seam water quality and the impact upon management strategies	JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING												The rapidly developing coal seam gas industry produces significant volumes of associated brackish water which needs to be appropriately managed. The aim of this study was to determine the variability of water composition within and between multiple gas fields in a defined geographic area and to discover relationships between species present. Water quality from 150 coal seam gas production wells from the Surat Basin, Queensland has been analysed. Chemical analysis revealed the associated water to predominantly contain bicarbonate (< 2030 mg/L), chloride (< 5910 mg/L) and sodium (< 3700 mg/L) species. In several instances, water parameters such as fluoride, were above recommended limits for direct beneficial reuse. Principal component analysis revealed three groups of water quality parameters which described the data. Iron, manganese and aluminium were in one group; bromide, magnesium, strontium, potassium, hardness, calcium, chloride, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids and sodium appeared as a second group and a third group comprised of fluoride, bicarbonate alkalinity as CaCO3, sodium adsorption ratio, pH, boron, silica, total organic carbon, and sulfate. The variability in water compositions may impact on water management technologies such as reverse osmosis as there may be a propensity for membrane fouling by alkaline earth ions or silica. This study suggested that the mineral quantities in coal such as clay, sulfide ores, oxide ores, quartz and phosphates may correlate with the water quality patterns. Through the use of multivariate analysis it was shown that depth of the CSG production well and the location of the CSG production well did not correlate with differing water quality patterns. The physical and chemical parameters that were analysed in this study will aid in the efficient management of associated water and provide information which allows better understanding of environmental impacts and the prospect for beneficial reuse.

In this study, surface water from different sources (e.g. pond, canal, lake and river) treated with combined Moringa seed powder, and scallop powder (MOSP) at a ratio of 2:1 for 10 minutes showed a clear water layer at the top and a sediment layer at the bottom. The clear water was then passed through an eight-fold sari cloth and/or natural bio-sand filtration and the resulting water was found drinkable. The microbiological and physico-chemical quality of this water showed non-significant differences compared to the US EPA drinking water quality parameters. Moreover, no cytotoxic effect of MOSP with BHK-21 and HeLa cells, nor any bacterial endotoxins were observed, indicating use of MOSP does not pose any adverse health effect. Furthermore, the quality of 6 months stored water at room temperature was found acceptable, indicating the usefulness of this technology for drinking water purposes. On the other hand, the sediment or sludge produced in this process could be used in agricultural fields after proper composting. Therefore, this simple, inexpensive and ecofriendly method could be used in drinking water scarcity areas of the world.																	1606-9749					FEB	2017	17	1					125	137		10.2166/ws.2016.111								WOS:000394582100013

Routine culture-based methods of identifying bacterial pathogens in water sources are laborious and time-consuming. Recently, the use of molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided rapid and highly promising detection methods. In this study, we developed two multiplex PCR assays for simultaneous detection of six water-borne bacteria. Two triplex PCR protocols were developed to detect six target genes. The first protocol targets uidA (Escherichia coli), int (Shigella spp.), and gyrB (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) genes, while invA (Salmonella spp.), ompW (Vibrio cholera), and lacZ (coliforms) were amplified by the second protocol. Specificity testing was carried out for 12 reference strains. Furthermore, the applicability of the multiplex PCR assays for detection of these bacteria was investigated for 52 surface water samples. The results indicated that all primer pairs showed specificities only for their corresponding target organisms. The detection sensitivity of both multiplex PCR assays was 3 x 10(2) 3 x 10(3) colony forming units. The developed assays represent simple and efficient diagnostic procedures for co-detection of water-borne bacteria and have the potential to provide earlier warnings of possible public health threats and more accurate surveillance of these organisms.

Yet the comprehensive performance in response to complex environmental conditions remains unclear. We investigated biofilm formation and distributed water quality under various nutrients, including chlorine concentrations and hydrodynamic conditions. Results showed that environmental fluctuations collectively induced changes in microbial propagation, which were mostly associated with turbidity variations, concentrations of total organic carbon, NH4+-N and soluble phosphorus compared to the other parameters. Fuzzy pattern recognition analysis integrating multiple water quality indicators revealed that low nutrient availability and addition of mild chlorine at 0.50 mg/L at 0.50 m/s flow velocity were the most favorable conditions screened for optimized comprehensive performance, while nutrient supplements yielded significant performance deterioration. These quantitative estimations offer new insights into advanced understanding of the system performance responding to often complex environmental fluctuations, essential for optimized design and practical functioning of DWDSs.																	1606-9749					FEB	2017	17	1					267	278		10.2166/ws.2016.134								WOS:000394582100028						
J	Cloutier, DD; McLellan, SL				Cloutier, Danielle D.; McLellan, Sandra L.			Distribution and Differential Survival of Traditional and Alternative Indicators of Fecal Pollution at Freshwater Beaches	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Alternative indicators have been developed that can be used to identify host sources of fecal pollution, yet little is known about how their distribution and fate compare to traditional indicators. Escherichia coli and enterococci were widely distributed at the six beaches studied and were detected in almost 95% of water samples (n = 422) and 100% of sand samples (n = 400). Berm sand contained the largest amount of E. coli (P < 0.01), whereas levels of enterococci were highest in the backshore (P < 0.01). E. coli and enterococci were the lowest in water, using a weight-to-volume comparison. The gull-associated Catellicoccus marimammalium (Gull2) marker was found in over 80% of water samples, regardless of E. coli levels, and in 25% of sand samples. Human-associated Bacteroides (HB) and Lachnospiraceae (Lachno2) were detected in only 2.4% of water samples collected under baseflow and post-rain conditions but produced a robust signal after a combined sewage overflow, despite low E. coli concentrations. Burdens of E. coli and enterococci in water and sand were disproportionately high in relation to alternative indicators when comparing environmental samples to source material. In microcosm studies, Gull2, HB, and Lachno2 quantitative PCR (qPCR) signals were reduced twice as quickly as those from E. coli and enterococci and approximately 20% faster than signals from culturable E. coli. High concentrations of alternative indicators in source material illustrated their high sensitivity for the identification of fecal sources; however, differential survival and the potential for long-term persistence of traditional fecal indicators complicate the use of alternative indicator data to account for the levels of E. coli and enterococci in environmental samples. IMPORTANCE E. coli and enterococci are general indicators of fecal pollution and may persist in beach sand, making their use problematic for many applications. This study demonstrates that gull fecal pollution is widespread at Great Lakes beaches, whereas human and ruminant contamination is evident only after major rain events. An exploration of sand as a reservoir for indicators found that E. coli was ubiquitous, while gull host markers were detected in only 25% of samples. In situ sand beach microcosms provided decay rate constants for E. coli and enterococci relative to alternative indicators, which establish comparative benchmarks that would be helpful to distinguish recent from past pollution. Overall, alternative indicators are useful for identifying sources and assessing potentially high health risk contamination events; however, beach managers should be cautious in attempting to directly link their detection to the levels of E. coli or enterococci.

Detection of ESKAPE Bacterial Pathogens at the Point of Care Using Isothermal DNA-Based Assays in a Portable Degas-Actuated Microfluidic Diagnostic Assay Platform	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												An estimated 1.5 billion microbial infections occur globally each year and result in similar to 4.6 million deaths. A technology gap associated with commercially available diagnostic tests in remote and underdeveloped regions prevents timely pathogen identification for effective antibiotic chemotherapies for infected patients. The result is a trial-and-error approach that is limited in effectiveness, increases risk for patients while contributing to antimicrobial drug resistance, and reduces the lifetime of antibiotics. This paper addresses this important diagnostic technology gap by describing a low-cost, portable, rapid, and easy-to-use microfluidic cartridgebased system for detecting the ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) bacterial pathogens that are most commonly associated with antibiotic resistance. The point-of-care molecular diagnostic system consists of a vacuumdegassed microfluidic cartridge preloaded with lyophilized recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) assays and a small portable battery-powered electronic incubator/reader. The isothermal RPA assays detect the targeted ESKAPE pathogens with high sensitivity (e.g., a limit of detection of similar to 10 nucleic acid molecules) that is comparable to that of current PCR-based assays, and they offer advantages in power consumption, engineering, and robustness, which are three critical elements required for the point-of-care setting. IMPORTANCE This paper describes a portable system for rapidly identifying bacteria in resource-limited environments; we highlight the capabilities of the technology by detecting different pathogens within the ESKAPE collection, which cause nosocomial infections. The system is designed around isothermal DNA-based assays housed within an autonomous plastic cartridge that are designed with the end user in mind, who may have limited technological training. Displaying excellent sensitivity and specificity, the assay systems that we demonstrate may enable future diagnoses of bacterial infection to guide the development of effective chemotherapies and may have a role in areas beyond health where rapid detection is valuable, including in industrial processing and manufacturing, food security, agriculture, and water quality testing.

Water contamination with heavy metals and trace elements from Kilembe copper mine and tailing sites in Western Uganda; implications for domestic water quality	CHEMOSPHERE												The mining and processing of copper in Kilembe, Western Uganda, from 1956 to 1982 left over 15 Mt of cupriferous and cobaltiferous pyrite dumped within a mountain river valley, in addition to mine water which is pumped to the land surface. This study was conducted to assess the sources and concentrations of heavy metals and trace elements in Kilembe mine catchment water. Multi-element analysis of trace elements from point sources and sinks was conducted which included mine tailings, mine water, mine leachate, Nyamwamba River water, public water sources and domestic water samples using ICP-MS. The study found that mean concentrations (mg kg(-1)) of Co (112), Cu (3320), Ni (131), As (8.6) in mine tailings were significantly higher than world average crust and were being eroded and discharged into water bodies within the catchment. Underground mine water and leachate contained higher mean concentrations (mu g L-1) of Cu (9470), Co (3430) and Ni (590) compared with background concentrations (mu g L-1) in un contaminated water of 1.9, 0.21 and 0.67 for Cu, Co and Ni respectively. Over 25% of household water samples exceeded UK drinking water thresholds for Al of 200 mu g L-1, Co exceeded Winsconsin (USA drinking) water thresholds of 40 mu g L-1 in 40% of samples while Fe in 42% of samples exceeded UK thresholds of 200 mu g L-1. The study however found that besides mining activities, natural processes of geological weathering also contributed to Al, Fe, and Mn water contamination in a number of public water sources.

Thus far, only a handful of studies have examined its impact on plant systems. Present research is limited to the potential uptake of these chemicals by plants and the general phytotoxic effects it can elicit. The aim of this study was to determine what effect an EDC has on developing plant and cell organelles and how it affects it. In this study, cos lettuce plants were exposed to different concentrations of nonylphenol (NP), an EDC, in a static hydroponic system. Changes in plant morphology, mass and length, chlorophyll content, as well as electrolyte leakage were examined. Furthermore an in-depth investigation of the plant cell ultrastructure was carried out with transmission electron microscopy. Results indicated that cos lettuce growth was severely restricted, chlorophyll content was reduced, leakage of electrolytes increased and roots were stunted especially after >= 3200 41 NP exposures. The structure of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, vacuole and chloroplast were also changed. This study emphasizes the importance of water quality management, since the presence of an EDC, like NP, can negatively impact the yield and internal structure of one of the world's most significant salad crops, namely lettuce.

Factors influencing the occurrence and distribution of neonicotinoid insecticides in surface waters of southern Ontario, Canada	CHEMOSPHERE												The widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides and recent increased regulatory scrutiny requires the generation of monitoring data with sufficient scope and resolution to provide decision makers with a better understanding of occurrence and distribution in the environment. This study presents a wide scale investigation of neonicotinoid insecticides used across the range of agricultural activities from fifteen surface water sites in southern Ontario. Using statistical analysis, the correlation of individual compounds with land use was investigated, and the relationship between neonicotinoid occurrence and hydrologic parameters in calibrated water courses was also assessed. Of the five neonicotinoids studied, imidacloprid, clothianidin and thiamethoxam exhibited detection rates above 90% at over half the sites sampled over a three year period (2012-2014). At two sites in southwestern Ontario, the Canadian Federal freshwater guideline value for imidacloprid (230 ng/L) was exceeded in roughly 75% of the samples collected. For some watersheds, there were correlations between the occurrence of neonicotinoids and precipitation and/or stream discharge. Some watersheds exhibited seasonal maxima in concentrations of neonicotinoids in spring and fall, particularly for those areas where row crop agriculture is predominant; these seasonal patterns were absent in some areas characterized by a broad range of agricultural activities.

Two PCPs (nPCP and tPCP) having a permeability of similar to 4.5 minis were prepared with optimized mix designs. A control impervious concrete pavement (CP) was also prepared. Results showed that both PCP-BBB's outperformed CP-BBB not only in runoff volume reduction, but also in pollutant removal; both PCPs removed a considerably high amount of pollutants, especially in fecal coliform and phosphate removal. tPCP-BBB improved water quality better than nPCP-BBB in terms of chemical oxygen demand and pH. Additionally, D. sanderiana grew healthier in tPCP-BBB than in nPCP-BBB. Production costs for tPCP and CP were similar, whereas nPCP production was twice as expensive. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial and temporal patterns of dissolved organic matter quantity and quality in the Mississippi River Basin, 1997-2013	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Recent studies have found insignificant or decreasing trends in time-series dissolved organic carbon (DOC) datasets, questioning the assumption that long-term DOC concentrations in surface waters are increasing in response to anthropogenic forcing, including climate change, land use, and atmospheric acid deposition. We used the weighted regressions on time, discharge, and season (WRTDS) model to estimate annual flow-normalized concentrations and fluxes to determine if changes in DOC quantity and quality signal anthropogenic forcing at 10 locations in the Mississippi River Basin. Despite increases in agriculture and urban development throughout the basin, net increases in DOC concentration and flux were significant at only 3 of 10 sites from 1997 to 2013 and ranged between -3.5% to +18% and -0.1 to 19%, respectively. Positive shifts in DOC quality, characterized by increasing specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, ranged between +8% and +45%, but only occurred at one of the sites with significant DOC quantity increases. Basinwide reductions in atmospheric sulfate deposition did not result in large increases in DOC either, likely because of the high buffering capacity of the soil. Hydroclimatic factors including annual discharge, precipitation, and temperature did not significantly change during the 17-year timespan of this study, which contrasts with results from previous studies showing significant increases in precipitation and discharge over a century time scale. Our study also contrasts with those from smaller catchments, which have shown stronger DOC responses to climate, land use, and acidic deposition. This temporal and spatial analysis indicated that there was a potential change in DOC sources in the Mississippi River Basin between 1997 and 2013. However, the overall magnitude of DOC trends was not large, and the pattern in quantity and quality increases for the 10 study sites was not consistent throughout the basin.

Researcher disciplines and the assessment techniques used to evaluate Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America have been a focus of environmental and ecosystem research since the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1972. This study provides a review of scientific literature directed at the assessment of Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems. Our aim was to understand the methods employed to quantify disturbance and ecosystem quality within Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems within the last 20 years. We focused specifically on evidence of multidisciplinary articles, in authorship or types of assessment parameters used. We sought to uncover: 1) where Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems are investigated, 2) how patterns in the disciplines of researchers have shifted over time, 3) how measured parameters differed among disciplines, and 4) which parameters were used most often. Results indicate research was conducted almost evenly across the five Laurentian Great Lakes and that publication of coastal ecosystems studies increased dramatically ten years after the first State of the Great Lakes Ecosystem Conference in 1994. Research authored by environmental scientists and by multiple disciplines (multidisciplinary) have become more prevalent since 2003. This study supports the likelihood that communication and knowledge-sharing is happening between disciplines on some level. Multidisciplinary or environmental science articles were the most inclusive of parameters from different disciplines, but every discipline seemed to include chemical parameters less often than biota, physical, and spatial parameters. There is a need for an increased understanding of minor nutrient, toxin, and heavy metal impacts and use of spatial metrics in Laurentian Great Lakes coastal ecosystems.

Here we apply a climate change "test" to a framework for estimating the amount of agricultural conservation practices needed to achieve desired fish conservation outcomes for four watersheds in the Saginaw Bay region of Michigan, USA. We developed three climate scenarios from global climate model outputs (high emissions scenario, "2080s" timeframe) to provide insight on potential impacts of a climate driver that represents a key uncertainty for this management system, the amount and timing of spring and summer precipitation. These scenarios were used as inputs to agricultural watershed models, which produced water quality outputs that we compared to thresholds in fish biodiversity metrics at the subwatershed scale. Our results suggest that impacts of climate change on evaporation rates and other aspects of hydrology will shift the relative importance of key stressors for fish (i.e., sediment loadings vs. nutrient concentrations) across these different watersheds, highlighting the need to design resilient implementation plans and policies. Overall, we found that changes in climate are likely to increase the need for agricultural conservation practices, but that increasing the implementation rate above current levels will likely remain a good investment under current and future climate conditions.

Mussel-derived stimulation of benthic filamentous algae: The importance of nutrients and spatial scale	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The reoccurrence of benthic filamentous algal (FA) blooms in the Great Lakes, without associated increases in phosphorus loading, has stimulated renewed interest in determining the causes of Great Lakes benthic algal blooms. We investigated the potential roles of invasive mussels and nutrient limitation with experimental substrata within inner Saginaw Bay. FA abundance on live mussel substrata was typically significantly greater than that on inert (empty shell or rock) substrata. Nutrient addition (from an artificial source) significantly increased FA abundance on inert substrata. These results suggest that: 1) mussel nutrient excretion could be a primary stimulatory mechanism; 2) mussel-mediated stimulation may be even stronger in other, more oligotrophic, Great Lakes nearshore zones; and 3) increased nutrient loading to inner Saginaw Bay may exacerbate existing FA blooms. FA abundance on inert substrata was not affected, even in close proximity to mussels, indicating that the observed stimulatory effect of mussel-derived P on live mussels attenuated at very small spatial scales, on the order of centimeters or less.

A depth-adjusted ambient distribution approach for setting numeric removal targets for a Great Lakes Area of Concern beneficial use impairment: Degraded benthos	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We compiled macroinvertebrate data collected from 1995 to 2014 from the St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC) of Lake Superior. Our objective was to define depth-adjusted cutoff values for benthos condition classes to provide an analytical tool for quantifying progress toward achieving removal targets for the degraded benthos beneficial use impairment. We used quantile regression to model the limiting effect of depth on selected benthos metrics, including taxa richness, percent non-oligochaete individuals, combined percent Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata individuals, and density of ephemerid mayfly nymphs (Hexagenia). We created a scaled trimetric index from the first three metrics. Metric values above the 75th percentile quantile regression model prediction were defined as being in relatively excellent condition in the context of the degraded beneficial use impairment for that depth. We set the cutoff between good and fair condition as the 50th percentile model prediction, and we set the cutoff between fair and poor condition as the 25th percentile model prediction. We examined sampler type, geographic zone, and substrate type for confounding effects. Based on these analyses we combined data across sampler types and created separate models for each of three geographic zones. We used the resulting condition-class cutoff values to determine the relative benthic condition for three adjacent habitat restoration project areas. The depth-limited pattern of ephemerid abundance we observed in the St. Louis River AOC also occurred elsewhere in the Great Lakes. We provide tabulated model predictions for application of our depth-adjusted condition class cutoff values to new sample data.

REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll-a (Chl a) is a key parameter for the assessment of water quality in coastal and shelf environments. The availability of satellite ocean colour offers the potential of monitoring these regions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales, as long as a high level of accuracy can be achieved. To use satellite derived Chl a to monitor these environments, it is imperative that rigorous accuracy assessments are undertaken to select the most accurate ocean colour algorithm(s). To this end, the accuracy of a range of ocean colour Chl a algorithms for use with Medium Imaging Resolution Spectrometer (MERIS) Level 2 (L2) Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs), using two different atmospheric correction (AC) processors (COASTCOLOUR and MERIS Ground Segment processor version 8.0 - MEGS8.0), were assessed in North West European waters. A total of 594 measurements of R-rs(lambda) and/or Chl a were made in the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, along the Portuguese Coast English Channel and Celtic Sea between June 2001 and March 2012, where Chl a varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). The following algorithms were compared: MERIS Case 1 water Chl a algorithm OC4Me, the MERIS Case 2 algorithm Algal Pigment 2 (AP2), the MODIS-Aqua Case 1 Chl a algorithm OC3 adapted for MERIS (OC3Me), the MODIS-Aqua Garver-Siegel-Maritorena algorithm (GSM) adapted for MERIS and the Gohin et al. (2002) algorithm for MERIS (005Me). For both COASTCOLOUR and MEGS8.0 processors, OC5Me was the most accurate Chl a algorithm, which was within similar to 25% of in situ values in these coastal and shelf waters. The uncertainty in MEGS8.0 R(rs)4442) (similar to 17%) was slightly higher compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 12%) from 0.3 to 7 mg m(-3) Chl a, but for R-rs(560)the uncertainty was lower for MEGS8.0 (similar to 10%) compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 13%), which meant that MEGS8.0 Chl a was more accurate than COASTCOLOUR for all of the Chl a algorithms tested. Compared to 005Me, OC4Me tended to over-estimate Chl a, which was caused by non-algal SPM especially at values >14 g M-3. GSM also over-estimated Chl a, which was caused by variations in absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)). AP2 consistently under-estimated Chl a, especially when non-algal SPM was >4 g m(-3). (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Nevertheless, human activities have favored the bloom of toxic cyanobacteria in many reservoirs: which has resulted in environmental, social, and economic problems. This study aims to evaluate the water quality of a reservoir in South Brazil through the analysis of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins PSTs (Paralytic Shellfish Toxins) and biomarkers of environmental contamination in fish. For this purpose, water samples and fish (Geophagus brasiliensis) (Perciformes: Cichlidae) were collected from September 2013 to May 2014. The fish G. brasiliensis were separated in two groups. The first one "site group" was euthanized after the sampling and their weight and length were measured. The blood, brain, muscle and liver were collected for chemical, biochemical and genetics biomarkers analysis. The second group "depuration group" was submitted to depuration experiment for 40 days in clean water. After that, the same procedures as for the first group were carried out. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was the dominant cyanobacteria found in the reservoir, and it showed a density above the recommended limit by Brazilian legislation of 20,000 cells/ mL. Results showed that the fish accumulate PSTs in the Reservoir and these were not eliminated after 40 days. The biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers showed a significant difference between "site groups" and "depuration groups", which suggests a recovery of the antioxidant system and a reduction of cellular damage after 40 days in clean water. In conjunction with results reported earlier by others, Alagados Reservoir, in South Brazil, appears to have a persistent contamination of cyanotoxins. Moreover, the mixture of contaminants which may be present in the water body can explain the seasonal differences in fish at the sampled points. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sousa, VS; Corniciuc, C; Teixeira, MR				Sousa, Vania Serrao; Corniciuc, Claudia; Teixeira, Margarida Ribau			The effect of TiO2 nanoparticles removal on drinking water quality produced by conventional treatment C/F/S	WATER RESEARCH												Nanoparticles, namely titanium dioxide (TiO2), are emerging contaminants widely used to commercial and industrial applications, are a potential hazard and can cause damage to environment and human health due to their toxicity. Therefore, their removal from the water is urgent to minimize or eliminate the adverse environmental and human effects. This work, investigates the efficiency of conventional coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation (C/F/S) from drinking water treatment to remove TiO2 nano particles (NPs) from surface waters, and pretends to understand if the removal of TiO2 NPs affects the ability of C/F/S to remove natural organic matter (NOM) and turbidity, and consequently affects the quality of the treated water. Results show that TiO2 NPs removal is high (>90%) for all the waters studied (hydrophobic and hydrophilic waters) and the treated water quality is not compromised (turbidity, Ti and Al concentrations, pH and conductivity are below the national and international guidelines). In addition, TiO2 initial concentrations, ranging between 0.2 and 10 mg/L, have not a significant impact on NPs removal by C/F/S. Therefore, the widely used polyaluminium based coagulants are effective in the removal of TiO2 NPs by conventional C/F/S treatment, but removal is strongly influenced by the water characteristics. Hydrophobic waters need a higher coagulant dose than hydrophilic waters to achieve the same TiO2 NPs removals, as well as water with higher UV254nm values. The principal mechanism involved in TiO2 NPs removal is charge neutralisation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Iron and manganese removal: Recent advances in modelling treatment efficiency by rapid sand filtration	WATER RESEARCH												A model has been developed that takes into account the main characteristics of (submerged) rapid filtration: the water quality parameters of the influent water, notably pH, iron(II) and manganese(II) concentrations, homogeneous oxidation in the supernatant layer, surface sorption and heterogeneous oxidation kinetics in the filter, and filter media adsorption characteristics. Simplifying assumptions are made to enable validation in practice, while maintaining the main mechanisms involved in iron(II) and manganese(II) removal. Adsorption isotherm data collected from different Dutch treatment sites show that Fe(II)/Mn(II) adsorption may vary substantially between them, but generally increases with higher pH.

Model results coincide with experimental values when the heterogeneous rate constants are calibrated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Photocatalytic reduction of nitrate to molecular nitrogen presents a promising approach to remove nitrate from drinking water sources. However, harmful intermediates like NO2-, NO, NO2 and N2O are usually formed, and metal loading or hole scavengers are generally needed to reduce the recombination of photo generated electrons and holes, which will cause secondary pollution to drinking water. In this work, an efficient, selective and sustainable bioelectro-photocatalytic nitrate-reducing system by utilizing commercial TiO2 nanoparticles P25 as the photocatalyst and bio-electrons from microbial metabolism as the hole scavenger is reported. In this system, bio-electrons extracted from organic substrates in bio-anode are transferred to the photocathode through an external circuit for hole quenching. With the utilization of the residual photogenerated electrons, nitrate is completely reduced to nitrogen without accumulation of harmful nitrite or ammonium. The experimental results and the mechanistic analysis using the first-principles density functional theory calculations demonstrate that toxic by-products like nitrite or ammonium will not be accumulated in this system. Thus, this approach has a great potential for sustainable remediation of nitrate-contaminated drinking water sources. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methylmercury production and accumulation in urban stormwater ponds and habitat wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Stormwater management ponds and created habitat wetlands effectively manage erosion, flooding, and pollutant loadings while providing biodiversity and aesthetic benefits, but these structures are also potential sources of methylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative neurotoxin. While MeHg accumulation has been confirmed in habitat wetlands, the extent of MeHg production and accumulation in stormwater ponds is unknown. Additionally, the fine-scale spatial variation in MeHg in these wetlands has never been explored despite the possibility that cycles of wetting and drying, and the presence of aquatic plants may stimulate methylation at their margins. To address these knowledge gaps, we compared MeHg and inorganic mercury concentrations, the percent of total mercury present as MeHg (%MeHg), and potential mercury methylation rate constants (K-meth) in the sediments of terrestrial-aquatic transects through several stormwater and habitat wetlands. We present novel evidence confirming the in situ production of MeHg in both stormwater ponds and habitat wetlands, but observe no systematic differences across the terrestrial-aquatic gradient, suggesting that routine variations in water level do not alter MeHg production and accumulation. Stormwater ponds effectively trap mercury while converting relatively little to MeHg, as evidenced by lower MeHg concentrations, %-MeHg, and K-meth values than habitat wetlands, but often greater inorganic Hg concentrations. The relationship of aquatic vegetation to MeHg accumulation is weak and ambiguous, suggesting plants are not strong drivers of MeHg biogeochemistry in these systems. Although the MeHg hazard associated with individual artificial wetlands is low, they may be important sources of MeHg at the landscape level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They could often occur at certain concentrations to cause adverse effects on aquatic life and human health. Generally, parametric models are mostly used to construct species sensitivity distributions (SSDs), which result in comparison for water quality criteria (WQC) of elements in the same period or group of the periodic table might be inaccurate and the results could be biased. To address this inadequacy, the non-parametric kernel density estimation (NPKDE) with its optimal bandwidth's and testing methods were developed for establishing SSDs. The NPKDE was better fit, more robustness and better predicted than conventional normal and logistic parametric density estimations for constructing SSDs and deriving acute HC5 and WQC for transition metals in the fourth period of the periodic table. The decreasing sequence of HC5 values for the transition metals in the fourth period was Ti > Mn > V > Ni > Zn > Cu > Fe > Co > Cr(VI), which were not proportional to atomic number in the periodic table, and for different metals the relatively sensitive species were also different. The results indicated that except for physical and chemical properties there are other factors affecting toxicity mechanisms of transition metals. The proposed method enriched the methodological foundation for WQC. Meanwhile, it also provided a relatively innovative, accurate approach for the WQC derivation and risk assessment of the same group and period metals in aquatic environments to support protection of aquatic organisms.

The river supplies inhabitants of the city of Besancon in drinking water, raising the question of a potential risk through both water consumption and use. We developed a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to quantify S. parasitica in the Loue River as well as in the drinking water. A weak spatial trend is suggested with greater quantities of S. parasitica observed at the sampling station close to the main pumping station. No S. parasitica DNA was detected in the tap water connected to pumping stations. The use of qPCR, which combines specificity, practicality, speed and reliability, appears to be an effective tool to monitor the spatial and temporal dynamics of this oomycete and identify the risk period for wild salmonid populations in the field, for fishery management or in aquaculture.

Overall, harvested rainwater is of good quality, falling within the Malaysian recreational water quality Class BB standards with exceptions for pH (18/92), ammonia (1/92), phosphates (3/92), and total coliforms (8/92). A large number of samples tested positive for Escherichia coli (22/92), total coliforms (64/92) and Chromobacterium violaceum (7/92), showing that disinfection of harvested rainwater is mandatory prior to reuse. 2/37 harvested rainwater samples exceeded lead limits in Malaysian drinking water standards, showing that consuming rainwater without additional treatment may pose a health risk. Mixing harvested rainwater with groundwater resulted in higher phosphates and total coliforms. Rainwater collected during the wet seasons have higher concentrations of suspended solids, turbidity, and Escherichia coli than dry seasons due to the antecedent dry period. Last but not least, both principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were conducted on 37 samples to apportion pollutant sources in harvested rainwater. 7 principal components were identified, namely: industrial dust, steel, roadside dust, faeces, organic decay, fertilisers, and plumbing. The results from principal component analysis and positive matrix factorisation were in agreement, although the latter identified mains water top-up as an additional factor responsible for dissolved solids. Both techniques are effective at apportioning pollutant sources in harvested rainwater, and show that a rainwater harvesting system should be designed carefully to reduce contributions from steel, plumbing, organic decay, bird faeces, industrial dust and roadside dust.

The results of characteristic analyses and a mobile factor calculation show that the bonding patterns of heavy metals in DS were stable and had low bioavailability and mobility. DS can effectively adsorb ammonia and phosphate according to the pseudo second-order kinetics model. The adsorption isotherm for ammonia can be described by the Langmuir model. Both the Langmuir and Freundlich models can be used for phosphate adsorption isotherm evaluation. Ammonia adsorption involved physical adsorption, and the mechanisms for phosphate removal included adsorption and chemical precipitation. The adsorption of ammonia by DS was a non-spontaneous endothermic process, and the adsorption of phosphate was a spontaneous exothermic process. The results from excitation emission fluorescence matrix analysis show that the organic substances in the fish pond with DS addition included a soluble microbial product, protein-like substance, and humic acid-like substance. This indicates that algal growth and biomass accumulation could be enhanced by DS addition because the released trace elements and hydroxide ions from DS are beneficial to algal growth. Using DS as an amendment and construction material for the fish pond would increase the water alkalinity and prevent acidification of pond water. The results indicate that DS can be used in the aquacultural industry as construction material as well as for pH control and algal growth enhancement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Henry, DAW; Cumming, GS				Henry, Dominic A. W.; Cumming, Graeme S.			Can waterbirds with different movement, dietary and foraging functional traits occupy similar ecological niches?	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Competitive interactions potentially play an important role in structuring bird communities. It is unclear how differences in functional traits influence the niche dimensions of highly mobile waterbird species, particularly when they co-exist in spatiotemporally heterogeneous communities. We investigated the inter-relationships between waterbird trait groupings (movement, dietary and foraging habitat) and environmental variable groupings (rainfall, land cover, vegetation structure and water quality). Specifically, we tested whether the scale of environmental variables filtered movement traits and whether these traits operated in conjunction with dietary and foraging habitat traits to form distinct ecological niches in waterbirds. We conducted waterbird and environmental variable surveys in 60 sites, sampled seven times each at bimonthly intervals, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Trait-environment relationships were tested using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Several significant trait-environment relationships emerged in bivariate correlations and multivariate ordination space. Movement traits correlated with the scale of environmental variables; migrant and nomadic species responded to broad scale environmental variables. Vegetation structure and land cover were particularly important in explaining the abundance of species foraging in emergent vegetation. Three groups emerged along a gradient in multivariate ordination space providing evidence for ecological niche separation of waterbirds with different movement traits. Our findings suggest that the scale of landscape resources can act as a filter of movement traits, and that in conjunction with dietary and foraging traits, waterbirds with different movement traits occupy distinct ecological niches.

J	Lanz, B; Provins, A				Lanz, Bruno; Provins, Allan			Using averting expenditures to estimate the demand for public goods: Combining objective and perceived quality	RESOURCE AND ENERGY ECONOMICS												In response to the perceived quality of a public good, households may choose to incur averting expenditures as a substitute to its aggregate provision, thereby revealing an (inverse) demand function. When unobserved heterogeneity affects both perceived quality and averting behavior, identification of the demand function is plagued by a problem of endogeneity. In this paper, we propose the use of an auxiliary (first stage) model of perceived quality as a function of objective quality to recover unbiased and microconsistent estimates of marginal willingness to pay for the provision of the public good. The approach can be applied when people have well-formed perceptions of the quality of the good, a prerequisite for the averting expenditures method, and when objective quality of provision is plausibly exogenous. We illustrate the approach with data on averting expenditures for two qualitative aspects of household tap water networks: water hardness and aesthetic quality in terms of taste and odor.

In the eye of the beholder: Assessing the water quality of shoreline parks around the Island of Montreal through citizen science	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												As a part of the FreshWater Watch project aiming to promote volunteers' water monitoring in 25 cities around the world, St. Lawrence River water quality was characterized at 28 public shoreline parks around Montreal Island, Quebec, Canada. This involved training of 69 citizen scientists by researchers of the Universite de Montreal in five one-day sessions. Shoreline sampling yielded 174 data points over three summers (May 2013 to November 2015). Water turbidity, nitrate and phosphate concentrations were measured in situ, together with the thickness and type of beach-cast vegetation, and the relative abundance of different types of beach litter. Data generated by citizen scientists provided 1) an overview of the water quality of the St. Lawrence and Des Prairies rivers around the Island of Montreal, 2) an estimation of the quantity and types of beach-cast aquatic plants and filamentous algae, and 3) novel insights into the distribution of the nuisance cyanobacterium Lyngbya wollei. Overall, half of the sites were classified as "good" being characterized by low turbidity, nitrate and phosphate concentrations, and little deposition of beach-cast vegetation. Lyngbya wollei was found at 57% of the sites, revealing a more frequent occurrence than initially anticipated. The amount of litter recorded along the shoreline was generally small, comprising items related to picnicking (cans/bottles), smoking, and fishing activities inmost parks. Wind exposure and rain events explained a significant fraction of the variability in nutrient concentration and turbidity among sites and dates. Shoreline condition assessed from water quality and vegetation data from this study was not correlated, however, with the most serious problem of faecal coliform counts gathered by the City of Montreal. This assessment of the quality and utilization of shoreline parks provides additional information to support planning and management activities of municipalities.

Further on, they will affect them indirectly through adaptation in land use which ultimately influences diffuse nutrient emissions to rivers and therefore potentially the compliance with good ecological status according to the EU Water Framework Directive(WFD). We present an integrated impact modelling framework (IIMF) to track and quantify direct and indirect pollution impacts along policy-economy-climate-agriculture-water interfaces. The IIMF is applied to assess impacts of climatic and socio-economic drivers on agricultural land use (crop choices, farming practices and fertilization levels), river flows and the risk for exceedance of environmental quality standards for determination of the ecological water quality status in Austria. This article also presents model interfaces as well as validation procedures and results of single models and the IIMF with respect to observed state variables such as land use, river flow and nutrient river loads. The performance of the IIMF for calculations of river nutrient loads (120 monitoring stations) shows a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.73 for nitrogen and 0.51 for phosphorus. Most problematic is the modelling of phosphorus loads in the alpine catchments dominated by forests and mountainous landscape. About 63% of these catchments show a deviation between modelled and observed loads of 30% and more. In catchments dominated by agricultural production, the performance of the IIMF is much better as only 30% of cropland and 23% of permanent grassland dominated areas have a deviation of >30% between modelled and observed loads. As risk of exceedance of environmental quality standards is mainly recognized in catchments dominated by cropland, the IIMF is well suited for assessing the nutrient component of the WFD ecological status.

The frequency and magnitude of harmful algal blooms (primarily in the western basin) and the extent of hypoxic bottom waters in the central basin have increased. The decline in ecosystem health, despite meeting goals for external P loads, has sparked a renewed effort to understand P cycling in the lake. We use pore-water P concentration profiles and sediment cores incubation experiments to quantify the P flux from Lake Erie central basin sediments. In addition, the oxygen isotopes of phosphate were investigated to assess the isotopic signature of sedimentary phosphate inputs relative to the isotopic signature of phosphate in lake water. Extrapolating the total P sediment flux based on the pore-water profiles to the whole area of the central basin ranged from 300 to 1250 metric tons per year and using the flux based on core incubation experiments an annual flux of roughly 2400 metric tons of P is calculated. These estimates amount to 8-20% of the total external input of P to Lake Erie. The isotopic signature of phosphate in the extractable fraction of the sediments (similar to 18%) can explain the non-equilibrium isotope values of dissolved phosphate in the deep water of the central basin of Lake Erie, and this is consistent with sediments as an important internal source of P in the Lake.

Seasonal induced changes in spinach rhizosphere microbial community structure with varying salinity and drought	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Salinity is a common problem under irrigated agriculture, especially in low rainfall and high evaporative demand areas of southwestern United States and other semi-arid regions around the world. However, studies on salinity effects on soil microbial communities are relatively few while the effects of irrigation-induced salinity on soil chemical and physical properties and plant growth are well documented. In this study, we examined the effects of salinity, temperature, and temporal variability on soil and rhizosphere microbial communities in sand tanks irrigated with prepared solutions designed to simulate saline wastewater. Three sets of experiments with spinach (Spinacia oleracea L., cv. Racoon) were conducted under saline water during different time periods (early winter, late spring, and early summer). Bacterial 16S V4 rDNA region was amplified utilizing fusion primers designed against the surrounding conserved regions using MiSeq (R) Illumina sequencing platform. Across the two sample types, bacteria were relatively dominant among three phyla-the Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes-accounted for 77.1% of taxa detected in the rhizosphere, while Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria accounted for 55.1% of taxa detected in soil. The results were analyzed using UniFrac coupled with principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) to compare diversity, abundance, community structure, and specific bacterial groups in soil and rhizosphere samples. Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) analysis showed that soil temperature (P = 0.001), rhizosphere temperature (P = 0.001), rhizosphere salinity (P = 0.032), and evapotranspiration (P = 0.002) significantly affected beta diversity of soil and rhizosphere microbial communities. Furthermore, salinity had marginal effects (P = 0.078) on soil beta diversity. However, temporal variability differentially affected rhizosphere microbial communities irrigated with saline wastewater. Therefore, microbial communities in soils impacted by saline irrigation water respond differently to irrigation water quality and season of application due to temporal effects associated with temperature.

J	Soberg, LC; Viklander, M; Blecken, GT				Soberg, Laila C.; Viklander, Maria; Blecken, Godecke-Tobias			Do salt and low temperature impair metal treatmentin stormwater bioretention cells with or without a submerged zone?	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Although seasonal temperature changes and (road) salt in winter and/or coastal stormwater runoff might interfere with the metal treatment performance of stormwater bioretention cells, no previous study has evaluated the effect of these factors and their interactions under controlled conditions. In this 18 week long study 24 well established pilot-scale bioretention columns were employed to evaluate the individual and combined effect(s) of low/high temperature, salt and presence of a submerged zone with an embedded carbon source on metal removal using a three factor, two-level full factorial experimental design. In most instances, the three factors significantly influenced the metal outflow concentrations and thus the treatment performance; the effect of temperature depended on the metal in question, salt had an overall negative effect and the submerged zone with carbon source had an overall positive effect. Despite these statistically significant effects, the discharge water quality was generally markedly improved. However, leaching of dissolved Cu and Pb did occur, mainly from bioretention cells dosed with salt-containing stormwater. The highest concentrations of metals were captured in the top layer of the filter material and were not significantly affected by the three factors studied. Overall, the results confirmed that bioretention provides a functioning stormwater treatment option in areas experiencing winter conditions (road salt, low temperatures) or coastal regions (salt-laden stormwater). However, validation of these results in the field is recommended, especially focusing on dissolved metal removal, which may be critically affected under certain conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of in vitro estrogenic activity and estrogen concentrations in source and treated waters from 25 US drinking water treatment plants	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In vitro bioassays have been successfully used to screen for estrogenic activity in wastewater and surface water, however, few have been applied to treated drinking water. Here, extracts of source and treated water samples were assayed for estrogenic activity using T47D-KBluc cells and analyzed by liquid chromatography-Fourier transform mass spectrometry (LC-FTMS) for natural and synthetic estrogens (including estrone, 17 beta-estradiol, estriol, and ethinyl estradiol). None of the estrogens were detected above the LC-FTMS quantification limits in treated samples and only 5 source waters had quantifiable concentrations of estrone, whereas 3 treated samples and 16 source samples displayed in vitro estrogenicity. Estrone accounted for the majority of estrogenic activity in respective samples, however the remaining samples that displayed estrogenic activity had no quantitative detections of known estrogenic compounds by chemical analyses. Source water estrogenicity (max, 0.47 ng 17 beta-estradiol equivalents (E2Eq)L-1) was below levels that have been linked to adverse effects in fish and other aquatic organisms. Treated water estrogenicity (max, 0.078 ng E2Eq L-1) was considerably below levels that are expected to be biologically relevant to human consumers. Overall, the advantage of using in vitro techniques in addition to analytical chemical determinations was displayed by the sensitivity of the T47D-KBluc bioassay, coupled with the ability to measure cumulative effects of mixtures, specifically when unknown chemicals may be present.

Atmospheric deposition of particles at a sensitive alpine lake: Size-segregated daily and annual fluxes from passive sampling techniques	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake Tahoe, a North American alpine lake long appreciated for its clear water and geographic setting, has experienced a trend of declining water clarity due to increasing nutrient and particle inputs. Contributions from atmospheric deposition of particulate matter (PM) could be important, yet they are inadequately quantified. This study established a yearlong deposition monitoring network in the northern Lake Tahoe Basin. Dry deposition was quantified on surrogate surfaces while wet deposition was based on particles suspended in precipitation at 24-hour resolution. The particle size ranges by these passive techniques were 1-64 mu mand 0.5-20 mu min diameter for dry and wet deposition, respectively. Dry deposition of submicrometer (0.5-1 mu m) particles was also estimated by extrapolation of a lognormal size distribution. Higher daily number deposition fluxes (NDFdry and NDFwet) were found at a near-shore site, confirming substantial impacts of commercial and tourist activities. The two more isolated sites indicated a uniform regional background. On average, daily NDFdry is about one order of magnitude lower than daily NDFwet. Dry deposition velocities increased rapidlywith particle size, as evidenced by collocatedmeasurements of NDFdry and ambient particle number concentrations, though it seemsless so for wet deposition due to different scavenging mechanisms. Despite fewer "wet" days than "dry" days during the monitoring period, wet processes dominated seasonal particle deposition, particularly in winter and spring when most precipitation occurred. Adopting sediment (insoluble, inorganic) particle fraction estimates from the literature, this study reports an annual particle flux of 2.9-5.2 x 10(10) # m(-2) yr(-1) for sediment particles with 1-20 mu m diameter and 6.1-11 x 10(10) # m(-2) yr(-1) for those with 0.5-20 mu m diameter. Implications of these findings to the current knowledge of atmospheric deposition in the Lake Tahoe Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Indicators of improved water access in the context of schistosomiasis transmission in rural Eastern Region, Ghana	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Populations with poor access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure are disproportionately affected by the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). As a result, WASH has gained increasing prominence in integrated control and elimination of NTDs, including schistosomiasis. In order to identify underserved populations, relevant measures of access to WASH infrastructure at sub-national or local levels are needed. We conducted a field survey of all public water sources in 74 rural communities in the Eastern Region of Ghana and computed indicators of water access using two methods: one based on the design capacity and another on the spatial distribution of water sources. The spatial method was applied to improved and surface water sources. According to the spatial method, improved water sources in the study area were well-distributed within communities with 95% (CI95%: 91, 98) of the population having access within 500 m when all, and 87% (CI95%: 81, 93) when only functional water sources were considered. According to the design capacity-based method, indicator values were lower: 63% (CI95%: 57, 69) for all and 49% (CI95%: 43, 55) for only functional sources. Surfacewater access was sub-stantial with 62% (CI95%: 54, 71) of the population located within 500 m of a perennial surface water source. A negative relationship was observed between functional improved water access and surface water access within 300 m. In this context, perceived water quality of the improved sources was also important, with a 17% increase in surface water access in towns with one reported water quality problem as compared to towns with no problems. Our study offers a potential methodology to use water point mapping data to identify communities in need of improved water access to achieve schistosomiasis risk reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The land-use legacy effect: Towards a mechanistic understanding of time-lagged water quality responses to land use/cover	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Numerous studies have linked land use/land cover (LULC) to aquatic ecosystem responses, however only a few have included the dynamics of changing LULC in their analysis. In this study, we explicitly recognize changing LULC by linking mechanistic groundwater flow and travel time models to a historical time series of LULC, creating a land-use legacy map. We then illustrate the utility of legacy maps to explore relationships between dynamic LULC and lake water chemistry. We tested two main concepts about mechanisms linking LULC and lake water chemistry: groundwater pathways are an important mechanism driving legacy effects; and, LULC over multiple spatial scales is more closely related to lake chemistry than LULC over a single spatial scale. We applied statistical models to twelve water chemistry variables, ranging from nutrients to relatively conservative ions, to better understand the roles of biogeochemical reactivity and solubility on connections between LULC and aquatic ecosystem response. Our study illustrates how different areas can have long groundwater pathways that represent different LULC than what can be seen on the landscape today. These groundwater pathways delay the arrival of nutrients and other water quality constituents, thus creating a legacy of historic land uses that eventually reaches surface water. We find that: 1) several water chemistry variables are best fit by legacy LULC while others have a stronger link to current LULC, and 2) single spatial scales of LULC analysis performed worse for most variables. Our novel combination of temporal and spatial scales was the best overall model fit for most variables, including SRP where this model explained 54% of the variation. We show that it is important to explicitly account for temporal and spatial context when linking LULC to ecosystem response. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although nutrients, such as phosphorus fertilizers, can promote crop growth while improving soil fertility, excessive nutrient inputs can produce diffuse pollution, which may results in water quality degradation. The objective of this paper is to employ the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) to estimate diffuse P effects on temporal and spatial distributions for a typical agricultural watershed and to identify the conjunct and independent influences of long-term land use and soil properties variation on diffuse P. With the validated model, the four-period simulation results (from 1979 to 2009) indicate that land use changes from agricultural development increased diffuse P yields. However, regarding updated soil properties, no significant differences of P yield were found between 1979 and 2009, demonstrating that impact of the cropland expansion were naturalized with soil property variations. An F-test was employed to assess the essentiality of all of the variables examined during the simulation period, and the test results indicated that diffuse P loading was more sensitive to soil properties than to land use. Before the P pollution control project about the land use optimization planning, it is more effective to distinguish the impacts of land use and soil properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, highly managed river basins may be particularly sensitive to future climate change. However, effects on retention-attenuation of nutrients are difficult to quantify due to the complexity and variability of relevant processes. We here use the example case of the large (covering 1.3% of the earth's land surface) and extensively irrigated Aral Sea Drainage Basin (ASDB) in Central Asia, together with 73 general circulation model (GCM) projection results and field-data driven nitrogen retention-attenuation modeling, to investigate to which extent projected future climate change (for years 2025, 2050 and 2100) can influence nitrogen loads and concentrations in the water systems of the basin. Results for the principal Amu Darya River of the ASDB suggest that riverine concentrations of nitrogen will decrease considerably throughout the coming century. This is due to projected climate-related decreases in runoff and river discharge, which increases internal nitrogen recirculation ratios, average transport distances and nitrogen retention-attenuation. However, in groundwater near the agricultural fields, there is in contrast a risk of considerable nitrogen accumulation. More generally, the sensitivity of nitrogen concentrations in the ADRB to climate-driven changes in runoff and discharge is likely to be shared with many highly managed basins in arid and semiarid regions of Central Asia, and the world.

This study assesses the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes in parts of the Southern Gangetic Plain based on samples collected from 33 dug wells. In this scope, two robust indices are utilized, namely Groundwater Quality Index (GQI) and the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) Water Quality Index (CCME_WQI), to assess the overall quality of groundwater by integrating observed water quality determinants like pH, TDS and major ion concentration. The concentration of major anions and cations is observed to be in the order of HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3- and Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+, respectively. The pH values of the analyzed samples vary between 6.2 and 7.37 during the post-monsoon (POM) period and between 6.6 and 7.9 during the pre-monsoon (PRM) period. Similarly, TDS concentrations are observed to vary between 6.7 and 1535 mg/l (POM) and 1.43 and 1327 mg/l (PRM). The values of GQI in the study area range between 10.41-108.56 and 16.03-130.06 for the PRM and POM periods, respectively. Among the groundwater samples collected during the PRM period, about 21, 73 and 6% are found to be excellent, good and poor quality, respectively. While the percentage of poor quality water for POM period is exactly the same as that of PRM, about 42 (52%) of the samples are found to be of excellent (good) quality for drinking purposes. The analysis of CCME_WQI for groundwater samples reveals that 3 (21%), 42 (36%), 33 (18%), 21 (24%) of the samples collected during PRM (POM) are classified to be of excellent, good, fair and marginal category, respectively. The spatial distribution of GQI and CCME_WQI illustrates that excellent quality water occurs primarily in the northeast part of the study area during the POM period. However, some localized patches with excellent quality are also observed in both the seasons. Results from this study will be crucial for proper utilization and management of already depleted groundwater resources of the study area.

In order to assess the effects of PES in the conservation soil area, the chemical and isotopic compositions of water from springs were characterized and the water baseline chemistry was established to provide a useful standard to monitor the water resources and to support the decision-making under current water management policies. A total of 32 water samples taken in four field surveys, during the dry and rainy season, and background chemical data from different information sources, were studied. The water salinity increases from southwest to northeast towards the urbanized area. The chemical composition of water is due to the occurrence of natural chemical interactions between water and rocks in aquifers and to the presence of effluents generated by human activities. In the forest area, water chemistry has not changed significantly over the past three decades and there are no major discernible trends in the compiled water chemistry data, suggesting that PES has contributed in part to maintain the initial condition in the aquifer recharge area. The natural reference levels proposed have allowed the current chemical conditions in the system to be understood and can be implemented to monitor water resources in the area of conservation soil in the Sierra de Las Cruces with an acceptable degree of reliability.

Fuzzy modelling to identify key drivers of ecological water quality to support decision and policy making	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												Water quality modelling is an effective tool to investigate, describe and predict the ecological state of an aquatic ecosystem. Various environmental variables may simultaneously affect water quality. Appropriate selection of a limited number of key-variables facilitates cost-effective management of water resources. This paper aims to determine (and analyse the effect of) the major environmental variables predicting ecological water quality through the application of fuzzy models. In this study, a fuzzy logic methodology, previously applied to predict species distributions, was extended to model environmental effects on a whole community. In a second step, the developed models were applied in a more general water management context to support decision and policy making. A hill-climbing optimisation algorithm was applied to relate ecological water quality and environmental variables to the community indicator. The optimal model was selected based on the predictive performance (Cohen's Kappa), ecological relevance and model's interpretability. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was performed as an extra element to analyse and evaluate the optimal model. The optimal model included the variables land use, chlorophyll and flow velocity. The variable selection method and sensitivity analysis indicated that land use influences ecological water quality the most and that it affects the effect of other variables on water quality to a high extent. The model outcome can support spatial planning related to land use in river basins and policy making related to flows and water quality standards. Fuzzy models are transparent to a wide range of users and therefore may stimulate communication between modellers, river managers, policy makers and stakeholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrogen leaching following clear-cutting and soil scarification at a Scots pine site - A modelling study of a fertilization experiment	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Boreal forest stands fertilized with nitrogen (N) might be susceptible to elevated N leaching following clear-cutting, with consequences for water quality and soil acidification. Here, we studied a forest fertilization experiment with N, 165 Hagfors, in Sweden during the first six years (2006-2011) following clear cutting. The N fertilization treatments were 0 kg ha(-1) (0 N) and 450 kg ha(-1) of N (450 N), supplied during 1981-1992 to a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand: the stand was harvested in March 2006. Following clear-cutting, disc trenching was performed and furrows (F), ridges (R) and areas in-between two furrows (IB) were created. We calculated the N leaching fluxes and ecosystem N budget during 2006-2011 as affected by previous N fertilization, disc trenching and interactions thereof, at Hagfors by the use of a process-based biogeophysical ecosystem model (CoupModel). The model was calibrated against measurements of soil water and temperature dynamics and previously reported measurements of N in soil solution, soil organic matter and vegetation biomass. Criteria for acceptance of model estimates were based on the range enclosed by the 95% confidence intervals of the mean of the field data used in calibration sampled at low frequency (1-2 occasions) and a combination of the mean error and the coefficient of the determination for variables sampled at a higher frequency (28-1921 occasions). The accepted model estimates of the mean annual leaching rates of N were 3.1 (range 1.4-22.7) and 2.4 (range 0.8-7.0) kg ha(-1) of N year in the treatments 0 N and 450 N, respectively, without disc trenching. Disc trenching increased N leaching during the regeneration phase, more so in the 450 N treatment (mean 6.1, range 1.9-16.7 kg ha(-1) of N year(-1)) than in the 0 N treatment (mean 4.6, range 1.9-12.9 kg ha(-1) of N year(-1)). Overall, differences in the posterior model parameter estimates between N treatments and disc trenched treatments F, R and IB were related to the soil physical component: the differences resulted in enhanced drainage in the disc trenched treatments. We conclude that vegetation biomass N accumulation controlled soil water N leaching, and disc trenching increased N leaching from the previously N fertilized plots at Hagfors by its effects on water drainage flow and vegetation N uptake. This finding warrants more research since N fertilization followed by soil scarification in boreal forests is a practice which may increase in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Farmer perspectives of the on-farm and off-farm pros and cons of planted multifunctional riparian margins	LAND USE POLICY												The planting of riparian margins is a policy option for pastoral farmers in response to land use induced environmental issues such as declining water quality, stream bank erosion, and loss of aquatic and terrestrial habitat. We elicited the views and experiences as to pros and cons of planting riparian margins from two sets of dairy farmers from Taranaki, New Zealand: those who are or have planted riparian margins, and those who have not yet done so. Those farmers who have planted riparian margins identified 21 positive aspects of riparian margin plantings and 11 negative aspects of riparian margin plantings. Perceived benefits identified by this group include water quality, increased biodiversity, the provision of cultural ecosystem services, immediate direct benefits to farm management and the farm system, and in some instances increased productivity on-farm. In contrast, those farmers that had fenced but not planted their riparian margins did not consider that riparian margin plantings could add further benefits to that which could be achieved by excluding stock from waterways, and associated only negative perceptions with riparian margin plantings. Planting riparian margins is not cost neutral and will not deliver anticipated environmental benefits in every situation. However, we argue that riparian margin plantings are an important ecological infrastructure investment that needs to be captured within a wider policy framework, the benefits of which extend beyond the mitigation of a single negative externality generated by land use practices, such as nutrient loss, and contribute to a multifunctional landscape.

Stressor effects on fungal communities may, however, result in changes of decomposition of plant litter and, thus, impact nutrient cycling, a key process for ecosystem functioning. We tested the impact of increased chloride and sediment levels, as well as reduced water flow velocity, on eukaryotic freshwater communities, with an emphasis on fungi, in a mesocosm experiment. Each of the three stressors was applied individually and in all combinations in a full-factorial design. Litterbags with non-sterilised tree leaves and sterile ceramic tiles were added to the mesocosms, to analyse the responses of communities in decaying plant material and in biofilms. Fungi preferably occurring in biofilms were supposed to represent indigenous aquatic fungi, while litterbag communities should be predominantly composed of fungi known from terrestrial litter. Community composition was assessed by high-throughput sequencing of amplified barcoding regions. Similarity matrices of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) tables calculated by UCLUST and CD-HIT-OTU-Illumina were significantly correlated. Preferred occurrence in biofilm and litter communities, respectively, was used for the grouping of OTUs into three ecological guilds. Stressor sensitivity varied among the guilds. While non-fungal, in particular autotrophic, OTUs responded to several treatments, two of the fungal guilds, i.e. those exclusively colonising litter and those preferably occurring on the ceramic tiles, showed no response to any applied treatment. Only fungi preferably, but not exclusively, colonising litter significantly responded to chloride addition. Their distribution patterns again correlated significantly with those of non-fungal OTUs, indicating possible interdependencies between both groups. The results indicate that eukaryotic freshwater communities are composed of different guilds, with distinctive sensitivity and tolerance to anthropogenic stressors.

Screening dense and noisy DOX-datasets with NN-blending and "dizzy" swarm intelligence: Profiling a water quality process	SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION												A novel nature-inspired method is presented in this work for resolving product/process development or improvement with design of experiments (DOX). The technique is suitable for difficult Taguchi-type multifactorial screening and optimization studies that need to simultaneously contain the double hassle of controllable and uncontrollable noise intrusions. The three-part sequential processing routine requires: 1) a regressive data-compression preprocessing, 2) a smart-sample generation using general regression neural networks (GRNN), and 3) a screening power prediction using 'reverse swarm intelligence (SI). The approach is primed to confront potential non-linearity and data messiness in the examined effects. The Taguchi-type orthogonal-array (OA) sampler is tuned for retrieving information in controllable (outer OA) and uncontrollable (inner OA) noises. The OA-saturation condition is elicited for maximum data exploitation. GRNN-fuzzification consolidates into a single contribution the uncertainty from all possible sources. The resulting 'smart' sample is defuzzified by a robust-and-agile data reduction. Screening-solution meta-power is controlled with a new SI-variant. The independent swarm groups, as many as the studied effects, are tracked toward preassigned targets, i.e. their ability to return to their host beehives. The technique is illustrated on a complex purification process where published multifactorial data had been collected for a critical wastewater paradigm and thus may be used to test the benchmark solution. However, environmental water-qualimetrics are profoundly dominated by messy data as justified in this work. We elucidate on several issues that regular Taguchi methods may be benefited by the proposed GRNN/SI processing while emphasizing the consequence of overlooking the underlying assumptions that govern standard comparison models. The new swarm itelligence method offered a practical way to estimate a first-time "soft" power measure for the inner/outer OA optimization case that was impossible with ordinary statistical multi-factorial treatments. Key performance advantages in efficiency, robustness and convenience are highlighted against alternative approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Variations in 11 water quality parameters from 15 sampling sites in Poyang Lake were investigated from 2009 to 2012. An integrative fuzzy variable evaluation (IFVE) model based on fuzzy theory and variable weights was developed to measure variations in water quality. Results showed that: 1) only chlorophyll-a concentration and Secchi depth differed significantly among the 15 sampling sites (P < 0.01), whereas the 11 water quality parameters under investigation differed significantly throughout the seasons (P < 0.01). The annual variations of all water quality variables except for temperature, electrical conductivity, suspended solids and total phosphorus were considerable (P < 0.05). 2) The IFVE model was reasonable and flexible in evaluating water quality status and any possible 'bucket effect'. The model fully considered the influences of extremely poor indices on overall water quality. 3) A spatial analysis indicated that anthropogenic activities (particularly industrial sewage and dredging) and lake bed topography might directly affect water quality in Poyang Lake. Meanwhile, hydrological status and sewage discharged into the lake might be responsible for seasonal water quality variations.																	1002-0063	1993-064X				FEB	2017	27	1					39	51		10.1007/s11769-017-0845-2								WOS:000392313900005

With the frequency of phytoplankton blooms increasing, remediation solutions are becoming increasingly popular. This study investigated the use of a peat-based floating treatment wetland (FTW) for reducing phytoplankton growth in eutrophic waters. Over a four-week period, the FTWs were able to reduce chlorophyll a concentrations by 80%, through sequestration of nitrate and phosphate and possibly due to the direct inhibitory properties of phenolic compounds. Although there are concerns about the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the FTWs, this may be more than offset by the beneficial suppression of phytoplankton growth and the resulting reduced input of `untreatable' low molecular weight DOC.

Ryan			Nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance, retention and uptake in six plant species grown in stormwater bioretention microcosms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stormwater runoff contains high levels of nutrients, and is regulated by the Federal National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to protect surface water quality. Stormwater bioretention (BR) systems are increasingly used to address these regulations. Planted BR systems remove significantly more pollutants than unplanted systems, but most studies do not attempt to verify a pollutant mass balance and seldom evaluate differences in nutrient uptake among species. This greenhouse experiment proved that an overall 98% recovery of Total Phosphorus (TP) mass over the study period was feasible for six plant species, ensuring accuracy of measurements and analyses. Additionally, it was found that Phragmites australis, Carex praegracilis, and Carex microptera uptake significantly more TP and Total Nitrogen (TN) mass into harvestable tissue than Typha latifolia, Scirpus validus, and Scirpus acutus. These results confirm that species selection can optimize nutrient retention and recovery from stormwater and decrease pollutant discharge to surface waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Plateau lake ecosystem in China is very vulnerable and especially sensitive to environmental change and human disturbance, due to its strong closeness, species simplification, oligotrophy and simple food chain. This research focuses on evaluating the quantitative and spatial relationships of land use pattern and water quality of rivers inflowing to Fuxian Lake, Chinas largest deep freshwater lake in plateau. To investigate the influence of spatial variation in land-use structures and topography on rivers water quality, the distributions of land-use types in the lakes drainage basin were obtained from satellite images, and the correlations between land-use types and inflow water quality indicators were examined by applying statistical analysis and spatial analytical function of Geographic Information System. Subarea-level analysis reveals that a land-use type could exert different effects on water quality in plains and mountains, and the effects had a connection with topographic and hydrologic factors, its mixture with other land-use types, weather conditions during field measurements, as well as its scale. In addition, a comparison of correlation coefficient data for buffer regions of different scales indicated that the effect of land-use type on inflow water quality peaked in buffer regions with a radius between 100 and 200 m. On the whole, the regions within 200 m of river banks were the key regions that affected river water quality, and thus the construction and preservation of a riparian buffer zone in these regions can provide considerable protection from the inputs of non-point source pollutants and nutrients, and important function such as water and soil conservation. Based on these, a pollution control zoning was constructed from two key pollution control zones in the north and south, a phosphate rock pollution control zone in the northeast, a water loss and soil erosion control zone in the east, and a tourism pollution control zone in the west. This research also offers valuable insights into how to carry out subarea-level prevention and control of water pollution and regional development, according to natural environment, land use pattern and characteristics of pollution sources in different pollution control zones.

From this perspective, the sustainability of a water system and its supply to end users may be classified according to the products, services, and energy necessary for its operation, which are incorporated from the corresponding socioeconomic system and form an important aspect of its evaluation. In the present study, the development of a geoinformatics tool with an emergy accounting approach and its corresponding methodology are described, focusing on a spatial-temporal analysis of water resources and their allocation to domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses. In addition, different water provision scenarios that involve several levels of infrastructure in the basin of the Upper Course of the Lerma River (UCLR) are evaluated, and existing water deficits are considered in order to assess their economic impact and offer a perspective on regional environmental sustainability. To achieve this, the water supply processes with the greatest relevance for the UCLR basin are evaluated, which include the extraction of groundwater and the treatment of surface and wastewater for subsequent use. The evaluation of the proposed scenarios indicates that the water supply system where treated water is recycled for agricultural, industrial, and urban uses (with restrictions) has the highest value according to the environmental sustainability index. Beyond this, it is possible to establish a series of strategies to transition from the current scenario where the water supply largely comes from an overexploited aquifer, to one where wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are capable of implementing additional units in their processes to achieve drinking water quality. Finally, the proposed methodology and the geoinformatics tool developed in this study showed their effectiveness as instruments for achieving an integrated management of water resources, which would facilitate a more objective decision making process based on current and projected scenarios.

Impacts of the long-term presence of buried crude oil on salt marsh soil denitrification in Barataria Bay, Louisiana	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Denitrification is typically the dominant process of nitrate removal in coastal wetlands, converting bioavailable N in surface waters into gases released to the atmosphere through microbial respiration. This critical function and valuable ecosystem service performed by soil microbes in coastal wetlands improves water quality and benefits the surrounding ecosystem. Five years after the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a layer of crude oil was found similar to 5 cm beneath the wetland soil surface in Bay Jimmy, LA. While previous research found potential denitrification in coastal wetland soils was significantly reduced immediately following oil exposure, this study sought to investigate the effects of the long-term presence of spilled crude oil on nitrate removal. Intact soil cores were collected from a salt marsh heavily oiled by the DWH spill, and a nearby, non-oiled site in Barataria Bay, LA. The presence of a layer of buried oil increased nitrate removal from the overlying water column, a proxy measure of denitrification, by 31.8% in intact cores compared to non-oiled cores. However, when the oil was thoroughly mixed through the surface soil intervals, there was an 1853% decrease in the rate of denitrification. This seemingly contradictory result demonstrates that oil buried 5 cm below the surface, and not in contact with the newly accreted soil, did not negatively affect areal denitrification rates. However, when oil was in direct contact and well mixed in the soil, denitrifiers in that part of the soil profile are still negatively affected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Condition factor, Length - Weight relationship, and the fishery of Barbus altianalis (Boulenger 1900) in Lakes Victoria and Edward basins of Uganda	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The condition, fishing effort and environmental parameters signify health of fish populations. This study characterized differences in water quality and fishing effort in the lacustrine and riverine systems of the River Nile, Lake Edward and Kazinga channel in Uganda. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences in mean relative condition among populations in the water bodies exposed to different levels of fishing effort and water quality conditions. There were significant differences in the mean relative condition (K-n) of Barbus altianalis between River Nile (mean dif 0.0880, P < 0.004) and Lake Edward and between River Nile and Kazinga channel (mean dif. 0.0796, P < 0.001). No significant difference in the mean relative condition between Kazinga channel and Lake Edward (mean diff. 0.0840, P < 0.95). Lake Edward had the highest condition (1.05), while Kazinga channel and River Nile had 1.04 and 0.96 respectively. The relationship between weight and length for each population, obtained by pooling individuals across systems was significant (P < 0.001), the length-weight allometry between the populations was also significantly different (F (2, 237) = 9.73, P < 0.001). River Nile had the highest number of fishers of 311 +/- 0.88 while the number of fishers in Lake Edward and Kazinga channel were 75 +/- 2.45 and 33 +/- 9.12, respectively. Catch rates varied between River Nile (1.92 +/- 0.59 Kg boat(-1) day(-1)) and the rest of the systems, 6.20 +/- 1.86 and 6.85 +/- 1.49 Kg boat(-1) day(-1) in Lake Edward and Kazinga channel respectively. Water quality varied greatly across all the water bodies. Dissolved oxygen was below the minimum of 5 mgl(-1) required for the physiology of freshwater fish. Conductivity was highest in Lake Edward (312 A mu S cm(-1)), followed by Kazinga channel and least in River Nile. The consistent variation in condition, fishing effort and water quality, indicates differential selective pressures faced by B. altianalis in the systems and therefore calls for concerted efforts for appropriate management measures.

However, in the north of China, using sea cages to culture this species in winter is hampered by the fact that the seawater temperature is extremely low. Here, a large scale commercial production of tiger puffer has been successfully realized using a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) from 3 October 2012 to 31 May 2013. The RAS was comprised of nine culture tanks (total water volume 200 m(3)) and stocked with approximately a total of 14400 fish (initial mean weight 160 g). The tiger puffer was hand-fed at a rate of 0.7% of total body weight per day, and the feed conversion rate was (1.21 +/- 0.3) kg kg(-1). The recycle water in RAS was treated by a sieve bend screen, a foam fractionator, a submerged biofilter, an UV sterilizer and a submersible aerator. During the whole culture period, an excellent water quality control was achieved in RAS. At the end of this experiment, the survival rate of tiger puffer was more than 98%. The final tank densities averaged 31.2 kg m(-3), and the final individual mean weight was 440 g.																	1672-5182	1993-5021				FEB	2017	16	1					107	113		10.1007/s11802-017-2802-1								WOS:000392131500014

Production Costs, Inefficiency, and Source Water Quality: A Stochastic Cost Frontier Analysis of Canadian Water Utilities	LAND ECONOMICS												This analysis employs a stochastic cost frontier to estimate relationships between source water quality, production costs, and cost efficiency in Canadian municipal water treatment facilities. Data for the analysis are obtained primarily from a census of water providers that contains detailed information on operational costs, source water quality, and treatment technologies. Results show water quality, as measured by turbidity, is a significant determinant of production costs. The estimated elasticity for turbidity is 0.1, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.06 to 0.14. We find no significant differences in cost efficiency across regions, treatment technologies, output, or turbidity levels.

Implicit benefits of nitrogen abatement are also derived and hypothesis tests concerning their hypothesized drivers are conducted. Key findings are that nitrogen removal costs increase with rising raw water nitrogen concentration coining from agricultural activities, and that network density and system size matter in determining average total costs of community water systems. Merging water systems to take advantage of scale economies may be difficult due to the heterogeneity of the sector, however.

This would not be achievable unless continuous water quality monitoring is implemented. With the recent advances in remote sensing technology, this technology could assist us to produce accurate models for estimating water quality variables in the ecosystem of wetlands. The present study was carried out to evaluate the capability of remote sensing data to estimate the water quality variables [pH, total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, chloride and the concentration of chlorophyll a] in Zarivar International Wetland using linear regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. For this purpose, spectral reflectance of bands 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the OLI sensor of Landsat 8 was utilized as the input data and the collected chemical and physical data of water samples were selected as the objective data for both ANN and LR models. Based on our results overall, ANN model was the proper model compared with LR model. The spectral reflectance in bands 5 and 4 of OLI sensor revealed the best results to estimate TDS, TSS, turbidity and chlorophyll in comparison with other used bands in ANN model, respectively. We conclude that OLI sensor data are an excellent means for studying physical properties of water quality and comparing its chemical properties.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				FEB	2017	85	3					1511	1527		10.1007/s11069-016-2641-1								WOS:000392302700010						
J	Kim, J; Park, J				Kim, Jinah; Park, Jinah			Bayesian structural equation modeling for coastal management: The case of the Saemangeum coast of Korea for water quality improvements	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												The data-driven paradigm is widely used in ocean science and includes the statistical modeling of various phenomena in coastal marine environments and data assimilation in numerical models. One of the most important challenges in the data-driven paradigm is finding the model that best approximates the underlying mechanism of a phenomenon with measurement data. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to modeling coastal marine environments using ocean observational data, and we apply it to the Saemangeum coast. There are two main advantages to the Bayesian method: domain knowledge can be encoded to prior probability, and Markov-chain Monte Carlo simulation can be used in model estimation and inference. We apply the method to estimate model parameters and predict coastal water quality and sea current for maintaining optimal coastal water quality. The threshold quantity of sea current is computed to ensure sustainable coastal development. One of the interesting results we have obtained is a flat plateau relationship between the sea current for water exchange and the level of improvement of coastal water quality. This means that coastal water quality is not always being improved, even if the amount of water exchange is increased. The computed results are in good agreement with oceanographic theory, while showing a valid difference compared to the results using the frequentist approach and probabilistic inference using the probabilistic graphical model. These results will be helpful in coastal water quality management, ultimately contributing to sustainable coastal development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is particularly true in Mediterranean climate regions where long dry periods are interrupted by strong rainfalls. Storm events remobilize particles from soils and sediments and, as a consequence, the load of particulate matter in rivers can be quite considerable, severely affecting water quality. Nevertheless, an absence of fieldwork studies exists concerning the simultaneous dynamics of mixtures of pollutants in river waters, particularly during strong rainfalls and floods. Our study assessed the concentrations of six families of pollutants, including pesticides, at these events, and compared them to those observed at drought sampling periods. We have used as model a typical Mediterranean coastal river from Southeast France, the Tet River, whose hydrodynamics and major elements fluxes have been fairly investigated. As expected, our results show that chemical mixtures due to human activities occur and that they are particularly relevant during storm events. But the results of our study argue that exceptional multicontamination phenomena actually happen more often than expected because they are linked to recurrent sudden intense rainfall events in the Mediterranean. In particular, combined sewer overflows are responsible for this major issue in urbanized areas, whereas runoff and leaching will be the most important sources of pollutant mixtures occurring at flood flow peak, After an overview of the sources responsible for chronic multiple stressors events in regions under a Mediterranean climate regime worldwide, we revisit best management measures to reduce risks from the presence of chemical mixtures in the environment.

A catchment-scale method to simulating, the impact of historical nitrate loading from agricultural land on the nitrate-concentration trends in the sandstone aquifers in the Eden Valley, UK	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Nitrate water pollution, which is mainly causedby agricultural activities, remains an international problem. It can cause serious long-term environmental and human health issues due to nitrate time-lag in the groundwater system. However, the nitrate subsurface legacy issue has rarely been considered in environmental water management. We have developed a simple catchment-scale approach to investigate the impact of historical nitrate loading from agricultural land on the nitrate-concentration"trends in sandstones, which represent major aquifers in the Eden Valley, UK The model developed considers the spatio-temporal nitrate loading, low permeability superficial deposits, dual-porosity unsaturated zones, and nitrate dilution in aquifers. Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken to analyse parameter sensitivity and calibrate the model using observed datasets. Time series of annual average nitrate concentrations from 1925 to 2150 were generated for four aquifer zones in the study area. The results show that the nitrate concentrations in 'St Bees Sandstones', 'silicified Penrith Sandstones', and 'non-silicified Penrith Sandstones' keep rising or stay high before declining to stable levels, whilst that in 'inter-bedded Brockram Penrith Sandstones' will level off after a slight decrease. This study can help policymakers better understand local nitrate-legacy issues. It also provides a framework for informing the long-term impact and timescale of different scenarios introduced to deliver water-quality compliance. This model requires relatively modest parameterisation and is readily transferable to other areas. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A microcosm experiment to determine the consequences of magnetic microparticles application on water quality and sediment phosphorus pools	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This study used microcosms to evaluate the effects of adding iron (Fe) magnetic microparticles (MPs) on water quality, focusing on P concentrations in the water column and sediment. Two treatments were considered for a constant 85:1 MP:P-Moblie molar ratio: T-W, applying MPs on the surface water layer; and T-S, applying MPs on the sediment. MP addition reduced P concentrations in lake water and sediment, with both treatments producing a mean reduction of 68 +/- 6% in dissolved inorganic P concentration (DIP) over a 70-day oxic period and reductions of 80 +/- 8% (T-W) and 80 +/- 4% (T-S) over a 5-day anoxic period. MPs also decreased reactive silicate (Si) concentrations by around 50% in both periods, but dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was reduced-by only 15% at 24 h after MP addition. Despite the marked decrease in DIP concentration due to MP addition, there was no-reduction in chlorophyll a (Chla), because post-treatment total P concentrations (>200 mu g L-1 vs. >700 mu g L-1 before treatments) remained higher than required for changes in the biological community (0.05-0.1. mg L-1). With T-S treatment, there was a reduction of 15% in P bound to Al oxides, clay minerals, and humic substances (P--> NaOH) and of 12% in labile organic P (Org-P-Labile) versus controls. P bound to humic substances (P--> NaOH,P- (Humic)) was reduced by 11-22% in both treatments. Finally, T-W rather than T-S treatments are recommended for future whole-lake applications to achieve more effective P removal from water and sediment and a higher percentage MP recovery.

Hydrological and depositional processes associated with recent glacier recession in Yanamarey catchment, Cordillera Blanca (Peru)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this study, we investigate changes in the glaciated surface and the formation of lakes in the headwater of the Querococha watershed in Cordillera Blanca (Peru) using 24 Landsat images from 1975 to 2014. Information of glacier retreat was integrated with available climate data, the first survey of recent depositional dynamics in proglacial Yanamarey Lake (4600 m a.s.l.), and a relatively short hydrological record (2002-2014) at the outlet of Yanamarey Lake. A statistically significant temperature warming (0.21 degrees C decade(-1) for mean annual temperature) has been detected in the region, and it caused a reduction of the glacierized area since 1975 from 3.5 to 1.4 km(-2). New small lakes formed in the deglaciated areas, increasing the flooded area from 1.8 ha in 1976 to 2.8 ha in 2014. A positive correlation between annual rates of glacier recession and runoff was found. Sediment cores revealed a high sedimentation rate (>1 cm yr(-1)) and two contrasted facies, suggesting a shift toward a reduction of meltwater inputs and higher hydrological variability likely due to an increasing role of precipitation on runoff during the last decades. Despite the age control uncertainties, the main transition likely occurred around 19982000, correlating with the end of the phase with maximum warming rates and glacier retreat during the 1980s and 1990s, and the slowing down of expansion of surface lake-covered surface. With this hydrological - paleolimnological approach we have documented the association between recent climate variability and glacier recession and the rapid transfer of hydroclimate signal to depositional and geochemical processes in high elevation Andean environments. This, study also alerts about water quality risks as proglacial lakes act as secondary reservoirs that trap trace and minor elements in high altitude basins. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We collected a total of 276 heterogeneous datasets with 8 water quality parameters and 25 fish species from 10 sampling sites. The self-organizing feature map (SOM) was used to cluster, analyze and visualize the heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, the structuring index (SI) was adopted to determine the relative importance of each input variable of the SOM and identify the indicator factors. The clustering results showed that the SOM.could suitably reflect the spatial characteristics of fishery sampling sites. Besides, the patterns of water quality parameters and fish species could be distinguishably (visually) classified into three eco-water quality groupS: 1) typical upstream freshwater fishes that depended the most on dissolved oxygen (DO); 2) typical middle-lower reach riverine freshwater fishes that depended the most on total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen; and 3) low lands or pond (reservoirs) freshwater fishes that depended the most on water temperature, suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand. According to the results of the SI, the representative indicators of water quality parameters and fish species consisted of DO, TP and Onychostoma barbatulum. This grouping result suggested that the methodology can be used as a guiding reference to comprehensively relate ecology to water quality. Our methods offer a cost-effective alternative to more traditional methods for identifying key water quality factors relating to fish species. In addition, visualizing the constructed topological maps of the SOM could produce detailed interrelation between water quality and the fish species of stream habitat units. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This likely lead to poor decisions regarding climate adaptation. Climate warming and farmland responses have synergistic consequences for diffuse nitrogen pollution, which are hypothesized to present different spatio-temporal patterns. In this study, we propose a modeling framework to simulate the synergistic impacts of climate warming and warming-induced farmland shifts on diffuse pollution. Active accumulated temperature response for latitudinal and altitudinal directions was predicted based" on a simple agro-climate model under different temperature increments (Delta(0) is from 0.8 degrees C to 1.4 degrees C at an interval of 0.2 degrees C). Spatial distributions of dryland shift to paddy land were determined by considering accumulated temperature. Different temperature increments and crop distributions were inserted into Soil and Water Assessment Tool model, Which quantified the spatio-temporal changes of nitrogen. Warming led to a decrease of the annual total nitrogen loading (2.6%-142%) in the low latitudes compared with baseline, which was larger than the decrease (0.8%-6.2%) in the high latitudes. The synergistic impacts amplified the decrease of the loading in the low and high latitudes at the sub-basin scale. Warming led to a decrease of the loading at a rate of 035 kg/ha/degrees C, which was lower than the synergistic impacts (3.67 kg/ha/degrees C) at the watershed level. However, warming led to the slight increase of the annual averaged NO3 (LAT) (0.16 kg/ha/degrees C), which was amplified by the synergistic impacts (0.22 kg/ha/degrees C). Expansion of paddy fields led to a decrease in the monthly total nitrogen loading throughout the year, but amplified an increase in the loading in August and September. The decreased response in spatio-temporal nitrogen patterns is substantially amplified by farmland-atmosphere feedbacks associated with farmland shifts in response to warming. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Biogeochemical and hydrological drivers of the dynamics of Vibrio species in two Patagonian estuaries	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The ecology of the most relevant Vibrio species for human health and their relation to water quality and biogeochemistry were studied in two estuaries in Argentinian Patagonia. Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were reported in > 29% of cases at the Rio Colorado and Rio Negro estuaries. Neither the pandemic serogroups of Vibrio cholerae O1, Vibrio cholerae O139 nor the cholera toxin gene were detected in this study. However, several strains of V. cholerae (not O1 or O139) are able to cause human disease or acquire pathogenic genes by horizontal transfer. Vibrio vulnificus was detected only in three instances in the microplankton fraction of the Rio Negro estuary. The higher salinity in the Rio Colorado estuary and in marine stations at both estuaries favours an abundance of culturable Vibrio. The extreme peaks for ammonium, heterotrophic bacteria and faecal coliforms in the Rio Negro estuary supported a marked impact on sewage discharge. Generally, the more pathogenic strains of Vibrio have a faecal origin. Salinity, pH, ammonium, chlorophyll a, silicate and carbon/nitrogen ratio of suspended organic particulates were the primary factors explaining the distribution of culturable bacteria after distance-based linear models. Several effects of dissolved organic carbon on bacterial distribution are inferred. Global change is expected to increase the trophic state and the salinisation of Patagonian estuaries. Consequently, the distribution and abundance of Vibrio species is projected to increase under future changing baselines. Adaptation strategies should contribute to sustaining good water quality to buffer climate- and anthropogenic- driven impacts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Understanding the links between nitrate concentration and groundwater resource is a prerequisite for assessing the sustainability of irrigated systems. The Berambadi catchment (ORE-BVET/Kabini Critical Zone Observatory) in Southern India is a typical example of intensive irrigated agriculture and then an ideal site to study the relative influences of land use, management practices and aquifer properties on NO3 spatial distribution in groundwater. The monitoring of >200 tube wells revealed nitrate concentrations from I to 360 mg/L. Three configurations of groundwater level and elevation gradient were identified: i) NO3 hot spots associated to deep groundwater levels (30-60.m) and low groundwater elevation gradient suggest small groundwater reserve with absence of lateral flow, then degradation of groundwater quality due to recycling through pumping and return flow; ii) high groundwater elevation gradient, moderate NO3 concentrations suggest that significant lateral flow prevented NO3 enrichment; iii) low NO3 concentrations, low groundwater elevation gradient and shallow groundwater indicate a large reserve. We propose that mapping groundwater level and gradient could be used to delineate zones vulnerable to agriculture intensification in catchments where groundwater from low-yielding aquifers is the only source of irrigation. Then, wells located in low groundwater elevation gradient zones are likely to be suitable for assessing the impacts of local agricultural systems, while wells located in zones with high elevation gradient would reflect the average groundwater quality of the catchment, and hence should be used for regional mapping of groundwater quality. Irrigatiori with NO3 concentrated groundwater induces a "hidden" input of nitrogen to the crop which can reach 200 kgN/ha/yr in hotspot areas, enhancing groundwater contamination. Such fluxes, once taken into account in fertilizer management, would allow optimizing fertilizer consumption and mitigate high nitrate concentrations in groundwater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These correspond with the large average concentration of total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and soluble reactive (SRP) as well as high phytoplankton density in the water column. The consistency among P concentrations, phytoplankton density and APA, together with the positive impact of phytoplankton density on total APA revealed by the structural equation modelling, (SEM), indicates that facilitated APA levels in water is an essential strategy for phytoplankton to enhance the available P. Furthermore, a positive interaction between phytoplankton APA and bacteria APA was detected, suggesting a potential collaboration between phytoplankton and bacteria to boost available P content in the water column. Both macrophyte species had a prominent performance on regulating phytoplankton proliferation. The phytoplankton density and quantum yield in C. demersum systems were all significantly lower (33.8% and 24.0%) than those in V. spiralis systems. Additionally, a greater decoupling effect of C. demersum on the relationship between P, APA, phytoplankton density, bacteria dynamic and quantum yield Was revealed by SEM. These results imply that the preferred tactic of different species could lead to the performance gap. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The present study was dedicated to assessing the spatial distribution of three heavy metals (copper, lead, zinc) in the surface soil of ten small-scale infiltration facilities, along with several physical parameters (soil moisture, volatile matter, variable thickness of the upper horizon). High-resolution samplings and in-situ measurements were undertaken, followed by X-ray fluorescence analyses and spatial interpolation. Highest metal accumulation was found in a relatively narrow area near the water inflow zone, from which concentrations markedly decreased with increasing distance. Maximum enrichment ratios amounted to >20 in the most contaminated sites. Heavy metal patterns give a time-integrated vision of the non-uniform infiltration fluxes, sedimentation processes and surface flow pathways within the devices. This element indicates that the lateral extent of contamination is mainly controlled by hydraulics. The evidenced spatial structure of soil concentrations restricts the area where remediation measures would be necessary in these systems, and suggests possible optimization of their hydraulic functioning towards an easier maintenance. Heterogeneous upper boundary conditions should be taken into account when studying the fate of micropollutants in infiltration facilities with either mathematical modeling or soil coring field surveys.

Effect of different dietary levels of commercial wood charcoal on growth, body composition and environmental loading of red tilapia hybrid	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												A 60-day feeding study was performed to evaluate the role of dietary commercial wood charcoal (CWC) in fish growth performance, body composition and water quality of finger-lings red tilapias (Oreochromis mossambicus 9 Oreochromis niloticus). Four levels of charcoal (10, 20, 30 and 40 g kg(-1)) were added to the control diet (0 g kg(-1) CWC) and fed to red tilapias (initial weight of 1.20 +/- 0.04 g). At the end of the feeding trial, the fish weight gain, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio and energy retention of the fish groups fed 30 and 40 g kg(-1) (CWC) in diet were significantly (P < 0.05) higher comparing with all other tested fish groups. Moreover, some proximate composition such as crude protein and nitrogen retention efficiency g kg(-1) of the fish groups fed on 30 and 40 g kg(-1) CWC diets showed higher values (P < 0.05) than those of other tested fish groups (0, 10 and 20 g kg(-1) CWC). Apparent digestibility coefficients of protein and dry matter were improved (P < 0.05) in CWC-tested fish groups compared to the control fish group. These data were powered by the data of the water quality that showed significant (P < 0.05) enhancement in both dissolved oxygen and ammonia concentrations by the increment in dietary charcoal levels. The above-mentioned parameters' data suggested that 30 g kg(-1) dietary CWC can be considered as a suitable level to maintain normal growth of red tilapia juveniles as well as to enhance water quality of the rearing area.																	1353-5773	1365-2095				FEB	2017	23	1					210	216		10.1111/anu.12385								WOS:000391980500020

Evaluation of nutritional and environmental variables during early larval culture of pigfish Orthopristis chrysoptera (Linnaeus)	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												Pigfish (Orthopristis chrysoptera Linnaeus) are a commonly used baitfish in the southeastern United States. Aquaculture methods for broodfish spawning and juvenile grow-out have been developed but there is still a paucity of information regarding larval culture methods. Five, short duration (10 days) experiments were conducted to determine effective strategies to yield high larval survival and growth during early development. Experiment one examined the rotifer enrichments Ori-Green, DHA Protein Selco, and AlgaMac 3050 as well as a non-enriched control along with corresponding fatty acid levels in the enriched rotifers and pigfish larvae. Experiment two evaluated three, once daily feeding frequencies of either 5, 10 or 20 rotifers mL(-1). Experiment three compared feeding 20 rotifers mL(-1) once daily to feeding 5 rotifers mL(-1) twice daily. Experiment four examined four different larval stocking densities: 50, 75, 100, or 125 larvae L-1. Experiment five examined green water strategies using either live Tahitian strain Isochrysis galbana (Parke) or Nannochloropsis oculata (Hibberd) paste at either 250 000 or 500 000 cells mL(-1) as well as a clear water control. Results indicated rotifer enrichment with DHA Protein Selco and green water application using live T-ISO at 500 000 cells mL(-1) had the highest survival of pigfish during early stages of larval culture. A once daily rotifer feeding regime of 20 rotifers mL(-1) and stocking density of 50 larvae L-1 also improved survival. These results provide producers with methods to improve efficiency for pigfish larval culture and provide researchers with new foundational data, such as potential fatty acid requirements.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				FEB	2017	48	2					434	446		10.1111/are.12891								WOS:000391960400007

In order to understand the spatial distribution and relationship of microbial communities in intensively farmed genetically improved farmed tilapia (GIFT, Oreochromis niloticus), 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing was applied to analyse the 16S rRNA gene of bacteria in intensive GIFT ponds in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China. A total of 72 747 initial sequences were obtained from four depths of pond water, from tilapia large intestines and from pond sediment. The most common phylum in all samples was Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria were the most abundant in water, Fusobacteria and Firmicutes in the large intestine and Chloroflexi in sediment samples. The sediment microbial community structure was comparatively similar to that of the tilapia large intestine. The microbial communities from different water depths were somewhat similar, especially the three most shallow samples, although the abundance of Actinobacteria gradually decreased with increased water depth. This data offer a preliminary exploration of the response mechanisms of the bacterial communities to aquafarming and contributes to the understanding of the status of bacterial communities of tilapia pond systems during the peak period of breeding from the aspect of their spatial distributions.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				FEB	2017	48	2					459	472		10.1111/are.12894								WOS:000391960400009

However, PPS are not very efficient in removing heavy metals from stormwater. A pilot scale study using zeolite or basalt as bed material in PPS removed 41-72%, 67 -74%, 38-43%, 61-72%, 63-73% of Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn, respectively, from synthetic stormwater (pH 6.5; Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn concentrations of 0.04, 0.6, 0.06,1.0, and 2.0 mg L-1, respectively) over a period of 80 h. The total volume of stormwater that passed through the PPS was equivalent to runoff in 10 years of rainfall in Sydney, Australia. The concentrations of metals in the PPS effluent failed fresh and marine water quality trigger values recommended in the Australian and New Zealand guidelines. An addition of a post-treatment of a horizontal filter column containing a titanate nano-fibrous (TNF) material with a weight < 1% of zeolite weight and mixed in with granular activated carbon (GAC) at a GAC:TNF weight ratio of 25:1 removed 77% of Ni and 99-100% of all the other metals. The effluent easily met the required standards of marine waters and just met those concerning fresh waters. Batch adsorption data from solutions of metals mixtures fitted the Langmuir model with adsorption capacities in the following order, TNF >> zeolite > basalt; Pb > Cu > Cd, Ni, Zn.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												National scale initiatives are being attempted in New Zealand (NZ) to meet important environmental goals following land-use intensification over recent decades. Riparian restoration to filter agricultural spillover effects is currently the most widely practised mitigation measure but few studies have investigated the cumulative value of these practices at a national level. We use an applied economic land use model the benefits (GHG emissions, N leaching, P loss, sedimentation and biodiversity gain) and relevant costs (fencing, alternative stock water supplies, restoration planting and opportunity costs) of restoring riparian margins (5-50 m) on all streams in NZ flowing through current primary sector land. Extensive sensitivity analysis reveals that depending on margin width and cost assumptions, riparian margin restoration generates net benefits of between NZ$1.7 billion - $5.2 billion/yr and benefit-cost ratios ranging between 1.4 and 22.4. This suggests that even when not monetising the increase in biodiversity or components of stream ecosystem health and other benefits from planting riparian strips, the benefits to climate and freshwater are significantly greater than the implementation costs of riparian restoration.

For this reason, the US FDA has promulgated the Produce Rule, mandating the testing of irrigation water sources for many farms. The rule requires the collection and analysis of at least 20 water samples over two to four years to adequately evaluate the quality of water intended for produce irrigation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of interannual weather variability on surface water microbial quality. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model to simulate E. coli concentrations in the Little Cove Creek; this is a perennial creek located in an agricultural watershed in south-eastern Pennsylvania. The model performance was evaluated using the US FDA regulatory microbial water quality metrics of geometric mean (GM) and the Statistical threshold value (STV). Using the 90-year time series of weather observations, we simulated and randomly sampled the time series of E. coli concentrations. We found that weather conditions of a specific year may strongly affect the evaluation of microbial quality and that the long-term assessment of microbial water quality may be quite different from the evaluation based on short-term observations. The variations in microbial concentrations and water quality metrics were affected by location, wetness of the hydrological years, and seasonality, with 15.7-70.1% of samples exceeding the regulatory threshold. The results of this work demonstrate the value of using modeling to design and evaluate monitoring protocols to assess the microbial quality of water used for produce irrigation.

However, the water quality of secondary treated effluents from sewage treatment plants generally does not meet the requirements of industrial water use because of the high inorganic constituents. This paper reports experimental data from a pilot-plant study of two treatment processes-(i) fiber filtration (FF)-ultrafiltration (UF)-reverse osmosis (RO) and (ii) sand filtration (SF)-electrodialysis reversal (EDR)-for treating industrial high conductivity effluents from the Xianxi wastewater treatment plant in Taiwan. The results demonstrated that FF-UF was excellent for turbidity removal and it was a suitable pretreatment process for RO. The influence of two membrane materials on the operating characteristics and process stability of the UF process was determined. The treatment performance of FF-UF-RU was higher than that of SF-EDR with an average desalination rate of 97%, a permeate conductivity of 272.7 +/- 32.0, turbidity of 0.183 +/- 0.02 NTU and a chemical oxigen demand of <4.5 mg/L. The cost analysis for both processes in a water reclamation plant of 4000 m(3)/d capacity revealed that using FF-UF-RU had a lower treatment cost than using SF-EDR, which required activated carbon filtration as a post treatment process. On the basis of the results in this study, the FF-UF-RU system is recommended as a potential process for additional applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Simulating the environmental performance of post-harvest management measures to comply with the EU Nitrates Directive	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Nitrate (NO3-) leaching from farmland remains the predominant source of nitrogen (N) loads to European ground- and surface water. As soil mineral N content at harvest is often high and may increase by mineralisation from crop residues and soil organic matter, it is critical to understand which post-harvest management measures can be taken to restrict the average NO3- concentration in ground- and surface waters below the norm of 50 mg l(-1.) Nitrate leaching was simulated with the EU-rotate_N model on a silty and a sandy soil following the five main arable crops cultivated in Flanders: cut grassland, silage maize, potatoes, sugar beets and winter wheat, in scenarios of optimum fertilisation with and without post-harvest measures. We compared the average NO3- concentration in the leaching water at a depth of 90 cm in these scenarios after dividing it by a factor of 2.1 to include natural attenuation processes occurring during transport towards ground- and surface water. For cut grassland, the average attenuated No concentration remained below the norm on both soils. In order to comply with the Nitrates Directive, post-harvest measures seemed to be necessary on sandy soils for the four other crops and on silty soils for silage maize and for potatoes. Successful measures appeared to be the early sowing of winter crops after harvesting winter wheat, the undersowing of grass in silage maize and the removal of sugar beet leaves. Potatoes remained a problematic crop as N uptake by winter crops was insufficient to prevent excessive Nor leaching. For each crop, maximum levels of soil mineral N content at harvest were proposed, both with and without additional measures, which could be used in future nutrient legislation. The approach taken here could be upscaled from the field level to the subcatchment level to see how different crops could be arranged within a subcatchment to permit the cultivation of problem crops without adversely affecting the water quality in such a subcatchment.

Compared with other environmental flow methods, this method, for the first time, integrate considering hydrology parameters and ecology attributes, quantitatively describing the relationships between species and habitat. Aquatic habitat suitability models began with one-dimensional physical habitat Simulation model (PHABSIM) at micro-scale physical habitat. Afterwards, habitat suitability models for meso- and macro-scale were developed; eco-factors indicating physical habitat and water quality situation were included; two and three-dimensional model were employed to provide the situation of eco-factors. Based on field survey or mathematical models, the state of habitat eco-factors can be obtained. By establishing habitat suitability evaluation criteria, the impact of aquatic habitats on the particular life stage of indicate species can be assessed, the effect of reservoir regulation mode and habitat restoration projections can be predicted. Here,we summarized aquatic habitat suitability models in different spatial scale, and the advantages and disadvantage, of each model were analyzed and concluded.																	1364-0321					FEB	2017	68		1				748	762		10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.138								WOS:000391899200055

Renewable energy combined with sustainable drainage: Ground source heat and pervious paving	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS					10th Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems (SDEWES)	SEP 27-OCT 02, 2015	Dubrovnik, CROATIA					Taken individually, Ground Source Heat (GSH) pervious paving systems (PPS) and rainwater harvesting are not new, but in combination, this energy-water blend is relatively recent. Sealed with impermeable geomembrane, PPS becomes a water harvesting tank and by installing GSH collectors in the base, there is the potential to sustainably heat and cool buildings, provide flood resilience and improve water quality. A review of the literature found that Coefficients of Performance suggest that such systems could be considered viable, reaching the value of 2.875 required by the EU Renewable Energy Directive, 2009. Small-scale laboratory-based test rigs of the combined system were able to reduce pollutants by up to 99% for biological oxygen demand and 95% for ammonia-nitrogen, with rare occurrences of potentially pathogenic bacteria e.g. Legionella, and low survival rates of Escherichia coli. Whilst test rigs provide valuable information, field monitoring at the building scale is the only way to validate the technology. Thus, this paper presents previously unpublished results of monitoring a combined system at the building scale which found that there is clear potential to use a clean, renewable and sustainable source of heat at the same time as providing flood resilience, water quality improvements and some amenity in a domestic setting. However, it was also found that seasonal changes and building use affected levels of comfort achievable. Lessons were learnt, such as construction strategies to optimise design, including depth of the heat collectors and the optimal surface area of the PPS available to infiltrate water.

This research is conducted to determine the concentration of selected heavy metals in groundwater around Mekong River Basin and to evaluate the potential source of heavy metals from a geological perspective in the rocky outcrops from the surrounding area. Approximately 21 sampling location from Tbong Khmum, Kandal, Kratie, and Kampong Cham in Cambodia have been selected, where sample of groundwater, sediment and rock was collected for analysis. Arsenic, chromium and lead concentration in groundwater, sediment and rock is analyzed using ICP-OES, while rock thin section is used to identify the mineralogical content in rock sample. The Interim Freshwater Sediment Quality Guidelines (IFSQG 2001) limit of arsenic and chromium exceeds in some area of Tbong Khmum and Kampong Cham. All four provinces exceeds the arsenic and lead limits in drinking water by World Health Organization Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality (WHO 2011) of 10 mu g/L (0.01 mg/L), reading for chromium did not exceed the limits of 50 mu g/L (0.05 mg/L). The result of geochemical analysis in rock samples collected from the research area shows the significant average concentration of heavy metals from different types of rock sample. The result shows that the geological background in the study area is believed has potential to influence the high concentration of As, Pb and Cr into the surrounding area; that would lead to the enrichment of heavy metal in sediment and contaminate the groundwater.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				FEB	2017	23	2					1433	1436		10.1166/asl.2017.8374								WOS:000430814700171

The study area is mostly underlain by the sedimentary rock of Belait Formation, which consists of interbedded conglomerate, sandstone, shale and coal. The sandstone layer commonly fractured with several sets of joints and became an important source of groundwater aquifer. The groundwater samples were collected from boreholes at Bukit Minyak Gas (KG-BH1 and KG-BH2) and Bukit Kubong (BK-BH1 and BK-BH2). Samples collected during month of dry season and wet season. The pH values were measured in-situ and the results were in the range of 2.41-5.90 mg/L. The Ca and Mg concentrations show seasonal variation and most of the samples from Bukit Kubong in all seasons shows values beyond the WHO guidelines (100 mg/L). Fe is dominating the cation constituents in Bukit Minyak Gas whereas, SO4 concentration recorded higher in all samples. Analysis of heavy metals also shows Ni, Pb and Zn present in significant value.																	1936-6612	1936-7317				FEB	2017	23	2					1452	1455		10.1166/asl.2017.8393								WOS:000430814700176

(b) to characterize the seasonal changes in the marsh surface water quality. (c) to address the potential environmental risk of these elements by comparison with the historical levels and global quality guidelines (i.e., World Health Organization (WHO) standard limits). (d) to define the sources of these elements (i.e., natural and/or anthropogenic) using combined multivariate statistical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Agglomerative Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (AHCA) along with pollution analysis (i.e., enrichment factor analysis) Methods: Water, sediment, plant, and fish samples were collected from the marsh, and analyzed for major and minor ions, as well as heavy metals, and then compared to historical levels and global quality guidelines (WHO guidelines). Then, multivariate statistical techniques, such as PCA and AHCA, were used to determine the element sourcing. Results: Water analyses revealed unacceptable values for almost all physiochemical and biological properties, according to WHO standard limits for drinking water. Almost all major ions and heavy metal concentrations in water showed a distinct decreasing trend at the marsh outlet station compared to other stations. In general, major and minor ions, as well as heavy metals exhibit higher concentrations in winter than in summer. Sediment analyses using multivariate statistical techniques revealed that Mg, Fe, S, P, V, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Br, Cd, Ca, N, Mn, Cr, and Pb were derived from anthropogenic sources, while Al, Si, Ti, K, and Zr were primarily derived from natural sources. Enrichment factor analysis gave results compatible with multivariate statistical techniques findings. Analysis of heavy metals in plant samples revealed that there is no pollution in plants in Al-Hammar Marsh. However, the concentrations of heavy metals in fish samples showed that all samples were contaminated by Pb, Mn, and Ni, while some samples were contaminated by Pb, Mn, and Ni. Discussion and conclusions: Decreasing of Tigris and Euphrates discharges during the past decades due to drought conditions and upstream damming, as well as the increasing stress of wastewater effluents from anthropogenic activities, led to degradation of the downstream Al-Hammar Marsh water quality in terms of physical, chemical, and biological properties. As such properties were found to consistently exceed the historical and global quality objectives. However, element concentration decreasing trend at the marsh outlet station compared to other stations indicate that the marsh plays an important role as a natural filtration and bioremediation system. Higher element concentrations in winter were due to runoff from the washing of the surrounding Sabkha during flooding by winter rainstorms. Finally, the high concentrations of heavy metals in fish samples can be attributed to bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes.																	2405-8440					FEB	2017	3	2							UNSP e00256	10.1016/j.heliyon.2017.e00256								WOS:000432016700006

In this study, the performance of phytoremediation by Salvinia molesta macrophytes on treated Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) is investigated. The objectives of the study are to determine the nutrient uptake by S. molesta from treated POME and its effect towards the biomass and biochemical content. The water quality after phytoremediation were monitored. The wastewater phytoremediation by S. molesta was conducted outdoor for 16 days in a raceway pond rig. The results showed that S. molesta achieved 95% phosphate removal efficiency from the wastewater, lowering concentration to 0.17 mg/1. Nitrate concentration was determined to be at 0.50 mg/1 at the end of the experiment. Ammonia concentration showed a dynamic fluctuation trend with average value of 2.62 mg/1. For water quality assessment, turbidity decreased from 7.56 NTU to 0.94 NTU in just 2 days' time. MLVSS analysis was significantly low by day 2 of experiment. COD removal efficiency was determined at 39%. All six water quality assay met their respective statutory discharge limit. The S. molesta cultivated in the raceway pond rig also showed increment toward the biomass gain, carbohydrate and protein at the end of the experiment. This study indicates that S. molesta plants have the potential to be used in the phytoremediation of treated POME and showed a superior biochemical composition. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The 11th hydro-morphological indicators that describe the deviation from the natural conditions of the hydrological regime, river continuity and morphological conditions have been calculated for five atypical lowland water bodies, based on the data sets generated by the Romanian National Hydrological and Hydrogeological Database. Subsequently, the values (scores) of uni-criteria indicators were used to calculate multi-criteria indicators in order to establish the final status of some elements (e.g. hydrological regime element). Most of the hydro-morphological indicators classify the analyzed water bodies mainly in quality classes I and II except some indicators in class III and IV (moderate and poor status) for example the riparian zone indicator. We used the "one out, all out" principle (the worst status of the elements used in the assessment) to classify the final hydro morphological status (in case of four out of five waterbodies the riparian zone indicator gave the final hydro-morphological status). The correct classification is important for taking measures to improve water quality. The results stress the necessity for an in-depth analysis of the link between hydro-morphological, physico-chemical and biological status as well as to further refine the hydro-morphological classification schemes at least for some river types. The final classification should be consistent across all 3 assessments required by Water Framework Directive (using hydro-morphological, physico-chemical and biological elements).																	1842-4090	1844-489X				FEB	2017	12	1					161	169										WOS:000390973500017						
J	Adams, AJ				Adams, Aaron J.			Guidelines for evaluating the suitability of catch and release fisheries: Lessons learned from Caribbean flats fisheries	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Catch and release is receiving attention as a recreational fisheries conservation tool, but data are often lacking on: the suitability of target species; location-specific factors (e.g., predator field); likelihood of community support; infrastructure capabilities; availability of suitable habitat. This is especially true where C&R fisheries are being developed because they are perceived as economically valuable, automatically self-sustaining, with low environmental impact. However, resources to support research, management, and enforcement are often lacking, leading to fisheries that are de facto C&R, with little oversight or conservation planning. This can lead to fisheries that are not sustainable due to low post-release mortality, overfishing, loss of critical habitats. In locations with limited resources, a framework is needed to maximize these resources to provide sufficient information for fisheries management and evaluation. The "flats fishery" of the Caribbean, comprised of bonefish (Albula vulpes), Atlantic tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), permit (Trachinotus falcatus), and common snook (Centropomus undecimalis), supports an economically valuable recreational fishery that is C&R in many locations throughout its geographic range. Once a fishery that received little management attention, recent research has provided sufficient information to guide conservation and management. In this manuscript, the lessons learned from >10 years of research and conservation of the Caribbean flats fishery are used to demonstrate how C&R Fishery Evaluation Guidelines (FEGs) can be applied to this and similar C&R fisheries. The FEG factors include: species suitability, habitat, water quality, fishery status, fishery capacity, socio-economics, enforcement and compliance, cultural factors, and education.

Characterizing pharmaceutical, personal care product, and hormone contamination in a karst aquifer of southwestern Illinois, USA, using water quality and stream flow parameters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Karst aquifers are drinking water sources for 25% of the global population. However, the unique geology of karst areas facilitates rapid transfer of surficial chemicals to groundwater, potentially contaminating drinking water. Contamination of karst aquifers by nitrate, chloride, and bacteria have been previously observed, but little knowledge is available on the presence of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as pharmaceuticals. Over a 17-month period, 58 water samples were collected from 13 sites in the Salem Plateau, a karst region in southwestern Illinois, United States. Water was analyzed for 12 pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), 7 natural and synthetic hormones, and 49 typical water quality parameters (e.g., nutrients and bacteria). Hormones were detected in only 23% of samples, with concentrations of 2.2-9.1 ng/L. In contrast, PPCPs were quantified in 89% of groundwater samples. The two most commonly detected PPCPs were the antimicrobial triclocarban, in 81% of samples, and the cardiovascular drug gemfibrozil, in 57%. Analytical results were combined with data of local stream flow, weather, and land use to 1) characterize the extent of aquifer contamination by CECs, 2) cluster sites with similar PPCP contamination profiles, and 3) develop models to describe PPCP contamination. Median detection in karst groundwater was 3 PPCPs at a summed concentration of 4.6 ng/L. Sites clustered into 3 subsets with unique contamination models. PPCP contamination in Cluster I sites was related to stream height, manganese, boron, and heterotrophic bacteria. Cluster II sites were characterized by groundwater temperature, specific conductivity, sodium, and calcium. Cluster III sites were characterized by dissolved oxygen and barium. Across all sites, no single or small set of water quality factors was significantly predictive of PPCP contamination, although gemfibrozil concentrations were strongly related to the sum of PPCPs in karst groundwater.

Monitoring bacterial indicators of water quality in a tidally influenced delta: A Sisyphean pursuit	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary (Delta) is the confluence of two major watersheds draining the Western Sierra Nevada mountains into the Central Valley of California, ultimately terminating into San Francisco Bay. We sampled 88 sites once a month for two years (2006-2008) over 87 separate sampling events for a total of 1740 samples. Water samples were analyzed for fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli, enterococci and fecal coliforms), and 53 other physiochemical, land use, and environmental characteristics. The purpose of the study was to create a baseline of microbial water quality in the Delta and to identify various factors (climatic, land use, tidal, etc.) that were associated with elevated concentrations of indicator bacteria. Fecal indicator bacteria generally had weak to modest relationships to environmental conditions; the strength and direction of which varied for each microbial indicator, drainage region, and across seasons. Measured and unmeasured, site-specific effects accounted for large portions of variance in model predictions (p = 0.086 to 0.255), indicating that spatial auto correlation was a major component of water quality outcomes. The effects of tidal cycling and lack of connectivity between waterways and surrounding landscapes likely contributed to the lack of association between local land uses and microbial outcomes, though weak associations may also be indicative of mismatched spatiotemporal scales. The complex nature of this system necessitates continued monitoring and regular updates to statistical models designed to predict microbial water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The increase is due to drawdown of As-polluted groundwater (As <= 5144 mu g/L) from overlying aquifers at depths 65 to 150 m deep in response to large-scale abstraction for public supply. The increase in As threatens drinking water quality locally, and by inference does so across the entire Po Plain, where natural As-pollution of groundwater (As >10 mu g/L) is a basin-wide problem. Using new and legacy data for Cl/Br, delta O-18/delta H-2 and other hydrochemical parameters with groundwater from 32 wells, 9 surface waters, a sewage outfall and rainwater, we show that the deep aquifer (160-260 m below ground level), which is tapped widely for public water-supply, is partly recharged by seepage from overlying aquifers (65-150 m below ground level). Groundwater quality in deep aquifers appears free of anthropogenic influences and typically <10 mu g/L of As. In contrast, shallow groundwater and surface water in some, not all, areas are affected by anthropogenic contamination and natural As-pollution (As >10 mu g/L). Outfalls from sewage-treatment plants and black water from septic tanks firstly affect surface waters, which then locally infiltrate shallow aquifers under high channel-stages. Wastewater permeating shallow aquifers carries with it NO3 and SO4 which suppress reduction of iron oxyhydroxides in the aquifer sediments and so suppress the natural release of As to groundwater.

J	Niu, BB; Wang, HH; Loaiciga, HA; Hong, S; Shao, W				Niu, Beibei; Wang, Huanhuan; Loaiciga, Hugo A.; Hong, Song; Shao, Wei			Temporal variations of groundwater quality in the Western Jianghan Plain, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Western Jianghan Plain (WJHP) lies in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. It has been impacted by anthropogenic activities during the past decades. The long-term variations of the WJHP's regional aquifer's hydrochemistry and groundwater quality have not been previously assessed. Sixteen physiochemical parameters at 29 monitoring wells within the Western Jianghan Plain were monitored during 1992-2010 and analyzed with multiple approaches. The confined groundwater is predominantly of the HCO3Ca-Mg type with Cl-, So(4)(2-), NH4-N, and NO3-N showing remarkable spatial variations. Correlation analysis was used to identify the origins and contamination sources of groundwater. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test revealed that pH, NO3-N, and Cl- concentrations at 27, 26 and 15 wells, respectively, exhibited significant increasing trends during 1992-2010. The increase of pH may be attributed to CO2 degassing caused by extensive groundwater extraction. Regional average NO3-N concentrations of groundwater increased coincidently with the increased use of fertilizer, which suggests that nitrate pollution is caused by agricultural activities. Abnormally high values of and SO4- at some wells were induced by industrial chemicals. In addition, the similarity of the temporal variations of the regional average of pH, NH4-N, and NO3-N concentrations in groundwater with those in the Yangtze River at the outlet of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) suggests that the variations of these parameters in the WJHP is partly due to water storage by the TGR. This study presents an analysis of temporal variations of groundwater quality in the WJHP that reveals a relation between the creation of the TGR and downstream groundwater quality. This paper's findings provide clues for measures that could be taken to protect the groundwater quality of the WJHP's aquifer.

This results in minimal or null water exchange. The sum of fish biomass and microorganisms favors alkalinity consumption and, consequently, pH reduction. It is in this context that the present study evaluates alkalinity and pH maintenance using sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) or calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) on BFT during a Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) nursery. In this study, 25 fishes/tank was distributed in nine experimental units (useful vol. 37.5 L) and the performance was evaluated at 60 days. During the assay, the temperature, oxygen and pH were maintained within the ideal range levels for Nile tilapia growth. All alkalizing compounds were able to pH and alkalinity correction, but when using NaHCO3, the alkalinity and pH were more elevated than the other treatments. Furthermore, at the beginning these assay, the total ammonia (TAN; NH3 + N-4(+)) and NO2--N accumulate and it caused a peak, but mostly experiment remained to very low levels because of the total nitrification activity, resulting in NO3- -N accumulation. Because the non water exchange, at the final experiment the ion Na+ accumulate when utilized NaHCO3, resulting in level similar to brackish water. While using CaCO3 or Ca(OH)(2), the Ca2+ ion accumulate, resulting in extremely hard water. Despite this, the fish survival was similar between treatments (about 80%). Moreover, the final weight, daily growth rate and net yield for NaHCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) they were higher than CaCO3 treatment. This may have been because of the higher total suspended solids (TSS) and lower protein content of the bioflocs in this treatment. In order to assess the possible physiologic alterations of the fish associated with the production system, the hematocrit, glycemia and plasmatic osmolality were evaluated. Furthermore, the antioxidant capacity against peroxy radicals (ACAP), lipid peroxidation (120) and catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities on the gills and liver were also evaluated. There were no differences in biochemical/physiological parameters when the different alkalizing compounds were utilized. The results demonstrate that the use of sodium bicarbonate, hydroxide or calcium carbonate is effective on the alkalinity and pH adjustments of the final proportion of 14.64 +/- 0.49, 7.18 +/- 032 e 24.09 +/- 2.32% in relation to the feed consumption, respectively. Thus, the study demonstrates that the use of NaHCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) are recommended for alkalinity and pH correction during Nile tilapia nursery on BFT systems, because of the higher growth and net yield, and this sum to less amount of these compounds may represent important economic gain. Statement of relevance: The results of this manuscript demonstrate: -Amount of alkalizing compound utilized for maintenance of alkalinity and pH -Best growth to utilize NaHCO3 and Ca(OH)(2) -The importance of evaluate the ionic concentration, specially Na+ and Ca+2, because the imbalance ionic -The difficulty to solids control in BFT system.

J	Hatami, R; Paul, W; Soofiani, NM; Asadollah, S				Hatami, Rezvan; Paul, Warren; Soofiani, Nasrollah Mahboobi; Asadollah, Saeed			Rapid bioassessment of macroinvertebrate communities is suitable for monitoring the impacts of fish farm effluents	AQUACULTURE												Development of the fish farming industry in Iran in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner requires an effective and low-cost means of regularly monitoring receiving environments. Biomonitoring using macroinvertebrates is known to be effective for assessing water quality. The problem, however, is that biomonitoring can be labour intensive and analyses can have a long turnaround time. Rapid bioassessment methods have been developed to overcome these limitations, but it is not known whether they are as sensitive to changes in water quality as are their more time-consuming counterparts. To answer this question, we compared three methods for sampling and measuring macroinvertebrates. We refer to these as the quantitative method, semi quantitative method, and qualitative method respectively. The quantitative method was a single habitat method with taxonomic identification of macroinvertebrates to genus level that counted all taxa The semi-quantitative method involved multi-habitat sampling with identification to family level and quantification as relative abundance. The qualitative method was the same as the semi-quantitative method except that incidence (presence/ absence) was recorded instead of abundance. The study was carried out at three fish farms in Iran with sampling done once per season for a year from the outfall of each farm as well as from the receiving rivers, with one sample taken upstream of the effluent discharge and two samples downstream. Analysis by permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed that the effects of three variables of season, farm, and site on macroinvertebrate communities were significant for all three methods. Qualitative sampling was the only method that showed a statistically significant interaction between farm and season as well as a difference among the sites within each farm. Although the results of a BEST (Bio-Bio) analysis showed that different families were responsible for the differences between the sites, all three methods were able to detect the differences between the sites within each farm. However, pairwise comparisons between sites within farms indicated some differences between the three methods. The quantitative method revealed fewer differences than did the other two methods. The qualitative method did not lose any important information and had the added advantage of saving considerable time and effort in sampling and enumerating. These results suggest that rapid bioassessment could be used to effectively monitor the receiving waters of fish farm effluents. Statement of relevance: This manuscript compares three methods of sampling which are quantitative, semi quantitative and qualitative methods in order to find the most efficient and cost-effective method of sampling. There is no apparent consensus on the appropriate method of collecting and measuring macroinvertebrates, in particular for investigating the effect of fish farms on the rivers. Our manuscript revealed that rapid bioassessment method as a cost-efficient and effective method can be used in order to develop aquaculture in a sustainable manner, both environmentally and economically. Therefore, authors believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication by the Journal of Aquaculture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

G.; Dickson, Malcolm; Allah, Ahmed Nasr; Al-Kenawy, Diaa; Phillips, Michael			Benchmarking the environmental performance of best management practice and genetic improvements in Egyptian aquaculture using life cycle assessment	AQUACULTURE												Egyptian aquaculture is gaining importance as an affordable and nutritious source of animal protein among Egyptians. Nile tilapia dominates production (77% of total production), followed by carps (17%) and mullets (11%). Egyptian tilapia farmers are, however, facing challenges with regards to financial viability and poor water quality. Fish farms are also contributing towards water pollution and other environmental impacts. In order to improve the situation, WorldFish launched the IEIDEAS project in 2011 with the ambition to train farmers in best management practices (BMP) and distribute the 9th generation of the Abbassa strain (G9). The present study aimed at evaluating any relative environmental gains that BMP and G9 offers compared to conventional farming using life cycle assessment (LCA). Inventory data representing 137 farmers and four groups (control, BMP, G9 and BMP + G9) were evaluated. Life cycle impact assessment results including quantitative uncertainties were then calculated and statistically tested, using Monte Carlo analysis and Wilcoxon paired significance test. Five impact categories were explored: global warming, eutrophication, acidification, freshwater consumption and land use. The G9 stain offered the greatest improvements across the evaluated impact categories, significantly reducing environmental impacts with between 12% and 36%. BMP, in the meantime, only offered significant improvements compared to the control with regards to eutrophication, acidification, freshwater consumption and land use. Meanwhile, BMP + G9 performed comparably to only G9 except for eutrophication where it had a significantly larger environmental footprint. More efficient feed utilization and higher productivity were the main reasons for the environmental improvements. Additional improvements that should be explored include improved feeds made of sustainably sourced raw materials, and better pond water management, including probiotics and paddle-wheels.

Land based on-growing of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) using Recirculating Aquaculture Systems; a case study from the Basque region (Northern Spain)	AQUACULTURE												Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is one of the most famous cold-water marine fish species. While the supply of Atlantic cod to European markets is relatively stable, this species continues to represent an interesting, and potentially lucrative, opportunity for commercial-scale aquaculture. Due to fishing restrictions and quota decreases over the last decade, the supply of Spanish-caught cod in European markets has declined, while the local demand for this species has increased. As wild-capture will not grow to meet this increased demand, land-based aquaculture of cod could represent a viable production model to satisfy demand. However, both capital investments and operation costs for a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS) farm are expected to be high, and therefore, all economic aspects must be taken into account before embarking on design or planning considerations. The influence of thermal control on growth, mortality and product quality also represent an important landmark when considering land-based aquaculture operations. The following represents a feasibility study to analyze the different economic scenarios and biological factors that can influence the business potential of growing this species in RAS. 2500 cod individuals were reared at two different thermal regimes (i.e., controlled and natural range, respectively) through 2 pilot RAS set up in the Basque region (Northern Spain). The experiment lasted 430 days. Statistical differences were found in survival between different thermal regimes but no significant differences were detected within the fall or winter seasons. Daily specific growth rates were significantly different during the summer season with some compensatory growth patterns being observed in the natural thermal regime set up. Likewise, statistical significances were found between the fat contents from both temperatures after the summer period. Conversely, no significant differences were observed at sensorial level between the samples obtained within our pilot experiment and commercial samples from wild origin. Electricity use was found to be one of the most significant economic costs to be considered. The present study represents the first technical feasibility attempt on cod in land-based aquaculture from the north of Spain and demonstrates the technical feasibility to produce on-land based cod in the region, the equivalence of growth patterns with previous studies, the usefulness of the proposed thermal regime management as a tool for this species production, and the key economic parameters and thresholds for a potential feasible commercial activity in the region. Statement of relevance: This contribution is of help for the modelling and decision-making for on land based recirculating aquaculture initiatives. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Geng, YQ; Wang, DM; Yang, WB				Geng, Yuqing; Wang, Dongmei; Yang, Wenbin			Effects of different inundation periods on soil enzyme activity in riparian zones in Lijiang	CATENA												The most important environmental processes in riparian zones are the release of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus from various organic compounds. The extracellular enzymes of soil microorganisms are involved in the bio-geochemical cycling of organic matter nutrients and may be important for regulating water quality. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether the activities of soil enzymes were affected by different inundation periods in the riparian zone and to identify major factors that influence soil enzyme activity. We subjected three study plots to different inundation conditions (long inundation, moderate inundation, and rare inundation) within the transects perpendicular to the river flow at three sites (Weijiadu, Lijiaocun, and Daxu) in Lijiang, Guilin City, China. Soil physicochemical properties, dissolved nutrient composition, and soil enzyme activities were analyzed. The activity of acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and arylsulfatase significantly increased as the inundation frequency decreased, whereas the activity of glucosidase, beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase, glycine aminopeptidase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, and dehydrogenase were significantly higher in study plots that received long inundation than in those subjected to moderate or rare inundation. Linear regression indicated that most hydrolase and dehydrogenase activities were affected by soil clay content, soil organic matter, and soil water content, among other factors. NO3--N limited the activity of acid phosphatase, L-leucine aminopeptidase, and glycine aminopeptidase. Polyphenol oxidase activity was constrained by soil water content and available potassium but promoted by NO3--N. Our study demonstrated that imposing longer inundation periods can increase soil enzyme activities. To maintain microbial activity and to minimize water pollution, it is important to reduce high NO3--N loads. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the potential ecotoxicological risk of multiple contaminants in the River Scheldt discharge into the Western Scheldt estuary	CATENA												The study site, Land van Saeftinghe, is an area within the Western Scheldt estuary with Special Protection Area (SPA) status for the EU Birds directive. We used a combination of hydrodynamic and water quality monitoring, hydrodynamic and water quality and modeling, ecotoxicity modeling and observations on the ecological status to correlate the water quality to the observed ecological status of the study site. The monitoring and modeling results show that the copper concentrations are elevated above the Maximum Tolerable Concentration (MTR) during the whole year, while zinc and cadmium show a spring peak (>MTR). Other metals, and all the measured organic contaminants where below the MTR. The peak in the three metals during springtime translates into an increase in the ecotoxicity, as expressed by the calculated multi-substance Potentially Affected Fraction (ms-PAF). The ms-PAF peaked at 25% for all organisms, and 30% for benthic invertebrates. The observed ecological status for the study site at the time of monitoring (2000) was Maximum Ecological Potential (MEP). This result seems to be in contradiction with the exceedance of the MTR for three metals during spring time. However the calculated ms-PAF during the spring peak of 25% is deemed acceptable based on current policy, therefore potential ecotoxic stress is within acceptable boundaries. The ms-PAF results therefore do not contradict the MEP status. The evaluation of the ecological status versus the water quality within the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) can be improved by using the calculated ecotoxicity (ms-PAF) instead of the water quality. We propose an additional step for water bodies which are currently 'at risk', based on their chemical status. In this additional step, the ms-PAF is calculated for all contaminants in the water phase, not discriminating between priority and non-priority substances. The outcome of this calculation defines if the water body is at risk (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Water reuse has been increasingly recognized as a sustainable water management strategy. The results of this paper have shown that the development of water reuse in China is found to have positive correlations to local water resource availability and GDP levels, and the water reuse rate in some megacities has already reached 35-60%. Centralized water reuse systems have widely gained favor. Thus, a centralized water reuse framework with three utilization patterns is proposed. Particularly, a multiple-utilization model that applies a hierarchical use structure is found to be viable for meeting multiple water quality requirements. Other patterns address environmental and cascading ways in maximizing the value of reclaimed water use. A case study in a Chinese megacity, Tianjin, is demonstrated where a large-scale centralized water reuse project with a multiple barrier treatment approach and a hierarchical distribution and use structure has contributed to water reuse development in a safe, reliable and economical manner. This paper can be beneficial to water authorities and practitioners for long-term urban water management in other rapidly developing cities and regions that have encountered similar water-related problems.

There are very few studies about lake nutrient criteria and water body classification system, which may cause difficulties in nutrient level assessment and management. This paper reviewed WQS system in the US, EU, and Japan, and then presented the development procedures for revising surface WQS in different periods in China. The amendment includes indicators, standard values, and framework of the standard system. However, current WQS set in light of the criteria and standards of the US and Europe couldn't adapt to the natural conditions of lakes in China. Therefore, by learning from the water quality criteria setting method of USA and taking the regional differences into consideration, a methodology of combining structure equation model and expert elicitation was recommended for setting WQS. Furthermore, it considered to investigate the differences (climate, elevation and geographical condition, etc.) in each region, and set lake nutrient criteria and standards on regional scale. Consequently, the proposed methodology for setting standards could be applied to each region in China. Yungui ecoregion was taken as an example for setting up the lake nutrient standards with considering TP, Chl-a, TN and CODMn, four influence factors for designated use attainment, and a suitable TP standard 0.02 mg/L was recommended by using the proposed methods.

To evaluate the feasibility of applying MD process for SGPW treatment, membrane fouling and wetting, which are barrier to its practical application, were systematically examined by varying organic and inorganic constituents, simulating the SGPW from Marcellus shale (USA). The liquid entry pressure (LEP) was first measured to predict the possibility of wetting by the chemical constituents of SGPW, and then a series of lab-scale MD and MDC experiments were performed to elucidate membrane wetting mechanisms. The results revealed that membrane wetting became more pronounced in the presence of oil and grease. The inorganic scaling induced by multivalent ions, such as barium and calcium in SGPW, also enhanced membrane wettability and led to poor permeate water quality. By integrating with crystallization, scalant loading was reduced properly and thus membrane wetting was mitigated effectively. As a result, adopting this MDC process increased total recovery up to 62.5%. Our experimental observations demonstrated that MD could be sustainably operated for SGPW treatment through optimized crystallization for scaling removal as well as effective pre-treatment for organic removal.

J	Hanson, MA; Herwig, BR; Zimmer, KD; Hansel-Welch, N				Hanson, Mark A.; Herwig, Brian R.; Zimmer, Kyle D.; Hansel-Welch, Nicole			Rehabilitation of shallow lakes: time to adjust expectations?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Shallow lake managers seek strategies to improve water quality and ecological features of these habitats, but lake responses are unpredictable and factors responsible for changes are often unclear. We summarized results of eight whole-lake rehabilitation projects in Minnesota, USA, an area with many shallow waters highly impacted by anthropogenic activities. To assess lake responses, we compared characteristics of managed sites to those of other regional shallow lakes manifesting clear-or turbid-state conditions. Managed lakes showed modest similarity to clear-water reference lakes in terms of phytoplankton (as chlorophyll a), nutrients, and submerged aquatic plants. Responses of aquatic invertebrate communities were more equivocal, with relatively little similarity to clear-water sites following management. These patterns indicate that these lakes either failed to undergo transitions to clear-water states, or that clear-water conditions did not persist throughout the 2-3 year period following treatment and prior to our evaluation. We believe these results show responses of shallow lakes that have been pushed beyond boundaries where they maintain sufficient natural resilience to resist local stressors. This means that shallow lake rehabilitation efforts will not always succeed and that, when improvements occur, management may need to be repeated to maintain favorable ecological conditions in highly modified landscapes.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2017	787	1					45	59		10.1007/s10750-016-2865-9								WOS:000390139200003

They are important links in numerous food chains and have localized behavior that can be used to assess sediment toxicity and water quality. Bioassays performed with amphipods, however, largely still use 10-42 d static tests in large volumes, require manual manipulation of samples, and employ mortality, growth and reproduction as the major test criteria, which are time and labour intensive, and can be subject to "observer bias". This work describes design and validation of a miniaturized, continuous perfusion based Lab-on-a-Chip technology for automated sub-lethal behavioral toxicity tests using the native Australian marine amphipod Allorchestes compressa. An automation module with a high-resolution USB camera, user-friendly fluidic interconnects and miniaturized 3D-printed interface was developed. To evaluate performance of the new chip-based system, median lethal concentrations (LC50) of a panel of reference toxicants obtained on this system were compared with those from tests using conventional static protocols, and were not significantly different. Automated behavioral tests were then conducted by perfusing toxicants through the chip-based device to dynamically assess the effect of toxicants on selected locomotory parameters. Results showed that the system was able to detect and automatically analyse data to assess changes in the swimming behavior of A.compressa at toxicant concentrations that did not induce mortality in test populations. For the majority of chemical stressors tested, behavioral sub-lethal changes occurred early and in a concentration and exposure time-dependent manner and could be recorded with no "observer" input. We postulate that integrated Lab-on-a-Chip systems can enable new avenues for "Early Warning" biomonitoring systems that can automate the use of sensitive behavioral indices to rapidly detect presence of toxicants in aquifers.

J	Hu, YT; Wang, XP				Hu, Yingtian; Wang, Xiaoping			Application of surrogate parameters in characteristic UV-vis absorption bands for rapid analysis of water contaminants	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL												In recent years, absorption spectroscopy is being widely used for water quality monitoring. However, much of the spectral analysis results do not provide any physical meaning and the use of traditional parameters for monitoring water quality, such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), is not a radical research method because of the large diversity of chemical components in water. Here in, we studied the absorption spectra of eight typical contaminants and proposed four integral parameters in different spectral ranges, which were relative to different functional groups. The proposed surrogate parameters can be used to rapidly analyze and predict the categories of contaminants based on their changes without using any modeling. We used a dynamic partitioning algorithm based on the fourth-order derivative spectrum to adapt the movement of absorption bands. The impact of turbidity was eliminated by deducting the turbidity component from surrogate parameters based on the proportion of four parameters in formazine turbid solution. Using this method, we conducted long-term monitoring of the wastewater released by a dyeing and printing plant. The rapid analysis and prediction potential of different categories of water contaminants was demonstrated. The prediction results can provide evidence for more targeted and detailed analysis and water quality monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The determined practical concentrations of the Fenton reagents were 5 mg/L Fe(II) and 5 mg/L H2O2, respectively. The Fenton process is a fast reaction, completed within 5-30 min (Fe(II), H2O2 = 0.2-10 mg/L; MC-LR0 = 200 mu g/L). The degradation intermediates of MC-LR by the Fenton process were firstly reported as in/z 1029.5,1011.5, 835.5, 795.4, and 783.4, associated with the diene bond in the Adda chain, then alleviate their toxicity. The effects of organic matter were examined in the range of Nak-Dong River water, as a drinking water source, monitored for six months in 2015. Fulvic acid was affected more than humic acid and natural organic matter (NOM). The degradation efficiency in the raw water was lower than that of distilled water because of the competing effect of NOM, geosmin, and 2-methylisoborneol, and the higher pH (7.64), furthermore, dissolved organic matter, geosmin, and 2-methylisoborneol was removed 7.39%, 4.28% and 12.30% after the Fenton process in the river water. The final concentration of MC-LR after treatment was under the drinking water guideline level with initial MC-LR concentration of 2 mu g/L. No acute toxicity was observed to Daphnia magna (TU = 0) after the Fenton process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Defining optimal DEM resolutions and point densities for modelling hydrologically sensitive areas in agricultural catchments dominated by microtopography	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Defining critical source areas (CSAs) of diffuse pollution in agricultural catchments depends upon the accurate delineation of hydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) at highest risk of generating surface runoff pathways. In topographically complex landscapes, this delineation is constrained by digital elevation model (DEM) resolution and the influence of microtopographic features. To address this, optimal DEM resolutions and point densities for spatially modelling HSAs were investigated, for onward use in delineating CSAs. The surface runoff framework was modelled using the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and maps were derived from 0.25.m LiDAR DEMs (40 bare-earth points m(-2)), resampled 1 m and 2 m LiDAR DEMs, and a radar generated 5 m DEM. Furthermore, the resampled 1 m and 2 m LiDAR DEMs were regenerated with reduced bare-earth point densities (5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 points m(-2)) to analyse effects on elevation accuracy and important microtopographic features. Results were compared to surface runoff field observations in two 10 km(2) agricultural catchments for evaluation. Analysis showed that the accuracy of modelled HSAs using different thresholds (5%, 10% and 15% of the catchment area with the highest TWI values) was much higher using LiDAR data compared to the 5 m DEM (70-100% and 10-84%, respectively). This was attributed to the DEM capturing microtopographic features such as hedgerow banks, roads, tramlines and open agricultural drains, which acted as topographic barriers or channels that diverted runoff away from the hillslope scale flow direction. Furthermore, the identification of 'breakthrough' and 'delivery' points along runoff pathways where runoff and mobilised pollutants could be potentially transported between fields or delivered to the drainage channel network was much higher using LiDAR data compared to the 5 m DEM (75-100% and 0-100%, respectively). Optimal DEM resolutions of 1-2 m were identified for modelling HSAs, which balanced the need for microtopographic detail as well as surface generalisations required to model the natural hillslope scale movement of flow. Little loss of vertical accuracy was observed in 1-2 m LiDAR DEMs with reduced bare-earth point densities of 2-5 points m(-2), even at hedgerows. Further improvements in HSA models could be achieved if soil hydrological properties and the effects of flow sinks (filtered out in TWI models) on hydrological connectivity are also considered.

Produced water treatment by membranes: A review from a colloidal perspective	JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE												While the world faces an increased scarcity in fresh water supply, it is of great importance that water from industry and waste streams can be treated for re-use. One of the largest waste streams in the oil and gas industry is produced water. After the phase separation of oil and gas, the produced water is left. This mixture contains dissolved and dispersed hydrocarbons, surfactants, clay particles and salts. Before this water can be used for re-injection, irrigation or as industrial water, it has to be treated. Conventional filtration techniques such as multi media filters and cartridge filters, are able to remove the majority of the contaminants, but the smallest, stabilized oil droplets (<10 mu m) remain present in the treated water. In recent years, research has focused on membranes to remove these small oil droplets, because this technology requires no frequent replacement of filters and the water quality after treatment is better. Membranes however suffer from fouling by the contaminants in produced water, leading to a lower clean water flux and increased energy costs. Current research on produced water treatment by membranes is mainly focused on improving existing processes and developing fouling-resistant membranes. Multiple investigations have determined the importance of different factors (such as emulsion properties and operating conditions) on the fouling process, but understanding the background of fouling is largely absent. In this review, we describe the interaction between the membrane and a produced water emulsion from a colloidal perspective, with the aim to create a clear framework that can lead to much more detailed understanding of membrane fouling in produced water treatment. Better understanding of the complex interactions at the produced water/membrane interface is essential to achieve more efficient applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Sen, ZK				Sen, Zekai			Hydrological trend analysis with innovative and over-whitening procedures	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Different statistical methodologies can be employed to identify possible trend components in any hydro-meteorological time series. A pre-whitening (P-W) procedure has been suggested to reduce the serial correlation effect on Mann-Kendall (M-K) trend analysis. In this paper, instead of P-W, an over-whitening (O-W) procedure is suggested, which generates serially independent series with the same trend slope value. Analytically necessary formulations for O-W are presented with a non-parametric but simple innovative trend assessment procedure, which are supported by extensive simulation studies. The applications of the methodology are presented for eight factual time series records from tropical, temperate and arid regions including temperature, rainfall, streamflow, relative humidity and CO2 concentrations for different short and long durations. Relative humidity and CO2 records are monthly time series and, hence, there are trend and periodicity components. It is noticed in all cases that the natural trends remain as they were after the O-W procedure, thus providing an opportunity to determine reliably the trends embedded even in the serially dependent series. The O-W procedure is applicable even in the cases of periodicity in the original records.																	0262-6667	2150-3435				FEB	2017	62	2					294	305		10.1080/02626667.2016.1222533								WOS:000392602000011

Modeling yield and biomass responses of maize cultivars to climate change under full and deficit irrigation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												With as much as 4.8 degrees C increase in air temperature by end of 21st century, new crop cultivars are needed for adapting to the new climate. The objective of this study was to identify maize (Zea mays L) cultivar parameters that maintain yield under projected climate for late in the 21st century under full and deficit irrigation in a semi-arid region. The Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) was calibrated with four years of maize data from northeastern Colorado, USA, under various irrigation conditions and was then used to simulate climate change effects on maize production with current management practices. Results showed that projected climate change decreased yield by 21% and biomass by 7% late in the 21st century (2070-2091) under full irrigation, compared to yield in the current climate (1992-2013). Under deficit irrigation, the corresponding reductions were 14% and 3%, respectively. Using the cultivar parameters calibrated with RZWQM2 for southern Colorado condition did not show yield decrease under future climate, but it simulated much lower yield under current climate in northeastern Colorado. A cultivar from the DSSAT (Decision Support Systems for Agrotechnology Transfer) crop database (GL 482) produced similar yield to experimental data under current climate and increased yield by 4% at full irrigation under future climate in northeastern Colorado. Using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), we also identified 70 cultivars with longer maturity duration (between silking and physiological maturity) and higher grain filling rate for mitigating climate change effects on maize production. These two identified traits can guide plant breeders in developing cultivars for the future. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Wooldridge, SA				Wooldridge, Scott A.			Preventable fine sediment export from the Burdekin River catchment reduces coastal seagrass abundance and increases dugong mortality within the Townsville region of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The coastal seagrass meadows in the Townsville region of the Great Barrier Reef are crucial seagrass foraging habitat for endangered dugong populations. Deteriorating coastal water quality and in situ light levels reduce the extent of these meadows, particularly in years with significant terrestrial runoff from the nearby Burdekin River catchment. However, uncertainty surrounds the impact of variable seagrass abundance on dugong carrying capacity. Here, I demonstrate that a power-law relationship with exponent value of -1 (R-2 similar to 0.87) links mortality data with predicted changes in annual above ground seagrass biomass. This relationship indicates that the dugong carrying capacity of the region is tightly coupled to the biomass of seagrass available for metabolism. Thus, mortality rates increase precipitously following large flood events with a response lag of <12-months. The management implications of this result are discussed in terms of climate scenarios that indicate an increased future likelihood of extreme flood events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial and temporal microbial pollution patterns in a tropical estuary during high and low river flow conditions	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Spatial and temporal patterns of coastal microbial pollution are not well documented. Our study examined these patterns through measurements of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), nutrients, and physiochemical parameters in Hilo Bay, Hawai'i, during high and low river flow. >40% of samples tested positive for the human-associated Bacteroides marker, with highest percentages near rivers. Other FIB were also higher near rivers, but only Clostridium perfringens concentrations were related to discharge. During storms, FIB concentrations were three times to an order of magnitude higher, and increased with decreasing salinity and water temperature, and increasing turbidity. These relationships and high spatial resolution data for these parameters were used to create Enterococcus spp. and C. perfringens maps that predicted exceedances with 64% and 95% accuracy, respectively. Mapping microbial pollution patterns and predicting exceedances is a valuable tool that can improve water quality monitoring and aid in visualizing FIB hotspots for management actions.

The biogeochemical module accounts for nitrogen and phosphorus and includes the water column and upper sediment layer. The simulations showed that water circulation and the seasonal patterns of nutrients, phytoplankton and dissolved oxygen were satisfactorily reproduced. Model results indicate that water circulation in the lagoon is driven mainly by tide and wind. Plankton primary production is co-limited by phosphorus and nitrogen, and is highest in the inner part of the lagoon, due to the combined effects of high water residence time and high nutrient inputs from the boundary. However, a sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of exchanges with the Mediterranean Sea in maintaining a high level of productivity. Intensive use of fertilizers in the catchment area has a significant effect on phytoplankton biomass increase. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Characterizing light attenuation within Northwest Florida Estuaries: Implications for RESTORE Act water quality monitoring	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Water Quality (WQ) condition is based on ecosystem stressor indicators (e.g. water clarity) which are biogeochemically important and critical when considering the Deepwater Horizon oil spill restoration efforts under the 2012 RESTORE Act. Nearly all of the proposed RESTORE projects list restoring WC as a goal, but 90% neglect water clarity. Here, dynamics of optical constituents impacting clarity are presented from a 2009-2011 study within Pensacola, Choctawhatchee, St. Andrew and St Joseph estuaries (targeted RESTORE sites) in Northwest Florida. Phytoplankton were the smallest contribution to total absorption (a(t-w)PAR) at 412 nm (5-11%), whereas colored dissolved organic matter was the largest (61-79%). Estuarine a(t-w)PAR was significantly related to light attenuation (K(d)PAR), where individual contributors to clarity and the influence of climatic events were discerned. Provided are conversion equations demonstrating interoperability of clarity indicators between traditional State-measured WQ measures (e.g. secchi disc), optical constituents, and even satellite remote sensing for obtaining baseline assessments.

F.; Piepho, Hans-Peter; Schmitter, Petra; Hilger, Thomas; Cadisch, Georg			Quantifying uncertainty on sediment loads using bootstrap confidence intervals	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Load estimates are more informative than constituent concentrations alone, as they allow quantification of on-and off-site impacts of environmental processes concerning pollutants, nutrients and sediment, such as soil fertility loss, reservoir sedimentation and irrigation channel siltation. While statistical models used to predict constituent concentrations have been developed considerably over the last few years, measures of uncertainty on constituent loads are rarely reported. Loads are the product of two predictions, constituent concentration and discharge, integrated over a time period, which does not make it straightforward to produce a standard error or a confidence interval. In this paper, a linear mixed model is used to estimate sediment concentrations. A bootstrap method is then developed that accounts for the uncertainty in the concentration and discharge predictions, allowing temporal correlation in the constituent data, and can be used when data transformations are required. The method was tested for a small watershed in Northwest Vietnam for the period 2010-2011. The results showed that confidence intervals were asymmetric, with the highest uncertainty in the upper limit, and that a load of 6262 Mg year(-1) had a 95% confidence interval of (4331, 12 267) in 2010 and a load of 5543Mg an interval of (3593, 8975) in 2011. Additionally, the approach demonstrated that direct estimates from the data were biased downwards compared to bootstrap median estimates. These results imply that constituent loads predicted from regression-type water quality models could frequently be underestimating sediment yields and their environmental impact.

Moreover, it is also unclear whether the effects of plant litter submergence depend on other factors such as the duration of litter submergence, water source or litter species identity. Here we conducted a greenhouse experiment by submerging the litter of 7 wetland plant species into three types of water substrates and monitoring changes in water nutrient concentrations. Litter submergence affected water quality positively via decreasing the concentration of nitrate nitrogen and negatively via increasing the concentrations of total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and total phosphorus. The effects of litter submergence depended on the duration of litter submergence, the water source, the litter species identity, and the plant life form. Different plant species had different effects on the water nutrient concentrations during litter submergence, and the effects of floating plants might be more negative than that of emergent plants. These results are novel evidence of how the submergence of different plant (life form) litter may affect the purification function of constructed wetlands. For water at low eutrophication levels, submerging a relative small amount of plant litter might improve water quality, via benefiting the denitrification process in water. These findings emphasized the management of floating plant litter (a potential removal) during the maintenance of human-controlled wetland ecosystems and provided a potential tool to improve the water quality of constructed wetlands via submerging plant litter of different types.																	1932-6203					JAN 27	2017	12	1							e0171019	10.1371/journal.pone.0171019								WOS:000396211400012	28129405

'Red Edge' to fertigation with leachates vs. conventional fertigation: Sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												The sequential reuse of drainage water in greenhouse horticulture production to grow successively more salt tolerant crops is proposed as a sustainable alternative to recirculation systems when the irrigation water quality is low. This practice is known as Serial Biological Concentration or Integrated Farm Drainage Management. The objective of this assay was to assess the nutritional responses of Cordyline fruticosa var. 'Red Edge' (a semi-tolerant crop) fertigated with leachates from Citrullus lanatus (horticultural crop) cultivated on rockwool, compared to a conventional fertigation. Four treatments were tested: T-1 (nutritionally balanced control or standard nutrient solution, with an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2.5 dS m(-1)); T-2 (saline control; T-2 diluted to an EC of 1.5 dS m(-1), afterwards, NaCl was added to achieve 2.5 dS m(-1)); T-3 (pure leachate from the hydroponic culture of C. lanatus), and T-4 (diluted leachates, T-3 diluted with irrigation water to 2.5 dS m(-1)). At the end of the trial, biometric parameters were determined and Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations and the accumulation In photosynthetic organs (leaves), conductive organs (stems and petioles) and absorption organs (roots) were measured. The treatments tested had no effect on the number of leaves, leaf area per plant, leaf size, plant fresh and dry weight and shoot:root dry weight ratio. Nevertheless, the plants fertigated With pure leachates were significantly smaller. Regarding the plants' fresh:dry weight ratio, this was significantly lower when plants were fertigated with pure leachates than with diluted leachates. The use of pure leachates does not cause an increment in total Na+ accumulation with respect to the nutritionally balanced control because Na+ concentration increases only in sterns and petioles. Total K+ accumulation decreased when plants were irrigated with solutions with high concentrations of NaCI. The high Ca2+ concentration in the non-diluted leachate led to a high total Ca2+ accumulation. Total Mg2+ accumulation was affected negatively by Ca2+ uptake. It can be concluded that diluted leachates from C. lanatus can be used for the fertigation of C. fruticosa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ellis, H; Schoenberger, E				Ellis, Hugh; Schoenberger, Erica			On the Identification of Associations between Five World Health Organization Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Phenotypes and Six Predictors in Low and Middle-Income Countries	PLOS ONE												Background According to the most recent estimates, 842,000 deaths in low-to middle-income countries were attributable to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene in 2012. Despite billions of dollars and decades of effort, we still lack a sound understanding of which kinds of WASH interventions are most effective in improving public health outcomes, and an important corollary-whether the right things are being measured. The World Health Organization (WHO) has made a concerted effort to compile comprehensive data on drinking water quality and sanitation in the developing world. A recent 2014 report provides information on three phenotypes (responses): Unsafe Water Deaths, Unsafe Sanitation Deaths, Unsafe Hygiene Deaths; two grouped phenotypes: Unsafe Water and Sanitation Deaths and Unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Deaths; and six explanatory variables (predictors): Improved Sanitation, Unimproved Water Source, Piped Water To Premises, Other Improved Water Source, Filtered and Bottled Water in the Household and Handwashing. Methods and Findings Regression analyses were performed to identify statistically significant associations between these mortality responses and predictors. Good fitted-model performance required: (1) the use of population-normalized death fractions as opposed to number of deaths; (2) transformed response (logit or power); and (3) square-root predictor transformation. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the relationships and countries being studied, these models exhibited remarkable performance and explained, for example, about 85% of the observed variance in population-normalized Unsafe Sanitation Death fraction, with a high F-statistic and highly statistically significant predictor p-values. Similar performance was found for all other responses, which was an unexpected result (the expected associations between responses and predictors-i.e., water-related with water-related, etc. did not occur). The set of statistically significant predictors remains the same across all responses. That is, Unsafe Water Source (UWS), Improved Sanitation (IS) and Filtered and Bottled Water in the Household (FBH) were the only statistically significant predictors whether the response was Unsafe Sanitation Death Fraction, Unsafe Hygiene Death Fraction or Unsafe Water Death Fraction. Moreover, the fraction of variance explained for all fitted models remained relatively high (adjusted R-2 ranges from 0.7605 to 0.8533). We find that two of the statistically significant predictors-Improved Sanitation and Unimproved Water Sources-are particularly influential. We also find that some predictors (Piped Water to Premises, Other Improved Water Sources) have very little explanatory power for predicting mortality and one (Other Improved Water Sources) has a counterintuitive effect on response (Unsafe Sanitary Death Fraction increases with increases in OIWS) and one predictor (Hand Washing) to have essentially no explanatory usefulness. Conclusions Our results suggest that a higher priority may need to be given to improved sanitation than has been the case. Nevertheless, while our focus in this paper is mortality, morbidity is a staggering consequence of inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene, and lower impact on mortality may not mean a similarly low impact on morbidity. More specifically, those predictors that we found uninfluential for predicting mortality-related responses may indeed be important when morbidity is the response.																	1932-6203					JAN 26	2017	12	1							e0170451	10.1371/journal.pone.0170451								WOS:000396176100108	28125625					
J	Jaddi, NS; Abdullah, S; Malek, MA				Jaddi, Najmeh Sadat; Abdullah, Salwani; Malek, Marlinda Abdul			Master-Leader-Slave Cuckoo Search with Parameter Control for ANN Optimization and Its Real-World Application to Water Quality Prediction	PLOS ONE												Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been employed to solve a broad variety of tasks. The selection of an ANN model with appropriate weights is important in achieving accurate results. This paper presents an optimization strategy for ANN model selection based on the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm, which is rooted in the obligate brood parasitic actions of some cuckoo species. In order to enhance the convergence ability of basic CS, some modifications are proposed. The fraction P-a of the n nests replaced by new nests is a fixed parameter in basic CS. As the selection of Pa is a challenging issue and has a direct effect on exploration and therefore on convergence ability, in this work the Pa is set to a maximum value at initialization to achieve more exploration in early iterations and it is decreased during the search to achieve more exploitation in later iterations until it reaches the minimum value in the final iteration. In addition, a novel master-leader-slave multi-population strategy is used where the slaves employ the best fitness function among all slaves, which is selected by the leader under a certain condition. This fitness function is used for subsequent Levy flights. In each iteration a copy of the best solution of each slave is migrated to the master and then the best solution is found by the master. The method is tested on benchmark classification and time series prediction problems and the statistical analysis proves the ability of the method. This method is also applied to a real-world water quality prediction problem with promising results.																	1932-6203					JAN 26	2017	12	1							e0170372	10.1371/journal.pone.0170372								WOS:000396176100116	28125609

With the self learning and memory abilities of neural networks (NN), handling uncertainty capacity of fuzzy logic (FL), analyzing local details superiority of wavelet transform (WT) and global search of genetic algorithm (GA), the proposed hybrid intelligent model can extract the dynamic behavior and complex interrelationships from various water quality variables. For finding the optimal values for parameters of the proposed FWNN, a hybrid learning algorithm integrating an improved genetic optimization and gradient descent algorithm is employed. The results show, compared with NN model (optimized by GA) and kinetic model, the proposed FWNN model have the quicker convergence speed, the higher prediction performance, and smaller RMSE (0.080), MSE (0.0064), MAPE (1.8158) and higher R-2 (0.9851) values. which illustrates FWNN model simulates effluent DMP more accurately than the mechanism model.

Here, we demonstrate two new 16S rDNA primer sets, which are compatible with NGS approaches and are primarily for use in water quality studies. Compared to 16S rRNA gene based universal primers, in silico and experimental analyses demonstrated that the new primers showed increased specificity for the Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla, allowing increased sensitivity for the detection, identification and relative quantification of toxic bloom-forming microalgae, microbial water quality bioindicators and common pathogens. Significantly, Cyanobacterial and Proteobacterial sequences accounted for ca. 95% of all sequences obtained within NGS runs (when compared to ca. 50% with standard universal NGS primers), providing higher sensitivity and greater phylogenetic resolution of key water quality microbial groups. The increased selectivity of the new primers allow the parallel sequencing of more samples through reduced sequence retrieval levels required to detect target groups, potentially reducing NGS costs by 50% but still guaranteeing optimal coverage and species discrimination.

J	Houle, JJ; Ballestero, TP; Puls, TA				Houle, James J.; Ballestero, Thomas P.; Puls, Timothy A.			The Performance Analysis of Two Relatively Small Capacity Urban Retrofit Stormwater Controls	JOURNAL OF WATER MANAGEMENT MODELING												This paper details field investigations that were conducted on the performance of small capacity urban retrofit stormwater control measures. The objective of the two year study (2013-2015) was to provide performance data on stormwater retrofits that could not be fully sized according to conventional standards due to space constraints. In many states performance credits are not granted to stormwater management controls that are not designed to manage regionally derived water quality volumes. In retrofit applications there may exist numerous limitations to conventionally sized systems such as limited rights of way, setback distances or existing utilities. The larger scale objective of green infrastructure implementation is to improve receiving water quality and therefore even undersized systems, to some extent, meet this objective. This study introduces data on two systems: an innovative bioretention design with a water treatment residual amended filter media and an internal storage reservoir; and an undersized linear subsurface gravel wetland sized to optimize both phosphorus and nitrogen removal. The systems were retrofitted into existing developed areas and were sized at less than the water quality volume due to limited space at each location. The bioretention system (IBSC) was constructed in a commercial area in the town of Durham, NH in summer 2011 and the subsurface gravel wetland system (SGWSC) was constructed in a narrow drainage right of way in a residential neighbourhood of Durham, NH in the fall of 2013. Sediment and metal removals for both undersized systems were high with median removal efficiencies in the SGW of 75% for both total suspended solids (TSS) and total zinc (TZn). The Durham IBSC recorded median removal efficiency (RE) of 86% for TSS and TZn. Total phosphorus (TP) REs were higher than conventional bioretention systems with the subsurface gravel wetland system achieving a median RE of 53% and the Durham IBSC achieving a median RE of 40% for TP. Both systems reduced total nitrogen (TN) by approximately 20% (23% for SGWSC and 21% for Durham IBSC) with median effluent concentrations of 1.4 mg/L.

The aim of this study was to investigate the numerical relationships of FRNA-bacteriophage genotypes, adenovirus 41, and human adenoviruses (HADV) in Mexican surface water systems to assess sewage contamination. We studied the presence of HADV, HADV41 and FRNA bacteriophage genotypes in water samples and quantified by qPCR and RT-qPCR. Virus and water quality indicator variances, as analyzed by principal component analysis and partial least squared regression, followed along the major percentiles of water faecal enterococci. FRNA bacteriophages adequately deciphered viral and point source water contamination. The strongest correlation for HADV was with FRNA bacteriophage type II, in water samples higher than the 50 th percentiles of faecal enterococci, thus indicating urban pollution. FRNA bacteriophage genotypes I and III virus indicator performances were assisted by their associations with electrical conductivity and faecal enterococci. In combination, our methods are useful for inferring water quality degradation caused by sewage contamination. The methods used have potential for determining source contamination in water and, specifically, the presence of enteric viruses where clean and contaminated water have mixed.

J	Kasuga, H; Takaya, M				Kasuga, Hidefumi; Takaya, Masaki			Does inequality affect environmental quality? Evidence from major Japanese cities	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												This study investigates whether income inequality affects environmental degradation. We use city-level data in Japan, where local governments have limited authority and often use voluntary agreements with private firms. We test the hypothesis that inequality weakens residents' bargaining power over polluters and has a negative effect on environmental quality. Our results show that inequality negatively affected air quality in residential and commercial areas during the 1990s but not in industrial areas. This evidence suggests that the inequality-pollution relationship is not just a correlation but reflects a causal effect of residents' bargaining power on environmental quality. This implies that equal communities can pressure firms into accepting pollution prevention agreements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The case of the Cleaner Production Center at the University of Cienfuegos in Cuba, a country in transition	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Universities are key stakeholders in teaching, researching and supporting the implementation of cleaner production activities. This case study discusses the experience of establishing and operating the Cleaner Production Center at the University of Cienfuegos (Cuba). Establishing, starting-up and running the center during its first four years of activity was supported by two projects targeted to inter-university cooperation. The collaboration allowed to establish a master program on cleaner production which acts as a bridge between the university, and the production industry and the services sector in the province of Cienfuegos. Currently 32 students from the first two promotions graduated and the program of two other promotions is ongoing. The master thesis research works are defined improving the environmental performance of the companies or organizations the student originate from. This results in a measurable improvement of the air and surface water quality in Cienfuegos city. An estimated yearly reduction of the emission of 60,000 ton of carbon dioxide equivalents and of 400 MWh at a cement plant have been realized. Research activities currently target the pollution inventory of Cienfuegos, energy production from local biomass, and establishing indicators for sustainable development for Cienfuegos. The inter-university collaboration resulted in several publications in international peer reviewed journals. The successful inter-university North South collaboration between Cuba and Belgium, targeted at capacity building, transfer of experience and expertise, proved to be most crucial during these first years the center was active. It allowed generating the necessary funds which are often difficult to raise in developing countries. Therefore this is a unique case of building academic experience on cleaner production.

J	Chrispim, MC; Nolasco, MA				Chrispim, Mariana Cardoso; Nolasco, Marcelo Antunes			Greywater treatment using a moving bed biofilm reactor at a university campus in Brazil	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Water reuse can contribute as an important approach and practice to the reduction of the pressures on water resources lowering the demand for potable water for purposes that do not require water's high quality. However the greywater reuse has been rarely applied in Brazil. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to evaluate a greywater collection and treatment system from lavatories, showers and washing machine aiming the non-potable reuse. The objectives were to characterize the quality and quantity of greywater from different sources, to monitor a pilot system for synthetic greywater treatment and to analyze the quality of the effluent after treatment. The pilot system implemented in a building at University of Sao Paulo allowed to segregate greywater collection and characterization. To evaluate the greywater production water flow meters were installed in the water inlet of each greywater source. The treatment system included a moving bed biofilm reactor and a settling tank at pilot scale. The evaluation of greywater treatment was conducted based on the monitoring of physicochemical and microbiological water quality parameters during the operation of the experimental system. Based on the results, amongst the three greywater sources, the water from showers had the highest E. coli concentration while the lavatories water had the highest total coliforms concentration. The removal efficiencies of BOD and COD were 59% e 70% respectively. The phosphorus removal during the experimental period was low. Nevertheless the water quality produced is viable to be applied for outdoor purposes- landscape and garden irrigation in household, commercial and institutional buildings and the results were satisfactory according to Brazilian standard. The treatment showed stability and reliability ensuring the potential for a safe reuse if appropriate operation and monitoring of the treatment system is performed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Pedersen, LF; Henriksen, NH				Pedersen, Lars-Flemming; Henriksen, Niels Henrik			Semi-continuously addition of peracetic acid to a flow-through fish farm	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												Seasonal occurrence of skin and gill parasites in fish ponds can substantially affect fish performance by reduced growth and increased mortality and hence the economic returns of aquaculture systems. To minimize loss of fish, preventive and curative water treatments are typically applied by adding sodium chloride and/or formalin into the ponds. This note from the field describes a simple alternative method to improve water quality in a Danish flow through fish farm. Instead of periodic formalin baths/flushes in all ponds, peracetic acid (PAA) was continuously added from a mixing tank to the common water inlet during daytime throughout the spring and summer season. The method was tested on a commercial organic flow through trout farm, and included verification of PAA residuals and distribution in the makeup water, within ponds and in the effluent from the fish farm. PAA was found to be evenly distributed to the ponds, achieved and maintained at concentrations around 0.10-0.15 mg PAA/1 corresponding to aimed values. PAA degraded within the fish ponds and negligible amounts of PAA were measured in the discharge. The economic and environmental feasibility of the applied low practical methods was demonstrated as white spot disease outbreak was absent throughout the season without using any formalin.

Molecular and Spectroscopic Characterization of Water Extractable Organic Matter from Thermally Altered Soils Reveal Insight into Disinfection Byproduct Precursors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												To characterize the effects of thermal-alteration on water extractable organic matter (WEOM),-Soil samples were heated in a laboratory at 225, 350, and 500 degrees C. Next, heated and unheated soils were leached, filtered, and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration, optical properties, molecular size distribution, molecular composition, and disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation following the addition of chlorine. The soils heated to 225 degrees C leached the greatest DOC and had the highest C- andi N-DBP precursor reactivity per unit carbon compared to the unheated material or soils heated to 350 or 500 degrees C. The molecular weight of the soluble compounds decreased with increasing heating temperature. Compared to the unheated soil leachates, all DBP yields were higher for the leachates of soils heated to 225 degrees C. However, only haloacetonitrile yields (mu g/mg(C)) were higher for leachates of the soils heated to 350 degrees C, whereas trihalomethane, haloacetic acid and chloropicrin yields were lower compared to Unheated soil leachates.: Soluble N-containing compounds comprised a high number of molecular formulas for leachates of heated soils, which may explain the higher yield of haloacetonitriles for heated soil leachates. Overall, heating soils altered the quantity, quality, and reactivity, of the WEOM pool. These results May be useful for inferring how thermal alteration of soil by wildfire can affect water quality.

Membranes that have the ability to self-heal would recover their original rejection levels autonomously, bypassing the need for costly integrity monitoring and membrane replacement practices. Herein, we fabricated hydrogel pore-filled membranes via in situ graft polymerization of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) onto microporous poly(ether sulfone) (PES) substrates and successfully demonstrated their self-healing ability. Covalent attachment of the hydrogel to the substrate was essential for stable membrane performance. The membranes autonomously restore their particle rejection up to 99% from rejection levels as low as 30% after being physically damaged. We attribute the observed self-healing property to swelling of the pore-filling hydrogel into the damage site, strong hydrogen bonding, and molecular interdiffusion. The results of this study show that hydrogel pore-filled membranes are a promising new class of materials for fabricating self-healing membranes.

Evaluation of a Silver-Embedded Ceramic Tablet as a Primary and Secondary Point-of-Use Water Purification Technology in Limpopo Province, S. Africa	PLOS ONE												The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes point-of-use water treatment (PoUWT) technologies as effective means to improve water quality. This paper investigates long-term performance and social acceptance of a novel PoUWT technology, a silver-infused ceramic tablet, in Limpopo Province, South Africa. When placed in a water storage container, the silver-embedded ceramic tablet releases silver ions into water, thereby disinfecting microbial pathogens and leaving the water safe for human consumption. As a result of its simplicity and efficiency, the silver-embedded ceramic tablet can serve as a stand-alone PoUWT method and as a secondary PoUWT to improve exisitng PoUWT methods, such as ceramic water filters. In this paper, three PoUWT interventions were conducted to evaluate the silver-embedded ceramic tablet: (1) the silver-embedded ceramic tablet as a stand-alone PoUWT method, (2) ceramic water filters stand-alone, and (3) a filter-tablet combination. The filter-tablet combination evaluates the silver-embedded ceramic tablet as a secondary PoUWT method when placed in the lower reservoir of the ceramic water filter system to provide residual disinfection post-filtration. Samples were collected from 79 households over one year and analyzed for turbidity, total silver levels and coliform bacteria. Results show that the silver-embedded ceramic tablet effectively reduced total coliform bacteria (TC) and E. coli when used as a stand-alone PoUWT method and when used in combination with ceramic water filters. The silver-embedded ceramic tablet's performance as a stand-alone PoUWT method was comparable to current inexpensive, single-use PoUWT methods, demonstrating 100% and 75% median reduction in E. coli and TC, respectively, after two months of use. Overall, the the filter-tablet combination performed the best of the three interventions, providing a 100% average percent reduction in E. coli over one year. User surveys were also conducted and indicated that the silver-embedded ceramic tablet was simple to use and culturally appropriate. Also, silver levels in all treated water samples remained below 20 mu g/L, significantly lower than the drinking water standard of 100 mu g/L, making it safe for consumption. Long-term data demonstrates that the silver-embedded ceramic tablet has beneficial effects even after one year of use. This study demonstrates that the silver-embedded ceramic tablet can effectively improve water quality when used alone, or with ceramic water filters, to reduce rates of recontamination. Therefore, the tablet has the potential to provide a low-cost means to purify water in resource-limited settings.																	1932-6203					JAN 17	2017	12	1							e0169502	10.1371/journal.pone.0169502								WOS:000392372300020	28095435					
J	Lobo, GP; Bonilla, CA				Lobo, Gabriel P.; Bonilla, Carlos A.			A modeling approach to determining the relationship between vegetative filter strip design and sediment composition	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are areas of either planted or indigenous established vegetation designed to improve the quality of surface runoff. They can be incorporated into pastures, grassed waterways, terraces, or cropland to remove sediment, nitrogen, or phosphorus from runoff. However, their trapping efficiencies depend mainly on the sediment characteristics. The finer soil particles pass through the filter more easily and have more surface area, accounting for most of the transported sediment-bound pollutants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use a modeling approach to develop a Sediment Composition Vegetative Filter Strip (SCVFS) model to predict the clay, silt and sand trapping efficiencies of VFS based on a wide range of soil loss data from Central Chile. The physically based Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was implemented using actual soil and climate data from Central Chile to generate a soil loss database for many VFS designs. More than 22,000 erosibn events were generated with data from 28 sites. Three nonlinear relationships were developed between clay, silt and sand delivery and VFS length. The clay and silt models provided accurate estimates compared to WEPP for the calibration (R-2 = 0.80-0.87) and validation (R-2 = 0.73-0.80) sites. However, the sand estimates were not correlated to WEPP (R-2 = 0.00-0.18), as the model computes sand using the difference between the total predicted sediments (R-2 = 0.77-0.89) and the clay and silt estimates. Nevertheless, because most of the sediment-bound pollutants move with the finer sediments, this is not a modeling limitation. Compared to other physically based VFS models, the SCVFS model is remarkably easy to use because it only requires the characteristics of the sediment delivery when there is no filter, the rainfall erosivity and the hillslope and filter lengths. Additionally, it can be easily combined with many existing erosion models that provide daily soil loss estimates, making it a flexible VFS design tool. This study provides the detailed methodology to construct this model and discusses its advantages and limitations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The impact of global climate change on water quantity and quality: A system dynamics approach to the US-Mexican transborder region	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH												The potential impacts of Global Climate Change (GCC) in zones where water is scarce, such as along the US-Mexico border is, and will continue to be, a key concern for the future sustainability of humanity. This paper estimates the variation in quality/quantity water due to climate change and assesses its impact on community development in the US-Mexico border region of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo Water Basin. To estimate variation in different water quality parameters, we use a conservative model with most probable scenarios for temperature/precipitation produced by the International Panel on Climate Change. We propose a system dynamics model to understand the complex interaction of factors governing the quantity/quality of water and their effects on social and economic conditions. The model simulates, for a 70-year period, policies and decisions that have the potential to improve conditions and prevent risks that may lead to social unrest and hinder economic development.

Water quality modeling can contribute to the necessary scientific grounding of coastal management. In this paper, some of the dynamic functions and parameters of nitrogen were calibrated based on coastal field experiments covering the dynamic nitrogen processes in Jiaozhou Bay (JZB), including phytoplankton growth, respiration, and mortality; particulate nitrogen degradation; and dissolved organic nitrogen remineralization. The results of the field experiments and box model simulations showed good agreement (RSD = 20% +/- 2% and SI = 0.77 +/- 0.04). A three-dimensional water quality model of nitrogen (3DWQMN) in JZB was improved and the dynamic parameters were updated according to field experiments. The 3DWQMN was validated based on observed data from 2012 to 2013, with good agreement (RSD = 27 +/- 4%, SI = 0.68 +/- 0.06, and K = 0.48 +/- 0.04), which testifies to the model's credibility.

The work highlights the following features (1) tintinnid community composed of 28 species belonging to 11 genera and 9 families, revealed significant differences among the four study sites (2) maximum numerical abundance (2224 +/- 90 ind.l(-1)) and species diversity (H' = 2.66) of tintinnid were recorded towards Bay of Bengal whereas minimum abundance (720 +/- 35 ind. k(-1)) and diversity (H' = 1.74) were encountered in the backwater sites, (3) multivariate analyses [RELATE, Biota-environment (BIOENV) and canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP)] reveal that chl a, nitrate and phosphate were the potential causative factors for tintinnid distribution. Based on the results, we suggest that tintinnids may be used as a potential bioindicator of water quality status in marine ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By quantifying the delta N-15 of the common sea fan Gorgonia ventalina sampled from 30 sites throughout Bermuda we show that sewage-derived nitrogen is detectable on nearshore coral reefs and declines across the lagoon to the outer rim. We also sampled gorgonians from two museum collections representing a 50y time-series (1958-2008). These samples revealed an increase in delta N-15 of >4.0%. until the mid-1970s, after which delta N-15 values slowly declined by similar to 2.05 parts per thousand. A delta N-15 chronology from a gorgonian skeleton exhibited a similar decline over the last 30-40 years of approximately 0.6 parts per thousand. We conclude that policies have been effective in reducing sewage impacts to Bermudian reefs. However, significant sources of sewage pollution persist and are likely have a strong impact on harbor and nearshore coral communities and human health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The relatively high 813Crom values suggested the input of C-13-depleted terrigenous organic matter was low in Daya Bay. There were significant correlations between delta C-13(POM) values and chlorophyll a concentrations both during summer and winter, suggesting the delta C-13(POM) values were mainly controlled by the phytoplankton biomass in the surface water. The distribution of delta N-15(POM) values was more complicated than that of delta C-13(POM) and displayed low values in the outer bay and the Dan'ao River estuary. N-15-depleted ammonia originating from industrial wastewater might have strongly influenced the water quality and stable isotopic signatures of POM near the Dan'ao River estuary. The delta C-13(POM) and delta N-15(POM) values strongly reflect the influences of anthropogenic activity and eutrophication in Daya Bay. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Application to the Spanish coast	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												An atlas of susceptibility to pollution of 320 Spanish marinas is provided. Susceptibility is assessed through a simple, fast and low cost empirical method estimating the flushing capacity of marinas. The Complexity Tidal Range Index (CTRI) was selected among eleven empirical methods. The CTRI method was selected by means of statistical analyses because: it contributes to explain the system's variance; it is highly correlated to numerical model results; and, it is sensitive to marinas' location and typology. The process of implementation to the Spanish coast confirmed its usefulness, versatility and adaptability as a tool for the environmental management of marinas worldwide. The atlas of susceptibility, assessed through CTRI values, is an appropriate instrument to prioritize environmental and planning strategies at a regional scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The optimization calculation may become very time consuming when the number of water quality constraint equations is great. A Trial and Error Method (TEM) to remove the redundant points was first introduced through iterative calculations under structure and non-structure model grids. The TEM was applied for the TPLA in the Bohai Sea in China. The calculation time was reduced to about 2 min under the condition that 103,433 model grids met the water quality standards. In the best case, the optimization efficiency was improved by 98.9%. The allocation results showed that approximately 90% of total nitrogen (TN) load should be reduced in the 56 pollution sources around the Bohai Sea; of these values, roughly 85% of the reduction could come from 10 pollution sources.

A regional-scale predictive model for the Great Barrier Reef, Australia	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A spatial risk assessment model is developed for the Great Barrier Reef (GBR, Australia) that helps identify reef locations at higher or lower risk of coral bleaching in summer heat-wave conditions. The model confirms the considerable benefit of discriminating nutrient-enriched areas that contain corals with enlarged (suboptimal) symbiont densities for the purpose of identifying bleaching-sensitive reef locations. The benefit of the new system level understanding is showcased in terms of: (i) improving early-warning forecasts of summer bleaching risk, (ii) explaining historical bleaching patterns, (iii) testing the bleaching-resistant quality of the current marine protected area (MPA) network (iv) identifying routinely monitored coral health attributes, such as the tissue energy reserves and skeletal growth characteristics (viz. density and extension rates) that correlate with bleaching resistant reef locations, and (v) targeting region-specific water quality improvement strategies that may increase reef-scale coral health and bleaching resistance.

The metal oxides are the best candidates for sensing electrodes of such sensors as they offer high chemical stability. In this paper, we present a novel approach to obtain interdigitated conductimetric pH sensor using screen printing of TiO2 thick film on an alumina substrate. The microstructural and crystalline properties of the TiO2 sensitive film were examined with scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The impedance spectroscopic studies of the fabricated thick film sensor were carried out in the frequency range of 5-20 kHz for the test solutions in the pH range of 4-10 and it was observed that the impedance of the film is distinctly dependent on pH. Using the measured impedance data, we have also proposed an equivalent RC network model for the fabricated pH sensor. The physical meaning of the model parameters was determined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopic analysis, and through statistical analysis it was found that all parameters are distinctly pH-dependent.

Association of groundwater constituents with topography and distance to unconventional gas wells in NE Pennsylvania	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Recently we reported an association of certain diseases with unconventional gas development (UGD). The purpose of this study is to examine UGD's possible impacts on groundwater quality in northeastern Pennsylvania. In this study, we compared our groundwater data (Columbia 58 samples) with those published data from Cabot (1701 samples) and Duke University (150 samples). For each dataset, proportions of samples with elevated levels of dissolved constituents were compared among four groups, identified as upland far (i.e. >= 1 km to the nearest UGD gas well), upland near (<1 km), valley far (>= 1 km), and valley near (<1 km) groups. The Columbia data do not show statistically significant differences among the 4 groups, probably due to the limited number of samples. In Duke samples, Ca and CI levels are significantly higher in the valley near group than in the valley far group. In the Cabot dataset, methane, Na, and Mn levels are significantly higher in valley far samples than in upland far samples. In valley samples, Ca, CI, SO4, and Fe are significantly higher in the near group (i.e. <1 km) than in the far group. The association of these constituents in valley groundwater with distance is observed for the first time using a large industry dataset. The increase may be caused by enhanced mixing of shallow and deep groundwater in valley, possibly triggered by UGD process. If persistent, these changes indicate, potential for further impact on groundwater quality. Therefore, there is an urgent need to conduct more studies to investigate effects of UGD on water quality and possible health outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Models were developed using Random Forest and 26 predictor variables (19 predictors to model macroinvertebrate indices and 22 predictors to model the fish index). Predictor variables were related with different environmental characteristics (water quality, physical habitat characteristics, hydrology, topography, geology and human pressures). The importance and effect of predictors on the 4 biotic indices was evaluated with the IncNodePurity index and partial dependence plots, respectively. Results indicated that the spatial variability of macroinvertebrate and fish indices were mostly dependent on the same environmental variables. They decreased in river reaches affected by high mean annual nitrate concentration (>4 mg/l) and temperature (>12 degrees C), with low flow water velocity (<0.4 m/s) and aquatic plant communities being dominated by macrophytes. These indices were higher in the Atlantic region than in the Mediterranean.

Little is known about the role of pre-dams regarding the production and decomposition of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in relation to discharge and how this affects the quality of DOC in the water. We combined quantitative and qualitative investigations under different hydrological conditions at three pre-dams exhibiting a gradient from oligotrophic/high-DOC to eutrophic/low-DOC. All pre-dams were mainly autotrophic in their upper water layers. The ratio of OC production to total gained OC (i.e. OC import + OC production) decreased with increasing discharge. On average, 0-30% of the total gained OC was produced within the pre-dams. The amount of microbially decomposed DOC increased with the average water residence time (WRT) and with the trophic status of the pre-dams. Radiocarbon analyses of respired CO2 revealed that heterotrophic bacteria preferentially utilized old DOC components (195-395 years before present) under base flow conditions, whereas younger components (modern, i.e. OC produced after 1950) were utilized at high discharge. DOC quality changed significantly over the year within the pre-dams: High proportions of algae-derived DOC were observed during base flow in summer, and the freshness index (beta/alpha ratio) decreased significantly with higher discharges. DOC production and quality changes in response to hydrological conditions should be considered for future water quality management in reservoirs, as climate scenarios for temperate regions predict decreased runoffs leading to longer WRT and increased eutrophication and production of algae derived OC.

DOM is a mixture of diverse components, so a range of organic molecules potentially participates in the occurrence of dissolved trace metals. In this study, we investigated water quality variables that influence dissolved trace metal concentrations in natural and effluent water systems with a particular attention given to the relationship between DOM optical properties and dissolved copper and iron concentrations. We found that specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254): an indicator of DOM aromaticity) has a significant correlation with dissolved trace metal to dissolved organic carbon concentration ratios ([Me](T)/[DOC]) for copper and iron in natural freshwaters and treated municipal wastewater in the Sagami River basin, Japan. This trend was also prevalent for other freshwaters in temperate climates except for Fe-rich waters. Our findings indicate that the concentrations of dissolved copper and iron in natural and effluent waters are significantly influenced not only by DOM concentration, but also by aromaticity of DOM, and that this DOM property can be inferred from spectrophotometric measurements.

Three-dimensional model to capture the fate and transport of combined sewer overflow discharges: A case study in the Chicago Area Waterway System	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We used a numerical model to analyze the impact of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) in the hydrodynamics and water quality of the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS). We coupled the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) with the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP) to perform threedimensional simulations of the hydrodynamics and water quality in CAWS. The analysis was performed for two different storms: (i) May 6, 2009 representing a 6-hour duration 4-month return period, and (ii) September 12, 2008 representing a 48-hour duration 100-year return period. Results from the simulations show distinct differences between the two storms. During the May 2009 storm there was only one major CSO pumping event with negligible impact on the water quality of CAWS. During the September 2008 storm there were several CSOs that impacted the hydrodynamics and water quality of CAWS. In particular, CSOs during the September 2008 event induced a reversal flow in CAWS, with a plume of constituents that traveled in the opposite direction as water does under normal conditions. However, the simulation results show that CSOs events in CAWS take place during periods of high rainfall, thus the discharge of CSOs is significantly diluted along the CAWS. As a result, the concentrations of organic matter and inorganic nutrients observed at the downstream boundary in CAWS were significantly lower than those recorded at the CSOs outfalls and are within the limits established in the regulation for regular effluents. These results suggest that even during storms events with significant CSOs into the CAWS there is a significant dilution that reduce the impact in the water quality at the system boundaries.

Eurasian beaver activity increases water storage, attenuates flow and mitigates diffuse pollution from intensively-managed grasslands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Beavers are the archetypal keystone species, which can profoundly alter ecosystem structure and function through their ecosystem engineering activity, most notably the building of dams. This can have a major impact upon water resource management, flow regimes and water quality. Previous research has predominantly focused on the activities of North American beaver (Castor canadensis) located in very different environments, to the intensive lowland agricultural landscapes of the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe. Two Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) were introduced to a wooded site, situated on a first order tributary, draining from intensively managed grassland. The site was monitored to understand impacts upon water storage, flow regimes and water quality. Results indicated that beaver activity, primarily via the creation of 13 dams, has increased water storage within the site (holding ca. 1000 m(3) in beaver ponds) and beavers were likely to have had a significant flow attenuation impact, as determined from peak discharges (mean 30 +/- 19% reduction), total discharges (mean 34 +/- 9% reduction) and peak rainfall to peak discharge lag times (mean 29 +/- 21% increase) during storm events. Event monitoring of water entering and leaving the site showed lower concentrations of suspended sediment, nitrogen and phosphate leaving the site (e.g. for suspended sediment; average entering site: 112 +/- 72 mgl(-1), average leaving site: 39 +/- 37 mgl(-1)). Combined with attenuated flows, this resulted in lower diffuse pollutant loads in water downstream. Conversely, dissolved organic carbon concentrations and loads downstream were higher. These observed changes are argued to be directly attributable to beaver activity at the site which has created a diverse wetland environment, reducing downstream hydrological connectivity. Results have important implications for beaver reintroduction programs which may provide nature based solutions to the catchment-scale water resource management issues that are faced in agricultural landscapes.

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of climate and land-use change on the hydrological regime and nutrient yield from the 3S River Basin (Sekong, Srepok, and Sesan) into the 3S River system in Southeast Asia. The 3S Rivers are important tributaries of the Lower Mekong River, accounting for 16% of its annual flow. This transboundary basin supports the livelihoods of nearly 3.5 million people in the countries of Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. To reach a better understanding of the process and fate of pollution (nutrient yield) as well as the hydrological regime, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to simulate water quality and discharge in the 3S River Basin. Future scenarios were developed for three future periods: 2030s (2015-2039), 2060s (2045-2069), and 2090s (2075-2099), using an ensemble of five GCMs (General Circulation Model) simulations: (HadGEM2-AO, CanESM2, IPSL-CM5A-LR, CNRM-CM5, and MPI-ESM-MR), driven by the climate projection for RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways): RCP4.5 (medium emission) and RCP8.5 (high emission) scenarios, and two land-use change scenarios. The results indicated that the climate in the study area would generally become warmer and wetter under both emission scenarios. Discharge and nutrient yield is predicted to increase in the wet season and decrease in the dry. Overall, the annual discharge and nutrient yield is projected to increase throughout the twenty-first century, suggesting sensitivity in the 3S River Basin to climate and land-use change.The results of this study can assist water resources managers and planners in developing water management strategies for uncertain climate change scenarios in the 3S River Basin.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk to human health from ingestion of As, Ba, Co, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, Se and Ni present in soil, sterile and mineralized waste, and water and plants at a gold mine in Serra Pelada, Para, Brazil. Samples of soil, sterile and mineralized waste, water and plants were collected around an artisanal gold mine located in Serra Pelada. The mean concentrations of potentially toxic elements in the soil were higher than the soil quality reference values as defined in the legislation, which may be attributeable to past mining activities. Water from the area close to the mine exhibited As, Ba and Pb concentrations exceeding the reference values established by the World Health Organization, deemed unfit for human consumption. Plants exhibited high Pb concentrations, representing a food safety risk to the population. The mean hazard index (HI) values were below the acceptable limit (1.0) established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, although the highest HI values observed for adults and children were higher than the respective acceptable limits. Environmental contamination and risk to human health were heterogeneous in the surroundings of the mine. Mitigation strategies need to be adopted to decrease the risks of contamination to the environment and to the local population. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Supply-side and demand-side management is a core strategy to address this water shortage. Under this strategy, reclaimed water, which the Canadian public is willing to use for non-potable purposes, is an option. However, no universal guidelines exist for reclaimed water use. Despite the federal government's long-term goal to develop guidelines for many water reuse applications, guidelines have only been prescribed for reclaimed water use in toilet and urinal flushing in Canada. At the provincial level, British Columbia (BC) has promulgated guidelines for wide applications of reclaimed water but only at broad class levels. This research has investigated and proposed probabilistic risk-based recommended values for microbial quality of reclaimed water in various non-potable urban reuses. The health risk was estimated by using quantitative microbial risk assessment. Two-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations were used in the analysis to include variability and uncertainty in input data. The proposed recommended values are based on the indicator organism E. coli. The required treatment levels for reuse were also estimated. In addition, the recommended values were successfully applied to three wastewater treatment effluents in the Okanagan Valley, BC, Canada. The health risks associated with other bacterial pathogens (Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella spp.), virus (adenovirus, norovirus, and rotavirus), and protozoa (Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia spp.), were also estimated. The estimated risks indicate the effectiveness of the E. coil-based water quality recommended values. Sensitivity analysis shows the pathogenic E. coli ratio and morbidity are the most sensitive input parameters for all water reuses. The proposed recommended values could be further improved by using national or regional data on water exposures, disease burden per case, and the susceptibility fraction of population.

Assessing the long-term ecological effects of riparian management practices on headwater streams in a coastal temperate rainforest	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Our understanding of how effective forestry Best Management Practices (BMPs) can mitigate logging impacts on the structure and functioning of temperate headwater streams tends to be based upon studies conducted within the first few years post-harvest. Little is known about how the affected biological parameters of streams change during riparian and upland forest regeneration, particularly the time taken to return to pre-harvest levels, or to within the range of reference conditions. By following up on an earlier study in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, we examined the post-logging recovery trajectories of stream attributes under multiple forest treatments. These treatments provided a gradient of riparian protection, including streamside clear-cutting with no reserves, and with fixed-width reserves (10 m and 30 m), and thinning with 50% basal area removal of riparian trees, which were compared with unharvested control sites. About 15 years after clear-cutting and 9 years after thinning, slower decomposition of red alder leaves (Alnus rubra) was reported in streams affected by forest harvesting, which was attributed to lower density of shredder invertebrates. Thinned reaches had lower litter decomposition rate than, but similar shredder density and richness to, unharvested reference sites. After a further 7 years of forest regrowth (time elapsed between the previous and present study), we found that litter decomposition rate and shredder density in logging-affected reaches converged with values in reference reaches. Stream functional integrity, as reflected by litter decomposition, increased across all forest treatments. Some differences in rarefied shredder richness among forest treatments emerged in this study. The legacy effects of thinning on some biotic variables likely diminished more quickly (2-9 years post-harvest) than those of clear-cutting with and without riparian reserves (8-15 years). Stream recovery from thinning to reference conditions should continue to warrant attention, as wider, larger-scale partial harvesting practices are recommended within emerging paradigms of forest management. Overall, our findings indicate time scales towards recovery of an important ecological process of streams under common forestry practices, which could be longer than other stream properties, such as water quality. Such differences in recovery time frames should be considered for the planning of forestry operations and monitoring of harvesting legacies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Gooseff, MN; Wlostowski, A; McKnight, DM; Jaros, C				Gooseff, Michael N.; Wlostowski, Adam; McKnight, Diane M.; Jaros, Chris			Hydrologic connectivity and implications for ecosystem processes - Lessons from naked watersheds	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Hydrologic connectivity has received great attention recently as our conceptual models of watersheds and water quality have evolved in the past several decades. However, the structural complexity of most temperate watersheds (i.e. connections among shallow soils, deep aquifers, the atmosphere and streams) and the dynamic seasonal changes that occur within them (i.e., plant senescence which impacts evapotranspiration) create significant challenges to characterizing or quantifying hydrologic connectivity. The McMurdo Dry Valleys, a polar desert in Antarctica, provide a unique opportunity to study hydrologic connectivity because there is no vegetative cover (and therefore no transpiration), and no deep aquifers connected to surface soils or streams. Glacier melt provides stream flow to well-established channels and closed-basin, ice-covered lakes on the valley floor. Streams are also connected to shallow hyporheic zones along their lengths, which are bounded at similar to 75 cm depth by ice-cemented permafrost. These hydrologic features and connections provide water for and underpin biological communities. Hence, exchange of water among them provides a vector for exchange of energy and dissolved solutes. Connectivity is dynamic on timescales of a day to a flow season (6-12 weeks), as streamflow varies over these timescales. The timescales over which these connections occur is also dynamic. Exchanges between streams and hyporheic zones, for example, have been estimated to be as short as hours to as long as several weeks. These exchanges have significant implications for the biogeochemistry of these systems and the biotic communities in each feature. Here we evaluate the lessons we can learn about hydrologic connectivity in the MDV watersheds that are simplified in the context of processes occurring and water reservoirs included in the landscape, yet are sensitive to climate controls and contain substantial physical heterogeneity. We specifically explore several metrics that are simple and/or commonly employed in hydrologic analyses and interpret them in the context of connectivity between and among hydrologic features.

The social connectivity of urban rivers	GEOMORPHOLOGY												By social connectivity we refer to the communication and movement of people, goods, ideas, and culture along and across rivers, recognizing longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity, much as has been described for other riversfor hydrology and ecology. We focus on rivers as they pass through cities, and the relationships between these rivers and city dwellers. Historically, the most important longitudinal connectivity function of rivers was their role as major transport routes and the simplification of formerly complex, irregular banks and beds, into straight, uniform shipping channels has resulted in a loss of lateral and vertical connectivity, notably the quotidian uses such as fishing, washing clothes, water supply, swimming and other recreation. The scale of the river itself, and its scale in comparison to the scale of the city, largely determine the river's social function and the degree to which it influences city form. River width affects the perception of 'closeness' of the other bank, ease of bridging the river, influence of the river on the city's street pattern, and type of waterfront uses that occur. Up to 15 m wide, people can converse, whereas across rivers similar to 50 to similar to 200 m wide, people are not recognizable but still clearly visible, instilling the banks with a 'lively' atmosphere. At widths over similar to 200 m, people blur, yet moving vehicles and trees branches shaldng in wind may still provide some dynamic elements to an otherwise static landscape composed of building facades. In exceptionally wide rivers, the city on the opposite bank is little more than a skyline, which often becomes a signature and symbol of regional identity. In contemplating how people use rivers, we can define a range of human activities in relation to height above the water (i.e., instream to banktop), a vertical dimension of human connectivity with rivers. Many uses occur on the top of the bank, such as quiet contemplation, walking, or cycling along a riverside trail, while others depend on contact with the water itself, such as wading, diving, and canoeing (which presupposes adequate water quality). Many of these relationships are illustrated by the challenge of reconnecting Cairo with the Nile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A spatial model to improve site selection for seagrass restoration in shallow boating environments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Due to widespread and continuing seagrass loss, restoration attempts occur worldwide. This article presents a geospatial modeling technique that ranks the suitability of sites for restoration based on light availability and boating activity, two factors cited in global studies of seagrass loss and restoration failures. The model presented here was created for Estero Bay, Florida and is a predictive model of light availability and boating pressure to aid seagrass restoration efforts. The model is adaptive and can be parameterized for different locations and updated as additional data is collected and knowledge of how factors impact seagrass improves. Light data used for model development were collected over one year from 50 sites throughout the bay. Coupled with high resolution bathymetric data, bottom mean light availability was predicted throughout the bay. Data collection throughout the year also allowed for prediction of light variability at sites, a possible indicator of seagrass growth and survival. Additionally, survey data on boating activities were used to identify areas, outside of marked navigation channels, that receive substantial boating pressure and are likely poor candidate sites for seagrass restoration. The final map product identifies areas where the light environment was suitable for seagrasses and boating pressure was low. A composite map showing the persistence of seagrass coverage in the study area over four years, between 1999 and 2006, was used to validate the model. Eighty-nine percent of the area where seagrass persisted (had been mapped all four years) was ranked as suitable for restoration: 42% with the highest rank (7), 28% with a rank of 6, and 19% with a rank of 5. The results show that the model is a viable tool for selection of seagrass restoration sites in Florida and elsewhere. With knowledge of the light environment and boating patterns, managers will be better equipped to set seagrass restoration and water quality improvement targets and select sites for restoration. The modeling approach outlined here is, broadly applicable and will be of value to a large and diverse suite of scientists and marine resource managers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The effective evaluation height for flux-gradient relationships and its application to herbicide fluxes	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Volatilization represents a significant loss pathway for many pesticides, herbicides and other agrochemicals. One common method for measuring the volatilization of agrochemicals is the flux-gradient method. Using this method, the chemical flux is estimated as the product of the vertical concentration gradient and a turbulent-transfer coefficient (eddy diffusivity). For computational simplicity, the evaluation height needed to calculate the eddy diffusivity is typically approximated as either the geometric or logarithmic mean. Both of these estimation methods are based on simplifying assumptions and can be a significant source of error, particularly when the separation distance between the measurement heights is large. Using data collected over an eight-year period at the USDA-ARS OPE3 experimental watershed, this study compared fluxes of metolachlor, a commonly-used herbicide, computed using the approximated evaluation heights with those calculated using the exact evaluation height. While it was found that the primary factor influencing the accuracy of the flux estimates using the approximate evaluation heights was atmospheric stability, errors in the estimate of the evaluation height can result in significant (>10%) errors in the flux estimates. Based on these results, it is recommended that the exact evaluation height be used with the flux-gradient technique.

Investigation of fluorescence methods for rapid detection of municipal wastewater impact on drinking water sources	SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY												Fluorescence spectroscopy as a means to detect low levels of treated wastewater impact on two source waters was investigated using effluents from five wastewater facilities. To identify how best to interpret the fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) for detecting the presence of wastewater, several feature selection and classification methods were compared. An expert supervised regional integration approach was used based on previously identified features which distinguish biologically processed organic matter including protein-like fluorescence and the ratio of protein to humic-like fluorescence. Use of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-like (NADH) fluorescence was found to result in higher linear correlations for low levels of wastewater presence. Parallel factors analysis (PARAFAC) was also applied to contrast an unsupervised multiway approach to identify underlying fluorescing components. A humic-like component attributed to reduced semiquinone-like structures was found to best correlate with wastewater presence. These fluorescent features were used to classify, by volume, low (0.1-0.5%), medium (1-2%), and high (5-15%) levels by applying support vector machines (SVMs) and logistic regression. The ability of SVMs to utilize high-dimensional input data without prior feature selection was demonstrated through their performance when considering full unprocessed EEMs (66.7% accuracy). The observed high classification accuracies are encouraging when considering implementation of fluorescence spectroscopy as a water quality monitoring tool.

Subsurface ice contained in permafrost is similarly affected by climate change, causing persistent impacts on natural and human systems. In contrast to glaciers, permafrost is not observable spatially and therefore its presence and possible changes are frequently overlooked. Correspondingly, little is known about permafrost in the mountains of the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region, despite permafrost area exceeding that of glaciers in nearly all countries. Based on evidence and insight gained mostly in other permafrost areas globally, this review provides a synopsis on what is known or can be inferred about permafrost in the mountains of the HKH region. Given the extreme nature of the environment concerned, it is to be expected that the diversity of conditions and phenomena encountered in permafrost exceed what has previously been described and investigated. We further argue that climate change in concert with increasing development will bring about diverse permafrost-related impacts on vegetation, water quality, geohazards, and livelihoods. To better anticipate and mitigate these effects, a deepened understanding of high-elevation permafrost in subtropical latitudes as well as the pathways interconnecting environmental changes and human livelihoods are needed.

Lessons from temporal and spatial patterns in global use of N and P fertilizer on cropland	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												In recent decades farmers in high-income countries and China and India have built up a large reserve of residual soil P in cropland. This reserve can now be used by crops, and in high-income countries the use of mineral P fertilizer has recently been decreasing with even negative soil P budgets in Europe. In contrast to P, much of N surpluses are emitted to the environment via air and water and large quantities of N are transported in aquifers with long travel times (decades and longer). N fertilizer use in high-income countries has not been decreasing in recent years; increasing N use efficiency and utilization of accumulated residual soil P allowed continued increases in crop yields. However, there are ecological risks associated with the legacy of excessive nutrient mobilization in the 1970s and 1980s. Landscapes have a memory for N and P; N concentrations in many rivers do not respond to increased agricultural N use efficiency, and European water quality is threatened by rapidly increasing N: P ratios. Developing countries can avoid such problems by integrated management of N, P and other nutrients accounting for residual soil P, while avoiding legacies associated with the type of past or continuing mismanagement of high-income countries, China and India.

The studies were conducted on a group of ten shallow lakes situated on the area of Polesie Lubelskie (eastern Poland). The lakes represented five types of macrophyte communities, Chara-Stratiotes-, Myriophyllum-, Potamogeton-and Ceratophyllum-dominated. The total biomass of macrophytes and their distribution were significantly negatively correlated with the trophic status of the lake. Principal component analysis confirms the separation of the lakes with regard to trophic status and macrophyte species richness and biomass. The results of the Monte Carlo permutation test (RDA analysis) indicated the significant effect of Secchi disc depth, pH, conductivity, chlorophyll-a, P-tot, P-PO4, N-NO3 and N-NH4 on the biomass and distribution of submerged macrophytes in the lakes.																	0003-4088	2100-000X				JAN 10	2017	53						27	34		10.1051/limn/2016031								WOS:000412934500001

Meteorological drivers of hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Oxygen concentration is both an indicator and driver of water quality in lakes. Decreases in oxygen concentration leads to altered ecosystem function as well as harmful consequences for aquatic biota, such as fishes. The responses of oxygen dynamics in lakes to climate-related drivers, such as temperature and wind speed, are well documented for lake surface waters. However, much less is known about how the oxic environment of bottom waters, especially the timing and magnitude of anoxia in eutrophic lakes, responds to changes in climate drivers. Understanding how important ecosystem states, such as hypolimnetic anoxia, may respond to differing climate scenarios requires a model that couples physical-biological conditions and sufficiently captures the density stratification that leads to strong oxygen gradients. Here, we analyzed the effects of changes in three important meteorological drivers (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) on hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake using the anoxic factor as an index that captures both the temporal and spatial extent of anoxia. Air temperature and relative humidity were found to have a positive correlation with anoxic factor, while wind speed had a negative correlation. Air temperature was found to have the greatest potential impact of the three drivers on the anoxic factor, followed by wind speed and then relative humidity. Across the scenarios of climate variability, variation in the simulated anoxic factor was primarily due to changes in the timing of onset and decay of stratification. Given the potential for future changes in climate, especially increases in air temperature, this study provides important insight into how these changes will alter lake water quality.

Bioadsorbents from peat, coconut shell, fruit stones and oil palm biomass have been produced but the bioadsorbent ability in removing pollutants from biologically treated palm oil mill effluent final discharge is scarcely reported. This research attempts to treat biologically treated palm oil mill effluent final discharge using steam activated oil palm mesocarp fiber bioadsorbent without the use of chemicals as activating agents. Oil palm mesocarp fiber was carbonised at 600 degrees C for 30 min and later activated using steam at same temperature for another 30 min. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the bioadsorbent was found to be 494 m(2)/g. Bioadsorbent produced was then used to treat biologically treated palm oil mill final discharge by mixing both bioadsorbent and the wastewater into a conical flask and shaken at 150 rpm for 24 h. At 10 g/L dosage, the bioadsorbent reduced the chemical oxygen demand and suspended solid of biologically treated palm oil mill effluent final discharge from 395 mg/L and 117 mg/L down to 303 mg/L and 14 mg/L, respectively. Consecutive treatments at 10 g/L dosage resulted in higher removal of the chemical oxygen demand and suspended solids up to 122 mg/L and 7 mg/L, respectively, which meets the river water quality, making the final wastewater suitable as recycled water for the zero-emission system in the palm oil mill.

The construction of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has dramatically changed the hydro-environmental conditions, including hydrological regimes and water quality in the Yangtze River estuary (YRE), which could have a significant impact on the estuarine ecosystem. To evaluate the effects of hydro-environmental alterations on the phytoplankton community in YRE, sampling campaigns were conducted in the area during 2010-2011; meanwhile, historical data before TGD construction and during the TGD filling period were collected. Seasonal variations showed that diatoms dominated the community throughout the sampling period, and the most important environmental factors affecting the phytoplankton community were silicate, total suspended solids and phosphate. With respect to differences in the three phases ( before TGD construction, during TGD filling and after TGD filing), the abundance of phytoplankton showed an increasing trend: the proportions of diatom species numbers declined, while the proportions of Dinophyta species numbers increased. The position of phytoplankton abundance maximum moved inwards to the estuary of the Yangtze River after the impoundment of the TGD.																	0003-4088	2100-000X				JAN 9	2017	53						1	10		10.1051/limn/2016027								WOS:000412933500001

In the present study, we designed and synthesized a novel coordination polymer, [AgL0.5(NO3)](n) (1), {L = 25,26,27,28-tetra[(3-pyridylmethyl)oxy] calix[4] arene}, from AgNO3 and a tetra-pyridyl-functionalized calix[4] arene ligand, which possessed a 2D network based on [Ag4L(NO3)(4)] units. The 1-modified glassy carbon electrode (1/GCE) exhibited good electrocatalytic activity toward the reduction of NB, offering the selective detection of NB in a wide linear range (1-2450 mu M) and a low detection limit (0.62 mu M). Furthermore, it displayed excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of NB in aqueous solution under UV light. The kinetics of the catalytic degradation reaction and the stability of the catalyst were also studied. These results indicated that compound 1 is a favorable material for the effective determination and degradation of NB, which makes it a promising candidate in both monitoring water quality and treating wastewater.																	1477-9226	1477-9234				JAN 7	2017	46	1					178	185		10.1039/c6dt03990a								WOS:000391570700020

Therefore, the aim of this study was to establish genetic relatedness between faecal coliforms and enterococci isolated from the river water and riverbed sediments of Apies River to better understand the genetic similarity of microorganisms between the sediment and water phases. Indicator bacteria were subjected to a molecular study, which consisted of PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA gene using specific primers for faecal coliforms and enterococci, respectively. Results revealed that the Apies River had high faecal pollution levels with enterococci showing low to moderate correlation coefficient (r(2) values ranged from 0.2605 to 0.7499) compared to the faecal coliforms which showed zero to low correlation (r(2) values ranged from 0.0027 to 0.1407) indicating that enterococci may be better indicator than faecal coliforms for detecting faecal contamination in riverbed sediments. The phylogenetic tree of faecal coliforms revealed a 98% homology among their nucleotide sequences confirming the close genetic relatedness between river water and riverbed sediment isolates. The phylogenetic tree of the enterococci showed that Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are the predominant species found in both river water and riverbed sediments with bootstrap values of >= 99%. A high degree of genetic relatedness between sediment and water isolates indicated a possible common ancestry and transmission pathway. We recommend the microbial monitoring of riverbed sediments as it harbours more diverse microbial community and once resuspended may cause health and environmental problems.

In the tension area between economic demands, circular flow economy and environmental safety, a link between the results from standardized leaching tests and the respective environmental quality standards must be created. To derive maximum release limits of metals and metalloids for armourstones in hydraulic engineering, this link is accomplished via a simple model approach. By treating natural materials and industrial by-products the same way, the article delivers an overview on the recent regulative situation in Europe as well as describes and discusses an innovative approach to derive maximum release limits for monolithic construction products in hydraulic engineering on a conceptual level. On a practical level, a list of test parameters is derived by connecting an extensive dataset (seven armourstone materials with five repetitions and 31 elements tested with the worldwide applied dynamic surface leaching test) with surface water quality standards and predicted no effect concentrations. Finally, the leaching tests results are compared with the envisaged maximum release limits, offering a direct comparison between natural materials and industrial by-products.																	1932-6203					JAN 6	2017	12	1							e0168926	10.1371/journal.pone.0168926								WOS:000391641500045	28060850

Northern morocco agro-food industries use different sources of water, but public water and wells water are the main sources of water used. This water can be the main source of possible food contaminations and alterations. This study aims is to assess the bacteriological quality of water used in the agro-food industries in the Northern region of Morocco, to identify the different types of germs responsible for the pollution of these waters and to establish the main causes of this pollution. Methods: water samples taken from taps or wells were analyzed to detect pollution indicator germs (total coliform (TC), fecal coliform (PC), intestinal enterococci (E), revivable microorganisms (RM), sulphite-reducing anaerobes) and pathogens (Salmonella, Staphylococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The enumeration of the bacteria was performed by filtration technique and incorporation obtained through supercooled solid state. Results: the results showed that public-supply waters were of satisfactory bacteriological quality while 40% of the wells water was non-compliant with water quality standards due to the presence of TC, FC, E and RM pollution indicators. In contrast, pathogens, particularly Salmonellae, were absent in all the wells water analyzed. Conclusion: well water pollution was generally due to failure to meet hygienic requirements for water pumping. Bacteriological quality of these wells water could be improved by adequate protection.																	1937-8688					JAN 5	2017	26								13	10.11604/pamj.2017.26.13.10591								WOS:000397454800001	28450992

Plankton bioindicators of environmental conditions in coastal lagoons	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Coastal lagoons are characterised by strong spatial gradient of environmental parameters, especially hypersalinity, and are prone to anthropogenic disturbance. The Coorong (South Australia) is an inverse estuarine coastal lagoon separated from the sea by sand dunes. It is exposed to extreme water quality changes that affect its aquatic communities. Here, we used plankton as indicators of extreme environmental fluctuations to monitor and manage the environmental health of such complex systems. We defined the relationship of different plankton communities with water quality fluctuations and determined plankton species suitable for monitoring the ecosystem health. Two distinct communities of phytoplankton and zooplankton were identified, with salinity and nutrients being the principal factors impacting species distribution. Thus, two sets of indicator species were selected based on the different communities observed. Polychaete and gastropod larvae were positive indicators, showing salinity range restriction of brackish to marine. The distribution Acartia cf. fancetti represented healthy hypersaline conditions (salinity 40-60), while Cyclophora sp. and Scrippsiella sp. were negative indicators, correlating with extreme salinity and ammonia levels. The implementation of planktonic organisms as environmental indicators provided a constructive tool for the management of ecosystem health of the Coorong and will be applicable to similar coastal lagoons.

Despite the small sizes of the watersheds (<16.5 km(2)), a redundancy analysis showed that river water quality explained 62% of the cross-estuary variation in the biogeochemical properties of estuarine tidal flat sediment by the first two ordination axes. We also found that the dissolved nutrient concentrations of river water and pheophytin a content of tidal flat sediment were positively related to agricultural and urbanized land cover in the watersheds. These results indicate that human nutrient inputs significantly increase algae-derived deposits in estuaries with relatively more developed watersheds. The 813C of particulate organic matter (POM) was negatively related to watershed forest cover. This suggests that terrestrially derived-origin POM deposits are substantial in the estuaries connected to watersheds with relatively high forest cover. However, the chemical properties of tidal flat sediment were not related to chemical indicators of POM in the base flow. We hypothesize that substantial terrestrially derived POM is discharged to estuaries of high-forest-cover watersheds during high flow, and this partially controls the chemical properties of estuarine sediments. Our results demonstrate that the chemical properties of estuarine tidal flats are associated with watershed land cover, and that the dominant processes controlling estuarine sediment properties differ among watersheds depending on land cover composition.

"Rojo Brillante" grafted on D-lotus and D-virginiana	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												Persimmon trees grafted on D. lotus have been found to be extensively affected by leaf necrosis in the important cropping area of Valencia (E Spain). Although this problem has been attributed to chloride toxicity, this association had not been rigorously demonstrated. In addition the chloride and salinity tolerance of persimmons grafted on D. lotus has not been characterised, and neither has the performance of this rootstock been compared to D. virginiana. Two outdoors experiments, one in pots, and another one in the field were set up and conducted for three years with trees grafted on both rootstocks. Trees in the pots experiment were arranged in five groups and irrigated with waters differing in their salt and thus, Cl-, Ca2+ and Na+ water contents. Season-end leaf contents of Na, CI, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, B, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, toxicity symptoms and fruit yields were assessed. In the field experiment, one irrigation water quality was used, and just leaf chloride contents, water potential and fruit yields were evaluated. Field toxicity symptoms were reproduced in the pots experiment in the trees on D. lotus, but not on D. virginiana, with leaf chloride contents increasing with increasing irrigation water salinity. Leaf chloride contents were much higher than either sodium or boron, and significantly more correlated with toxicity symptoms. Comparing to chloride toxicity and salinity tolerance data from similar woody crops, D. lotus was classified as sensitive to salinity with, respectively, threshold ECe and slope of 1.2 dS m(-1) and 22 dS(-1) m. D. lotus rootstocks lend persimmon trees very lower ability to avoid chloride toxicity likely because of, on the one hand, its low soil exploration capacity, and, on the other hand, its low chloride exclusion capacity. In return, however, D. lotus lends persimmon trees more productivity, which still keeps for waters with slight-to-moderate chloride contents (3-4 mmol/L). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Model fit versus biological relevance: Evaluating photosynthesis-temperature models for three tropical seagrass species	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												When several models can describe a biological process, the equation that best fits the data is typically considered the best. However, models are most useful when they also possess biologically-meaningful parameters. In particular, model parameters should be stable, physically interpretable, and transferable to other contexts, e.g. for direct indication of system state, or usage in other model types. As an example of implementing these recommended requirements for model parameters, we evaluated twelve published empirical models for temperature-dependent tropical seagrass photosynthesis, based on two criteria: (1) goodness of fit, and (2) how easily biologically-meaningful parameters can be obtained. All models were formulated in terms of parameters characterising the thermal optimum (T-opt) for maximum photosynthetic rate (P-max). These parameters indicate the upper thermal limits of seagrass photosynthetic capacity, and hence can be used to assess the vulnerability of seagrass to temperature change. Our study exemplifies an approach to model selection which optimises the usefulness of empirical models for both modellers and ecologists alike.

In contrast, this study considers the alternative of "active and incomplete" participation in PES programs, in which participants are not obliged to contract their own land, and have the right to select into the program or not. This type of program has been popular over the last decade in China; however, there have been few studies on the characteristics of willingness to participate and implementation. As such, this paper uses the Choice Experiment (CE) method to explore ways for inducing effective program participation, by analyzing the effects of different regime attributes. The case study used to analyze participation utility was the Jing-Ji Afforestation Program for Ecological and Water Protection (JAPEWP), a typical active-participation forestry PES program, and a key source of water near Beijing in the Miyun Reservoir Catchment (MRC). Analyzing rural household survey data indicated that the program faces a variety of challenges, including long-term maintenance, implementation performance, costeffectiveness, and monitoring approaches. There are also challenges with one-size-fits-all payment strategies, due to ineffective program participation or imperfect implementation regimes. In response, this study proposes several policies, including providing secure and complete land tenure to the participants, creating more local off-farm employment opportunities, designing performance-based monitoring systems that are integrated with financial incentives, applying differentiated payment strategies, providing capacity building to support forestation activities, and establishing a comprehensive implementation regime that would address these challenges. These policy conclusions provide valuable lessons for other active-participation PES programs as well.

Consequently, nutrient and metal concentrations are parameters used to define water quality. The European Union's Water Framework Directive (WFD) goes further than a contaminant-based approach and utilises indices to assess the Ecological Status (ES) of transitional water bodies (e.g. estuaries and lagoons). One assessment is based upon the abundance of opportunistic Ulva species, as an indication of eutrophication. The objective of this study was to characterise Ireland's Ulva blooms through the use of WFD assessment, metal concentrations and taxonomic identity. Furthermore, the study assessed whether the ecological assessment is related to the metal composition in the Ulva. WFD algal bloom assessment revealed that the largest surveyed blooms had an estimated biomass of 2164 metric tonnes (w/w). DNA sequences identified biomass from all locations as Ulva rigida, with the exception of New Quay, which was Ulva rotundata. Some blooms contained significant amounts of As, Cu, Cr, Pb and Sn. The results showed that all metal concentrations had a negative relationship (except Se) with the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR). However, only in the case of Mn were these differences significant (p = 0.038). Overall, the metal composition and concentrations found in Ulva were site dependent, and not clearly related to the ES. Nevertheless, sites with a moderate or poor ES had a higher variability in the metals levels than in estuaries with a high ES.

J	Hussain, I; Ahamad, KU; Nath, P				Hussain, Iftak; Ahamad, Kamal Uddin; Nath, Pabitra			Low-Cost, Robust, and Field Portable Smartphone Platform Photometric Sensor for Fluoride Level Detection in Drinking Water	ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Groundwater is the major source of drinking water for people living in rural areas of India. Pollutants such as fluoride in groundwater may be present in much higher concentration than the permissible limit. Fluoride does not give any visible coloration to water, and hence, no effort is made-to remove or reduce the concentration of this chemieal present in drinking water. This may lead to a serious health hazard for people taking groundwater as their primary-,source Of drinking water. Sophisticated laboratory grade tools such as ion selective electrodes (ISE) and portable spectrophotometers- are commercially available for in-field detection of fluoride level-in drinking water. However, such tools are generally expensive and, :require expertise to handle. In this paper, we demonstrate the: working of a low cost, robust, and field portable.smartphone platform fluoride sensor that can detect and analyze fluoride concentration, level in drinking water. For development of the proposed sensor, we utilize the ambient light sensor (ALS)' of the smart-phone as light intensity detector and' its LED flash light as an optical source. An android application "FSense" has been develop-edwhich can detect and analyze the 'fluoride concentration level in water samples. The custom developed application-Can be, used for sharing of in-field sensing data from any remote location to the central water quality monitoring station. We envision that the proposed sensing technique could be useful for initiating a fluoride removal program undertaken by governinent41-and nongovernmental organizations here in India.

Transport and transformation of nutrients and sediment in two agricultural watersheds in Northeast Arkansas	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Understanding pollutant transport at different spatial and temporal scales is crucial to agroecosystems management and planning. This study aimed to reduce the knowledge gap between edge-of-field and larger agricultural watersheds. Nutrients and sediment transport and transformation at two small agricultural watersheds, Little River Ditches Basin (LRDB) and Lower St. Francis Basin (LSFB), in Northeast Arkansas, were evaluated. Flow, nutrients, and sediment were measured at 3-5 instream locations in these two contrasting watersheds. These watersheds differed in primary crop, soil type, and size. Differences in sediment and nutrients loads were measured between the two watersheds primarily due to differences in cropping practices and soil type. LSFB was dominated by rice farms and had more pollutant load per unit area but lower concentrations for all measured parameters except nitrate, whereas LRDB was dominated by cotton farms and had less pollutant load per unit area but higher concentrations. Turbidity increased considerably at LSFB, but it did not increase or decrease at LRDB as water traveled downstream. The median nitrate-N concentration at LRDB increased from 1.64 to 2.34 mg L-1 as watershed size increased, in contrast to no increase at LSFB. Total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations remained constant, but ammonium-N decreased as the water traveled downstream in both watersheds. Nitrate-N were high in spring and late fall at both watersheds. The annual loss of nitrate-N was 9.6 and 8.6 kg ha(-1), sediment was 1604 and 1958 kg ha(-1), and SRP was 0.8 and 0.9 kg ha(-1), respectively from LRDB and LSFB. Source control in spring and late fall could be more effective in reducing agricultural pollution.

Agricultural land use and macroinvertebrate assemblages in lowland temporary streams of the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Streams that dry during part of the year are common throughout the world, yet studies of the macroinvertebrate assemblages in these types of streams are rare compared to those in permanent streams; and studies that assess the effects of agriculture on temporary stream invertebrates are even rarer. We studied macroinvertebrate assemblages in lowland temporary streams of a region with high agricultural land use, the southern Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. Overall assemblages were dominated by non-insects, and invertebrates tolerant of organic pollution. Nonetheless, these invertebrates displayed adaptations to life in temporary habitats, and as such they may be unique to temporary streams and seasonal wetlands, providing an important addition to regional biodiversity. Stream invertebrates are also important as a prey base for native fish and amphibians using these channels. Benthic invertebrate densities were higher at sites with slower water and more in-stream vegetation; to a lesser degree greater agricultural land use was associated with lower densities. Taxon richness was also negatively affected by agriculture, but this was most evident when least disturbed and highly agricultural sites were compared. Sites in watersheds with a lower proportion of their area under agriculture (mostly west of the Willamette River) had a variety of taxa in disturbance-sensitive insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT), plus flies in the family Simuliidae present. In addition, they had greater relative abundances of 2 types of flies in the family Chironomidae. In contrast, sites in watersheds with high agricultural land use (mainly east of the Willamette River) had greater relative abundances of non insects, including ostracods, nematodes, and oligochaete worms. In highly agricultural watersheds, when stream-bottom vegetation was abundant, it was associated with greater benthic invertebrate density, but not with higher taxon richness. Our results suggest that increasing stream-bottom vegetation could be useful when food is limiting for native vertebrates. On the other hand, reduced agricultural land use allows for the development of more diverse benthic invertebrate assemblages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Time lag may therefore, impede the achievement of remediation deadlines such as those described in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Omitting time lag from catchment characterisation renders evaluation of management practices impossible. Time lag aside, regulators at national scale can only manage the expectations of policy makers at larger scales (e.g. European Union) by demonstrating positive nutrient trajectories in catchments failing to achieve at least 'good' status. Presently, a flexible tool for developing spatial and temporal estimates of trends in water quality/nutrient transport and time lags is not available. The objectives of the present study were first to develop such a flexible, parsimonious framework incorporating existing soil maps, meteorological data and a structured modelling approach, and to secondly, to demonstrate its use in a grassland and an arable catchment (similar to 10 km(2)) in Ireland, assuming full implementation of measures in 2012. Data pertaining to solute transport (meteorology, soil hydraulics, depth of profile and boundary conditions) were collected for both catchments. Low complexity textural data alone gave comparable estimates of nutrient trajectories and time lags but with no spatial or soil series information. Taking a high complexity approach, coupling high resolution soil mapping (1:10,000) with national scale (1:25,000) representative profile datasets to <5 m depth, indicated trends in nutrient transport of 10-12 months and 13-17 months throughout the grassland and arable catchments, respectively. For the same conditions, regulators relying on data from groundwater sampling to test the efficacy of the present measures would be delayed by 61-76 months and 46-79 months, respectively. Variation in meteorological datasets enabled temporal analysis of the trends in nutrient transport and time lag estimates. Such a tool could help catchment scientists to better characterise and manage catchments, determine locations for monitoring or mitigation, assess the efficacy of current measures, and ultimately, advise policy makers and regulators.

Quantitative assessment of human exposure to extended spectrum and AmpC beta-lactamases bearing E. coli in lettuce attributable to irrigation water and subsequent horizontal gene transfer	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY					9th International Conference on Predictive Modelling in Food (ICPMF)	SEP 08-12, 2015	Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	Elsevier, Int Comm Predict Modelling Food				The contribution of the fresh produce production environment to human exposure with bacteria bearing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and AmpC beta-lactamases (ESBL/AmpC) has not been reported. High prevalence of ESBLs/AmpC bearing E. coli as well as a high gene transfer efficiency of lettuce and irrigation water E. coli isolates was previously reported. This stochastic modeling was aimed at quantitatively assessing human exposure to ESBL/AmpC bearing E. coli through lettuce attributable to irrigation water and subsequent horizontal gene transfer. Modular process risk approach was used for the quantitative exposure assessment and models were constructed in Ms. Excel spreadsheet with farm to consumption chain accounted for by primary production, processing, retail and consumer storage. Probability distributions were utilised to take into account the variability of the exposure estimates. Exposure resulting from ESBL/AmpC positive E. coli and gene transfer was taken into account. Monte Carlo simulation was carried out using @Risk software followed by sensitivity and scenario analysis to assess most effective single or combinations of mitigation strategies for the ESBL/AmpC positive E. coli events from farm to fork. Three percent of South African lettuce consumers are exposed to lettuce contaminated with about 10(6.4) +/- 10(6.7) (95% CI: 10(5.1)-10(7)) cfu of ESBL/AmpC positive E. coli per serving. The contribution of originally positive isolates and conjugative genetic transfer was 10(6) +/- 10(6.7) (95% CI: 10(5)-10(7)) and 10(5.2) +/- 10(6.6) (95% CI: 10(3.9)-10(5.8)) cfu per serving respectively. Proportion of ESBL/AmpC positive E. coli (Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho) = 0.85), conjugative gene transfer (rho = 0.05-0.14), washing in chlorine water (rho = 0.18), further rinsing (rho = 0.15), and prevalence of E. coli in irrigation water (rho = 0.16) had highest influence on consumer exposure. The most effective single methods in reducing consumer exposure were reduction in irrigation water microbial quality variation (87.4% reduction), storage period (49.9-87.4% reduction) and growth rate reduction by 75% (90% reduction). Reduction in growth rate together with storage time (92.1-99.4%) and reduction in storage time combined with E. coli concentration in irrigation water (95-96% reduction) were most effective combinations of mitigation measures. The high variation in exposure reflected the high irrigation water quality variation. The exposure levels may impose higher consumer risk than acceptable for irrigation water risk. E. coli contamination and growth related measures, as well as measures to reduce contamination with antimicrobial resistant E. coli from lettuce production environment are recommended. This exposure model could form a basis for the development of similar models assessing the impact of contaminated irrigation water and gene transfer in other microbial hazards, antimicrobial resistance types and fresh produce types.

A novel coagulant dose controller was designed and successfully implemented in a pilot UF-RO seawater desalination plant. The coagulant controller, which tracks the UF resistance during filtration and backwash, adjusts coagulant dose to the UF feed with the objective of reducing the incremental cycle -to -cycle UF post -backwash (PB) resistance change (i.e., Delta(n)). Real-time tracking the above UF resistance metrics, as well as the rate of change of Delta(n) with coagulant dose, enabled the controller to quantify the progression of both irreversible fouling and UF backwash effectiveness. The above information was then utilized by the controller to make the appropriate coagulant adjustment. Field tests of the proposed self -adaptive coagulant dosing approach demonstrated measurable coagulant dose reduction while maintaining robust UF operation even during periods of both mild and severe water quality degradation. The approach to real-time coagulant dose control developed in the present work should be suitable for both seawater and brackish water UF treatment and has the potential of providing both effective UF operation as well as reduction in coagulant use.

J	Yang, SQ; French, R				Yang, Shu-Qing; French, Rob			Coastal reservoirs - an Australian water storage option	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES												Besides dams, technologies such as desalination, wastewater recycling and rainwater tanks are being employed in urban water supplies. From the fact that Australian water consumption is only 5-6% of annual run-off - as it is worldwide - the coming shortage is not of water, but of storage. New dam sites are becoming increasingly difficult to find and develop on land surfaces, so a paradigm shift is suggested: water storage may be located in seawater environments. The first generation of coastal storages has been successfully constructed in China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Korea. Their water quality problems have been essentially overcome with the second generation of coastal reservoirs which bypass or select against poor quality floodwaters. At a concept level, coastal reservoir technology is compared with other urban water supply technologies.																	1324-1583						2017	21	2					89	97		10.1080/13241583.2018.1454086								WOS:000437912200005

The results based on the data on fauna and flora gathered before (in 2003, T+0) and after (in T+2, T+6 and T+11) the reclamation showed that the river canalization and oxbow lake dredging can significantly disturb the ecology of water bodies adjacent to the river. Observations of the oxbow lake (OLS5), showed the decrease in the number of macrophyte phytocenoses from 11 before the dredging to 6 very valuable Potametea phytocenoses, after wards. The development of common pleustonic phytocenoses of Lemnetea minoris and the massive development of green algae resulted from the bottom sediment removal. In the case of population, Stratiotes aloides was rebuilt after elimination during dredging already in T+2. Before hydrotechnical works, the oxbow lake was characterized by 12 invertebrate taxa inhabiting S. aloides, whereas only 9 were found first period after the dredging, 15 taxa in second period and 23 in a recent study. During both observation periods, dominated by Chironomidae larvae (T+0), Trichoptera larvae (T+2 and T+6) and again Chironomidae larvae (T+11). The hydrotechnical activities significantly altered in the first period the structure of fauna and flora inhabiting the water body. Such radical interference in natural values of oxbow lakes is un-suitable for the preservation of ecosystems due to the significant decrease in their biodiversity. Achieved on a similar or higher level of macrophytes diversity and epiphytic invertebrates was noticeable ten years after the dredging of a water body.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00005	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700005								WOS:000437167900005

Water sludge is produced during coagulation, ozonation and backwashing of rapid anthracite filters. Its characteristic and properties depend on a raw water quality, treatment methods as well as types of chemicals used and their doses. According to the Polish Act of 4 December 2012 (Journal of Laws from 2013, item 21) the water sludge should be treated as hazardous waste. An alternative way to dispose water sludge and reduce its volume may be sludge reuse.

The protective cement linings are also commonly used for old water pipe renovation. In both cases, the cement lining is an excellent anticorrosion protection of the pipelines, effectively separating the pipe wall from the flowing water. Moreover, cement linings protect the pipelines not only by a mechanical barrier, but also by a chemical barrier creating a highly alkaline environment in water contact with the metal pipe wall. In addition, cement coatings have an ability for so-called self-regeneration and provide the improvement of hydraulic conditions inside the pipelines. In turn, the differences between the analysed cement coatings mainly depend on the types of cements used and techniques of cement mortar spraying. As was expected, they influence the quality of water having contact with the coating. A comparison of the impact of cement coatings manufactured in factories and sprayed on building sites during the renovation on drinking water quality parameters was performed in the study. The experiments were conducted in laboratory conditions, using the test stands prepared for this purpose. The results include analysis of selected water quality parameters for the samples contacting with cement mortar and collected during the investigation.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00061	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700061								WOS:000437167900061

This is associated with the imperfection of purification processes, or secondary water pollution. Not only it results in the deterioration of water quality parameters, but it also increases threat of epidemiological problems. The water that is biologically unstable creates ideal conditions for colonization of the microorganisms to the inner surface of pipelines which may form biofilm. The key issue, enabling prevention and control of the impact of the development of biofilms, is to assess the biodiversity of microbiocenosis. In order to obtain comprehensive characteristics of microorganisms communities on a particular substrate, it is necessary to combine several techniques. Further analysis using molecular biology methods are usually after traditional methods of assessing the microbiological quality of water. Standard methods do not reflect the actual species composition, because they are targeted at the bacteria that can be isolated and cultured in the laboratory. Conventional methods are capable of detecting less than 10% of the organisms in the sample. In order to study the biodiversity of organisms inhabiting a biofilm (apart from the conventional methods) analyses of the diversity of nucleic acids should be used. The first method could be the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Another way may be fluorescence in situ hybridization, which allows to detect determined DNA sequence using specially labeled oligonucleotide probes. Visualization of the material is performed using a fluorescence microscope. The main purpose of this article is to present rapid and precise identification groups of microorganisms in their natural habitat in biofilm using fluorescent in situ hybridization method (FISH). FISH method can be successfully used to visualize these microorganisms, which show difficulties in culturing, as well as to provide knowledge on the phylogenetic structure in different habitats. FISH technique allows the quantitative description of environmental samples.																	2267-1242						2017	17								UNSP 00098	10.1051/e3sconf/20171700098								WOS:000437167900098

For this study, six representative sections of the basin were considered. The vulnerability of the basin was determined through indicators of the hydrological regime and water quality based on FAO criteria for irrigation water. As a result, it was determined that the vulnerability index due to shortages has increased from moderate to high, and it has been attributed to the very low capacity for regulation and water retention and moderate use of the resource. The waters are not suitable for irrigation of agricultural crops, and they have slight to moderate restrictions. There is a danger of soil alkalization resulting from concentrations of bicarbonate in the water. The vulnerability could increase with the presence of some factors derived from climate change, due to the reduced supply and increased demand for water for agricultural activities in the area.																	1011-484X	2215-2563				JAN-JUN	2017		58					315	330		10.15359/rgac.58-1.13								WOS:000437752200014

To utilize ISFETs to form an integrated ph sensor is a promising avenue. To implement ISFET based ph sensors the need of calibration of V-th various / id variation of with per instance measurement of actual ph value is required. This waste introduces a unique concept of dynamic auto calibration of ESFET pH sensor, using reconfigurable FPGA hardware architecture in conjunction with artificial intelligence. The proposed work employs real time on the fly calibration system. Where in the output voltage of ISFET is sampled by ADC at various ph level & the same are digitized and sent to calibration pc/laptop, whereas in an artificial neural network learns the voltage output ph curve, & predicts the voltage values at various ph levels vs. Voltage output values & programs LUT (look up table) in FPGA flash. After calibration, the device captures BEET Vout values from ADC and searches the lookup table, computes compensation value & feed DAC to compensate the voltage output of ph sensor as per tradition standards in real time.																			978-1-5386-1144-9				2017							354	358										WOS:000437178100064

Optimum Design of Water Networks Using A Micro Software Based Genetic Algorithms Multiobjective	RIBAGUA-REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DEL AGUA												Water distribution networks are a system that searches for water and brings it to each user according to what they use the water for. The infrastructure needed to achieve this goal requires significant financial investment; therefore, providing the optimal design of these networks is very important. Not only is the economic aspect essential; in addition to it, there are others such as hydraulic behaviour, which refers to maximum pressures and speeds, availability of pipes, water quality, demand distribution, network reliability, system performance which further complicates an integral analysis leading to an optimal design. The optimization of a water network, due to its complexity, is associated to the combinatorial problem called NP-HARD, which means that it is not possible to use a deterministic method to solve it, but requires special methodologies that make use of a reasonable computational processing time. This is necessary to obtain a configuration of diameters complying with the limitations (speed and pressure), as well as achieving acceptable values in the objectives (lower cost and higher reliability). Using multiobjective genetic algorithms can solve this type of NP-HARD combinatorial problems; and consequently, optimizes the water network. To find an optimal set of solutions, we developed a computer program called Magmoredes, which based on the use of a multiobjective genetic microarray, proposed by Coello and Toscano [1], adapted for the application of water distribution networks. To comply the economic demands, under pressure and speed limits according to Peruvian regulations a program in the Java programming language was developed. Finally, verification of the proposed algorithm on the efficiency of the Hanoi water network is performed (Fujiwara and Khang, [2]). This water network has a single source with 3 basic circuits, 31 nodes, 1 reservoir and 34 pipes. The nodes are at the same elevation and minor losses in the pipes are not considered.																	2386-3781						2017	4	1					6	23		10.1080/23863781.2017.1317087								WOS:000437211300002

Jeli district in the state of Kelantan, Malaysia, is rich in water resources with attractive natural and geological/geomorphological features such as lake, river, waterfall, and hot spring. This study discusses the geological assessment of potential water-based tourism sites in the district, by selecting four (4) destinations i.e. Pergau Lake, Jeli Hot Spring, Rual River, and Lata Renyok Waterfall as case studies. Geological mapping and characterisation of these sites have been conducted in 2014. These sites contain some interesting geological/geomorphological features such as granitic mountainous and hilly areas (in Pergau Lake), exotic hot water spring in a small valley (in Jeli Hot Spring), beautiful landscape and features of a river valley (in Rual River), and wonderful cascading waterfall in the alternating bright and dark-coloured rocks (in Lata Renyok Waterfall). The geological assessment of these sites was carried out through qualitative and quantitative approaches based on some geodiversity values: scientific, educational, aesthetic, recreational, and some other values. To support the assessment, the in situ water quality analysis was conducted in mid of 2014 (June-July 2014) to show that these sites have different water quality classes based on Malaysia's Interim National Water Quality Standard (INWQS) i.e. Class I for Lata Renyok Waterfall, Class III for Rual River, and Class IV for Pergau Lake and Jeli Hot Spring. All localities are potential water-based tourism attractions in the district which have some specific tourism and recreational activities e.g. swimming and bathing (in Lata Renyok Waterfall and Rual River), fishing (in Lata Renyok Waterfall, Rual River, and Pergau Lake), rafting, boating, and kayaking/canoeing (in Pergau Lake), and hot water therapy and skin treatment (in Jeli Hot Spring). It is recommended that all these localities should be conserved and developed properly as models of sustainable water-based tourism destinations in Malaysia.																	2364-6934	2364-8198	978-3-319-51856-5; 978-3-319-51855-8				2017							173	195		10.1007/978-3-319-51856-5_11								WOS:000436089500011

They are predominantly represented by gastropods and only locally by bivalves. Within this framework, gastropod species of the genera Theodoxus, Melanopsis, Melanoides, Physa, Bulinus, Galba, Hydrobia, Ovatella, Falsipyrgula, Prosostenia, Pseudamnicola proved to be useful. Most commonly encountered are Theodoxus, Melanopsis Melanoides and Physa, and their presence alone presents good information about the quality of the water body they are living in. The results of the study indicate that Theodoxus and Melanopsis represent indicators of pure and clean fresh water while Physa is an indicator of polluted water. Of very special interest is the fauna in King Abdullah Canal influenced by the fauna of Lake Tiberias, represented by Falsipyrgula, and the bivalves of the two species of Unionidae and of Corbicula. Species of Falsipyrgula. Pseudamnicola, Melanoides, and Prosostenia tolerate increasing water salinity which when reaching sea water salinity Ovatella becomes present. Locally Pseudamnicola documents influence of mineral water which can tolerate high Sr2+ and Br(-)concentrations. Other members of Gastropods, especially Planorbis, Gyraulus and Ancylus have almost disappeared from running or standing fresh water in Jordan because of increasing pollution. The bivalves, Unio, Pisidium, Sphaerium, and Corbicula are found confined to freshwater environment. With exception of King Abdullah Canal where they used to be useful indicators for the quality of its water, they are rare in Jordanian waters. The study concludes that aquatic mollusks, mainly gastropods, can easily be used as biological indicators of environmental quality of surface water bodies. It is a fast, easy and trustful way of observing changes taking place in the environment, especially salinity, added chemical and pollution parameters.																	2364-6934	2364-8198	978-3-319-51856-5; 978-3-319-51855-8				2017							295	318		10.1007/978-3-319-51856-5_17								WOS:000436089500017

The operational change involved the cancellation of the primary settling tanks of the plant, and as a result, the raw wastewater received at the plant directly entered the aeration tanks. The effect of this change on treated wastewater quality as determined by Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentration was evaluated. These parameters were measured for one month before and one month after the cancelation of the primary settling tanks and the average values were calculated. Results showed that the average removal percentage of BOD and TSS in the last month before the operational change was implemented was 89 and 88%, respectively. The average removal percentage for the same parameters in the first month immediately after implementing the operational changes was 91 and 92% respectively, which shows that there is no significant difference in the removal efficiency for these parameters after the operational change. These results indicate that the treated wastewater quality was not affected by the operational change implemented at the plant. Results of this research provide useful information for the authorities responsible for wastewater treatment as well as for the scientific community.																	2364-6934	2364-8198	978-3-319-51856-5; 978-3-319-51855-8				2017							407	417		10.1007/978-3-319-51856-5_23								WOS:000436089500023

On the surface that previously belonged to the river have developed agriculture, transport routes and settlements. At the end of the 20th century, development spread over hazardous areas, many torrent flowed in highly confined channels, and ground water recharges drop down, instability of land surface and security for inhabitants decreased. This resulted in the changes reducing water resources of appropriate quality, reducing space for sediment deposit, increasing erosion, affecting natural habitats, causing major flood damage, decreasing groundwater stock, and deteriorating water quality. The water regime integrates all events across space from landslides, debris flow and is manifested in river regime in low lands. This problem is partially covered by many United Nations (UN) and UNESCO documents and reports. Proper actions are also suggested in the Ministerial Declaration from the 7th World Water Forum, where the first mentioned action is the significance of appropriate land management in relation to sustainable water management and planning. More room for landslides control means more space for potential landslide control out man made impacts that cause land slope instability, more space for torrents, more space for water and sediment storages, less impact on the slope stability and higher security for the peoples. We should change paradigm of space planning and development, especially in countries in development under intensive urbanization. The aim of this paper is to present particularly bad examples from Slovenia in order to support this proposal.																			978-3-319-59469-9; 978-3-319-53500-5				2017							563	569		10.1007/978-3-319-59469-9_51								WOS:000435273300051

Temporal Analysis of Water Quality in the Straits of Johor	JURNAL KEJURUTERAAN												Temporal analysis is used to obtain changes in water quality along the Straits of Johor. Boxplot is used to show graphically on the temporal pattern of yearly and monthly temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total suspended solids (TSS) and oil and grease in the water from 2003 to 2013. The ANOVA test is carried out to determine the significance of the mean of each parameter between years. The boxplot shows a particular trendfor each of the marine parameters over the year and the seasonal pattern is only apparent in temperature. The ANOVA test indicates a significant difference in the means of each water quality marine parameter across the year. The changes in each of the marine parameters over the year could be associated to the natural features of the marine water and climate change. The seasonal pattern however is only apparent in temperature which could be influenced by the monsoon seasons.																	0128-0198	2289-7526					2017	29	1			SI		63	67		10.17576/jkukm-s-01-09								WOS:000436530100009

The use of markers of water pollution can be a universal tool for water quality control. Nowadays, indicators specific to wastewater, belonging to the group of emerging contaminants become popular. Due to their low concentration, very sensitive techniques should be applied for their determination. In this study the HPLC-Q-TOF-MS was used for the determination of the emerging contaminants that can be presented in wastewater. Moreover, two different extraction procedure and chromatographic conditions were used in order to obtain the best results. Compounds such as acesulfame-K, caffeine, and paracetamol were detected in raw wastewater sample, whereas only acesulfame-K was found in effluent sample. It seems that this compound could be selected as water pollution marker in Polish water.																			978-80-7444-052-6				2017							216	222										WOS:000435216500039

Today, most of the places are suffering from the scarcity of water which is becoming the most imperative issue for human being because water is one of the most important natural resource present on earth. About 70% of the earth's surface is covered with water out of which only 1% is available as fresh water. In that case there is a need to use water efficiently. A vast amount of water is being wasted without being consumed anywhere due to existing ineffective water supply system. Unnecessary leakage of large amount of water during supply, unsystematic supply to various regions i.e. not according to consumption, need or requirement, degraded water quality, time taking process to find the fault and then fixing it are the major drawbacks in the existing supply system. In this research we are designing and implementing an efficient water management system based on smart wireless sensor technology, using IOT, automatic learning with multiple modules and cloud computing to enhance the water supply system.																	1865-0929	1865-0937	978-981-10-5427-3; 978-981-10-5426-6				2017	721						457	470		10.1007/978-981-10-5427-3_48								WOS:000434872100048

As a results of these activities, the nature is impacted by a number of changes and anthropogenic pollution. In this study, drilling core samples from the Izmit Bay (IZC-01) in the Sea of Marmara, Surmene (SC-01) and Hopa (HC-01) coasts in the Black Sea have been investigated with lithological, sedimentological, paleontological and geochemical perspectives. The concentrations of heavy metals as Ba, As, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Ti and Zn were considered from total of 45 samples which are covering 15 samples from each three cores. PLI (Pollution load index) values are calculated by using the results of As, Ba, Pb, Cr, Ni, and Zn elements, stand out 3.255 for the Gulf of Izmit, 2,195 and 1,706 for Surmene and Hopa in respectively. PLI values indicate accepted level of pollution above for the Gulf of Izmit and despite being dirty Surmene and Hopa relatively less polluted. In addition, EF values indicate a significant enrichment of the As, M and Cr and moderate enrichment of Pb and Zn elements at Izmit Gulf. In locations Hopa and Surmene; As, Ba and Cr elements showing insufficient enrichment and Ni, Pb and Zn was observed a significant enrichment. Besides, pollution related gypsum crystallization is also remarkable for Maramara core. The abundance and diversity of paleontological records in the cores are also compatible in line with the decreasing and increasing rate of pollution. Towards the deepest part of the all 3 cores, a reduction in the concentrations of elements such as Pb, Zn, Cr and As is seen. Radiocarbon dates obtained, from the shells of these reduction levels are mesured in Surmene 420 +/- 55 (BP) and Hopa 500 +/- 50 (BP). In addition, results of the other previous studies based on sedimentation rate and these ages are compatible. These specified age ranges were compared with opinions in the literature which are related to the beginning of Anthropocene and because of the overlaping, these clearly observed levels have been interpreted as the limit of the possible Anthropocene time.																	1016-9164						2017	60	2					145	168		10.25288/tjb.300672								WOS:000434458500001

Therefore, the further implementation of EPT index as bio-indicator can be standardized and efficient. The results showed that, EPT assemblage and distribution at these rivers varies even though there is no significant difference in the water quality. Water quality of all the rivers are in the range of 'good' level. Therefore, regression analysis was made to confirm the main factors influencing the variation of EPT assemblage within selected recreational rivers in Kelantan, Malaysia. The substrate composition appeared as the main factor influencing the variation in distribution and composition of EPT in good water quality from the analysis. Thus, it is concluded that the substrate composition is the major factor influencing the composition and distribution of EPT in recreational river (good water quality).																	1112-9867						2017	9			7	SI		37	48		10.4314/jfas.v9i7s.5								WOS:000433431200004

So, it is indispensable for real-time monitoring and early warning. The monitoring strategy used now relies on the deployment of sensors in large scale. Thus reducing the cost and size of the sensors is of great importance. In this paper, a solid state miniature pH sensor, consisting of an iridium oxide film based pH electrode and a solid state reference electrode, was developed for water quality detection. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation indicated that the iridium oxide nanoparticles were deposited on the surface of Pt electrode. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey illustrated that the atomic ratio of Ir (III) to Ir (IV) is about 1.38. The pH electrode exhibited a good linearity with the high sensitivity of -75.8 mV/pH. The characterization result of the on-chip reference electrode indicated that the proposed reference electrode has a good potential stability. The sensor could be fabricated in batches, thus the cost could be controlled to be acceptable for the use in large numbers.																			978-3-11-051662-3				2017							543	553		10.1515/9783110516623-053								WOS:000432429000053

The biostability is a useful approach to study the two competing affections that determine bacterial regrowth in a distribution system, inactivation because of the presence of a disinfectant and growth because of the presence of a substrate. This paper presents a research method for determining biostability, related water quality indexes, and limited factors on bacteria regrowth, therefore this will enable water plants to incorporate this approach for water quality safe needs.

The larvae were cultivated for 21 days under the following feed treatments: 100F (100% commercial feed); 67F33A (67% commercial feed, and 33% fronzen Artemia nauplii); 34F66A (34% commercial feed, and 66% frozen Artemia nauplii); and 100A (100% frozen Artemia nauplii). The larvae, submitted to the feed treatments, did not differ in performance, survival, weight, total and standard lengths, Fulton's condition factor and specific growth rate. Commercial ration increased ammonia concentrations, impairing water quality, while Artemia supply provided low concentrations of ammonia, partially due to easy cleaning. Therefore, frozen Artemia nauplii should be used in the curimata-pacu larviculture.					/0000-0002-8676-2254												0046-9939	1678-2305					2017	43				SI		47	53		10.20950/1678-2305.2017.47.53								WOS:000432890600005

An ammonia nitrogen concentration soft measure model based on the artificial neural network(ANN) is proposed in this paper, and utilizing existing data to achieve parameters detection in real-time accurately during the process of wastewater treatment processing. Firstly, parameters which are easily to detect are chosen as instrumental variables, then optimize the network's parameters by gradient descent algorithm.

To improve the efficiency of ozonation and to stabilize the quality of the treated water, the ozone dosage should be a good trade-off between the requirement of disinfection and the restriction of bromate formation. However, because of the changes of raw water quality and the nonlinear behavior of ozonation process, the ozone dosing process is very difficult to be controlled. In this paper, the control strategy of keeping a constant ozone exposure is attempted instead of conventional keeping a constant ozone dosage or dissolved ozone residual. To this end, internal model control (IMC) scheme based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network model is proposed to maintain a constant ozone exposure by adjusting ozone dosage. With the proposed control scheme, a RBF neural network model is established which could be used for IMC. And then an IMC controller is designed. The full-scale experimental studies demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed control scheme.																	2161-2927		978-9-8815-6393-4				2017							4430	4434										WOS:000432014405005

Particularly arsenic contamination in ground water has became great dilemma in the earlier decades. With advent in research for arsenic remediation, standard of drinking water is improving and now reduced to few parts per million (ppm) level of arsenic in drinking water sources. However, due to continuous enhancement in environmental pollution, remediation techniques are still needed to achieve the drinking water quality standard. Development of novel and economically feasible removal techniques or materials for selective separation of this toxic specie has been the main focus of research. Several arsenic removal techniques, including membrane separation, coagulation, precipitation, anion exchange have been developed. The aim of this article is to review briefly arsenic chemistry and previous and current available technologies that have been reported various low-cost adsorbents for arsenic removal.																	1996-918X	2221-5255					2017	18	1					18	36		10.21743/pjaec/2017.06.02								WOS:000432277000002

One of the most recurrent applications consists in the detection of changes and the related minimization of false alarms. This requirement is true also when dealing with natural systems. The monitoring of a natural resource usually involves the identification of a set of parameters, which are considered as representative of its underlining processes, in order to extract useful information about its current status and its expected behavior. This work is focused on the water resources destined to the drinkable water distribution, paying attention to two particular aspects: i) the need for a suitable metric to detect anomalous values in the assessment of water quality indicators; ii) the experimentation of a simplified data-driven strategy to estimate natural variations of one or more indicators, in order to mitigate false alarms. This paper proposes a preliminary investigation and a selected case study, in order to exemplify one practical implementation of the proposed approach. The possible application to a context of low-cost distributed sensors is also briefly discussed.																			978-1-5090-3596-0				2017							494	499										WOS:000431839600088

The problem is not just of the water quantity but also water quality. Water harvesting, water recycling and re-use in irrigation, reduction of water losses, improvement of crop water productivity are all based on principles of hydrotechnics and can be achieved with sustainable hydrotechnical measures. Integrated planning of hydrotechnical measures offers opportunities for the enhanced management of water demand.

The idea of switching from a theoretical concept of intelligent monitoring station for the quality of surface waters, obtained through the CAE computational technology, to a superior level of technological readiness which will take effect as an experimental demonstrator (the 3SWQM live-online-dynamic monitoring model), is illustrated in the current images from this paper. The special structure of the monitoring integrates IQ sensors and multiparameter probes for the measurement of the physicochemical and biological factors of the water body which is subject to pollution pressures. Anchored in the offshore of the flowing water the special mechanical structure of the station allows it to float in a fixed point for the monitoring of quality indicators at water surface. At the command of the onboard controller which equips the station this one can be immersed both for the monitoring of the quality indicators at different water levels (profile monitoring) as well as for frost protection during cold season. Thus equipped, the special monitoring station becomes an operational watermark in the infrastructure of the networks for surface water quality monitoring. The physical model thus designed allows the continuous evaluation in situ of the surface water "health status" with the purpose of warning in case of pollution.																	1848-4425						2017	45						87	97										WOS:000432420200009

Theoretical and experimental study on the safety chemistry of separation of oil/water transition layer by oxidation of chlorine dioxide	BULGARIAN CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS												The safety chemistry of ClO2 oxidative treatment of an oil/water transition layer was studied and evaluated by theoretical calculation and experiments. The theoretical analysis indicated that the unsafe factors were recognized as the difference of overpressure during the oxidation process, which originates from the decomposition of ClO2 and the release of gas from the oxidation of the reduced substances in the layer. The experimental results showed that the process pressure increased to a quite high value with the highly concentrated ClO2, and the overpressure caused an increase in the reactive temperature. Based on these data, some suggestions were presented for the safe production. The latter should ensure that the decomposed gas from chlorine dioxide leaves the atmosphere smoothly if the reaction process is an open system. ClO2 should be used at temperatures as low as possible, and the pressure control should be as stable as possible. This study provides safety control of the oxidation performance of chlorine dioxide, and efficient resolution of the settling tank oil/water transition layer with thickening, low-quality crude oil and high water quality.																	0324-1130						2017	49				K1		24	28										WOS:000432662500005

Soil and water contamination due to the accumulation of waste is another serious issue that adversely affects the health of the inhabitants in the area. There is a compelling need for the village inhabitants to appropriately monitor the water bodies and take suitable measures to dispose of the waste in the area. Over 2 acres of land is inhabited by people in Pettipalam Colony at Thalassery. Their colony ground was used as a municipal waste dump yard until 2014. Presently, also, the colony residents use the area for waste disposal and open defecation, thus contaminating the land and soil with plastic, organic, and chemical pollutants, etc. These contaminants affect the ground water and get washed into the water bodies when it rains, thus polluting the water resources. Techniques such as Bio-remediation (use of microorganisms to remove or neutralize pollutants) and vermi-composting, which triggers growth of plants that absorb the contaminants, can be introduced to address the issue of reducing the level of contaminants in the soil. But these solutions require proper identification of the contaminants. An extensive sensor system, which can monitor the contaminants in the soil as well as the water bodies, is essential. This project aims to design and develop an IoT based system that can sense the environmental parameters and effectively deliver information on the level of contamination and the quality of the water. Sensors to detect the hydrocarbons, chemical and metal content in the soil can be integrated into a soil probe for monitoring the soil contamination. And sensors for detecting pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, etc. can be used for monitoring the water quality in the rivers, ponds, etc. in the site of interest. The design, development and implementation of an IoT based system will help the authorities take the necessary steps to perform proper waste management of the affected area. We anticipate that monitoring the suitable parameters will help to impact land restoration initiatives in many areas of India.																	2377-6919		978-1-5090-6046-7				2017							108	114										WOS:000431859500038

It plays a vital role in the survival and existence of flora and fauna. But, now a days it is been exploited heavily by dumping of human waste, industrial and chemical waste in to the water bodies which is the resultant of water being contaminated with toxic chemicals. Water scarcity and water contamination has been one of the major issues faced by the society around the world. In many developing countries like India, the main focus is given to industrialization and urbanization. But this has caused an increased water usage and water contamination. This paper deals with the monitoring of water quality by mainly considering the physical and chemical properties of water. For this purpose, a Wireless Sensor node is designed which will contain several sensors to sense the chemical contents of water. The highlight of sensor node is that it is water proof. The main components of WSN include microcontroller for processing the system, communication system for inter and intra node communication and several sensors. The power for the sensor nodes are obtained from the solar panels connected to the sensor nodes. Though, in earlier times, there were water quality monitoring systems, they were power hungry and not real time. Apart from acting as a single system, if this system integrates with other innovative solutions like Smart Home or Smart Building, the application of this system would increase leading to an increased demand for it. This paper highlights on how a real time monitoring system can be made generic, using Network Virtualization. Also, new technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) could be incorporated in this system to make it advanced																	2377-6919		978-1-5090-6046-7				2017							125	131										WOS:000431859500039

Existing technologies make it possible to very accurately quantify contaminant levels in water; however the expense, extensive training, and off-site analysis required by these methods prevent wide scale use. Electrochemical detection offers many advantages, such as portability, minimal use of instrumentation, and ready integration with electronics. With a goal of water quality interventions, we have presented an affordable and point-of-use platform capable of detecting small amounts of arsenic in water samples. Our electrochemical system utilizes a three-electrode sensor integrated with a handheld, self-designed potentiostat called Aquasift. Aquasift's hardware is simplified as much as possible to maintain affordability and relies on firmware complexity to provide functionality comparable to more expensive bench top potentiostats. Several optional on-board digital filters are available for signal conditioning. The Aquasift can sample at a rate up to 1KSPS and the output data rate is adjustable from 1KSPS down to 1 sample per second. The board uses 12-bit data converters to provide a voltage resolution of 806 micro volts. The Aquasift is powered directly from the USB port and requires no additional power source. We compare the results obtained from the Aquasift of arsenic testing to those obtained from a commercially available bench top potentiostat. The results show Aquasift's comparable accuracy to the commercial analyzer, and demonstrate that our proposed system is a more affordable, portable alternative to laboratory testing.																	2377-6919		978-1-5090-6046-7				2017							211	214										WOS:000431859500053

Challenges associated with traditional environmental monitoring methods include accessibility constraints imposed by harsh terrains and vast geographical areas, lack of real-time data collection and processing, and the inability to facilitate continuous monitoring. This calls for a need to develop remote environmental monitoring techniques that are based on intelligent data acquisition, communication and processing. This paper focuses on using Internet of Things (IoT) technology to build and deploy smart, connected sensors that provide continuous monitoring of air and soil quality. Acquired data will be displayed on a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides real-time information, which may be used to define current conditions of the area being monitored, and also to establish trends or detect any abnormalities. Parameter thresholds will be established in order to trigger email/text alerts to users, stakeholders, or monitoring personnel, when there is a deviation from normal.																	2377-6919		978-1-5090-6046-7				2017							607	612										WOS:000431859500107

Phosphate fertilising management: new indicators for bioavailability applied to carrot crops	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CARROT AND OTHER APIACEAE	Acta Horticulturae				International Symposium on Carrot and Other Apiaceae	SEP 17, 2014	Angers, FRANCE	Int Soc Hort Sci				New indicators for bioavailability, in link with the knowledge of the phenomena involved in plants' phosphate nutrition, were assessed in carrot crops, and experimental references were established. The trials conducted in the Aquitaine region, a major French carrot production area for the fresh market, consisted in analysing the response of carrot, in terms of yield, to a wide range of soil phosphorus supply levels. The synthesis of the data acquired during a three-year study shows the importance of the P concentration in the soil solution, i.e. the soluble P, noted as Cp, for diagnosing the soil's nutritional status. Measuring Cp may be sufficient in the case of slightly buffered soils, characteristic for carrot cultivation in Aquitaine. However, the quality of the relation between yield and soil supply improves when it is represented by the sum of soluble P and diffusible P, linked to the plant's functioning. This is indicator E. Threshold values were determined, corresponding to 1 mg P L-1 and 15.7 mg P kg(-1) soil respectively for Cp and E. Those thresholds require further validation in a wider range of agronomic conditions. Furthermore, the newly acquired knowledge and technical references already make it possible to rectify fertilising practices in Aquitaine. In optimum fertilising conditions, the crop takes up 26 kg P ha(-1), i.e. 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1), and soil supply represents two thirds of the phosphorus uptake. This study offers perspective for new diagnosing methods, which take into account the functioning of the plant species. It shows that a more sparing use of phosphorus in carrot crops is possible without compromising yield. Changing fertilising practices accordingly will guarantee a better preservation of natural resources and water quality. Finally, the outcome of this study encourages us to apply those new concepts in soil phosphorus supply to a wider range of vegetables, in order to establish a reliable basis for integrated P management practices.																	0567-7572	2406-6168	978-94-62611-48-1				2017	1153						29	34		10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1153.5								WOS:000431840300005

Livestock wastewater generation and farm management: the gap analysis	III INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD ENGINEERING	Acta Horticulturae				3rd International Conference on Agricultural and Food Engineering	AUG 23, 2016	Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA	Int Soc Hort Sci				The livestock industry increased significantly globally due to increasing demand for animal products. There are however, growing concerns on the environmental risks, associated with the disposal of untreated livestock wastewater into streams and rivers. This paper aims at studying the pollutant levels in livestock wastewater and its effect on the environment. Samples of undiluted livestock wastewater were collected every week for ten weeks from two farms within the Universiti Putra Malaysia and tested for various water quality parameters. The average values of pollutants tested for, were: pH 6.88, COD 2839 mg L-1, BOD 597 mg L-1, TSS 703 mg L-1, TDS 419 mg L-1, color 6019 PtCo, turbidity 308 NTU, microbes 3x10(9) CFU 100 mL(-1) and NH3-N 180 mg L-1, for dairy wastewater, and pH 7.11, COD 2910 mg L-1, BOD 243 mg L-1, TSS 246 mg L-1, TDS 226 mg L-1, color 373 PtCo, turbidity 35 NTU, microbes 1.7x10(6) CFU 100 mL(-1) and NH3-N 10 mg L-1 for fish pond. These results exceed the effluent discharge standards stated by Environmental Quality Act 1974 and therefore unsuitable for discharge into water streams without prior treatment. Since most rural population depend on groundwater sources for daily activities, it is therefore recommended to intercept and treat wastewaters before they leave the farm as runoff or ground water infiltration or reused for irrigation.																	0567-7572	2406-6168	978-94-62611-49-8				2017	1152						265	271		10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1152.36								WOS:000431840100036

A significant contribution was made by cyanobacteria, their average abundance reached 256,000 cells.cm(-2) and biomass -0.007 mg.cm(-2). The abundance of diatoms varied from 48,000 to 75,000 cells.cm(-2), the biomass reached 0.011 mg.cm(-2) with the dominance of Seminavis ventricosa. The obtained data have shown the necessity of regular monitoring of the microphytobenthos of the Lebyazhy'i Ostrova Reserve in order to identify the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of mass, rare, toxic species and aquatic environment quality estimating using indicator species of microalgae.																	2500-008X						2017	2			2			9	18		10.24189/ncr.2017.027								WOS:000430590900002

As an important water-transfer channel and storage lake for the Eastern Route, the water quality of Nansi Lake has a direct impact on the water quality security of The Eastern Route project. On the basis of measured data and previous research results, this paper has preliminarily analyzed the distribution, content, and changing trend of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) of Nansi lake basin in China under the climate change. The analysis results show that the pollution control of Nansi lake basin has achieved significant results in recent years and the water quality is continuously improving, however, there are still some kinds of PAHs which are potentially threatening the diverting water quality of the Eastern Route project. Further effective measures for controlling pollution should be taken in the future along the Eastern Route project to reduce the adverse impact of these PAHs on water quality security.																	2352-5401		978-94-6252-380-7				2017	111						53	58										WOS:000431391500008

CALCULATED WATER DEMAND AS THE MAIN FACTOR INFLUENCING THE RELIABILITY OF HYDROGEOLOGICAL FORECASTS AT THE EVALUATION OF GROUNDWATER ELASTIC RESERVES	BULLETIN OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN												The article covers the problems of low reliability of hydrogeological forecasts concerning the state of groundwater resources due to significant difference between the amount of estimated elastic reserves registered on governmental level with included in prognostic calculations and actual water intake dynamics of its temporal variations. As a result, it leads to overestimation of prognostic levels with actual state. This problem is most acute within the Almaty urban agglomeration. The choice of this region as a pioneer is obvious for hydrogeologists. Within the limits of the allocated territory as of 2008, the state balance accounts for about 15% of the total value of the drinking water quality of groundwater resources in the Republic of Kazakhstan. The volume of groundwater production within the region is about 45%. This burden on the subsoil is not presented in any other region of the Republic of Kazakhstan. On the basis of available developments in this issue, given appropriate solutions and ways of changing existing approaches to hydrogeological forecasts in estimating groundwater reserves are proposed to eliminate emerging inconsistencies, i.e. the implementation of forecasting taking into account the real, rather than overestimated in the calculation of the dynamics of water withdrawal.																	1991-3494	2518-1467					2017		3					13	26										WOS:000431511500002

These changes expose the industry to the vagaries of the highly dynamic plant protein market. Resulting variations in the precise composition of aqua feeds may carry unpredictable consequences for water quality, since some plant ingredients cause undesirable reductions in the mechanical stability of faeces. Dietary supplements known as binders that enhance the stability of faeces have the potential to mitigate these issues, but may also bring negative effects. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: The present study employs an in vitro model to perform the first fundamental rheological characterization of salmonid chyme, and a factorial experiment designed to investigate the impacts of the presence of rheologically active substances. RESULTS: The highest mean viscosity values were measured for a treatment containing a 2: 1 ratio of tara gum: xanthan gum, resulting in chyme four times more viscous than a control formulation containing the same amount of water. Shear resistance was quantified by analyses of slopes fitting the frequency sweep measurements. CONCLUSIONS: These data open a new statistical approach to monitoring the consequences of market-driven changes in aqua feed composition and their impacts on the nutrition, health or performance of farmed fish.																	0006-355X	1878-5034					2017	54	5-6					167	184		10.3233/BIR-18167								WOS:000431069600004	29660895

The reservoirs chosen as examples include typical dam constructions with a single water body (Jeziorsko, Rydzyna), two water body objects with separated preliminary part (Stare Miasto, Kowalskie, Radzyny) and lateral constructions (Pakoslaw, Jutrosin). The reservoirs were built in period from 1970 to 2014. They differ in construction, functions and water management rules. Analysis of the main problems related to the reservoir functioning is aimed at finding ways of improving the construction of new reservoirs that would satisfy increasingly stringent environmental and legal restrictions and the methods of water management in the reservoirs. On the basis of a questionnaire filled in by the reservoir operators, the main problem is water quality. Especially the huge inflow of biogenic compounds causes blooms of algae and overgrowth with riparian vegetation. Some difficulties are also related to management of the reservoirs of multi-purpose operation. It is difficult to take into account the requirements of environmental flow maintenance, flood protection, water supply for agriculture and water use for tourism and recreation and hydropower generation, etc.																	1644-0765						2017	16	4					205	215		10.15576/ASP.FC/2017.16.4.205								WOS:000431019500013

Application of DHS-USB System and Ozone in Recirculating Freshwater Aquaria Towards Zero Water Exchange Aquaria	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			In recirculating aquaria system (RAS), partial water exchange was performed regularly as a part of aquaria maintenance for maintaining water quality and aesthetic beauty. To reduce large consumption of water during maintenance, this study proposed a biological nitrogen removal system consisted of down-flow hanging sponge (DHS) and an up-flow sludge blanket (USB) system with combination of ozone (O-3) to simultaneously maintain nitrogen compounds concentration and remove yellow substances that implicate color in aquaria without performing water exchange. The performance of the system was evaluated using on site freshwater aquaria at ambient temperature (20-34 degrees C). NH3, NO2-, and NO3- concentration detected was 0.10 +/- 0.12, 0.03 +/- 0.13 and 6.40 +/- 7.46 mg N L-1 respectively. Color were maintained at 6 color units at phase 2 and 4 when O-3 was applied continuously for 8 h per day. In addition, 16S rRNA gene of microorganisms from the bioreactors were sequenced to identify the microbial communities present. The analysis revealed that ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA) such as Ca. Nitrososphaera played important role in nitrification and Thauera played important role in denitrification. Fish survived throughout the study despite no water exchange was performed for 425 days. The application of O-3 in combination with DHS-USB system appeared to be a promising technology towards less-maintenance aquaria.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						43	49		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_7								WOS:000430181700007

Performance of a Baffled Membrane Bioreactor (BMBR) Operated with Sponge Biomass Carriers: Substantial Reduction in Operational Energy	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			The authors have proposed a baffled membrane bioreactor (BMBR) that can eliminate the energy needed for the mixed liquor circulation. A combination of the BMBR concept and use of biomass carriers is promising, and a substantial reduction in energy consumption should be possible. In this study, a pilot-scale BMBR treating municipal wastewater was operated with sponge biomass carriers and its performance was investigated in terms of treated water quality and energy consumption (aeration intensity). Long-term operation of the BMBR revealed that aeration demand for the BMBR was substantially reduced with minimal membrane fouling and excellent nitrogen removal being achieved. The expected energy consumption (aeration intensity) in a full-scale BMBR operated with sponge carriers is very low, definitely lower than the values in "normal" MBRs. With the proposed modification of the MBR, processes using MBRs will no longer be considered to be energy-intensive processes.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						153	158		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_23								WOS:000430181700023

This promising process relying on a dense FO membrane and osmotic gradient demonstrated higher rejections of all contaminants and lower fouling propensity than for MBR. The concept that we developed aims at (partially) retrofit existing MBR into OMBR. In addition to the use of existing MBR installation, such process also allows for combined operation of MBR and OMBR to avoid salinity build-up and to be flexible/reversible in term of operation in MBR/OMBR modes to fit with (seasonal) water quality needs. The study presented aimed at validating the proof of concept of such retrofitting which includes also the development of OMBR/FO module with similar performance than MBR/UF ones. As such, OMBR plate were designed based on Kubota MF cartridge 203 design and using new generation of thin film composite FO membrane. Then, pilot tests were conducted using a 50L MBR/OMBR pilot for two months. Stable operation was obtained in terms of depuration efficiency and water flux. Salinity build up occurred in the reactor, but conductivity was maintained below 3 mS.cm(-1) thanks to the salt purge via the MBR permeate. Fouling was observed both for MBR and OMBR operation; however, for OMBR, osmotic backwash every 3 days allowed for complete removal of the fouling layer. Finally, 90% rejection of all pharmaceuticals compounds tested was observed in OMBR operation as a result of combined biological degradation and high rejection of FO membranes.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						188	192		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_29								WOS:000430181700029

Removal of Conventional Water Quality Parameters, Emerging Contaminants and Fluorescing Organic Matter in a Hybrid Constructed Wetland System	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			Constructed wetlands (CWs) are nature-based wastewater treatment systems, which are often implemented in decentralized areas and small communities. In recent decades, the CW technology has rapidly evolved through the use of various designs and operational modes or other intensifications so as to improve effluent water quality with respect to various pollutants from wastewater. In the present study, the removal of conventional water quality parameters, emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) and fluorescence signature was investigated in a hybrid constructed wetland system comprising different CW configurations: (i) unsaturated vertical subsurface flow (VF), (ii) partial saturated vertical subsurface flow (VF sat), (iii) saturated horizontal flow (HF) and (iv) free water surface (FWS) wetlands. The obtained results showed higher removal of BOD5, COD and fluorescing organic matter in the aerobic VF reactor, whereas the anoxic HF wetland was the most efficient unit for nitrogen removal. The partially saturated VF wetland showed a greater performance in the reduction of nitrogen and highly biodegradable EOCs than the unsaturated VF bed. Finally, linear regression analyses performed between removal of water quality parameters, EOCs and fluorescence measurements suggested the possibility to use fluorescence indexes as useful indicators of water treatment efficacy and/or surrogate parameters for EOCs monitoring.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						313	317		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_50								WOS:000430181700050

REWAQUA: An Advanced Technology for Water Purification in Sustainable Aquaculture Based on Photocatalytic Ozonation	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			The present study has been undertaken in order to test the real potential of photocatalytic ozonation in a bench-scale recirculating aquaculture system working on a 180 L reef coral aquarium. Notably, this choice may be considered representative. In fact, (i) the system is virtually closed so that fresh water turnover is practically negligible, (ii) the presence of living organisms is highly diversified (corals, fishes, molluscs, echinoderms and crustaceans) and some of them are particularly sensitive to water quality, (iii) high salinity strongly puts a strain on the purification system. The hereby presented purification method has been named REWAQUA, which stands for REcycling Water for AQUAculture and AQUAria. REWAQUA allows purification rates higher than the sum of the rates of the single technologies (photocatalysis and ozonation) operating in series. Furthermore the production of bromate ions, which are carcinogenic by-products of ozonation, is efficiently controlled. Two years observation of the reef coral aquarium reveals that photocatalytic ozonation is a good candidate for water purification in recirculating systems in view of a sustainable aquaculture.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						318	323		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_51								WOS:000430181700051

Limitations using mechanistic biofilm models for engineering design do not rely on improved biofilm models, but rely on improved biofilm reactor models. This is important when considering that biofilm reactors containing submerged, free-moving biofilm carriers are the most widely applied biofilm system(s) for municipal wastewater treatment. This paper presents a new biofilm reactor model that considers the impact of submerged free-moving biofilm carrier (Xcarrier) movement on system performance. The model accounts for a hydrodynamic condition characterized as plug flow with back mixing (to model axial dispersion). The relevance of this new biofilm reactor model to engineering situations is evaluated by applying it to relevant scenarios and comparing model results.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						508	512		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_79								WOS:000430181700079

Reshaping the Activated Sludge Model ASM2d for Better Manageability and Higher Integration Potential	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			The European Water Framework Directive has pointed out that the best model for water management is management by river basin. However, to obtain an overview of the water quality in a river basin system, one has to look at the individual components of the system such as the sewer network, the wastewater treatment plant and the receiving water bodies and the interaction between them. Within this study, we develop an adjusted model from the original state-of-the-art activated sludge ASM2d model with as main focus to maximize the compatibility with the sewage and river water quality models while still assuring a sufficient prediction capacity of the activated sludge system. To this end, and to avoid the commonly required fractionation into the classic activated sludge model state variables, the latter are directly derived from the outputs of the sewage model (e.g., BOD5, COD, TN or TP) for the adjusted model. Furthermore, the modified ASM2d model is made more realistic and can be more broadly applied due to the re-introduction of organic nitrogen and phosphorus component state variables. While developed on the basis of the data of a wastewater treatment plant in Belgium, the validation of the adjusted model on a data set of a wastewater treatment plant in Girona (Spain) is highly promising.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						583	587		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_91								WOS:000430181700091

Application of Membrane Technology towards The Reusability of Lake Water, Mine Water, and Tube Well Water	JURNAL KEJURUTERAAN												Severe water shortage caused by El-Nino has caused life-threatening drought conditions globally. This natural disaster has put millions of lives at risk and forcing the people to search for waster. However, the water scarcity problem was not just limited to the countries that were strike by El-Nino. Poor water management and climate change were bringing droughts to Asia and the Pacific. The water scarcity worldwide has recently reached the alarming rate and received the greatest attention among the people. Membrane technology is an innovative technology which has proven to be effective and efficient for water and wastewater treatment. Therefore, membrane technology has high potential to be employed for the treatment of lake water, mine water, and tube well water in increasing the fresh water production for reuse purpose. The objective of this work is to investigate the potential of membrane technology for treating the lake water, mine water, and tube well water. A laboratory bench-scale dead-end test rig was used in this study to evaluate the performance of commercial flat-sheet nanofiltration (NF)-NF270 and reverse osmosis (RO)-BW30 membranes. Both source water and treated water were analysed based on chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), colour, total suspended solid (TSS), pH, and temperature. In order to prove the reuse concept of membrane technology, the permeate water quality after the membrane filtration process was compared with National Water Quality Standard (NWQS) of Malaysia. The results from this study shown that the permeate water filtered by NF270 and BW30 membranes were able to meet the NWQS Class III, which was suitable to recycled for livestock drinking and irrigation purposes.																	0128-0198	2289-7526					2017	29	2					131	137		10.17576/jkukm-2017-29(2)-09								WOS:000430867900009

The diversity of Species is due to the extensive aquatic environment where it is inserted. The Paspalun repens species comes from the Buiucu lake located in the region of Parintins-Amazonas-Brazil. The macrophyte was dried in a mill and then a digestion through biomass microwaves was done before and after its exposure to the solutions containing different concentrations of zinc and copper (1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 3.00 mg mL(-1) of metals) for a period of 48 hours. As a source of the metals, zinc sulfate (ZnSO4 7H(2)O) for zinc, and copper sulfate (CuSO4 5H(2)O) for copper were used as the source. As a result, the efficiency of Paspalun repens was observed in the metals removal, the highest removal percentage, of 29.67 and 37.07% in the leaves, whereas in the root it was 25.25 and 32.84% (at the concentration 1.0 and 2.0 mg/mL consequently), was of zinc, therefore the dry biomass of this species can be considered as a low cost alternative material in the removal of these heavy metals, contributing to the improvement of water quality.																	1516-1439	1980-5373					2017	20			2			532	536		10.1590/1980-5373-MR-2017-0109								WOS:000430187600080

Nowadays, many hydropower systems confront with infiltration through dams or lateral dikes, followed by unexpected erosions. In order to maintain the hydropower system active, the water level is drastically reduced, sometimes even with 10 m. Consequently, it means less water for the human necessities (water supply, irrigation), but mainly few resources to produce electric energy. The research paper starts by presenting the actual dams situation, structured on hydrographic basins. For the case study two hydropower lakes from Arges-Vedea hydrographic area that confront seepage through embankments were selected. In that area there are more than 100 lakes which confront with different functioning problems. The local geomorphologic structure and the water quality create an image of local functioning conditions. Further, there are briefly presented the mathematical and numerical models, elaborated as to establish the infiltration risk zones. The numerical model is tested and calibrated based on local conditions, showing the zone with erosion and infiltration risks. Finally, some conclusions, possibilities to extend the numerical model, the acknowledgements, and references are presented.																							2017							77	84		10.21698/simi.2017.0010								WOS:000430609800010

It is known that the contamination was induced by the industrial activities carried out in the area, which is caused by sulfur dioxide air emissions and atmospheric particulate matters containing heavy metals, mainly cadmium, lead and zinc. The pollution of the city and the neighboring areas was mainly due to activities of two companies: SC Sometra SA (with a non-ferrous metallurgy profile, which before 1990 was considered the largest unit in the country) and SC Carbosin SA (with a chemical profile until its closing, in 1993). The assessment of the quality level of the environmental factors was carried out in 2016 through specific activities for soil and water quality investigation - sampling and physico-chemical analysis in R&D Institute for Industrial Ecology ECOIND laboratories, in order to highlight relevant elements of environmental quality of the above mentioned year, within a pre-established experimental field and targeting the limited area of the Copsa Mica city. As an important aspect, it is worth mentioning that the footprint of the pollution sources is still present in the area, even long after their activity has ceased. It is estimated that a soil and water monitoring could establish a dynamics of the quality parameters in the Copsa Mica area during the subsequent periods.																							2017							128	133		10.21698/simi.2017.0016								WOS:000430609800016

Poor water quality has adverse effects on human health and aquatic life. Hence, protecting the water resources from pollutants and the monitoring of water quality is important. In recent years, some kind of methods such as water quality index model, regression analysis, factor analysis, principal component analysis, cluster analysis, etc. has been developed for easy assessment and interpretation of large amount of water quality data. Among these methods, multivariate statistical analysis has an advantage of giving an idea about possible sources of pollution. In this study, the assessment of water quality of 10 different sampling station in Kirmir Basin which is one of the most significant drinking water resources of Ankara, the capital city of Turkey has been investigated by using multivariate statistical methods (principal component analysis-PCA and factor analysis-FA). 18 water quality parameters were analysed for each sampling station and used for the statistical analysis. The correlations between parameters and sampling stations were evaluated by using statistical techniques in terms of underlying factors. FA/PCA identified water quality parameters in five groups. The results revealed that Kirmir Basin was mainly affected from agricultural activities, urban land uses and livestock activities. The improving of the water quality in this region can be achieved by controlling these activities.																							2017							197	204		10.21698/simi.2017.0025								WOS:000430609800025

In many cases, the spills are not controlled and are not decontaminated properly or even at all. In the Jiu hydrographic basin, there are 225 localities with a population of more than 2,000 peoples. Only 32 of them are equipped with sewer systems and only 2 of them in accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC. As consequence of the pollution with organic and inorganic substances (nutrients) has appeared the eutrophication of the lakes. From the total 12-hydropower lakes with a surface over 50 ha, eight of them are clogged in the proportion of 60%, and 3 of them in a proportion of 80%. In the first part of the paper are analyzed the main punctual and diffuse sources of organic and inorganic pollution, with a decisive factor in the development of the aquatic vegetation. During 2010-2016, a systematic campaign of measurements was done. They were determined the protection zones that need to be tracked, the catchments zone for the human consumption, the zones for protected fish or of those species economically important, the natural protected areas, and the zones vulnerable to nitrate and nitrites. The obtained results are presented for the most affected hydropower lakes from the selected area.

In a community, the state of the environment is influenced by both the quality and the quantity of water resources. The state of the environment is also given by measures to protect water resources in other areas such as energy, transport, agriculture, fisheries and tourism. The supply of drinking water is influenced by water quality. A prudent and rational use of natural resources, including water resources, can help preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment. Water management and use of water resources are very important. The importance is the multiple use of water. This may lead to deterioration in the qualitative parameters of water resources. This raises the issue of implementing rehabilitation and development measures for wastewater management systems. The application of modern and non-polluting technologies can lead to pollution prevention. In many areas, it is used in addition to surface water and groundwater. From this point of view, the article presents an analysis of the quality of surface waters and groundwater. Globalization has favoured technological transfer from developed countries to developing countries. Given the economic development of a country, globalization has made the role of human capital grow. It also had an effect on competitiveness. The article presents the evolution of the population served by the public water supply system, respectively the quantity of drinking water distributed to the consumers. In a globalized economy, increasing competitiveness is based on knowledge.																							2017							330	337		10.21698/simi.2017.0043								WOS:000430609800043

The implementation of heat metering is an important measure for avoiding energy waste and reducing polluted emission. As the core of heat metering, heat meter must meet the measure heat accuracy according to the"Technical specifications for heat metering of district heating system" (Ministry of Construction). Due to the poor water quality in China, impurities are the main factor that influences the measurement precision of heat meter. The sound attenuation caused by the particles on the propagation path will reduce the measurement accuracy of the ultrasonic heat meter. In this paper, the sound attenuation of ultrasonic wave in water containing impurities which leads to the measuring error of ultrasonic heat meter is studied. The researches in this paper have important scientific significance and practical value. (C) 2017 The Authors.

It is mainly for dissolved oxygen soft sensing. Dissolved oxygen is an important dependent factor of water quality and has effect on fish growth. At present, most of the dissolved oxygen sensors are expensive for aquaculture farmers, so they won't use them for real-time detection to perform control and optimal operation. To deal with this problem, a soft-sensor software was designed and developed based on a data-driven model which is proposed by partial least squares (PLS) and neural networks. The software included three parts which were control software, monitoring software and model calculation software. An industrial case study demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed soft sensor software, and it was simple to use, real-time and generic. It was also the foundation for the control and optimization of dissolved oxygen in the aquaculture process.																			978-1-5386-3524-7				2017							5413	5417										WOS:000427816105091

The HF systems are also to serve other life-critical applications, such as water quality control and monitoring, chemical spill backtracking, and marine navigation. However, not all the applications can benefit from this near-real-time HF data; some applications in different domains require forecast values. The examples include search-and-rescue system and hazardous materials spill trajectory prediction. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a predictive model for future current data based on historical HF coastal radar data sets, utilizing association rule mining combined with an object dispersion concept. So, the full potential of HF radar systems can be exploited. The spatial and temporal dimensions are taken into account when designing our predictive system, which consists of two phases: ocean surface current track formulation and spatio-temporal association rule mining. The experiments are performed on a two-year HF radar dataset (2014-2015) using Google Cloud Platform. The resulting forecast current values: velocity and direction are then compared with testing datasets (using 10-fold cross validation) of the actual recorded values and evaluated based on percentage accuracy and RMSE, respectively.																			978-1-5386-2715-0				2017							4293	4300										WOS:000428073704039

Monitoring the reservoirs is important for the decision-making process. In this paper, we present different methodologies for estimating the concentration of Chlorophyll-a, transparency and total suspended solids in reservoir from remote sensing multispectral data, based on artificial neural networks and Leave-One-Out cross-validation. Simulations on different sample station of the study area were performed to determine a relationship between these physico-chemical parameters and the spectral response of the reservoir. Based on the in situ measurements, empirical models are established in order to relate the reservoir reflectance measured by Landsat 7 Enhanced TM+ with the water optical parameters. Four images for each year from 2007 to 2014 are calibrated and atmospherically corrected. Statistical analysis using error estimation is employed, aiming at evaluating the most accurate methodology. Artificial neural networks are trained by hydrological cycle and are shown to be useful in estimating the physico-chemical parameters of water from reflectance of visible and NIR bands of satellite images, with better results for the period with little rain and few clouds in the analyzed region.																	1559-9450		978-1-5386-1211-8				2017							2876	2883										WOS:000428518302160

This paper attempts to design and develop a smart aquaponics system that can synergize fish farming and plant growing. Various sensors, actuators, microcontroller, and microprocessor were employed in the system to monitor and control water quality, light intensity, and fish feed. To ensure healthy growing environment for fish and plant, early warnings in form of email, short message service, and push notification are automatically sent to the user when the sensor detects any abnormal condition. Concurrently, the respective actuator will intervene and rectify the abnormal condition without human interference. Moreover, fish feed is dispensed at the user preset timings of the day. All system activities and live sensor measurements are securely stored in a cloud storage for data analysis. User-friendly web and mobile applications were also created to provide graphical user interfaces between the aquaponics system and the user. Additionally, the user can monitor the aquaponics facilities live from web application through a camera module of the system. As such, the proposed smart aquaponics system has demonstrated to be a self-sustainable, cost-effective, and eco-friendly urban farming that can attract commercial farmers and home gardeners.

The one-dimensional hydrodynamics and water quality numerical model of the cascade pumping station with sudden water pollution accident were established to study the transformation law of pollutant transportation and forecast its impact on water quality. Considering the propagation speed of pollutants and the variation of channel water level, the emergency control mode of pump station and backwater gate under water pollution accident is put forward. On the basis of this, the rules and schemes of pumping station and backwater gates are worked out. The variation range of the pollution group, the variation of the water level of the channel, the discharge quantity and so on under different control schemes are simulated and analyzed. Finally, the optimal pump station and gate scheduling control scheme is selected to effectively control the water pollution accident and ensure the safety of pump stations and channels. The research results can provide technical reference for emergency control of sudden water pollution accident in the east cascade pumping station project.																	2352-538X		978-94-6252-297-8				2017	59						1009	1015										WOS:000429718100193

These compounds come from the irregular or involuntary ejectment of substances such as pesticides, drugs, insecticides and other into the nature. By having a complex structure, the micropollutants have high resistance over the traditional water treatment to human consume. Thus, alternatives methodologies to their degradation have been studied, such as advanced oxidation process (AOPs). The AOPs are based in the formation of hydroxyls radicals (OH-) highly reactive that degrade complexes substances into lesser aggressive products as CO2 and water. Even though many methods to generate hydroxyls radicals from advanced oxidation processes exist, they differentiate on the application and viability. This review shows different methodologies using AOPs and their respective application characteristics, also some works already made in complexes substances treatment, which prove their efficiency.

Saline surface water will not be appropriate for drinking water production, agricultural and industrial use, and therefore, freshwater diverted from rivers is used for flushing the canals and ditches in coastal areas. The effects of climate change, sea level increase and fresh water availability increases the stress on deltaic areas resulting in questioning current fresh water management strategies. In this paper, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is developed and tested for combined salinity and water level control of a polder ditch. The MPC scheme is coupled with Rapid Saline Groundwater Exfiltration Model (RSGEM) developed for fast calculation of exfiltration flux and concentration in a low-lying polder. For the test case presented in this paper, real data from Lissertocht catchment in Netherlands is used for RSGEM to see the performance of the MPC scheme for a real scenario. With open space for further research, results presented on this paper show that MPC of salinity in polders is capable of dealing with saline groundwater exfiltration modeled by RSGEM.

Combined UDN (CUDN) carry both rain and wastewater together, which can overload the UDN and produce combined sewer overflows (CSO) that pollute the environment. Management of CUDN is receiving increasing attention from both researchers and water managers, in order to meet the high quality standards required for water and environment according to EU Water Framework Directive. Due to the complex dynamics of water quality, integrated control of CUDN and WWTP considering both flows and quality of the conveyed wastewater is a difficult problem. In order to design a real-time control (RTC) taking into account hydraulic and quality variables, the use of conceptual quality models is considered as a suitable option. This paper mainly presents a simplified conceptual quality modelling approach to represent the dynamics of suspended solid in sewers of CUDN oriented to real-time control. A sewer simulator implemented in SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) integrated with a lumped conceptual model for total suspended solid (TSS) is used for calibration and validation. A real example of Perinot sewer network is used as a case study. Discussions about RTC implementation in CUDN are also provided in this paper, where Model Predictive Control (MPC) is proposed as the suitable method to control the integrated water and quality models in CUDN as future motivation.

JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												This paper reviews the history and development of biological water quality assessment using macroinvertebrates in Italy. Italy was one of the first European countries to officially adopt a biomonitoring system based on benthic invertebrates, the "Indice Biotico Esteso" (IBE). After the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) 2000/60/EC, this method was replaced by the "Standardisation of River Classifications_Intercalibration Common Metrics" (STAR_ICM) index, which met the new requirements. As this method has been employed for some years, it could be useful to take a provisional stock and to provide some suggestions to ameliorate the current biomonitoring approach, also trying to minimize the break with past practices and better harmonize the history of biomonitoring in Italy. One of the most evident difference between past and current approach is related to the amount of time and effort required in the application of the two methods. STAR_ICM is a scientifically rigorous and modern method, but much more time-consuming and challenging in both field and laboratory efforts. This fact has various disturbing practical repercussions, i.e., the environmental agencies have generally reduced the number of sampling stations routinely monitored during the year. The aim of our work is to propose some operational changes that would help to simplify and expedite the monitoring process. In particular, regarding fieldwork, we focus on the time and effort required for macroinvertebrate collection, while for laboratory activity we suggest a reshaping of the requested taxonomic detail. Moreover, in this way the data provided by the new approach could be compared with the long time series available from the previous application of IBE.																	1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76			1			21	28		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1584								WOS:000429105600004

The Umbria Region lies in Central Italy and it can be split into three hydro-ecoregions belonging to the Mediterranean area. Data on diatom community composition were collected in five different Mediterranean macrotypes (M1-M5) throughout the diatom-based river monitoring network that is composed by 52 sampling stations in 36 watercourses. The main aim of this study was to characterise and to analyse diatom diversity across the different regional river macrotypes. Specifically, we investigated if: i) there were differences in species diversity (species richness and Shannon Index) among macrotypes; ii) there was difference in three water quality indexes (ICMi, IPS, and TI) among sites; and iii) there was a relationship between the observed ICMi, IPS and TI value and the diatom diversity. Two-hundred diatom species and varieties were identified, and the number of species per sampling station ranged from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 38 species. The most frequent and abundant species were Amphora pediculus, Achnanthidium minutissimum, Navicula cryptotenella, Nitzschia dissipata, and each macrotype showed some peculiar species. The ecological status evaluation based on Intercalibration Common Metric Index (ICMi) classified 69% of the water bodies in high or good class. Significant differences in diversity and ICMi value among stream macrotypes were found, with M4 (small and medium mountain) and M5 (small, lowland, temporary) typologies showing the lowest species richness, and with M5 showing the lowest Shannon Index. Conversely, M2 (small and medium lowland) and M5 showed the highest ICMi value. Lastly, significant correlations between Shannon Index and the ICMi, IPS and TI indexes were found.

Case studies on five Italian lakes	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Cyanobacterial blooms occur in many parts of the world as a result of entirely natural causes or human activity. Due to their negative effects on water resources, efforts are made to monitor cyanobacteria dynamics. This study discusses the contribution of remote sensing methods for mapping cyanobacterial blooms in lakes in northern Italy. Semi-empirical approaches were used to flag scum and cyanobacteria and spectral inversion of bio-optical models was adopted to retrieve chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. Landsat-8 OLI data provided us both the spatial distribution of Chl-a concentrations in a small eutrophic lake and the patchy distribution of scum in Lake Como. ENVISAT MERIS time series collected from 2003 to 2011 enabled the identification of dates when cyanobacterial blooms affected water quality in three small meso-eutrophic lakes in the same region. On average, algal blooms occurred in the three lakes for about 5 days a year, typically in late summer and early autumn. A suite of hyperspectral sensors on air-and space-borne platforms was used to map Chl-a concentrations in the productive waters of the Mantua lakes, finding values in the range of 20 to 100 mgm(-3). The present findings were obtained by applying state of the art of methods applied to remote sensing data. Further research will focus on improving the accuracy of cyanobacteria mapping and adapting the algorithms to the new-generation of satellite sensors.																	1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76			1			127	139		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1565								WOS:000429105600013

The server can react as the decision center based on the gathered real-time data. It also has the capability to provide analysis and instruct the related devices accordingly. Modern aquaculture need to involve continuous and real time electronic data acquisition and device. The parameter quite numbers and the update period vary -some daily based and some quite often. By implementing fog server, only selected data will be uploaded to the cloud and related vast number of data remains in the fog server. By doing this, surface level analysis can be done by looking at the cloud data. If there is something wrong condition triggered, user directly goes to fog server to do further analysis and related action can be done immediately.

RAS offers controlled environment which permits product growth rate control and predictable harvesting schedule. Two parameter categories need to be monitored in RAS - direct and indirect. Direct parameter like pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and some other water quality parameter exist as natural elements. The indirect parameter comes from the calcution based on stock capacity that will affect the content of these natural parameters. Extensive data acquisition and analysis will determine the success of RAS. The vast number of data will affect the network traffic especially if the system is cloud-based. Fog computing offers reduction of network traffic by providing a platform to filter and analyse the data generated by the devices. Real time decision and control also will be another advantageous in using fog technology. By using embedded system together with open source technology which offer small size, low cost, light weight, protable, high efficiency and low power consumption this paper will show how the RAS system can be equipped with fog computing in order to form an automatic data acquisition and monitoring system.																			978-1-5386-3132-4				2017							229	234										WOS:000428316600044

ANFIS is one of the useful and powerful neural network approaches for the solution of pattern recognition problems in the last decades. This study involved the evaluation and interpretation of surface water quality data in Tilesdit dam from Algeria. It also allowed us to obtain more advanced information about water quality, and to design a monitoring network for this study area. The ANFIS which is a technique for pattern classification has been widely used in many application areas such as water quality monitoring. This method is a binary classification technique, but in some cases, such as pattern recognition, we need more than two classes. A multi-class problem using ANFIS is a typical example for solving the mentioned problem. In this work, four physicochemical parameters in 4 seasons during the period 2009-2011, located at Tilesdit dam, were selected for this study, such as pH, Temperature, Conductivity and Turbidity to supervise water quality. Up to 95 % of the data could be correctly classified using ANFIS model. Its performance is more competitive when compared with artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the proposed procedure has a great potential in water quality monitoring.																			978-1-5386-1723-6				2017							769	774										WOS:000426978800133

The water classification is based on pollution map derived from surface water map's of four water quality parameters: Turbidity "Turb", Secchi Disk Depth "SDD", Suspended Sediments Concentration "SSC" and Chlorophyll-A "Chl-A" estimated from satellite data. Each water map is processed by an hybridization of fuzzy model and genetic algorithm which is modeled by a set of fuzzy rules extracted from the data through two steps procedure. First, fuzzy rules are generated by unsupervised fuzzy clustering of the input data. In the second step, genetic algorithm is applied to optimize the rules. Our contribution is focused on the use of Pollution Signature Draw (PSD) tool in characterizing water quality of some typical sites. This PSW gives the concentration of each parameter and presents useful information to highlight the pollution degrees of the studied sites. The proposed approach was tested on Algiers bay and has highlighted four pollution levels corresponding to High Pollution (HP), Medium Pollution (MP), Low Pollution (LP) and Clear Water (CW).																			978-1-5386-1723-6				2017							1455	1460										WOS:000426978800259

This is due to floods threaten human life and furthermore affected the economy of the involved country. In Malaysia, floods are usually due to the season monsoon and heavy rains that causing flash floods usually in urban area. Therefore, it is a must for researchers around the world to find a solution in solving this problem. A reliable and practical flood prediction model is in needs to predict flood occurrence ahead of time. Thus, this paper proposed the modelling of flood prediction model using NNARX (Neural Network Autoregressive with Exogenous Input) and hybrid NNARX with EKF (Extended Kalman Filter). The area of study was Klang River. The model was developed using real-time SCADA data that were acquired from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage, Malaysia. The model development was based on flood water level data in meter from 6 Feb. to 21 Nov. 2010. Modelling made used of 120 samples data, model validation using 78 samples data and model testing using 170 samples. The model performance of the NNARX-EKF hybrid model showed much better result than the NNARX model.																			978-1-5090-1184-1				2017							149	152										WOS:000428204800028

The suggested radio frequency for the proposed WSN communication to be deployed in vegetation area is 920MHz. The measured water parameter in this proposed system is pH level by using an analog pH sensor. The ambient temperature is captured during pH measurement by using an analog temperature sensor. All the WSN nodes are deployed in a real environment at the lake in the campus area of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for performance evaluation. Instead of using 2.4GHz ZigBee protocol, the 920MHz Digi Mesh protocol is proposed to be implemented for water quality monitoring in vegetation area due to its ability to surpass the signal attenuation. This novel proposed system prototype was evaluated in a real environment to ensure that the main functionality on pH measuring process is following the design requirements. Several experimental analysis were conducted including the energy analysis and communication read range analysis to study the overall performance of the proposed system.																			978-1-5386-0386-4				2017							18	23										WOS:000428429400004

Polluted water became a major reason behind several community diseases, mainly in undeveloped and developing countries. The public health condition is deteriorating and putting an extra burden of countermeasures to prevent such water borne diseases from spreading. Detecting the drinking water quality can prevent such scenarios prior to the critical stage. Recent research works have achieved reasonable success in predicting the water quality. However, the accuracy levels of already proposed models are to be improved, keeping in mind the sensitivity of the problem domain. In the current work, multi-objective genetic algorithm was employed to train the artificial neural network (NN-MOGA) to improve its performance over its traditional counterparts. The proposed model gradually minimizes two different objective functions; namely the root mean square error (RMSE) and Maximum Error in order to find the optimal weight vector for the artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed model was compared with three other, well established models namely NN GA (ANN trained with Genetic Algorithm),NN-PSO (ANN trained with Particle Swarm Optimization) and SVM in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-Measure, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and Fowlkes-Mallows index (FM index). The simulation results established superior accuracy of NN-MOGA over the other models.																	1935-4576		978-1-5386-0837-1				2017							963	968										WOS:000427453200144

This study assesses the effects of episodic rainfall in a Carboniferous headwater catchment contaminated by historical Pb and Zn mining. Comprehensive hourly water chemistry measurements combined with modelling using PHREEQC, WHAM/Model VII and WHAM-F-TOX were used in this assessment. For the episodic event, we measured flow increases from a baseline of 0.05 to 2.12 m(3) s(-1) at peak flow. Changes in metal concentration were most marked for ephemeral tributary, with Pb increasing from a baseline concentration of 55 mu g L-1 to a peak of 576 mu g L-1. Behaviour for Pb showed great affinity to form organic complexes or hind to colloidal Al and Fe oxides, whereas for Zn and the tributary flowing subsurface a more complex behaviour was observed. For example, the dissolution of secondary metal carbonate minerals (e.g. smithsonite (ZnCO3)) is likely constrained by higher concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate derived from increased bedrock weathering under flow conditions induced by episodic rainfall. The abundance of secondary mineral sources and circumneutral pit present during episodic rainfall are important factors controlling the mobilisation of Pb and Zn. Furthermore, episodic rainfall events could enhance metal toxicity but there are aggravating and mitigating factors that depend on site-specific chemical changes. Overall, this study highlighted the complexity of metal mobility and toxicity during these events.

Several studies have been undertaken to monitor this phenomenon from space by developing ocean color models that can quantify red tide by Chlorophyll a (Chl a) parameter. However, these models showed poor performance over this region due to the effect of water and atmospheric turbidity, despite of the use of atmospheric correction model on the data. This could be explained by the failure of this atmospheric correction model, which is based on assuming zero NIR reflectance (black pixel assumption) to correct the satellite imagery. In this paper, we have evaluated the black pixel assumption model and presented an empirical attempt that improve the estimation of water reflectance and Chl a. We found that the uncertainty of this model is mainly caused by the: (i) aerosol loading, which requires further correction (ii) water turbidity, and (iii) water depth.

Difficulties associated with conducting field work (i.e., hazardous terrain) can affect the ability of resource managers to correctly identify wetland plant species in a timely fashion. Thus, in wetland sites where access can be difficult, differentiation of plant species from aerial imagery can be of use. In this work, we studied laboratory produced hyperspectral data to classify various wetland plants thereby determining optimal multispectral bands that can distinguish these species. We then used an unmanned aerial systems (UAS) mountable 5- band multispectral sensor to classify 11 different wetland plant species to determine effectiveness of the multispectral bands chosen by the preliminary hyperspectral analysis. Classification experiments on the hyperspectral data produced the overall accuracies of 94-97% with 20% training samples. Experiments on the UAS collected multispectral data produced overall accuracy of 75% when considering four classes and 58% overall accuracy when considering 11 classes.																	2153-6996		978-1-5090-4951-6				2017							5924	5927										WOS:000426954605232

The ideal ozone dosage should be a good trade-off between the requirement of disinfection and the restriction of bromate formation. Additionally, the ozone dosing process should cope with the changes of raw water quality and maintain the treated water stable. However, ozone dosing process is very difficult to be controlled because of its complicated nonlinear behaviour. In this paper, model predictive control (MPC) scheme based on support vector machine (SVM) model is designed for the ozone dosing process. With the proposed control scheme, a SVM model is established which could be used for MPC. The control strategy of maintaining a constant ozone exposure is attempted for the requirement of more effective disinfection.

Secondly, a raw water quality model is set up to assess the raw water quality based upon SVM technique. Finally, a feedforward-feedback control scheme is designed for the chemical dosing process control. Thus, the chemical dosage can be adjusted in time to cope with the raw water quality variations and hence, the quality of treated water is stabilized. Experimental results demonstrate the improved effectiveness of the proposed method of raw water quality assessment and the feedforward-feedback control scheme.																	1948-9439		978-1-5090-4657-7				2017							6236	6241										WOS:000427082201099

Therefore quality testing has become an essential part of treatment. Currently in India,monitoring of water quality is done by physically going to water bodies and collecting samples which are then sent to be tested in laboratories. This is time consuming and inefficient method. To automate this process,water quality monitoring sensors,arduino IDE and RF module are placed in water sources. The sensors gather data like pH, temperature and turbidity which is forwarded to arduino IDE for binary to digital conversion. This data is transferred by radio frequency transmitter module to the lab, thus eliminating the need of physically going to the water bodies, ensuring real time on demand data of contamination level and also acts aswarning system for hazardous levels of contaminants.																			978-1-5090-4307-1				2017							503	506										WOS:000427635800097

The output from the master oscillator power amplifier is spliced with a highly nonlinear photonic crystal fiber, generating a supercontinuum with an average power of 250 mW at repetition rate of 1 MHz and spectrum bandwidth spanning from 600 to 1700 nm. The developed supercontinuum system is used to detect the presence of heavy metal contaminants in water by a simple light transmittance method to ensure that the water is free from heavy metal contaminants and safe for consumption. The supercontinuum laser source was shone onto a water sample with a detector placed at another end in order to measure the transmitted supercontinuum light. By measuring the amount of light attenuated at particular wavelength, the concentration of heavy metal contaminants present in the water sample could be determined.																	0078-5466	1899-7015					2017	47	3					445	456		10.5277/oa170310								WOS:000428218900010

We build a simulated multispectral imagery, represent the subsurface reflectance of coral reef environment that receives by Worldview-2 satellite. The evaluation was performed to two different subsurface reflectance: Lee et al.'s and Maritonia et al.'s radiative transfer model. As a result, in the case of simple Maritonia et al.'s reflectance model, it shows that the effect of the water column is removable. However, if the actual just above surface reflectance is as more complex as Lee et al.'s model, then the Lyzenga's water column method could reduce the effect of water attenuation but not removed. In fact, based on the mathematical presentation of Lyzenga's model on simulation reflectance formula the effect of depth and water attenuation are in multiplication function. Thus, even after the correction, the water column attenuation effect stillremain.																	1755-1307						2017	47								012018	10.1088/1755-1315/47/1/012018								WOS:000426771600018

The intent of this permit is to manage urban sources of stormwater runoff to protect overall water quality and improve water quality in impaired waters while acknowledging current and future planned improvements as part of NYC's combined sewer overflow (CSO) long-term control plan (LTCP) process and the impact of non-MS4 sources and planned controls for those sources. Accordingly, NYC is developing a citywide stormwater management program (SWMP) plan that addresses public education and outreach, public involvement/participation, illicit discharges, construction sites, post-construction stormwater management practices and its own (municipal) facilities and operations. In addition, the permit requires an industrial user pollutant source control program as required by the Phase I regulations and a program to control floatable and Settleable trash and debris. The City's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is coordinating program development amongst an interagency working group. This group is comprised of several Departments across the City that will subsequently implement the program, which will require extensive recordkeeping and a united annual reporting effort. NYC's approach to program development includes gathering lessons learned from other Phase I MS4 communities, identifying current practices in NYC that could be enhanced, determining gaps that need to be filled, and finding opportunities for innovation in order to achieve compliance.																			978-0-7844-8120-2				2017							277	284										WOS:000427389600026

Several hardware and software solutions have been designed and implemented to extend the network lifetime and to make the system autonomous and suitable for such an application scenario. The proposed system is composed of different components. The SUNSET Software Defined Communication Stack (SDCS) is used to provide networking capabilities to underwater nodes communicating acoustically through AppliCon SeaModem modems. The Hydrolab Series 5 probes are used to monitor the water quality. Lifetime of underwater nodes is extended through the use of a novel device that allows to harvest energy from underwater water currents via suitable propellers. In addition, novel sleep and wake up mechanisms have been designed and implemented into the underwater nodes to minimize the energy consumption of the system during the idle periods. The performance of the proposed system has been extensively evaluated in field by monitoring the water quality in three fish farming cages located in the Mediterranean Sea, Italy. The system has been connected to the Internet infrastructure allowing the users to easy interact with the underwater system in real-time. Our results confirm that the proposed system is suitable for long term monitoring providing a reliable and robust data collection scheme with an extended network life time.																	0197-7385		978-1-5090-5278-3				2017																		WOS:000426997001034

Therefore, proper water quality and consequentially regular monitoring covering large spatial areas is of interest not only for scientist but also for stakeholders and citizens. So far insufficiently sampled water quality parameters, requiring cost intensive laboratory analysis, can be addressed through measuring inherent optical properties as a proxy. A more sufficient and distributed monitoring can be achieved through the involvement of citizens enabling a "Citizens' observatory for coast and ocean optical monitoring" (CITCLOPS; European Union funded project). Implementing low-cost tools based on mobile-devices for measuring water quality parameters such as fluorescence compounds of colored dissolved organic matter (FDOM) is targeted to encourage and involve citizens. Quinine-sulfate dilution series, a FDOM related water constituent, was investigated with a do-it-yourself (DIY) fluorometer connected to the smartphone while performance was controlled by a benchtop luminescence spectrometer. This approach delivered a high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.99), therefore providing a novel extension of recently developed low-cost tools for monitoring water quality.																	0197-7385		978-1-5090-5278-3				2017																		WOS:000426997001002

In this study, a new trophic index was derived as a function of the ratio of vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) at 531 nm to 490 nm, expressed as K-d(531/490), to obtain the predictive scaling for monitoring the eutrophication status. The trophic index was also expressed in terms of Turbidity (NTU) which employs the Secchi Depth (Z(sd)) as a crucial intermediate parameter to derive the desired product. It was found that the ratio of Kd in the green-blue region of the visible spectra plays a paramount role in predicting the eutrophic conditions. Moreover, turbidity can be leveraged to establish the bio-optical link-pin between chlorophyll concentration and Z(sd) to determine the water quality in terms of trophic state index (TSI). The chlorophyll concentration was fixed as the primary classifier to derive water quality index on the scale of 0 to 100 denoted by non-dimensional reference scale of TSI (referred as TSIref). TSIref. was then, used as standard scale to predict the accuracy of the modelled TSI products obtained by correlation of K-d(531/490) and Z(sd) with chlorophyll concentration, referred as TSIKd and TSIZsd respectively. The performance of the modelled TSI products was tested over a wide variety of water types, ranging from relatively clear to highly turbid waters. The statistical measures calculated between the modelled TSI and the TSIref revealed that the trophic state of coastal and estuarine waters can be estimated with a percent mean relative error of +/- 20% and RMSE similar to 0.015 with R-2 of approximately 0.9. It was found that the newly derived TSI are in good agreement with TSIref.. The spatial contours for modelled and reference TSI were plotted for different seasons (i.e. for the month of August 2013 and January 2014) which further revealed the potential capability of the modelled TSI to closely predict TSIref. Thus, it can be implied that the proposed optical parameters can be adopted as crucial inputs to determine the eutrophication level of relatively turbid and turbid productive waters.																	0197-7385		978-1-5090-5278-3				2017																		WOS:000426997000160

Two of the most prevalent toxins from fresh and brackish water blooms are the cyclic peptide toxins of the microcystin family, formed from cyanobacterial, and the kainic acid analog neurotoxin known as domoic acid. There is therefore a significant need for constant and cost-effective 'on-site' algal-toxin monitoring to respond to constantly increasing demand for safe and 'toxin-free' freshwater, shellfish and fish stocks. Herein, we describe a Lab-On-A-Disc (LOAD) platform which was developed to assess microcystin and domoic acid concentration levels in-situ. Using recombinant antibody technology, the LOAD platform combines immunofluorescence with centrifugally driven microfluidic liquid handling to achieve a next-generation disposable device for high throughput sampling.																	0197-7385		978-1-5090-5278-3				2017																		WOS:000426997002065

So, event detection and its dynamic understanding are crucial to adapt strategy. An algorithm is proposed to identify curves mixture and their dynamics features - initiation, duration, peaks and ends of the event. The approach is fully unsupervised, it requires no tuning parameters and is based on Expectation Maximization process to estimate the most robust mixture according to fixed criteria. A complete framework is proposed to deal with a univariate time series with missing data. The approach is applied on Chlorophyll- a series collected weekly since 1989. Chlorophyll-a is a proxy of the phytoplankton biomass. The results are promising according to the phytoplankton composition knowledge, collected at lower frequency, and allowing to discuss about the annual variability of phytoplankton dynamics.																	0197-7385		978-1-5090-5278-3				2017																		WOS:000426997000035

In the marine environment, the ultimate goal of these platforms is to remotely monitor water quality in real-time with a system capable of detecting numerous water quality parameters like nutrient species and the presence of pollutants/contaminants. These self-sustaining platforms allow for regular automated monitoring of selected parameters at remote locations. An autonomous platform is ideal when monitoring such precarious and problematic entities as harmful algal blooms. This research focuses on the challenges surrounding the sample pre-treatment requirements of an autonomous biosensor for the detection of algal toxins specifically Microcystin-LR, and describes the development of a one-step cell lysis procedure using mechanical force by copper beads in a lysing chamber. We report a sample extraction process from seawater samples that require no prior sample clean-up.																	0197-7385		978-1-5090-5278-3				2017																		WOS:000426997002061

The paper offers a SWOT-based method intended to classify all criteria with regard to internal and external opportunities and threats and to overlay on one another iteratively the results of SWOT analyses in order to generate a unified set of criteria. The criteria, so obtained, are compared with regard to the available databanks and GIS maps, and only those criteria that are supported by the information being sufficient for their evaluation are sorted out. The criteria, so selected, are fit for further multi-criteria optimization of a network of monitoring stations with the use of systems analysis methods; they ensure better accuracy, validity, reliability and information value of such optimization results. The functionability of the method has been demonstrated by the example of designing the network of the surveillance monitoring stations for the surface water quality in line with the objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive.

Water bodies like dams, lakes, ponds play major role in storing and distributing the water in efficient manner. Stored water is used for drinking purpose, agriculture irrigation, electricity generation, etc. Sometimes excess storage of water causes flood during heavy raining season and kills valuable resources including human life. This mandates that the water bodies should be frequently monitored and controlled for the benefits of mankind. Water body monitoring involves the quantity and quality of water stored, input and output water flow through inlet and outlet shutters respectively, condition of the inlet and outlet shutters, condition of the channels carry the water to oceans during flood, etc. Conventional manual monitoring of water bodies consists several disadvantages including high manual overhead, low accuracy and excess time in measurements, high communication delay, high cost, life threatening risks during measurements, etc. The objective of the proposed work is to automatically monitor and control the smart water bodies to sort out the disadvantages of conventional monitoring. The proposed system consists of Remote Monitoring and Control Station (RMCS), Field Control Unit (FCU), Patrol Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (PUAV), different floating sensors like rainfall sensor, water quality sensor, inlet and outlet shutter interfaces, alarms. The proposed system is able to monitor the water body frequently and prepares accurate report that includes quantity of water, rainfall rate, input and output water flow rate, quality of water like existence of any poisonous chemical contents, working condition of the inlet/outlet shutters, etc. This report is quickly sent to the RMCS for further actions. The RMCS can pull the complete report or any particular information on demand. Further the RMCS processes the report to extract the knowledge for further actions like opening/closing shutters, replacing damaged sensors, directing PUAVs to capture the pictures, sending messages to field officials and operators, etc. As a whole, the proposed system significantly reduces the manual overhead, cost, time required to measure/check various factors while increasing the accuracy of measurements and enables the remote monitoring unit to monitor and govern the water body in all aspects.																			978-1-5090-4799-4				2017							116	120		10.1109/ICRTCCM.2017.85								WOS:000427184100021

Water quality refers to the condition of the water, including chemical, biological and physical characteristics with respect to its suitability for a particular purpose. The main purpose of this publication is to set up a virtual system for water analysis in order to measure particular parameters of the water before and after physicochemical treatment. The water is treated with clinoptilolite, which has recently been used for water filtration. It is suitable especially for water treatment due to its ion exchange, absorption properties and high porosity. The main geochemical and technological concerns are how the chemical behavior of natural clinoptilolite affects the quality of different types of water.																	2161-2536		978-1-5386-0582-0				2017																		WOS:000426973000106

The water quality is very important to ensure the fish performance. Thus, the monitoring of the water quality is crucial in order to automatize different process in facilities. In this paper, we present a system to monitor the turbidity in fish farms. First, the sensors and wireless nodes are defined. We use an optical sensor for turbidity monitoring and a Flyport as a node. Then, the topology and operation process are detailed. An extended star is proposed as network topology with a wireless connection between Flyports and the Access Points. Finally, the network performance is tested. The main issue is that in the fish farms there is a harsh environment and it is needed to minimize the number of Access Points employed, but maintaining good network performance. With 5 Flyports sharing one Access Point there is a packet loss rate close to 0.5%. Moreover, the appearance of the windows to visualize the data in the server and the alarms sent are shown. It is possible to select different tank types and tank numbers on the server to see the data. In the alarm message, it is possible to see the type of alarm, the affected tank and the timer of this alarm.																	2163-4033		978-1-5386-1742-7				2017																		WOS:000427351600015

Applying triangular whitenization weight functions to assess water quality of main affluents of Rimac river	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2017 ELECTRONIC CONGRESS (E-CON UNI)					Electronic Congress (E-CON UNI)	NOV 22-24, 2017	Lima, PERU	IEEE Peru Sect, Univ Nacl Ingn, IEEE Student Branch				The Rimac river watershed is characterized by its over exploitation of natural resources, such as mining activities and hydroelectric power, this fact makes necessary to assess water quality on its main affluent rivers. In this work, we apply the center-point triangular whitenization weight functions (CTWF) method, which is based on the grey systems theory that is an approach from artificial intelligence. In the case study, we analyze the following Rimac river affluents: Blanco river, Aruri river, Rimac river, Mayo river, and Santa river. The monitoring data on each affluent were obtained from Water National Authority of Peru (ANA). The CTWF method was applied using parameters of water quality such as O2, DBO, DQO, SS, NH3, and NO3. Then, the results were ranked using the Prati scale. Consequently, the results showed that all affluents classified as uncontaminated within the Prati scale, which means that these should be treated by conventional methods to be purified. However, the affluent Blanco river was more vulnerable to be contaminated. Finally, the results of this study could be used by local authorities or central government to make the best decision on the Rimac river watershed management.																			978-1-5386-2278-0				2017																		WOS:000427349000008

In this context, the grey clustering method, which is based on grey systems theory, offers an interesting alternative to assess water quality using artificial intelligence criteria. In this study, we assess water quality from Santa river watershed according to parameters stablish by MINAM-Peru (DS No 015-2015). In addition, we analyze monitoring data from water national authority from Peru (ANA), which was collected, in the study area, in 2013. Twenty-one monitoring points from Santa river watershed were analyzed. The results showed that 47.6% of the monitoring points presented good water quality to consumption of the population, which indicated that could be purified by applying disinfection; 33.3% of the monitoring points presented moderate water quality to consumption of the population, which indicated that could be purified by applying conventional treatment; and 19.1% of the monitoring points presented low water quality to consumption of the population, which indicated that could be purified by applying special treatment. The grey clustering method showed interesting results and could be applied to others studies on water quality or environmental quality in general.																			978-1-5386-2278-0				2017																		WOS:000427349000010

Multi-Level Multi-Task Learning for Modeling Cross-Scale Interactions in Nested Geospatial Data	2017 17TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING (ICDM)	IEEE International Conference on Data Mining				17th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDMW)	NOV 18-21, 2017	New Orleans, LA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Cisco Syst, Citigroup Inc, Natl Sci Fdn				Predictive modeling of nested geospatial data is a challenging problem as the models must take into account potential interactions among variables defined at different spatial scales. These cross-scale interactions, as they are commonly known, are particularly important to understand relationships among ecological properties at macroscales. In this paper, we present a novel, multi-level multi-task learning framework for modeling nested geospatial data in the lake ecology domain. Specifically, we consider region-specific models to predict lake water quality from multi-scaled factors. Our framework enables distinct models to be developed for each region using both its local and regional information. The framework also allows information to be shared among the region-specific models through their common set of latent factors. Such information sharing helps to create more robust models especially for regions with limited or no training data. In addition, the framework can automatically determine cross-scale interactions between the regional variables and the local variables that are nested within them. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms all the baseline methods in at least 64% of the regions for 3 out of 4 lake water quality datasets evaluated in this study. Furthermore, the latent factors can be clustered to obtain a new set of regions that is more aligned with the response variables than the original regions that were defined a priori from the ecology domain.																	1550-4786		978-1-5386-3835-4				2017							1153	1158		10.1109/ICDM.2017.154								WOS:000427187400146

However, different signal types of sensors in general are limited by these devices. Gradual improvement of IoT has lead to a revolution in the wireless communication; this scenario facilitates various applications from environmental monitoring to industrial management. Wired networks are mostly used to transfer data by connecting sensor. It is advantageous as it provides reliable communication system for instruments and controls. But connecting the sensors with a wired network will be costly hence low cost wireless technologies are much needed to cut down the cost. A novel approach is proposed in this paper to design smart sensor interface for water quality monitoring in IoT environment. Different sensors are available for water quality monitoring which are used to check the quality on following parameters i.e. pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, turbidity and temperature etc. IoT provide interface to monitor and operate remotely from anywhere and anytime.

To verify and monitor the water quality in a large area such as lake, river, and aquaculture requires an online water monitoring (OWM) system. The OWM system usually consists of some quantitative measurements such as temperature, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, Turbidity, Conductivity, TDS, Salinity, etc. Most of the used OWM system use discontinue data sampling that the sampling rate is longer than one minute and one hour for local measurement and online measurement, respectively. There is no historical measurement record to trace the initial problem when the water quality getting worse. In this paper, the proposed OWM system uses continue data sampling with higher sampling rate on local main station system. This system is also integrated with WIFI. Therefore, the measurement by the local main station can be done in real-time. In this system, the old data measurement can be analyzed by using historical view feature. The experimental result verifies that the system can monitor water quality in real-time and historically both on the local and online system.																			978-1-5386-0510-3				2017							34	+										WOS:000427156700007

This paper illustrates a microcontroller based water quality monitoring system with high degree of accuracy and susceptible to determine several parameters of water such as temperature, turbidity and potential of hydrogen (pH). Detection of those parameters of water is very important and indispensable in order to lead healthy life as different source of water are being tainted due to excess population. Various analytical schemes are subsist for ascertainment of the quality of water where several are time-consuming and few are used for industrial applications that are not applicable for simple water quality monitoring system. Consequently, it is needless to model a simple device that track out various parameters of water unerringly. In this project based research work, a simple microcontroller is used as central processing unit (CPU) and multiple sensors that detect various parameters and send the data to microcontroller and finally the LCD gives the results.																	2374-023X		978-1-5386-2175-2				2017							860	863										WOS:000426969400193

Accumulation of organic material in the pond will increase population of bacteria. The process of decomposition of organic materials by aerobic bacteria will cause a decrease in the oxygen content in water. Therefore, the conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrate is highly useful and can be successfully accomplished through the implementation of biofloc technology and maximizing the contribution of natural feed in intensifying aquaculture technology. This study aims to gain information on nutrient composition of biofloc caused by the use of different commercial probiotics through the formation of biofloc, including probiotic A, probiotic B and without probiotic. Parameters monitored in this research include biofloc nutrition (protein and fat) and other supporting parameters such as plakton diversity index, plankton domination index, C:N ratio, N:P ratio, pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen. Data analysis was carried out by Anova (analysis of variance) and descriptive. This research demonstrated that different probiotics significantly affected the protein and fat content of biofloc. Probiotics containing different bacterium in wide variety can enrich biofloc nutrient.																	2352-5398		978-94-6252-461-3				2017	98						195	198										WOS:000426718600042

Anisakidae as a Bioindicator Candidate in Response to Environmental Damage	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL OF UNIVERSITAS AIRLANGGA: IMPLEMENTATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENT TO MEET SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (ICPSUAS 2017)	Advances in Social Science Education and Humanities Research				1st International Conference of Postgraduate-School-of-Universitas-Airlangga (ICPSUAS) - Implementation of Climate Change Agreement to Meet Sustainable Development Goals	AUG 01-02, 2017	Univ Airlangga, Postgraduate Sch, Surabaya, INDONESIA		Univ Airlangga, Postgraduate Sch			The increase of environmental damage in coastal and marine areas can affect the presence of marine ecosystems and fishery products such as reducing the type of fish, and causing the decline of fish obtained from the sea. This will certainly affect the socio-economy in coastal areas, especially for groups of fishermen and traders. To prevent the occurrence of environmental damage in coastal and marine areas, it is necessary to develop an early warning system. Anisakidae has the potential as an early warning system as it works as a bioindicator. This research was expost facto research with purposive sampling from two different areas in East Java, between January and March 2016. Thirty samples of groupers from coastal Probolinggo were the areas exposed to anthropogenic effects and thirty samples from coastal Tuban were selected as areas far from anthropogenic effects. The results showed that Anisakidae in groupers between the sample from coastal Probolinggo and coastal Tuban had different levels of parasitological indexes. The prevalence from coastal Probolinggo was only 10%, with the infestation rate being very low 2. It was different with the sample from coastal Tuban, with the prevalence being 80% and infestation rate 5.9%. The data was analysed with a Mann Whitney test which showed that there was a significant difference in Anisakidae infestation in groupers between the two areas. This research showed that areas exposed to anthropoghenic effects have a low infestation rate of Anisakidae if compared with areas far from anthropogenic effects. Knowing the infestation rate of Anisakidae, people and the government can measure and overcome environmental damage in coastal and marine areas.																	2352-5398		978-94-6252-461-3				2017	98						374	376										WOS:000426718600082

The objective of this study was to investigate the internal correlation among water parameters, to analyze main water contamination and to identify the most polluted section along a seagoing river. Five water quality parameters (WT, EC, NH4+-N, NO3-N, NO2--N) were chosen to assess the water quality using multivariate statistical methods (Spearman's correlation, PCA, CA). PCA results showed 2 PCs can explain 78% of the total variation. The main water contamination was related to anthropogenic activities (domestic wastewater, industrial effluents and livestock operations) as well as natural condition (seawater intrusion). CA results gave 3 clusters by analyzing similarities of each section, indicating that the middle-downstream was the most polluted and the last section was mainly influenced by seawater intrusion.																	2352-5401		978-94-6252-453-8				2017	120						1451	1456										WOS:000426813400263

Effects of pulsed voltage rise rate on pulsed streamer discharge	2017 IEEE 21ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PULSED POWER (PPC)					21st IEEE International Conference on Pulsed Power (PPC)	JUN 18-22, 2017	Brighton, ENGLAND	IEEE				Pulsed streamer discharge plasma, a type of non-thermal plasma, is known to generate various chemically active species and as such is applied to many fields such as water quality improvement and ozone generation. However, detailed physical properties of streamer discharge remain unclear. Therefore, basic research on pulsed streamer discharge is necessary. Previous studies have shown that voltage rise rates greatly influence streamer discharge, but few reports have focused on this. While peak voltage tends to vary under the influence of voltage rise rates, research to date has generally utilized an unfixed peak voltage. This study investigates discharge propagation phenomena at a fixed peak voltage under various voltage rise rates using an ICCD camera. In the experiment, a pulsed voltage with a duration of 100 ns was created using Blumlein lines and applied to a needle-hemisphere electrode. The applied peak voltage was about 71 kV with the electrode gap set at 24 mm as measured from the top of the needle to hemisphere surface. A decrease in the number of winding coils from 5 to 0 resulted in a pulsed voltage rise rate increased from 0.61 to 1.21 kV/ns. Important results are as follows. (1) The ending time of streamer head propagation was delayed, and the voltage at that time increased from 53.1 to 61.0 kV. (2) Streamer head velocity on average increased from 0.45 to 0.58 mm/ns. (3) Brightness value increase at the end of streamer head propagation. Our experimental results elucidate the relationship of pulsed voltage rise rate to various streamer discharge parameters. We conclude that pulsed voltage rise rate has a great influence on the physical characteristics of streamer discharge.																			978-1-5090-5748-1				2017																		WOS:000426980300147

Chemistry of Stormwater Runoff from a Large Green Roof in Syracuse, NY	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE 2017: METHODOLOGY					International Conference on Sustainable Infrastructure	OCT 26-28, 2017	New York, NY	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Comm Sustainabil				A green roof can provide a wide variety of ecological benefits in urban environments such as reducing the amount of stormwater runoff. In addition, the growth medium may filter contaminated rainwater, providing runoff that is cleaner than the incoming rain. However, the growth medium might contribute other contaminants, thereby increasing the concentration relative to the rainwater. Thus, field experiments are needed to determine which contaminants are filtered out and which are leached from the growth medium during large rainstorms. It is also possible that some contaminants deposited from the atmosphere are picked up by the runoff. To investigate these issues, we determined the chemistry of stormwater runoff from two adjacent rooftops: a 1.5 acre extensive green roof on the Onondaga County Convention Center and a similarly sized gray roof on the war memorial sports arena, both located in downtown Syracuse, New York. We assumed that the same atmospheric contaminants depositing on the green roof are also depositing on the gray roof. This allowed us to compare concentrations of chemical species in the rain, green roof runoff, and gray roof runoff to determine which contaminants are contributed by the rain, by leaching from the growth medium, and by atmospheric deposition. Results from storms sampled in 2014, 2015, and 2016 suggest that sulfate and copper are leached from the growth medium while lead is filtered. Additional experiments will be conducted to better understand the leaching potential of the green roof.																			978-0-7844-8119-6				2017							45	52										WOS:000426799600005

Treatment options using proprietary BMP solutions to address local compliance initiatives are often way too expensive, a challenge to find the right footprint, and can be a deterrent to development of an area in desperate need of revitalization. Watershed management plans (WMPs) are written to address this issue at a regional level, bringing multiple stakeholders together for mutually beneficial solutions. Regional storm water capture and reuse/infiltration projects are designed to treat larger areas where development is at the ultimate stage, and finding large enough footprints for installation of treatment BMPs are a challenge. An example of this type of project is a design/build project located in the City of Long Beach, managed by the City of Signal Hill called Los Cerritos Creek (LCC) Sub-Basin 4 Regional BMP and Capture Facility.																			978-0-7844-8119-6				2017							315	321										WOS:000426799600028

In this paper, the constant temperature and pressure water supply system based on LADRC is established respectively for temperature and pressure. Compared with traditional PID control, the simulation results show that LADRC control is faster than the PID control response, with steady-state precision, better anti-interference ability. At the same time, the stability of second order linear expansion state observer (LESO) in the first order LADRC is proved by the Lyapunov stability method. The application of LADRC control in reverse osmosis control system can realize the real-time tracking of input to output, and make the system in steady state control better, and when the system is in steady state, the consumption of equipment is lowest, thus reducing system energy consumption, which has important practical value and research significance.																	2352-538X		978-94-6252-361-6				2017	74						222	228										WOS:000426673200037

Founded in the early 1930's it is now home of more than 160000 inhabitants, and it is characterized by low water quality, poor housing, lack of drainage and sanitation systems, and of green and public spaces. This paper presents the preliminary results of a joint research project between the Politecnico di Milano and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) for the improvement of the urban quality, health, livability and inclusiveness of Rocinha, that moves from an upgrading process of the environmental performance of the existing built environment. The project, in the frame the social responsibility program of Politecnico di Milano (Polisocial), is based on a multidisciplinary and integrated design methodology named IMM (Integrated Modification Methodology). The research aims to demonstrate that in a planet where the informal settlements are exponentially growing, strategies to improve the quality of life of their inhabitants are possible, and preliminary results, mostly achieved in the diagnostic phase of the process, are presented. Rocinha is seen as a complex system that has been investigated in its own morphological structure and the related environmental performance, focusing on: climate and energy, ecosystem services, waste management and their relation with urban morphology. This phase opens up to the next phases, specifically the intervention and retrofitting, that intend to select intervention areas and priorities and then to objectively size the implementation in Rocinha.

They impact air and water quality, alter resource consumption patterns, and pose unique challenges for the environment, energy, and infrastructure. Addressing these challenges requires understanding the city as the nexus of environmental context, built infrastructure, and human communities, which can only be achieved by close collaboration among educated professionals from a wide range of related domains. This paper describes the experiences of a university course that was developed to prepare students from diverse academic backgrounds to understand the nature of and learn the required skills to address sustainable urbanization challenges. The course, which was partially online enabled by the latest information and communications technology (ICT), was jointly offered by three academic departments at Tsinghua University and Stanford University. The course used Beijing and the Bay Area as two case studies, which offered students a unique cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary educational experience. Within the context of this course, students formed multinational teams, collaborated remotely, and explored sustainability topics such as air quality, urban mobility and transport, and cultural heritage buildings. The teams developed creative solutions to their chosen topics, presented them in the Human Cities Expo at Stanford University, and tested their validity in the case cities in consultation with local experts, scholars, and non-government organizations community partners. Lessons learned during this teaching experience, in terms of the role of ICT infrastructure in supporting online teaching, the management of cross-disciplinary in-class collaboration, and the value of conducting cross-cultural comparative studies, are discussed at the end of the paper.

However, the online monitoring equipment is very expensive, which hampereds the scope and effect of monitoring. Thus, soft measurement technology in industrial sewage which using neural networks and data driven method can be applied to monitor parameters and reduce the cost. Here, a water quality analysis system is designed, which can measure the conventional five parameters directly, and also can infer the COD parameter by means of historical data and neural networks learning strategy. Hardware structure of monitoring device is based on Exynos4412 CPU chip, and five sensors such as PH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, conductivity, turbidity are connected with CPU via communication bus of RS485. By recording and learning the data of five parameters using BP neural networks, device can construct a model of the five parameters with COD parameter online. As a result, conventional parameters are measured directly and COD value is calculated predictively. It is noted that the measurement software is designed and run on embedded Android platform, and all the six values are showed on a LCD screen in this device. At last, by sampling sewage in printing mill and verified by analysis instrument in laboratory, it is proved that this device is sensitive to water quality and is high efficiency. Therefore, it is much economic and practical to be applied in environmental monitoring field.																			978-1-5386-2901-7				2017							959	964										WOS:000425862800181

Based on 2015 data, with total imperviousness more than 60% in aquatic system catchment area of Universitas Indonesia (UI) Campus, the aquatic system quality is in poor condition. Best Management Practices (BMPs) as the practical form of Low Impact Development (LID) concept are proposed to be implemented in the catchment area. The performance of BMPs implementation can be quantitatively assessed using System for Urban Stormwater Treatment and Analysis Integration (SUSTAIN) model developed by US Environmental Protection Agency. As a decision support system, SUSTAIN model as the extension of ArcGIS can be applied for placement of BMPs at strategic locations in urban watersheds. This study aims to find the suitable location of BMPs placement in nine sub-catchments of UI Campus aquatic system catchment area. The suitability criteria for placing structural BMPs comprise nine database layers including slope, soil type, urban land use, percent impervious, land ownership, roads, water table depth, stream location, and drainage area. The study shows that there are ten types of BMPs that suitable to be implemented in UI campus catchment area, while three types of BMPs are not suitable. Based on the validation analysis, the applicable result from SUSTAIN model is 18 of 20, or has 90 percent of trust.																	2261-236X						2017	138								UNSP 06007	10.1051/matecconf/201713806007								WOS:000426810700090
