In this study, aiming to evaluate potential impacts of metallic mining activities on the quality of a transboundary river (Selenge) in central northern Mongolia, we performed hydrochemical investigations of rivers (Tuul, Khangal, Orkhon, Haraa, and Selenge). Hydrochemical analysis of river waters indicates that, while major dissolved ions originate from natural weathering (especially, dissolution of carbonate minerals) within watersheds, they are also influenced by mining activities. The water quality problem arising from very high turbidity is one of the major environmental concerns and is caused by suspended particles (mainly, sediment and soil particles) from diverse erosion processes, including erosion of river banks along the meandering river system, erosion of soils owing to overgrazing by livestock, and erosion by human activities, such as mining and agriculture. In particular, after passing through the Zaamar gold mining area, due to the disturbance of sediments and soils by placer gold mining, the Tuul River water becomes very turbid (up to 742 Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU)). The Zaamar area is also the contamination source of the Tuul and Orkhon rivers by Al, Fe, and Mn, especially during the mining season. The hydrochemistry of the Khangal River is influenced by heavy metal (especially, Mn, Al, Cd, and As)-loaded mine drainage that originates from a huge tailing dam of the Erdenet porphyry Cu-Mo mine, as evidenced by delta S-34 values of dissolved sulfate (0.2 to 3.8 aEuro degrees). These two contaminated rivers (Tuul and Khangal) merge into the Orkhon River that flows to the Selenge River near the boundary between Mongolia and Russia and then eventually flows into Lake Baikal. Because water quality problems due to mining can be critical, mining activities in central northern Mongolia should be carefully managed to minimize the transboundary movement of aquatic contaminants (in particular, turbidity, dissolved organic carbon, Fe and Al) from mining activities.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	2					2019	2034		10.1007/s11356-016-7895-3								WOS:000394254000085	27807785					
J	Liu, ZH; Yin, H; Dang, Z				Liu, Ze-hua; Yin, Hua; Dang, Zhi			Do estrogenic compounds in drinking water migrating from plastic pipe distribution system pose adverse effects to human? An analysis of scientific literature	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												With the widespread application of plastic pipes in drinking water distribution system, the effects of various leachable organic chemicals have been investigated and their occurrence in drinking water supplies is monitored. Most studies focus on the odor problems these substances may cause. This study investigates the potential endocrine disrupting effects of the migrating compound 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-d-t-BP). The summarized results show that the migration of 2,4-d-t-BP from plastic pipes could result in chronic exposure and the migration levels varied greatly among different plastic pipe materials and manufacturing brands. Based on estrogen equivalent (EEQ), the migrating levels of the leachable compound 2,4-d-t-BP in most plastic pipes were relative low. However, the EEQ levels in drinking water migrating from four out of 15 pipes may pose significant adverse effects. With the increasingly strict requirements on regulation of drinking water quality, these results indicate that some drinking water transported with plastic pipes may not be safe for human consumption due to the occurrence of 2,4-d-t-BP. Moreover, 2,4-d-t-BP is not the only plastic pipe-migrating estrogenic compound, other compounds such as 2-tert-butylphenol (2-t-BP), 4-tert-butylphenol (4-t-BP), and others may also be leachable from plastic pipes.				zehua, liu/C-5187-2009	zehua, liu/0000-0003-3293-5356												0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	2					2126	2134		10.1007/s11356-016-8032-z								WOS:000394254000094	27830418

Structural and morphological characterization was performed by X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and FESEM imaging. The Cu-doped oxide was found to possess lattice strain which resulted in the induction of surface defects. The prepared materials were used as sensing materials for toxic Cr(VI) ions in aqueous medium. A novel sensing technique was proposed based on adsorption, which was found to be more effective in terms of reproducibility and reusability of the sensor than the conventional electrochemical sensing technique. The sensing mechanism was explained based on the phenomenon of adsorption. This makes the efficiency of the sensor surface-dependent rather than chemical reactivity-dependent, thereby making it a non-destructive sensing technique. The Cu-doped NiO nanostructure (10% Cu doping) was found to show maximum sensitivity (252.62 at 1 ppm) and high selectivity, together with a low response time (similar to 2 s), towards Cr(VI) ions relative to Cd(II), As(V) and Pb(II) ions. This was due to its enhanced surface properties compared with its un-doped variants. The effect of Cu doping on the nanostructure morphology and consequently on sensor efficiency was also studied. The limit of detection was found to be 1 ppm (1 mg L-1) of Cr(VI) ions in aqueous solution. This material, along with the technique proposed, can thus be advantageous for the cost-efficient monitoring of water quality and drinking water standards.

However, WTPs face numerous potential obstacles, including changes in source water quality and quantity, financial burdens related to operations and upgrades, and stringent water quality regulations. Moreover, these challenges may be exacerbated by climate change in the form of long-term climatic perturbations and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. To help WTPs overcome these issues, decision support systems (DSSs), which are used to aid and enhance the quality and consistency of decision-making, have been developed. This paper reviews the scientific literature on the development and application of DSSs for water treatment, including physically-based models, statistical models, and artificial intelligence techniques, and suggests future directions in the field. We first set the context of how water quality is impacted by climate change and extreme weather events. We then provide a comprehensive review of DSSs and conclude by offering a series of recommendations for future DSS efforts for WTPs, suggesting that these tools should (1) more accurately reflect the practical needs of WTPs, (2) represent the tradeoffs between the multiple competing objectives inherent to water treatment, (3) explicitly handle uncertainty to better inform decision makers, (4) incorporate nonstationarity, especially with regard to extreme weather events and climate change for long-term planning, and (5) use standardized terminology to accelerate the dissemination of knowledge in the field.

Unlike static infrastructure, which cannot adapt its operation to individual storms or changing land uses, "smart" stormwater systems will use system-level coordination to maximize watershed pollutant removal and treatment. We illustrate that this vision is not limited by technology, which has matured to the point at which it can be ubiquitously deployed. Rather, the challenge is much more fundamental and rooted in a system-level understanding of environmental science. Once distributed stormwater systems become highly instrumented and controlled, how should they be operated to achieve desired watershed outcomes? The answer to this question demands the development of a theoretical framework for smart stormwater systems. In this paper, we lay out the requirements for such a theory. Acknowledging that the adoption of these systems may still be years away, we also present a modeling framework to allow for the simulation of controlled stormwater systems before they become commonplace. We apply this control framework to two simulated case studies in which stormwater sites are controlled to reduce nitrate loads to downstream water bodies.

J	Wang, J; Chua, LHC; Shanahan, P				Wang, Jia; Chua, Lloyd H. C.; Shanahan, Peter			Evaluation of pollutant removal efficiency of a bioretention basin and implications for stormwater management in tropical cities	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Non-point source pollution is a prevalent problem throughout the world. Bioretention basins have been deployed worldwide to treat stormwater runoff and alleviate eutrophication in downstream water resources. However, basin performance in the tropics is poorly understood. Given the distinctly different rainfall-runoff characteristics of tropical climates, whether basins that are built according to temperate design guidelines are effective is questionable. There have been no field studies based on continuous, high-resolution, long-term monitoring in the tropics. In this study, 96 storms were monitored in the first bio-retention basin in Singapore. Of these, flow measurements were made during 80 events and samples were collected and analyzed for 15 water quality parameters (including nitrogen and phosphorus species, total suspended solids, and chemical oxygen demand) during six events. The mean removal rates were 25%, 46%, and 53% for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids respectively. Results show that a lack of storage capacity and resulting high overflow reduce pollutant removal efficiency for high-rainfall-depth events. The transition from efficient to non-efficient removal occurs at a rainfall depth between 10 and 30 mm. Low EMC (event mean concentration) and weak first flush as a result of frequent and intense rainfall in the tropics also contribute to low removal rate. The results suggest a need to revise bioretention basin design guidelines for the tropics to be based on WQV or WQD (water quality volume or depth) instead of ARI (average recurrence interval). A larger basin volume (WQD between 10 to 30 mm) is recommended.					/0000-0001-8667-8186												2053-1400	2053-1419				JAN 1	2017	3	1					78	91		10.1039/c6ew00285d								WOS:000394270400006

Membrane fouling profiles were quantified by water flux decline and permeate conductivity. Mechanisms of the synergistic effect of combined fouling were revealed by light scattering measurements and infrared spectra of foulant-foulant interaction and foulant- membrane interaction. Membrane fouling morphology and element mapping provided further details of transport of colloidal silica particles and elucidated the mechanisms for silica-induced pore wetting. Specially, gelation of alginate formed an alginate layer on membrane surface and prevented penetration of silica particles into the membrane matrix, which was confirmed by silicon element mapping as well as infrared spectra. Adsorption of BSA protein by colloidal silica aggregates led to a sharp water flux decline and a partial pore wetting. Humic acid, forming a coil structure in high salinity, exhibited limited interaction with colloidal silica that penetrated into the membrane matrix and wetted membrane pores, thereby compromising the product water quality. Results showed that the combined organic fouling with colloidal silica particle not only deteriorated water production, but also compromised product quality by partial membrane wetting.

J	Carbone, M; Penna, N; Piro, P				Carbone, Marco; Penna, Nadia; Piro, Patrizia			Comparison of mathematical methods for the evaluation of wastewater settleability by settling column tests	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												Particulate matter (PM), which may serve as a vector of pollutants in both natural and human-impacted waters, is of primary interest in water quality studies, particularly for those conducted in urban areas. Separating solids from the liquid phase is one of the main goals of water treatment practices. Above all, the settling process is the most commonly used for this purpose. Generally, settling column tests are used in the laboratory to assess the total PM removal. Besides the traditional graphical method used for the interpretation of the laboratory results, other mathematical methods were developed - with the goal of simplifying the settling efficiency evaluation procedure and making it less subjective. To make a contribution in that direction, a study based on the comparison of four different mathematical methods for estimating PM removal efficiencies was conducted. The analysis was carried out on 15 samples of wastewater and showed that only two methods gave satisfactory results, and only one of them was physically based. Consequently, it is recommended to assess the overall PM removal, Etot, by a monoparametric exponential function, depending on the settling time (t) and on the first-order decay coefficient (k).

In this paper, the nitrification/denitrification reactor allowed a reduction in organic load, but offered a weak efficiency in nitrate reduction. However, the additions of the activated sludge in the reactor improve this efficiency. A decrease of NO3--N values from 13.3 to 8 mg/l was noted. Nevertheless, sludge inoculation led to a net increase of the number of pathogenic bacteria. For this reason, a UV-C pilot reactor was installed at the exit of the biological nitrificationdenitrification device. Thus, a fluence of 50 mJ.cm(-2) was sufficient to achieve values of 20 MPN/100 ml for fecal coliform and 6 MPN/100 ml for fecal streptococci, conforms to Tunisian Standards of Rejection. On the other hand, the DGGE approach has allowed a direct assessment of the bacterial community changes upon the treated wastewater.																	0959-3330	1479-487X					2017	38	6					762	771		10.1080/09593330.2016.1230651								WOS:000396790600013	27628535

Influence of Forest Harvest on Nitrate Concentration in Temperate Streams-A Meta-Analysis	FORESTS												Forest harvest alters natural nutrient cycles, which is reflected in stream water run-off from harvested catchments. Nitrate is an essential nutrient for plant growth, but increased concentrations in rivers, lakes, and oceans have contributed to eutrophication and anoxic conditions. Based on a literature review, we assessed the impact of three different harvest methods-clearcut, patchcut, and selective harvest-on nitrate concentrations in temperate forest streams. In a meta-analysis, the influence of harvest methods and additional environmental variables was analysed. Nitrate concentrations are significantly influenced by harvest methods, forest composition, site altitude, and time passed after the harvesting. The remaining unexplained between-site variability is small compared to the between-site variability explained by the model, indicating the model's validity. The effect of forest harvest is most pronounced in coniferous and deciduous forests, where clearcuts and patchcuts result in high nitrate run-off three to five years after harvest. Mixed forest plots can compensate for clearcut and patchcut, and do not show a significantly increased nitrate concentration after harvest. Selective harvest at low intensities succeeded in maintaining nitrate levels similar to control or pre-harvest levels in coniferous and mixed forests, and showed a positive but not significant trend in deciduous forests. Coniferous and deciduous monocultures clearly face the problem that nitrate wash-out cannot be minimized by reducing clearcut to patchcut harvest, whereas mixed forests are more suitable to diminish nitrate wash-out in both clearcut and patchcut.

Impedimetric biosensing is advantageous because it is a highly sensitive, label-free, real-time method for the detection of biological species. An impedimetric biosensor measures the change in impedance caused by specific capture of a target on the sensor surface. Each biosensor consists of a pair of photo paper-based inkjet printed electrodes. An impedance analyser was used to measure the impedance at frequencies ranging from 1 kHz to 1 MHz at 1V. The parameters that were investigated to achieve enhanced sensor performance were buffer type, antibody attachment method, measurement frequency, electrode layout, and conductive material. A 0.04M PBS (phosphate buffered saline) solution achieves better results compared to a less conductive 0.04M PB (potassium phosphate dibasic) solution. The direct adsorption of anti- E. coli antibodies onto the sensor surface yielded better results than attaching the sensor to a lateral flow test. The resistive component had a greater impact on the detected impedance, therefore an optimal frequency of 1 MHz was identified. Geometrical electrode designs that maximise the resistive change between the electrodes were utilised. Both lower cost silver and bio-compatible gold ink were validated as electrode materials. The impedance change generated by the selective capture of E. coli K-12, ranging in concentration from 103 to 107 colony forming units per millilitre (cfu/ml), showed a detection limit of 105 cfu/ml.

High sensitivity and rapid test time is essential and there is a great need for these tests to be implemented on-site without the use of a laboratory infrastructure. In the light of these requirements, a mobile micro-incubator was designed, manufactured and characterised. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) receptacle has been designed to house the 1-5 ml cell culture sample(2). A nano-silver printed electronics micro-heater has been designed to incubate the bacterial sample, with an array of temperature sensors implemented to accurately measure the sample temperature at various locations in the cell culture well. The micro-incubator limits the incubation temperature range to 37 +/- 3 degrees C in order to ensure near optimal growth of the bacteria at all times(3). The incubation time is adjustable between 30 minutes and 9 hours with a maximum rise time of 15 minutes to reach the set-point temperature. The surface area of the printed nano silver heating element is 500 mm(2). Electrical and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations are included in order to give insight on micro-incubator temperature control.

Therefore, plastic packages and plastic wastes being formed later on, no matter how meticulously they are collected, may lead to adverse effects on marine ecosystems in terms of their content. In coastal areas where macro plastics are detected, the entrance of materials into the marine ecosystem is very easy as a result of climatic and abiotic factors. The macro plastics that reach seas and oceans disintegrate in time and get a microplastic size and thus pose a threat for the marine organisms. This study aims to determine the possible entrance ways of macro and micro plastics, which were detected after they had been dimensioned in coastal area, into the marine ecosystem and their possible effects on living ecosystem on Istanbul coastal area. The studies, which have newly been started on microplastics, reveal the need for making a policy by predicting the conditions of globalized world apart from the country conditions. The role of researchers in the monitoring of plastic pollution will increase in the coming years, and the truly "big" data they document must become part of the science of plastic pollution. For the present, it is real that a few scientists around the Turkey are engaged in attempting to understand the consequences seas.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1					208	215										WOS:000395724000030

Standard methods of analysis have been used to determine total alkalinity (TA), total hardness (TH), total dissolved solids (TDS), carbon dioxide, major positive ions concentrations, and major negative ions concentrations. The potential of scale formation and corrosivity of all water samples were also determined using Langelier Saturation Index (LSI), Ryznar Stability Index (RSI), Puckorius Scaling Index (PSI), Aggressive Index (AI), Calcium Carbonate Precipitation Potential Index (CCPP), and Larson-Skold Index (L&Skl). All measured parameters were found to be within the range of permissible values of both Jordanian standards and WHO guidelines for drinking water. Based on the calculated indices, it has been found that about 31 % of studied water samples suffered from corrosion, while 69% suffered from scale formation. L&Skl index calculations showed that chloride and sulphate ions interfered with the natural scale formation in 93% of the studied water samples, while no interferenece was seen in 7% of the samples. LSI results ranged from-1.5 to 0.92, RSI ranged from 6.11 to 9.73, PSI ranged from 4.45 to 9.14, AI range was 11.45-12.71, CCPP range is-50.1-34.7, and finally L&Skl range was 0.15-1.02. The degree of linear association between two of any water parameters was calculated for all meseared parameters. Correlation coefficient values show high interrelation between EC with TDS and Cl-, TDS with Cl-, and TH with Cal'. Mixing water from two different sources ( Disi and Zai) showed that the combination improved the water quality especially when the ratio was 1:1.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					634	645										WOS:000395724300010

Based on the Saint-Venant equation and kappa-epsilon mixed model, this paper designed a 2D hydrodynamic and water quality model to optimize the layout of the sewage outlets along Jinsha River of Panzhihua city, and satisfactory results were obtained. Before optimization, numerical results showed that some sewage outlets had major pollution zones, and seriously affected the water quality downstream, thus it is necessary to further optimization design the sewage outlets. After optimization, numerical results demonstrated that, the river water could accommodate more discharge capacity, and even when the discharge concentration of chemical oxygen demand and ammonia nitrogen increased to 100mg/L and 15 mg/L, the sewage outlets still have minor pollution zone than before. Therefore, the proposed model is quite efficient to simulate the pollutant diffusion, and the optimization design is essential for the long-term plan.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					674	685										WOS:000395724300015

The highest number of THB bacteria in water body was found in August at a site located in the Ergene River, and the lowest in December at a site located in the Meric (Maritsa, Evros) River. The highest number of THB in sediment was found in February at a site located in the Ergene River, and the lowest in July at a site located in the Meric River. Some physicochemical measurements have been done at the same time as the bacterial sampling to determine environmental conditions of the ecosystems. According to Spearman's correlation index, some environmental conditions were found to have a remarkable correlation with bacterial distribution (p<0.05). This research concluded that pollution load significantly increased bacteria count and played an important role in variation of bacterial quality of the rivers.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					717	725										WOS:000395724300020

As the only one undammed river in Yangtze River basin, the Chishui River still maintains properties of natural rivers and is regarded as an ideal river for pilot biological monitoring on water quality. The aim of this study is to establish biocriteria based on macro invertebrates for water quality assessment and a sustainable management framework, and enhance integrated river basin management in the Yangtze River basin. Seventy-one sampling sites were set up to collect biological and water samples. According to certain steps, 4 core metrics were selected from 57 candidate metrics and regarded as sensitive to pollution and joined into the final system, including the metrics ScrapPct, EphemTax, ASPT and EPTPct. Four final metrics were from different metric groups and highly related to several water parameters, and the CSMMI index was also significantly correlated with the pollution gradient extracted from the macroinvertebrate community data. The deviation rates between chemical and biological assessment were acceptable. The results of application evaluation indicated the CSMMI index were a robust and reliable tool for bioassessment, possibly adapted and used in the adjacent rivers.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					749	760										WOS:000395724300024

Heavy cyanobacterial blooms occur in this highly turbid and shallow lake during summer and early autumn months, and excessive fish kills were observed after the blooms. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the zooplankton fauna of the pelagic food web to its relationship with selected water quality variables, and to evaluate its contribution to the food chain namely as abundance and diversity in a hypereutrophic shallow lake. Zooplankton and water samples were collected bimonthly at five stations from the open water of the lake between July 2010 and February 2012. During the study period a total of 48 taxa were recorded (3 taxa for Copepoda, 6 taxa for Cladocera, and 39 taxa for Rotifera). Rotifera was the most abundant group of the zooplankton community, comprising 81.2% of all samples, followed by Copepods 10.3% and Cladocerans 8.5%. Zooplankton community of the lake was dominated by eurytopic euplanktonic species Keratella cochlearis (21.8%). According to the Q(B/T) index, Lake Manyas showed a eutrophic character (Q(B/T)=2.3). The outcome of the statistical analysis showed that zooplankton fauna and its abundance were influenced mainly by water temperature, suspended particulate matter, and Secchi disk depth (transparency), respectively. The dense turbidity of Lake Manyas may be responsible for the elimination of sensitive organisms (larger sized cladocerans and copepods) over time, and also allow the dominancy of rotifers. Moreover cyanobacterial blooms affected crustaceans negatively, through poor food quality and harmful toxins. Temperature had a positive effect on rotifers as a result of population growth rates and available food. Consequently, the main factors that altered the composition and abundance of zooplankton in Lake Manyas were determined to be physical variables and favorable food availability.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					834	845										WOS:000395724300033

As the urbanization and population increasing, three types of surface water are simultaneously applied for drinking water sources in Huzhou. Based on the continuous monitoring and data analysis from 2011 to 2015, water quality evaluation was carried out by nine water quality indexes, in order to investigate the pollution characteristics and temporal variation trends of drinking water sources. The results showed that these three types of surface water generally conformed to the water quality standards of drinking water sources, and the water quality decreased in order of reservoir, lake and river. The water quality of reservoir was good and stable, while the main problem of Tai Lake was the exceeding standards of total nitrogen and total phosphorus which might lead to the algae growth. In the rivers, the indexes exceeding the national standards were total nitrogen, iron and manganese, and water quality indexes including chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen exhibited seasonal variation. More attention should be paid to water eutrophication and seasonal accidental risk in Huzhou.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					969	976										WOS:000395724300051

The present study covers measurement and evaluation of water quality parameters. Omerli Dam Reservoir has eutrophic character in terms of secchi disc depth (varies between 1.0-3.0 m) and phosphorus parameter (varies between 0.001-3.52 mg/L). It has oligotrophic character in terms of phytoplankton and carbon produced per unit area. Although pH of the reservoir is often alkaline in character, it shows categorically weak acid character after heavy rains. The chlorophyll-a parameter measured in the reservoir varies in vertical and horizontal positions. The average chlorophyll-a in the reservoir is 1.03 mg/L. Based on the water temperature measurements in the reservoir, it was determined that there was stratification in the reservoir during summer months. This stratification (the thermocline) was determined to be destroyed during winter months and the spring. The mean value of the measured dissolved oxygen in the reservoir was 8.49 mg/L. The TKN average in the reservoir was calculated as 1.83 mg/L. With these parameters, Omerli Dam Reservoir water quality could not be considered in a very clean class. Some rehabilitation studies have been carried out to solve the pollution problem in the lake basin. Preventing the pollution and improving water quality have affected the nature of the reservoir basin but it is necessary to continuously monitor the ecological balance of the reservoir continuously, which is significant for drinking water, fisheries and recreation facilities.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	1A					977	988										WOS:000395724300052

Because of its water capacity and myriad benefits in aquaculture facility, agricultural activities and tourism. The lake is considered as an important wetland within Buyuk Menderes basin. This study investigate the aquaculture facilities and anthropogenic sources of pollutions and how they affect the water quality of Bafa Lake. The major factors that control the quality-of Bafa Lake water are agricultural activities in the basin, domestic and industrial wastes that come from Buyuk Menderes River and its surrounding lake, fisheries and aquaculture facilities. Contaminants located in the Lake are continuously having a negative impact on its water quality during the last three decades. The effect of sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) cultivation facilities on surface water quality in the Lake were determined. Water samples were taken from five stations between April 2013 and March 2014 from Bafa Lake. Sample were analyzed for water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, amonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and orthophosphate. From result surface water quality was assessed based on the comparison of samples collected near aquaculture stations. For reference, a sample was taken outside the cultivation area and compared with the Water Pollution Registration Act (WPRA) standards. According to the WPRA, surface water quality of the Lake was classified as level II. At the end of analyses, it was revealed that the area where aquaculture activities were intense showed high rate of polution than the other 3 stations as well as the reference station. The results show that, aquaculture activities on sea bream and sea bass have a negative impact in the entire Bafa Lake.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	2A					1538	1547										WOS:000396642600025

BACTERIOPLANKTON CHARACTERISTICS AND WATER CHEMISTRY IN TWO MAJOR TRIBUTARIES OF DRINKING WATER SOURCE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Rasina and Blatasnica, two major tributaries of drinking water source, reservoir Celije, were sampled during one year investigation. The parameters that were determined were as follows: water temperature, KMnO4 consumption, concentrations of nutrients (total phosphorus, orthophosphates, ammonia nitrogen, nitrites, nitrates), and total bacterial count. Also, the morphotype diversity of bacterioplankton was investigated. Based on these parameters, Blatasnica had significantly poorer water quality than Rasina, primarily due to increased levels of total phosphorus, orthophosphates, ammonia nitrogen, and total bacteria. Also, Rasina had a worse quality of water after the inflow of Blatasnica than more upstream. The dominant bacteria morphotype at all sites were rods, followed by cocci and curved forms. Abundance of the rods was positively correlated with water turbidity, KMnO4 consumption and concentration of ammonia nitrogen. Abundance of cocci was also correlated with these parameters, including total phosphorus, orthophosphates and nitrites, but negatively. Curved bacteria were the only bacterial type showed positive correlation with water temperature.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	2A					1687	1697										WOS:000396642600044						
J	Liu, XC; Liang, J; Xia, SQ				Liu, Xinchao; Liang, Jun; Xia, Siqing			LARGE FULL-SCALE APPLICATION OF MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY FOR WATER RECLAMATION IN WUXI, CHINA-CASE STUDY	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Membrane technology like membrane bioreactor (MBR) and ultrafiltration-reverse osmosis process has been developed and applied for decades. In China, it has been increasingly widely applied in wastewater treatment and reclamation plants. This paper presented experience with several years of full-scale operation at the Wuxi New District, which has successfully adopted the large-scale application of membrane technology for water reclamation. The design and results of long-term operation of three MBRs in local wastewater treatment plant and a ultrafiltration-reverse osmosis plant in industry were introduced and discussed. Since 2009, the application of MBRs in three wastewater treatment plant with capacity ranging from 20,000 m(3)/d to 80,000 m3/d in Wuxi New District has allowed the 1A standard discharge of sewage that initially contained 360 similar to 510 mg/L CODcr, 250 similar to 300 mg/L SS, 43 similar to 55 mg/L total nitrogen and 3.1 similar to 5.0 mg/L total phosphate. With a product capacity of 10,000 m(3)/d, the high-purity reclamation of fluoride wastewater from a semiconductor manufacture which was recycled for industrial use and landscape irrigation was achieved by the adoption of a dual-membrane ultrafiltration-reverse osmosis plant. The dual membrane process yielded permeate with fluoride content below 1.0 mg/L and the product water quality meet the custom requirements. In the reverse osmosis operation, a positive correlation between feed temperature and permeate fluoride was observed.																	1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	2A					1791	1799										WOS:000396642600057

However, according to some studies on streams and small rivers, the diatom ecological guilds might be more effective tools for ecological quality assessment in the future, but their usability is not always clear. Our main goal was to compare the robustness of the IPS index and diatom ecological guilds in a large river. For this: i) a temporary study was carried out to investigate if there were some differences between how the nutrient content affected the IPS values and guild proportions in the Danube River; ii) spatial studies were conducted to investigate the effects of the different water depths (different light intensity and current velocity) on biological metrics (such as IPS and guilds); iii) we studied whether the IPS index or guild proportions were influenced more by the substrate type. As for the results of the temporal study, only the motile and planktic guilds had significant connections with phosphate phosphorus concentration. However, the high profile and the low profile taxa showed correlations neither with nutrient concentration nor water discharge. Nevertheless, the higher the abundances of the low profile guild, the lesser the values of the IPS index. In spatial studies, the guild abundances (especially the motile taxa) altered at different water depths. This could be caused by different microhabitats characterised by a disparate current velocity, and by different types of bed material along the cross-section. Contrary to guilds, there were no relevant differences in IPS values along the cross-sections. We experienced similarities in the study on shells and in the spatial study: there were significant differences between guild abundances on different shell surfaces, but not so in the IPS. On the whole, the IPS is robust enough to be a suitable index for ecological water quality assessment, and diatom ecological guilds cannot be used instead of the diatom index (IPS) in large rivers. However, the trait-based methods could be useful supplements to the ecological status assessment.																	1863-9135					JAN	2017	189	2			SI		87	103		10.1127/fal/2016/0933								WOS:000395223500002

We asked whether variability among samples is determined by sampled substrate (macrophyte species) or location (sampling site). Twenty-one samples of eleven species of vascular plants (predominantly aquatic macrophytes) and one charophyte species were collected at three sites within the fishpond during one sampling event in June 2015. Altogether, 129 diatom taxa were identified. Species richness ranged from 14 to 46 taxa per sample, with the highest richness for Elatine hydropiper and the lowest for Chara braunii. Surprisingly, the representation of typically periphytic taxa (attached to the substrate) was very low, and did not exceed 16 %. Genera typical for epiphyton were present only marginally. The exception was Gomphonema parvulum agg. On the other hand, facultatively periphytic species of the Fragilariales were dominant as well as motile raphid taxa of the Naviculales. Species assemblages at the three sampling sites differed significantly, including the subset of periphytic diatoms. Species composition at the fishpond dam was more represented by typically periphytic taxa, while the other two sites (bays of the Babicky and Dehtafslcy streams) were dominated by facultatively periphytic taxa, mainly Pseudostaurosira elliptica. These differences can be explained by the differences in environmental conditions among the sites, especially very intensive and frequent wave action typical for most parts of the Dehtaf fishpond. However, no significant differences in diatom species composition dependent on the species of sampled plant substrate were found.																	1863-9135					JAN	2017	189	2			SI		117	135		10.1127/fal/2016/0936								WOS:000395223500004

Two centuries of nitrogen dynamics: Legacy sources and sinks in the Mississippi and Susquehanna River Basins	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Global flows of reactive nitrogen (N) have increased significantly over the last century in response to agricultural intensification and elevated levels of atmospheric deposition. Despite widespread implementation conservation measures, N concentrations in surface waters are often remaining steady or continuing to increase. Although such lack of response has been attributed to time lags associated with legacy N stores in subsurface reservoirs, it is unclear what the magnitudes of such stores are and how they are partitioned between shallow soil and deeper groundwater reservoirs. Here we have synthesized data to develop a 214year (1800-2014) trajectory of N inputs to the land surface of the continental U.S. We have concurrently developed a parsimonious, process-based model, Exploration of Long-tErM Nutrient Trajectories (ELEMeNT) that pairs this input trajectory with a travel time-based approach to simulate transport and retention along subsurface pathways. Using the model, we have reconstructed historic nitrate yields at the outlets of two major U.S. watersheds, the Mississippi River Basin (MRB) and Susquehanna River Basin (SRB). Our results show significant N loading above baseline levels in both watersheds before the widespread use of commercial N fertilizers, largely due to the conversion of forest and grassland to row crop agriculture. Model results also allow us to quantify the magnitudes of legacy N in soil and groundwater pools and to highlight the dominance of soil legacies in MRB and groundwater legacies in SRB. Approximately 55% and 18% of the current annual N loads in the MRB and SRB were found to be older than 10years of age.

Imaging Hydrological Processes in Headwater Riparian Seeps with Time-Lapse Electrical Resistivity	GROUNDWATER												Delineating hydrologic and pedogenic factors influencing groundwater flow in riparian zones is central in understanding pathways of water and nutrient transport. In this study, we combined two-dimensional time-lapse electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) (depth of investigation approximately 2m) with hydrometric monitoring to examine hydrological processes in the riparian area of FD-36, a small (0.4km(2)) agricultural headwater basin in the Valley and Ridge region of east-central Pennsylvania. We selected two contrasting study sites, including a seep with groundwater discharge and an adjacent area lacking such seepage. Both sites were underlain by a fragipan at 0.6m. We then monitored changes in electrical resistivity, shallow groundwater, and nitrate-N concentrations as a series of storms transitioned the landscape from dry to wet conditions. Time-lapse ERI revealed different resistivity patterns between seep and non-seep areas during the study period. Notably, the seep displayed strong resistivity reductions (similar to 60%) along a vertically aligned region of the soil profile, which coincided with strong upward hydraulic gradients recorded in a grid of nested piezometers (0.2- and 0.6-m depth). These patterns suggested a hydraulic connection between the seep and the nitrate-rich shallow groundwater system below the fragipan, which enabled groundwater and associated nitrate-N to discharge through the fragipan to the surface. In contrast, time-lapse ERI indicated no such connections in the non-seep area, with infiltrated rainwater presumably perched above the fragipan. Results highlight the value of pairing time-lapse ERI with hydrometric and water quality monitoring to illuminate possible groundwater and nutrient flow pathways to seeps in headwater riparian areas.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				JAN-FEB	2017	55	1					136	148		10.1111/gwat.12461								WOS:000393955900016	27618484

In this study, a geographic information system based LVF model for a semiquantitative assessment of groundwater pollution risk is established, based on the groundwater pollution source load (L), groundwater vulnerability (V), and groundwater function value (F). Further, the pollution source load is characterized by seven specific pollution sources, the vulnerability is calculated by the modified DRASTIC method, and the groundwater function value is evaluated with the water quality and quantity. The model was used to assess the risk of shallow groundwater pollution in Shenyang city, Northeast China, with an area of 8,263 km(2). The results show that highest risk areas account for 16.3% of the study area and are mainly distributed in the east of the study area. High risk areas are significantly affected by a shallow buried depth of groundwater and many types of harmful pollutants from industrial, agricultural, and domestic pollution sources. The evaluation results reflect the risk of groundwater pollution in the Shenyang area, which is relevant to the management and sustainable use of groundwater resources in the area.																	1080-7039	1549-7860					2017	23	2					276	298		10.1080/10807039.2016.1245099								WOS:000396866900006

Data stored into EMRs span from data crawled from biological laboratories to textual description of diseases and diagnostic device results (e.g., biomedical images). Each EMR is related to a diagnosis related group (DRG) record. A DRG record is a record associated with a citizen that has been cured in a hospital. It contains a code, called major diagnostic category (MDC), which summarizes the treated disease and allows to reimburse costs related to patient treatments during his staying in health structures. DRGs are used for administrative process (e.g., costs and reimbursement management) as well as disease monitoring. Associating diagnostic codes with external information (such as environmental and geographical data) and with information filtered from EMRs (e.g., biological results or analytes values) can be useful to monitor citizens wellness status. We propose a methodology to analyze such data based on a multistep process. First, we cross reference data by using a semantics-based clustering procedure, extract information from EMRs, and then, cluster them by looking for similar patterns of diseases. Then, biological records in each disease cluster are analyzed to evaluate intracluster similarity by selecting analytes typologies and values. Finally, biological data is related to diagnosis codes and geometrically projected in areas of interest in order to map calculated outlier patients. We applied the methodology on two case studies: 1) diagnosis codes and biochemical analytes of 20 000 biological analyses about hospitalized patients during one observation year and 2) the correlation between cardiovascular diseases and water quality in a southern Italian region. Preliminary findings show the effectiveness of our method.																	2168-2194					JAN	2017	21	1					228	237		10.1109/JBHI.2015.2496424								WOS:000395538500025	26540721

The tillage systems consisted of conventional tillage with stubble (CT1), conventional tillage with stubbles burned (CT2), heavy disc harrow reduced tillage (RT1), rototiller reduced tillage (RT2), reduced tillage with heavy tandem disc harrow fallowed by no-tillage (RNT) and no-till (NT). Each tillage method applied at 480 m(2) plot and replicated three times in randomly distributed plots. In the experiment, organic matter content (OM), aggregate stability (AS), penetration resistance (PR), porosity, bulk density (BD) in 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm depth and nitrate concentrations at 90 cm depth were determined. Tillage practices significantly affected the measured properties at both soil depths. The BD and PR within the conservational managed plots were higher than under conventional managed plot. Whereas, OM content and AS were significantly greater under conservational managed plots, indicating improved soil quality. Soybean yield was not affected by tillage practices. The concentrations of NO3-N leached had strong variation within sampling dates and significantly different among treatments after the first and the third irrigation (P.0.01). The highest average NO3-N (1440.8b +/- 74.9 mg L-(1)) in leachate was measured in the CT2 plot while the lowest value (774.8a +/- 56.5 mg L-1) was obtained in the RT1 plot. The results of this study revealed that reduced tillage and no-till treatments could significantly improve soil physical quality and reduce NO3-N leaching of Typic Haploxerert soil in the Cukurova Region.

J	El Din, ES; Zhang, Y; Suliman, A				El Din, Essam Sharaf; Zhang, Yun; Suliman, Alaeldin			Mapping concentrations of surface water quality parameters using a novel remote sensing and artificial intelligence framework	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												The deterioration of surface water quality occurs due to the presence of various types of pollutants generated from human, agricultural, and industrial activities. Thus, mapping concentrations of different surface water quality parameters (SWQPs), such as turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and dissolved oxygen (DO), is indeed critical for providing the appropriate treatment to the affected waterbodies. Traditionally, concentrations of SWQPs have been measured through intensive field work. Additionally, quite a lot of studies have attempted to retrieve concentrations of SWQPs from satellite images using regression-based methods. However, the relationship between SWQPs and satellite data is complex to be modelled accurately by using regression-based methods. Therefore, our study attempts to develop an artificial intelligence modelling method for mapping concentrations of both optical and non-optical SWQPs. In this context, a remote-sensing framework based on the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is developed for the first time to quantify concentrations of different SWQPs from the Landsat8 satellite imagery. Compared to other methods, such as Support Vector Machine, significant coefficients of determination (R-2) between the Landsat8 surface reflectance and concentrations of SWQPs were obtained using the developed Landsat8-based-BPNN models. The resulting R-2 values were 0.991, 0.933, 0.937, 0.930, and 0.934 for turbidity, TSS, COD, BOD, and DO, respectively. Indeed, these findings indicate that the developed Landsat8-based-BPNN framework is capable of developing highly accurate models for retrieving concentrations of different SWQPs from the Landsat8 imagery.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	4					1023	1042		10.1080/01431161.2016.1275056								WOS:000394622600004

The method first analyses the display characteristics of waterbodies from remote-sensing images (their spectral characteristics, geometric features, and textural features), forming a decision tree of rules that represent characteristic knowledge for waterbody information extraction. This rule set is added to the various processing stages of waterbody information extraction after disasters to construct a waterbody information extraction model. Second, an object-oriented method is used for image segmentation. A rough initial waterbody information extraction is performed based on spectral information, and then refined based on the characteristic knowledge. Third, noise is eliminated and holes are filled in the images of the refined waterbody information extraction results. Finally, the accuracy of this new waterbody information extraction method is evaluated from both qualitative and quantitative aspects. Accuracy assessments of the experimental results obtained using remote-sensing images from the Wenchuan earthquake and a 2010 flood in Pakistan show that the proposed method is both efficient and accurate at extracting post-disaster waterbody information even when the background is complex.																	0143-1161	1366-5901					2017	38	5					1404	1422		10.1080/01431161.2016.1278284								WOS:000394647800011

The expedition was performed with the aim to test recently developed ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent portable lidar UFL-8 in natural lake waters and to validate it by contact conventional measurements. We had opportunity to compare our results with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra spectroradiometer satellite images received at the satellite monitoring station of the Eotvos Lorand University (Budapest, Hungary) to make an attempt of lidar calibration of satellite medium-resolution bands data.

It supports the lifeline of major population in urban and rural areas existing in the river basin. The river is a chief source of water supply, power generation, river-borne transport and expansion of the urban industrial belt. However, the river receives huge amount of untreated wastewater which imbalances the nutrient concentration at many points along the stretch. Therefore, the present study is focused to estimate the water pollution using water quality indices, such as OPI, national sanitation foundation index (NSFWQI), comprehensive pollution index (CPI) and heavy metal pollution index (HPI), and identify the imbalance nutrients (i. e. NO3, PO4, heavy metals, etc.) in the river. Also, the probability of health risk that might occur by drinking the river water has been classified using risk assessment index (RAI). The water samples were collected in post-and pre-monsoon months in year 2014-2015, from nine sampling locations between Haridwar and Garhmukteshwar. The results indicate that the water quality of River Ganga is unsuitable for drinking during sampling months, because the average NSFWQI was found to be 53.44 and 43.56, while CPI was 2.71 and 2.82 in post-and pre-monsoon, respectively. The river water has been found to be severely contaminated due to heavy metals (i. e. HPI > 3) and indicates the human health risk (i. e. RAI > 1). Therefore, it has been suggested that the river water must be treated to balance the nutrient concentration before used for drinking. Further, by a comparative analysis of indices, NSFWQI and CPI have been found as the better suitable indices to classify the status of water quality.																	1571-5124	1814-2060					2017	15	1					53	60		10.1080/15715124.2016.1205078								WOS:000396675800005

In this study, feedforward artificial neural networks are used to model the WQI in Perak River basin Malaysia due to its capability in modelling nonlinear systems. The results show that the developed single feedforward neural network model can predict WQI very well with the coefficient of determination R2 and mean squared error (MSE) of 0.9090 and 0.1740 on the unseen validation data, respectively. In addition to that, the aggregation of multiple neural networks in predicting the WQI further improves the prediction performance on the unseen validation data. Forward selection and backward elimination selective combination methods are used to combine multiple neural networks and both methods lead to 6 and 5 networks being combined with R2 and MSE of 0.9340, 0.9270 and 0.1156, 0.1256, respectively. It is clearly shown that combining multiple neural networks does improve the performance for WQI prediction.

Integrated treatment of GCP and slag quenching water of LD steel making unit	IRONMAKING & STEELMAKING												The scarcity of water has driven every steel plant in India to pursue major water conservation initiatives. R&D Tata Steel Jamshedpur has invented an integrated and cost effective process for treatment and reuse of steel making gas cleaning plant (GCP) wastewater and Linz-Donawitz (LD) slag quenching (SQ) wastewater. The new treatment process consists of mixing of GCP water with SQ wastewater in a specific ratio followed by coagulant addition and controlled carbon dioxide (CO2) sparging. The average total suspended solid (TSS) and total dissolve solids (TDS) concentration of treated water were observed to be 22 and 190 mg L-1 during 180 days of continuous monitoring. Thus the water quality falls well within the limits for reuse and recycle standards within the plants. The maximum allowable limit of TDS and TSS for industrial water supplies is 500 and 100 ppm, respectively. The process significantly reduces the water requirement for steel making and paves the path for conversion of LD steel making process into a sustainable 'Zero Liquid Discharge' unit.																	0301-9233	1743-2812					2017	44	1					1	5		10.1080/03019233.2016.1246846								WOS:000396712800001

The obtained results show that the mean values of all heavy metals in studied river water samples were significantly high, with following maximal concentrations: As (0.033 mg L-1), Cd (0.002 mg L-1), Cr (0.225 mg L-1), Cu (0.015 mg L-1), Hg (0.004 mg L-1), Mn (15.66 mg L-1), Ni (0.255 mg L-1), Pb (0.013 mg L-1), and Zn (0.612 mg L-1), but only two samples from locations influenced by Kishnica and Badovci flotation tailing dams showed statistically anomalous values of Cr3+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Hg2+. According to assessment based on Croatian standards, locations near both flotation tailing dams are significantly polluted with majority of studiedmetals, while downstream sampling stations are almost unpolluted or slightly polluted. Mercury is found to be the most significant contaminant. According to WHO recommended values for drinking water, on all locations values were within the limits for Al, Cd, Cu, and Zn, while for As, Cr, Hg, Mn, Ni, and Pb values exceed recommended values on some sampling stations. Further monitoring of water and possibly sediments of Grac, anica River is advised, as well as performing of remediation of Kishnica and Badovci mine tailing dams.

J	Zhang, YH; Liang, SX; Sun, ZC				Zhang Yihui; Liang Shuxiu; Sun Zhaochen			Measurement and Numerical Study of Vertical Mixing Microstructure in the Bohai Strait	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Vertical mixing plays an important role in three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality models. The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of vertical mixing in strong tidal waters and the simulation capability of turbulence closure models under the influence of flow velocity variations and temperature distribution. The distribution characteristics of thermocline and vertical mixing in the Bohai Strait is analyzed through field observations conducted using the Turbulence Ocean Microstructure Acquisition Profiler in summer. Based on the measured temperature and mixing data, three-dimensional numerical models are established with various temperature distribution and turbulence closure schemes. It is concluded that the vertical eddy viscosity K-m and the thermal-diffusion coefficient K-h, using the Mellor and Yamada level 2.5 (MY-2.5) and the k-epsilon turbulence closure models, exhibit a significant change with change in flow velocity and a time delay compared with the flow velocity process disregarding the effect of wind. The vertical mixing coefficients due to changing flow velocity under isothermality or temperature stratification could vary by one or two orders of magnitude, respectively. Simulated mixing coefficients using two different turbulence closure models exhibit different variations under isothermality and temperature stratification and have a significant discrepancy with the measurement data. Thermocline evolution is compared using three different methods for K-m and K-h. It is found that the temperature mixes gradually using constant mixing coefficients in the vertical direction. When the mixing coefficients are computed with the MY-2.5 and k-epsilon models, the temperature mixes rapidly in the shallow water zone. The mixing of temperature is even faster in the lower layer than in the upper layer in the deepwater zone, leading to the thermocline moving toward the upper layer. Moreover, the temperature mixes faster in the k-epsilon model than in the MY-2.5 model.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				JAN	2017	33	1					158	172		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-15-00235.1								WOS:000394926100014

They represent an important concern due to their widespread distribution in the environment, their resistance to biodegradation, their potential to bioaccumulate and their harmful effects. Several pilot treatments have been implemented to prevent economic consequences and deterioration of soil and water quality. As a promising option, fungal enzymes are regarded as a powerful choice for degradation of PAHs. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Pleurotus ostreatus and Bjerkandera adusta are most commonly used for the degradation of such compounds due to their production of ligninolytic enzymes such as lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase. The rate of biodegradation depends on many culture conditions, such as temperature, oxygen, accessibility of nutrients and agitated or shallow culture. Moreover, the addition of biosurfactants can strongly modify the enzyme activity. The removal of PAHs is dependent on the ionization potential. The study of the kinetics is not completely comprehended, and it becomes more challenging when fungi are applied for bioremediation. Degradation studies in soil are much more complicated than liquid cultures because of the heterogeneity of soil, thus, many factors should be considered when studying soil bioremediation, such as desorption and bioavailability of PAHs. Different degradation pathways can be suggested. The peroxidases are heme-containing enzymes having common catalytic cycles. One molecule of hydrogen peroxide oxidizes the resting enzyme withdrawing two electrons. Subsequently, the peroxidase is reduced back in two steps of one electron oxidation. Laccases are copper-containing oxidases. They reduce molecular oxygen to water and oxidize phenolic compounds.

GIS-based prediction of stream chemistry using landscape composition, wet areas, and hydrological flow pathways	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Landscape morphology exerts strong, scale-dependent controls on stream hydrology and biogeochemistry in heterogeneous catchments. We applied three descriptors of landscape structure at different spatial scales based on new geographic information system tools to predict variability in stream concentrations for a wide range of solutes (Al, Ba, Be, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, S, Si, Sr, Sc, Co, Cr, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Rb, Y, Cd, Sb, Cs, La, Pb, Th, U, DOC, and Cl) using a linear regression analysis. Results showed that less reactive elements, which can be expected to behave more conservatively in the landscape (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, and Si), generally were best predicted from the broader-scale description of landscape composition (areal coverage of peat, tills, and sorted sediments). These results highlight the importance of mineral weathering as a source of some elements, which was best captured by landscape-scale descriptors of catchment structure. By contrast, more nonconservative elements (e.g., DOC, Al, Cd, Cs, Co, Th, Y, and U), were best predicted by defining wet areas and/or flow path lengths of different patches in the landscape. This change in the predictive models reflect the importance of peat deposits, such as organic-rich riparian zones and mire ecosystems, which are favorable environments for biogeochemical reactions of more nonconservative elements. As such, using this understanding of landscape influences on stream chemistry can provide improved mitigation strategies and management plans that specifically target source areas, so as to minimize mobilization of undesired elements into streams.

Hydrochemistry and trophic state change in a large reservoir in the Brazilian northeast region under intense drought conditions	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The study shows changes on physical and chemical water parameters and of trophic state in a large reservoir in the Brazilian semiarid region following decreasing reservoir volume due to rainfall shortage during four consecutive years. The monitoring period, between November 2011 and May 2014, assessed approximately 50% water volume reduction and 10 meters' decrease of reservoir water level that degraded water quality. Decrease in reservoir volume, strong evaporation and the permanent influence of anthropogenic activities, favored the concentration of salts and accumulation of nutrients and of increasing pH. Thermal stratification of the water column occurred when volume was maximum and lead to a significant reduction in dissolved oxygen in the hypolimnion (0.07 to 2.62 mg L-1). Diminishing volume resulted in mixing of the hypolimnion nutrient-rich and oxygen-poor waters in the entre water column and changed the initial oligotrophic condition to eutrophic. However, the temporal scale of the response of the reservoir's trophic state differs in the different areas of the reservoir. Whereas deeper areas accumulating nutrients from aquaculture and agriculture progressively became mesotrophic and eventually eutrophic; shallower regions far from direct anthropogenic influences, changed their trophic sate much later, but rapidly turned into super-eutrophic conditions, probably due to more intense sediment resuspension and water mixing. Trophic State Index followed nutrient increase during most of the period. However, it also responded to an increase in chlorophyll a concentrations when the reservoir achieved its minimum volume, in particular in the shallower areas. The results suggest that this type of reservoir systems are vulnerable to eutrophication during extended drought periods and that a better assessment of the maximum support capacity for reservoir activities, particularly aquaculture, must be re-assessed taking into consideration worst case scenarios forecasted by global climate change.																	1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76	1					41	51		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1433								WOS:000396708700005

Morphological abnormalities in cladocerans related to eutrophication of a tropical reservoir	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												In zooplankton communities, morphological changes in Cladocera (Crustacea: Branchiopoda) may be resulting from water pollution by anthropogenic activities and/or natural events. The removal of vegetation cover, urbanization, agriculture and sewage release accelerate the eutrophication process in the aquatic environment. The present study seeks to demonstrate the occurrence of morphological abnormalities in cladocerans and relate the changes in the morphology and species composition to the physical and chemical parameters of the water. Samplings were made monthly in five stations on the Sapucai River compartment of Furnas Reservoir, located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, from July 2013 to February 2014. The Furnas Reservoir has intense occupation of the surrounding areas by agriculture, urban and industrial activities and the installation of net cage fish cultures, which contribute to the water quality deterioration. Cladocerans samples were collected using a suction pump and plankton net (68 mu m mesh size) and concentrated from a volume of 400 L. The measures of physical and chemical parameters of the water were obtained by a Horiba U-50 multi-sensor on the surface of water column and the density and morphology of Cladocera were made by microscopy. Twenty-three species of Cladocera were recorded with high organism densities of Chydoridae family species. Morphological abnormalities were observed in Daphnia gessneri, Ceriodaphnia silvestrii, Bosmina longirostris, Bosmina tubicen and Chydorus pubescens. The highest densities of C. pubescens with abnormalities were observed at sampling stations which had littoral characteristics and influences of sewage release. For C. pubescens, abnormalities were observed and classified into two types. The type 1 abnormality was considered an increase of length of intestine and size of its intestinal loop, whereas for type 2 was considered the occurrence of an intestine prolapse. The morphological abnormalities in cladocerans were described and compared to the ones described in the literature. From the results, it may observe that the abnormalities were probably resulting from continuous eutrophication process which has been occurring in the reservoir due to anthropogenic activities around the reservoir and a decrease in the water volume of the reservoir, caused by an unusual dry weather period in this region in the last years.																	1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76	1					94	102		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1395								WOS:000396708700009

To facilitate any meaningful research on cloud forest streams it is necessary to first describe the structure and composition of the local lotic aquatic communities and to establish which environmental factors structure them under natural conditions. The present study sampled the macroinvertebrate communities of rivers draining the montane cloud forests of Cucuso National Park in Honduras, where increasing anthropogenic pressures are threatening water quality. Using multivariate techniques a bottom-up approach was adopted to establish groups of similar sites and identify environmental factors driving the differences between these. Three site groupings emerged based largely on differences in taxon composition driven mainly by pH and altitude.																	1129-5767	1723-8633					2017	76	1					148	160		10.4081/jlimnol.2016.1522								WOS:000396708700014

The aim of the present study was to investigate the eutrophication of Mediterranean wetlands and their possible recovery. An in situ mesocosm nutrient enrichment experiment was performed in a coastal shallow lake from eastern Spain, holding dense Chara meadows. In this lake, 36 mesocosms were installed and fertilised weekly with four levels of N and P addition over an 8-week period from June to August. Mesocosms fertilised with the two higher levels (N : P >= 5 : 0.5 mg L-1) shifted to turbid status with macrophyte loss before Week 4. Saturation concentrations were similar under these two conditions, with averages, similar to 1.0 mg L-1 total particulate P and 700 mu g L-1 chlorophyll-a reached in the last 3 weeks. After 5 weeks of the experiment, macrophytes were removed from the mesocosms without nutrient addition and those fertilised with 1 : 0.1 mg L-1 N:P. Macrophyte removal resulted in a release of phosphate and ammonium from sediments, enhancing eutrophication. Three months after stopping nutrient addition, high nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations persisted in the highly fertilised mesocosms, but decreased in the low fertilised mesocoms, which shows that restoration of eutrophic Mediterranean shallow lakes depends to a great extent on previous external loads.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	3					506	518		10.1071/MF15291								WOS:000396038400010

Effects of small changes in riparian forest complexity on aquatic insect bioindicators in Brazilian subtropical streams	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Riparian forests have positive effects on water quality and biodiversity. However, most studies have only tested the effects of distinct vegetation types or streams with and without forests, despite the fact that riparian forests differ in degrees of complexity. The aim of the present study was to test whether riparian forest complexity affected the composition and abundance of the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa across a small environmental gradient. Wealso measured whether EPT genera or feeding groups responded to changes in riparian forest complexity. The study was conducted in two protection areas (i.e. Lagoa do Peri Municipal Park, PERI; and the Permanent Protection Area of Ratones, RAT) of Santa Catarina Island, Brazil. Primary production increased in streams with lower canopy percentage, and EPT assemblages differed among streams with different riparian forest complexity. In RAT, the water quality and forest variables affected EPT composition; however, in PERI, only water quality variables were important. Indicator species analysis based on genera suggested Kempnyia (Plecoptera) and Zelusia (Ephemeroptera) to be indicative of streams with greater forest complexity, whereas Farrodes (Ephemeroptera) was significant in streams of intermediate riparian forest complexity; however, no one functional group dominated. The results of the present study show that small changes in riparian forest complexity influence the composition of EPT insects in subtropical streams.

This paper briefly reviews shifts in freshwater policy in New Zealand over the last six years, identifies implications for demands on science, and then offers a framework of topics to help guide freshwater scientists better help water resource managers both develop and implement policy. Key themes include: (i) being clear about the various potential roles of scientists and the particular importance of the `honest broker' role at the interface; (ii) informing policy decisions on capacity for resource use, by predicting consequences of future scenarios; and (iii) integrating and communicating multidisciplinary technical and community-derived knowledge, including handling inevitable uncertainty. Understanding and practising these topics will contribute to improved policy for managing cumulative effects and benefit New Zealand's freshwaters and communities.																	0028-8330	1175-8805					2017	51	1					7	20		10.1080/00288330.2016.1264431								WOS:000396712500003

Finding reference: a comparison of modelling approaches for predicting macroinvertebrate community index benchmarks	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Reference benchmarks are needed to assess the contemporary status of rivers and to establish restoration targets. We developed predictive models to estimate site-specific reference values for a macroinvertebrate community index (MCI), which is used to indicate a range of human impacts on wadeable streams. We compared three statistical modelling approaches - general linear, boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) - and tested the effect of spatial scale on predictive accuracy by developing national and regional BRT models. Using fitted flexible models (BRT, RF) and resetting predictors to reflect natural state provided the most accurate predictions of reference condition. Variation in reference MCI predictions from national and regional models was within the range observed from methodological and temporal variability. The proportion of native vegetation in upstream catchments was the primary predictor of MCI scores in all models, while secondary predictors varied regionally.

Multiple lines of evidence determine robust nutrient load limits required to safeguard a threatened lake/lagoon system	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Three independent scientific lines of evidence were sought to determine the nutrient load limits to safeguard the macrophyte community of an intermittently closed and open lake/lagoon (ICOLL): (1) a literature review identified nitrogen load thresholds related to the collapse of macrophytes in similar systems in Australia, Europe and elsewhere, (2) an ICOLL expert carried out an assessment based on current local data and on data from 57 Australian coastal lakes and lagoons, and (3) a deterministic coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model was developed and applied to simulate the ecological outcomes of several nutrient loading scenarios. The three lines of evidence converged on well-defined nitrogen load estimates required to avoid the collapse of the macrophyte community. Uncertainties were slightly greater in relation to required phosphorus load limits, but the evidence still helped set a precautionary phosphorus load limit that accounted for these uncertainties. Thus, despite the challenges in setting load limits for complex ecosystems, multiple lines of evidence helped derive robust nutrient load limits for managing the ICOLL to safeguard values associated with a healthy macrophyte community.

Seagrass rehabilitation: successful transplants and evaluation of methods at different spatial scales	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Seagrass (Zostera muelleri Irmisch ex. Aschers) was historically prolific in Whangarei Harbour, New Zealand, but has since declined. Over two years we compared the survival of mid-intertidal zone transplants (18 x 0.25 m(2) plots) from a remnant meadow to a former site using three methods: (1) intact `sods', (2) unanchored `sprigs' and (3) sprigs amongst `mats' of artificial plants. Before and after transplant, we quantified plant cover in all plots, and in transects across the wider intertidal zone. We also measured plant biomass, irradiance and water quality at each site. We found that sods and sprigs were equally effective with plant cover increased from <1 to 63%, but mats were ultimately not successful. Cover across the wider transplant site increased from 10% to 46% (biomass from 58 to 321 g m(-2)). Donor plots regenerated within 9 months. This study shows that Z. muelleri can be rehabilitated by transplant upon reinstatement of suitable growing conditions at former sites.

Responses of stream macroinvertebrate communities and water quality of five dairy farming streams following adoption of mitigation practices	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Five streams in catchments with pastoral dairy farming as the dominant land use were monitored for periods up to 13 years after adoption of mitigation practices (MPs) to detect changes in stream macroinvertebrate communities and water quality. Water quality and macroinvertebrate community condition was degraded at the start with respect to N, P, suspended solids (SS), Escherichia coli concentrations, and a number of macroinvertebrate metrics, and were typical of catchments with intensive pastoral land use. Trend analysis showed a decrease in SS concentrations for all streams, generally increasing water clarity, and lower E. coli concentrations in two streams. The improvements, attributable to improved stream fencing and effluent disposal, were only sometimes associated with improved macroinvertebrate metrics, and suggest constraints of connectivity, habitat, time, and/or MP effectiveness. Macroinvertebrate species composition had the strongest correlation with total nitrogen at two sites, but changes probably reflected indirect factors associated with TN concentrations were responsible.																	0028-8330	1175-8805					2017	51	1					127	145		10.1080/00288330.2016.1269814								WOS:000396712500010

Here, a relatively new method based on preparative high performance size exclusion chromatography using deionized water as mobile phase (recovery rate of total carbon mass >97%) was developed to fractionate DOM depending on molecular size and identify molecular weight (MW)-dependent DOM characteristics presumably associated with its potential for formation of complexes with inorganic species (i.e. metals and metalloids), membrane fouling and disinfection byproducts. Size fractionated DOM from different types of source (river water vs. wastewater effluent) provided similar patterns in water quality, fluorescence properties and biopolymer composition. This suggested that discharge of municipal wastewater had an impact on the river water. However, the propensity for complexation between each size fractionated DOM sample and various inorganic species was substantially different, due to the differences in fluorescence spectral properties and associated biopolymer composition. Among three distinct size fractionated DOM samples, the fraction with medium MW and the main biopolymers polyhydroxy aromatics exhibited a relatively higher potential for metal complexation and the normalized ratio of metals and metalloids to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) [metal/DOC (fraction i, i = I, II, III)] to [metal/DOC (fraction I)] than the other size fractionated DOMs. The results indicate that the biopolymer composition of DOM plays a critical role in its complexation with inorganic species.

Data was acquired from the State Environmental Monitoring database for the period before and after changing the location of discharge from the treatment plant. The before-after (BA) and before-after-control-impact (BACI) analyses were used to determine the effectiveness of applied solutions. The BA study covered 12 physicochemical parameters and showed improvement of water quality in terms of phosphorous compounds, EC, ammonium nitrogen, TKN, TN, and BOD5. Lack of statistically significant differences for nitrates, pH, and TOC were noted. The BACI analysis was only applicable for six physicochemical parameters, and statistically significant differences were shown for TN, TKN, ammonium nitrogen, and TP. There were no differences in the case of nitrates and DO. After wastewater effluent diversion, a high concentration of nitrates in Trzemna water was still observed, with a statistically confirmed increasing trend. This is an effect of the negative impact of agricultural diffuse pollution. Modernisation of a WWTP and wastewater effluent diversion positively affected the quality of Trzemna water. The BA and BACI analyses in relation to statistical tests applied in hydrology can be successfully used to evaluate the impact of changes in the environment on water quality. In the case of BA design it was possible to analyse 12 parameters, whereas in BACI analysis it was only half of them. However, this method is recognised as more reliable and eliminates the impact of natural temporary variations.

The current study aims to investigate the water quality and fish diversity at Rasul Barrage in the Jhelum River. A total of six sampling sites were assessed for pollution levels and fish fauna of the Barrage. Physicochemical parameters such as turbidity, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were deviating from the permissible limits of fresh water set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but meeting the criteria of NEQS, whereas pH, temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), sodium, and chloride were below the permissible limits of NEQS, but the TSS level was above EPA standards. However, the concentrations of metals such as iron (2.62-3.98 mg L-1), chromium (0.03-0.59 mg L-1), and nickel (0.49-1.71 mg L-1) were higher than the permissible limits for drinking and irrigation waters. hi addition, a total of 35 fish species belonging to eight families were identified. Survey and result of study showed that concentrations of pollutants and non-stop fishing activities of commercial fish are the main reasons for the reduction of fish fauna. Two exotic fish species, Oreochromismossambicus and Ctenopharyngodon idella, were found to be abundant where population of native fish fauna numbers were being reduced. We concluded that the surface water quality is poor, as is evident from the higher concentrations of BOD, COD, and metals. Urgent measures are required to prevent such contamination and regular monitoring of water quality in the study area.

Contents of heavy metals (Sb, As, Cd, Pb, Zn) in both water and sediments were detected via atomic absorption spectrophotometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry, respectively. The variation coefficient (C.V) of each heavy metal as well as the partition coefficient (Kd) between surficial sediments and water was calculated. The ecological risks of heavy metals in collapsed lakes were assessed via geoaccumulation index (I-geo), and we estimated the Pearson correlation coefficients between heavy metals. Together with the real situations around collapsed lakes, we resolved the sources of heavy metals. We found that the contents of heavy metals in water were basically below Surface Water Quality Standard I. The contents of heavy metals in the majority of sediment samples exceeded the background levels in the Yangtze River and Huai River areas, but were below the threshold effect concentration. The spatial distributions of heavy metals in surficial sediments were not uniform, as the C.V.s indicate medium variations. Analysis of Partition coefficient showed that Lieshan collapsed lake (LSH) was under severe risk. An analysis of I-geo revealed gentle-medium ecological risks from Sb, As, and Cd. The classification and frequency distributions of I-geo of five heavy metals indicate that the ecological risk of Cd was the largest. The ecological risk was lowest in Yangzhuang collapsed lake (YZH). These results were confirmed by analysis of C.V and Kd. Analysis of heavy metal sources showed that the inputs of Sb and As into the three collapsed lakes were human-driven and very complex, probably due to point-source pollution, including leaching from gangue piles and industrial discharge. Cd mainly originated from non-point-source agricultural pollution, while Pb and Zn might mainly originate from natural sources.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	1					181	188		10.15244/pjoes/64379								WOS:000394830000020

Determining Multivariate Analysis Sampling Frequency for Monitoring Contamination Caused by Trout Farms	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												Recent rapid growth of the aquaculture industry and the necessity to comply with environmental standards suggest the need for studies on the possible negative effects of this type of industry. One of the most devastating effects of aquaculture is water pollution caused by the discharge of untreated effluent from fish farms into aquatic ecosystems. Assessment of the pollutants requires an optimal design of a water monitoring network in a way to demonstrate changes in aquatic environments. Accordingly, the present study used multivariate statistical analysis to determine sampling frequency for optimal monitoring of the contaminants resulting from trout farms in the Haraz River in northern Iran. For this purpose, a total number of 17 physical and chemical water quality parameters were sampled monthly over a one-year period based on the instructions recommended in the standard method (2005) [1]. The results showed that changes in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) during the warm months of summer were very high and reached its peak in August and September. This may be attributed to the increased fish production in fish farms, increased food intake to feed the fish, and higher rate of discharge from fish farms containing waste feed and fish faeces. The nitrate also reached its maximum level in June due to the same reasons. Conversely, dissolved oxygen (DO) level was the lowest in the warm months (August and September). The reason would be increased consumption of DO due to higher production rate in the fish farms and increased metabolism of fish in warm months. Overall, the findings confirmed the applicability of multivariate techniques in determining temporal frequency of the measurements during the monitoring period. By which it would be possible to recognize the reality of changes in water quality, with fewer measurements, and in less time and cost.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	1					337	346		10.15244/pjoes/64377								WOS:000394830000036

NPS pollution is influenced by a multitude of site-related factors whose effects are complicated. We estimated NPS pollution with a soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model in China's Fan River watershed. A new method, boosted regression tree (BRT), was proposed to study the relationship of impact factors on NPS pollution. We analyzed the effects of elevation, land use, soil, and slope on the patterns of sediment transport, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). The results showed that R-2 values were higher than 0.76, and NSE was higher than 0.67. The SWAT model can estimate NPS pollution effectively in a study area. Although the spatial pattern of sediment and TP was quite consistent, the relationship between sediment and TN was weak. The contribution of impact factors for sediment TN and TP were different. Slope is the most important impact factor for sediment and TP load. Land use is the most important impact factor for TN load. The BRT model can reduce barriers to factor complexity and promote understanding of the NPS pollution formation mechanism. We proposed control strategies of pollution sources, and our research has proven to be useful for the explanation of impact factors in NPS pollution study, which is meaningful for NPS pollution control.																	1230-1485	2083-5906					2017	26	1					403	411		10.15244/pjoes/64381								WOS:000394830000043

PROCEEDINGS OF THE ESTONIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES												Lake Peipsi sensu lato consists of limnologically and hydrochemically different parts, Lake Peipsi sensu stricto, Lake Lammijarv, and Lake Pihkva. The eutrophic L. Peipsi s.s. and the hypertrophic Lake Pihkva were studied. The aim was to find out if the ecological state of these lake parts has improved, stabilized or deteriorated during a ten-year period, 2003-2012. For this purpose, data on loadings, in-lake nutrient concentrations, water transparency, water level, chlorophyll a concentration, as well as phyto- and zooplankton were compared for two five-year sub-periods (2003-2007 and 2008-2012). Comparison demonstrated a decline in the loading of total phosphorus (TP) from rivers on the Estonian and Russian sides as well as in its mean concentration in both lake parts. Both phytoplankton biomass and cyanobacterial biomass decreased in response to the reduced nutrient content in the lake water. The responses of zooplankton were contradictory. Changes in the occurrence of indicator species and declining mean zooplankter weight reflected a continuous eutrophication process while changes in the abundance of rotifers and the genus Daphnia indicated a subtle shift towards recovery. Our results show a modest improvement in the ecological condition of both lake parts.																	1736-6046	1736-7530					2017	66	1					18	28		10.3176/proc.2017.1.02								WOS:000396591200003

Simulation calculations were performed based on a range of climate and river flow projections for the near (2021-2050) and for the far future (2071-2100) compared to a reference period (1961-1990). Changes in mean annual water temperature in the near future range between +0.6 and +1.4 A degrees C and between +1.9 and +2.2 A degrees C in the far future (average of nine stations). Monthly mean values of the far future change in a more differentiated way by +0.4 to +1.3 A degrees C in spring and +2.7 to +3.4 A degrees C in late summer. The length of periods of high water temperature, expressed as successive days with water temperatures over 27 A degrees C, increases by a factor of four until 2100. These prolonged durations of periods with unusually high water temperatures may provoke changes in the food web and in the rates of biological processes in the Rhine.																	1436-3798	1436-378X				JAN	2017	17	1			SI		299	308		10.1007/s10113-016-1006-3								WOS:000394157300023

This study aims to evaluate the origin and the mechanisms controlling the input of ions that effect surface water quality in the sub-basin of the Rio das Cobras, Rio Grande do Norte state, Northeastern Brazil. Thirteen ponds were identified for study: three in the main river and ten in the tributaries between, thus covering the whole area and lithology of the sub-basin. The samples were collected at two different times (late dry and rainy periods) in the hydrological years 2009 and 2010, equating to total of four collection times. We analyzed the spatial and seasonal behavior of water quality in the sub-basin, using Piper diagrams, and analyzed the source of the ions using Guibbs diagram and molar ratios. With respect to ions, we found that water predominate in 82% sodium and 76% bicarbonate water (cations and anions, respectively). The main salinity control mechanism was related to the interaction of the colloidal particles (minerals and organic sediment) with the ions dissolved in water. Based on the analysis of nitrates and nitrites there was no evidence of contamination from anthropogenic sources.																	0100-316X	1983-2125				JAN-MAR	2017	30	1					181	189		10.1590/1983-21252017v30n120rc								WOS:000394168900020

For self-purification identification the aerobic mineralization degree, biological deputation factor and TN/TP ratio were used. The trophic stage of Snagov Lake in the range and in all the points of sampling is eutrophic-hipereutrophic for all the parameters used for assessment, excepting several short periods of time (fall of 2010, spring and fall of 2011) when the lake was in mesotrophic state.																	0034-7752					JAN	2017	68	1					60	64										WOS:000395499200014

Air purification by means of precipitation is achieved by numerous highly complex mechanisms. The final products of degradation of the pollutant in the air, which are generally harmless, can be reacted with each other in the presence of water, giving rise to the final compounds with a high toxicity. Thus, exhaust, mobile sources of noxious almost identical to those specific activities in the industrial processing of oil, contain lead which is the ideal catalyst for converting SO2 to sulfuric acid in the presence of rainwater, with all the disadvantages that they create. This paper will present an experimental research oabout how rainfall water quality is influenced by the activity of the industrial processing of oil, in a chemical plant in Constanta County.

The model applies the concept that each stump can be attributed production values (economic) and environmental values (here soil protection and water quality). Individual tree stump information was incorporated directly from the production reports of harvesters and combined with high-resolution Geographical Information System data on topography and soil type to create a production submodel and a soil and water vulnerability submodel (SWM). To test the model, it was applied to a 45-ha study forest in south-central Sweden and the outcome of nine scenarios with varying bioenergy prices and environmental protection levels was examined. Combined analysis of the effects of production and environmental criteria on total dry mass of harvestable stumps at the study site showed that biomass prices had a stronger influence than environmental criteria. Conflict stumps were defined as stumps suitable for harvest based on production criteria, but unsuitable based on soil and water protection criteria. In a medium price scenario, the proportion of conflict stumps at the study site ranged from 6% to 18%, depending on protection level set.

J	Jalali, M; Jalali, M				Jalali, Mohsen; Jalali, Mahdi			Minerals control phosphorus solubility in long-term-cultivated calcareous soils	SOIL RESEARCH												Little information is available on phosphorus (P) solubility in long-term cultivated calcareous soils. Improved characterisation of P-containing minerals and soil P species in calcareous soils leads to better management of crop production, water quality and soil quality. In this study, we investigated the solubility relationships of P for 20 surface-soil samples from Hamedan, western Iran, with a wide range of physical and chemical properties. Two equilibration times (0.5 and 168h) were used to evaluate the effect of equilibration times on P activities. We observed up to 67% decrease in mean P concentration when equilibration time was increased from 0.5 to 168h. Solubility diagrams support the stability of hydroxyapatite with 0.5h equilibration and hydroxyapatite and -tricalcium phosphate with 168h equilibration. Geochemical modelling predicted that dicalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate and magnesium-P minerals would be unstable and thus would gradually dissolve and supply P in solution in these calcareous soils. The information obtained can be used to predict the behaviour of P and its availability for agricultural crops in calcareous soils.																	1838-675X	1838-6768					2017	55	2					182	190		10.1071/SR16057								WOS:000395593600008

The augmented two-reactant (2RA) model is shown to be the simplest model to accurately describe effects of rechlorination dose/timing on bulk chlorine decay, in combination with effects of initial concentration and temperature over long periods. The two-reactant (2R) and variable reaction-coefficient (VRC) models provided predictions of comparable accuracy under higher and successive rechlorination doses at constant temperature. However, the 2RA model provides a more general basis for strategy development, as the VRC model cannot describe the effect of temperature variation. The minimal data-set required for 2RA calibration was similar for all cases considered. The 2RA model is readily applied by incorporation into system modelling software such as the multi-species extension (MSX) to EPANET software.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	4					361	368		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1148180								WOS:000394665300004

Multifactorial analysis was conducted to determine the microbial and toxic metals load in drinking water of the investigated towns. The obtained results revealed that the fecal coliform bacteria (FCB), Salmonella, Shigella and Staphylococci were the highest in MAK followed by MK and GB. The toxic metals concentrations and their intake load in the study area was in the order: Cd > Pb > Cu > Zn. However, the concentrations of toxic elements were within the permissible limits set by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PAK EPA). The study area had a higher load of enteric pathogens such as the Shigella sp., fecal coliform and Staphylococci in the potable water wells. The redundancy analysis (RDA) illustrated that total viable count TVB, Cu, Staphylococci and FCB were higher in MAK, fungi and Shigella sp. in GB and the Pb concentration was higher in MK. It is concluded that water in the study area is fecally contaminated and can cause health hazards. It is recommended that there should be a proper monitoring of water quality in the area to improve the existing quality and prevent further contamination of drinking water in the study area.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	4					394	400		10.1080/1573062X.2016.1173218								WOS:000394665300008

The Impact of Shokarski Stormwater Canal on the Quality of the Bulgarian Black Sea Bathing Waters in the Area of Discharge(1)	WATER RESOURCES												The impact of Shokarski stormwater canal on the bathing waters quality of Varna Bay located in the northern Bulgarian Black Sea was investigated during 2007-2014. A total of five monitoring stations were selected: three city beaches near the area of discharge of the stormwater canal and two nearby resorts beaches. The water quality was assessed following the requirements of the old EU Bathing Water Directive (BWD) 76/160/EEC and the new BWD 2006/7/EC. The resort beaches exhibited excellent water quality through the whole period. The situation at the city beaches was worst. The "Officers Beach" situated exactly at the area of discharge of Shokarski stormwater canal exhibited concentrations of ammonium and nitrates significantly above the guide value in most of the cases,the lowest compliance with the total coliforms and faecal coliforms guide values and the highest concentrations of Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci.

Communities around the world are motivated to sustain and restore freshwater resources and are interested in processes controlling nutrient inputs. We studied the environment where streams flow into lakes, referred to as the stream-lake interface (SLI), for a channelized and unmodified stream outlet. Channelization is done to protect infrastructure or recreational beach areas. We collected hydraulic and nutrient data for surface water and shallow groundwater in two SLIs to develop conceptual models that describe characteristics that are representative of these hydrologic features. Water, heat, and solute transport models were used to evaluate hydrologic conceptualizations and estimate mean residence times of water in the sediment. A nutrient mass balance model is developed to estimate net rates of adsorption and desorption, mineralization, and nitrification along subsurface flow paths. Results indicate that SLIs are dynamic sources of nutrients to lakes and that the common practice of channelizing the stream at the SLI decreases nutrient concentrations in pore water discharging along the lakeshore. This is in contrast to the unmodified SLI that forms a barrier beach that disconnects the stream from the lake and results in higher nutrient concentrations in pore water discharging to the lake. These results are significant because nutrient delivery through pore water seepage at the lakebed from the natural SLI contributes to nearshore algal communities and produces elevated concentrations of inorganic nutrients in the benthic zone where attached algae grow.

A coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for predicting hypolimnetic oxygenation and epilimnetic mixing in a shallow eutrophic reservoir	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Artificial mixing and hypolimnetic oxygenation are two common methods for improving water quality in reservoirs. To examine the effects of their operation on the thermal structure of the water column, we used a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model coupled with a newly developed water-jet model and an existing linear bubble-plume model in conjunction with whole-reservoir in situ mixing experiments in a drinking-water reservoir. This reservoir has a side-stream supersaturation (SSS) hypolimnetic oxygenation system and a bubble-plume epilimnetic mixing (EM) system installed to reduce hypolimnetic hypoxia and algal blooms. The results show that the SSS successfully adds dissolved oxygen to the hypolimnion without destratifying the reservoir, whereas the EM, located at the lower metalimnetic boundary, deepens this boundary and partially mixes the metalimnion and epilimnion. The newly developed water-jet model coupled with the hydrodynamic model can successfully predict the variation of the thermal structure in the reservoir. The extent to which the SSS and EM systems affect the thermal structure of the reservoir is also quantified by further application of the coupled hydrodynamic model.

We developed a one-dimensional, fluid flow and solute transport model that quantifies the influence of tidal pumping on nitrate removal and applied it to the tidal freshwater zone (TFZ) of White Clay Creek (Delaware, USA). In field observations and models, both oxygenated river water and anoxic groundwater deliver nitrate to carbon-rich riverbed sediment. A zone of nitrate removal forms beneath the aerobic interval, which expands and contracts over daily timescales due to tidal pumping. At high tide when oxygen-rich river water infiltrates into the bed, denitrification rates decrease by 25% relative to low tide. In the absence of tidal pumping, our model predicts that the aerobic zone would be thinner, and denitrification rates would increase by 10%. As tidal amplitude increases toward the coast, nitrate removal rates should decrease due to enhanced oxygen exchange across the sediment-water interface, based on sensitivity analysis. Denitrification hot spots in TFZs are more likely to occur in less permeable sediment under lower tidal ranges and higher rates of ambient groundwater discharge. Our models suggest that tidal pumping is not efficient at removing surface water nitrate but can remove up to 81% of nitrate from discharging groundwater in the TFZ of White Clay Creek. Given the high population densities of coastal watersheds, the reactive riverbeds of TFZs play a critical role in mitigating new nitrogen loads to coasts.

Integrated modeling in urban hydrology: reviewing the role of monitoring technology in overcoming the issue of 'big data' requirements	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												Increasingly, the application of models in urban hydrology has undergone a shift toward integrated structures that recognize the interconnected nature of the urban landscape and both the natural and engineered water cycles. Improvements in computational processing during the past few decades have enabled the application of multiple, connected model structures that link previously disparate systems together, incorporating feedbacks and connections. Many applications of integrated models look to assess the impacts of environmental change on physical dynamics and quality of landscapes. Whilst these integrated structures provide a more robust representation of natural dynamics, they often place considerable data requirements on the user, whereby data are required at contrasting spatial and temporal scales which can often transcend multiple disciplines. Concomitantly, our ability to observe complex, natural phenomena at contrasting scales has improved considerably with the advent of increasingly novel monitoring technologies. This has provided a pathway for reducing model uncertainty and improving our confidence in modeled outputs by implementing suitable monitoring regimes. This commentary assesses how component models of an exemplar integrated model have advanced over the past few decades, with a critical focus on the role of monitoring technologies that have enabled better identification of the key physical process. This reduces the uncertainty of processes at contrasting spatial and temporal scales, through a better characterization of feedbacks which then enhances the utility of integrated model applications.

PILOT-SCALE DENITRIFICATION BIOREACTORS FOR REPLICATED FIELD RESEARCH	APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE												Carbon-based denitrification bioreactors are designed to intercept tile drainage and are a promising technology for reducing NO3- export to surface water. While these systems have been tested extensively in the laboratory, the ability to study in-field bioreactors under controlled conditions with statistical replicates has been limited. Nine pilot-scale bioreactors (5.79 x 1.05 x 1.07 m) were designed and installed for systematic field testing, allowing for variation in retention time, fill material, and influent water quality parameters. Each bioreactor is constructed from a concrete trench in-line with influent flow control, dosing port, flow diffusion, and effluent water level control. Sampling ports are installed at two points in each bioreactor for access to water samples or fill materials. A potassium bromide (KBr) tracer study was conducted and Morrill Dispersion Index (MDI) values averaged 2.8 +/- 0.3, indicating plug flow characteristics. The average tracer residence time (t) was 2.3 +/- 0.3 h, in close agreement with the estimated hydraulic retention time (HRT) value of 2.1 +/- 0.3 h, which was calculated using a porosity value of 0.70. Hydraulic efficiency was good (lambda = 0.78 +/- 0.03) and there was no evidence of short circuiting (S = 0.73 +/- 0.03). This system is expected to provide useful insight regarding design for improved field performance of denitrification bioreactors.

These pharmaceutical (biologically active) compounds were not fully metabolized by the body and excreted out in wastewater. This micro-pollutant remains unchanged during wastewater treatment plant operation and enters into the receiving environment via the discharge of treated water. Persistence of pharmaceutical compounds in both surface and ground waters becomes a major concern due to their potential eco-toxicity. Pharmaceuticals (emerging micropollutants) deteriorate the water quality and impart a toxic effect on living organisms. Therefore, from last two decades, plenty of studies were conducted on the occurrence, impact, and removal of pharmaceutical residues from the environment. This review provides an overview on the fate and removal of pharmaceutical compounds via biological treatment process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Annual precipitation regulates spatial and temporal drivers of lake water clarity	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Understanding how and why lakes vary and respond to different drivers through time and space is needed to understand, predict, and manage freshwater quality in an era of rapidly changing land use and climate. Water clarity regulates many characteristics of aquatic ecosystems and is responsive to watershed features, making it a sentinel of environmental change. However, whether precipitation alters the relative importance of features that influence lake water clarity or the spatial scales at which they operate is unknown. We used a data set of thousands of northern temperate lakes and asked (1) How does water clarity differ between a very wet vs. dry year? (2) Does the relative importance of different watershed features, or the spatial extent at which they are measured, vary between wet and dry years? (3)What lake and watershed characteristics regulate long-term water clarity trends? Among lakes, water clarity was reduced and less variable in the wet year than in the dry year; furthermore, water clarity was reduced much more in high-clarity lakes during the wet year than in low-clarity lakes. Climate, land use/land cover, and lake morphometry explained most variance in clarity among lakes in both years, but the spatial scales at which some features were important differed between the dry and wet years. Watershed percent agriculture was most important in the dry year, whereas riparian zone percent agriculture (around each lake and upstream features) was most important in the wet year. Between 1991 and 2012, water clarity declined in 23% of lakes and increased in only 6% of lakes. Conductance influenced the direction of temporal trend (clarity declined in lakes with low conductance), whereas the proportion of watershed wetlands, catchment-to-lake-area ratio, and lake maximum depth interacted with antecedent precipitation. Many predictors of water clarity, such as lake depth and landscape position, are features that cannot be readily managed. Given trends of increasing precipitation, eliminating riparian zone agriculture or keeping it <10% of area may be an effective option to maintain or improve water clarity.

Agents of change and temporal nutrient dynamics in the Altamaha River Watershed	ECOSPHERE												Nutrient and carbon dynamics in river ecosystems are shifting, and climate change is likely a driving factor; however, some previous studies indicate anthropogenic modification of natural resources may supersede the effects of climate. To understand temporal changes in river ecosystems, consideration of how these agents act independently and collectively to affect watershed biogeochemistry is necessary. Through the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long-Term Ecological Research Project, we assessed nutrient (phosphorus, nitrogen, silicate) and carbon dynamics, with specific regard to import and export, in the Altamaha River Basin from 2000 to 2012. This is the first study in the region to document the biogeochemical patterns in the Altamaha's four main tributaries, the Little Ocmulgee, Ocmulgee, Oconee, and Ohoopee rivers, and the relationships between biogeochemistry and historical precipitation and discharge patterns as well as agricultural and population census data. As discharge patterns are a primary driver of nutrient loads, we determined that water use was a dominant factor in the shifting ecosystem dynamics. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen loads were primarily driven by population density and dissolved inorganic phosphorus loads were strongly influenced by livestock biomass. Taken together, we conclude that both the transportation and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients within the Altamaha River Watershed were highly impacted by anthropogenic influences, which were then further exacerbated by continued climate change. Furthermore, the N- and P-loads in the Altamaha River and tributaries were dominated by dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved organic phosphorus, emphasizing a need to further study the bioavailability of these species and the mechanisms driving their potential ecological impacts.																	2150-8925					JAN	2017	8	1							e01519	10.1002/ecs2.1519								WOS:000396526300013						
J	Sutjiningsih, D				Sutjiningsih, Dwita			WATER QUALITY INDEX FOR DETERMINING THE DEVELOPMENT THRESHOLD OF URBANIZED CATCHMENT AREA IN INDONESIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY												The findings of numerous studies on the responses of stream quality indicators to different levels of watershed development have been integrated into an impervious cover model. The focus on one development stressor, namely the impervious cover, allows the decision makers to use the impervious cover model as a watershed planning tool to forecast stream response. In evaluating stream quality, the studies used various indicators such as pollutant loads, habitat quality, aquatic species diversity and abundance, and others. This study aims to test the applicability of the impervious cover model as a tool to set the threshold of catchment area development based on the targeted water quality index. The model is represented by a linear relationship between the water quality index as a response variable and catchment area imperviousness as an explanatory variable. The study area is an urbanized catchment area of a cascade-pond system located at the campus of Universitas Indonesia, Depok, West Java. Estimation of catchment area imperviousness is based on digital globe imagery and digitized based on identified rooftops. The water quality data to compute the water quality indices are collected from previous studies and related reports. The targeted water quality index is determined based on water use suitability referring to the Indonesian government regulation number 82/2001. Based on the available data, an increasing tendency of temporal variation of catchment area imperviousness for each pond can be recognized, while water quality index of each pond tends to decrease over time. In accordance with land cover distribution, spatial tendency indicates that imperviousness is decreasing in downstream direction, while water quality index is increasing in downstream direction, in line with the characteristics of cascade ponds. The results demonstrate that despite the fact that the available data are very limited, it is possible to use the linear relationship between catchment area imperviousness and water quality index as a tool to set the threshold for future development on the catchment area of the cascadepond system at the campus of Universitas Indonesia with a minimum water quality index suitable just for recreation activities.																	2086-9614	2087-2100					2017	8	1					145	159		10.14716/ijtech.v8i1.3971								WOS:000396653100016

Even though many physicochemical parameters are available for monitoring the water quality, the knowledge of domain experts are expected to analyze these parameters to find the final decision about the quality of water. In order to utilize the knowledge of the domain experts for water quality artificially, we have developed a functional tangent decision tree algorithm which, predict the water quality of the ponds based on the physiochemical parameters. The proposed method of predicting the water quality consists of three important steps such as, uncertainty handling, feature selection using reduct and core analysis, classification using the functional tangent decision tree. The proposed functional tangent decision tree is constructed by utilizing a new function called functional tangent entropy for the selection of attributes and split points. Then, the proposed work is experimented with the real database and compared with the existing classifiers to prove its better performance.

Atmospheric correction is particularly challenging over inhomogeneous water bodies surrounded by comparatively bright land surface. We present results of AisaFENIX airborne hyperspectral imagery collected over a small inland water body under changing cloud cover, presenting challenging but common conditions for atmospheric correction. This is the first evaluation of the performance of the FENIX sensor over water bodies. ATCOR4, which is not specifically designed for atmospheric correction over water and does not make any assumptions on water type, was used to obtain atmospherically corrected reflectance values, which were compared to in situ water-leaving reflectance collected at six stations. Three different atmospheric correction strategies in ATCOR4 was tested. The strategy using fully image-derived and spatially varying atmospheric parameters produced a reflectance accuracy of +/- 0.002, i.e., a difference of less than 15% compared to the in situ reference reflectance. Amplitude and shape of the remotely sensed reflectance spectra were in general accordance with the in situ data. The spectral angle was better than 4.1 degrees for the best cases, in the spectral range of 450-750 nm. The retrieval of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration using a popular semi-analytical band ratio algorithm for turbid inland waters gave an accuracy of similar to 16% or 4.4 mg/m(3) compared to retrieval of Chl-a from reflectance measured in situ. Using fixed ATCOR4 processing parameters for whole images improved Chl-a retrieval results from similar to 6 mg/m(3) difference to reference to approximately 2 mg/m(3). We conclude that the AisaFENIX sensor, in combination with ATCOR4 in image-driven parametrization, can be successfully used for inland water quality observations. This implies that the need for in situ reference measurements is not as strict as has been assumed and a high degree of automation in processing is possible.

Coagulation efficiency of Dicerocaryum eriocarpum (DE) plant	WATER SA												A study was conducted to investigate coagulation efficiency of the plant Dicerocaryum eriocarpum (DE) in the removal of turbidity from raw water. Widespread poor land use practices contribute to high turbidity in river water, making turbidity management or removal critical, particularly before the water is used for drinking or subjected to chemical treatment. In this study, mucilage from DE was extracted with deionized water and different chloride solutions. A coagulation efficiency of 99% using modified mucilage coagulant was achieved. The modified mucilage of potassium crude extract and sodium crude extract displayed higher coagulation efficiencies than unmodified mucilage of deionized water crude extract. An increase in coagulant dosage and initial turbidity influenced the coagulation efficiency of DE coagulant. A large reduction in turbidity levels of the treated water samples resulted in an improvement in water quality.

Impact of temporary desiccation on the mobility of nutrients and metals from sediments of Loskop Reservoir, Olifants River	WATER SA												South Africa is prone to droughts and is heavily dependent on stored water resources. Few studies in South Africa have investigated the impact of drought on water quality when rainfall resumes and reservoir sediments are rewet. Other research has shown that several negative impacts may occur with rewetting, including eutrophication, and acidification with increased metal solubility. In this study, the impact of drying and rewetting sediments on the mobility of nutrients and metals is explored using sediments from Loskop Reservoir. Rarely exposed sediments were collected from three sites, dried at 35 degrees C for 36 days, and then rewet under aerobic conditions. Filtered water samples were collected on Days 1, 2,4, 7, 11 and 16 following rewetting, and analysed for NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, total N, total P, PO43-, dissolved Al, Fe, Mn, and SO42-. Results were expressed as mass/m(2), and were compared to reference (non-drought) treatments that were maintained under saturated conditions. Acute toxicity tests were performed using Daphnia magna to establish if toxic effects were associated with changes in water quality following sediment rewetting. Following rewetting, elevated SO42-indicated the mobilisation of acid from sulfide oxidation, with an associated reduction in pH. Nitrification was evident as high quantities of organic N and NH4+ were initially released, followed by increases in NO2-+ NO3-. Total P increased, but PO43-reduced. This was attributed to complexes formed between PO43-and Fe (FePO4) and Al (AlPO4). Amounts of Fe and Al released were lower following rewetting due to the formation of relatively immobile (hydr) oxides. In contrast, Mn increased substantially reaching maximum values > 2 300 mg/m(2) (14 000 mu g/L). There were no acute toxic effects observed to D. magna. This study highlights the potential for acidification, mobilisation of nutrients, SO42-, and Mn following rewetting of reservoir sediments under aerobic conditions. This information may be incorporated into reservoir and catchment management plans in the form of revised water quality guidelines and a better ability to predict how drought impacts water quality in our stored water resources.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2017	43	1					7	16		10.4314/wsa.v43i1.02								WOS:000396502100002

Circulation induced by diffused aeration in a shallow lake	WATER SA												Field surveys were carried out to investigate the surface jet flows and the resulting circulation patterns generated by diffused aeration in a shallow lake. In conrast to previous studies, the experimental conditions included point-source bubble plumes with very high air flow rates (100-400 L/min) relative to the shallow water depth (1.5 m). The results indicate that the surface jet velocity can be described by linear profiles. The decay of this velocity with distance displayed a similar behaviour to that reported in the literature, but the surface jet spread much faster under the present conditions. Combining our results with published data allowed for the generation of dimensionless correlations for the velocity and depth of the surface jet. A good agreement between the total circulation flow rates predicted by using the proposed correlations and integral modelling was also obtained. Lastly, a simple returning flow model was proposed to describe the circulation flow patterns induced by the bubble plumes. The results were also applied to assess the impact of circulation on vertical algae migration, which is important for water quality management.

Effects of land use change on streamflow and stream water quality of a coastal catchment	WATER SA												This study aimed to link land cover/use change to water quality in an important water supply coastal catchment. The approach followed a spatial and temporal analysis of historical catchment land use change to assess how changes influenced water quality and river flow in the Touws and Duiwe Rivers, southwestern Cape, South Africa. Each sub-catchment has unique characteristics which influence land use and water quality and the purpose was to analyse each one separately. Historical water quality and flow analysis were based on the records available (Duiwe River: 1998-2013; Touws River: 1980-2013) together with rainfall data. Records were analysed to detect trends over time, which were linked to changes in land use activities. Agriculture intensified rapidly in the Duiwe River catchment with most arable land cultivated by 1960 and water storage as farm dams escalating. Concentrations of nutrients and electrical conductivity were higher in the Duiwe River than in the more natural Touws River, and were positively correlated to river flows. Mean values for total nitrogen and electrical conductivity were 0.03 mg/L and 16.7 mg/L, respectively, in the Touws River and 0.25 mg/L and 127 mg/L, respectively, in the Duiwe River. Nutrient concentrations decreased in the Duiwe River after 2006 as fertilizer applications to pastures were reduced. The South African Target Water Quality Ranges were exceeded at times and in the Touws catchment this appears to have been due to extensive fires. For instance, sodium concentrations reached a maximum of 1 874.5 mg/L in 1996 compared to a usual average concentration of 20.8 mg/L where the guidelines are between 0 and100 mg/L. The link between land cover/use and water quality was demonstrated and when spatial heterogeneity of the catchments was altered by human or natural events, this was reflected in changes in the water quality.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2017	43	1					139	152		10.4314/wsa.v43i1.16								WOS:000396502100016

Phosphorus cycling in urban aquatic ecosystems: connecting biological processes and water chemistry to sediment P fractions in urban stormwater management ponds	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Phosphorus (P) dynamics in urban landscapes may differ from that in natural landscapes due to different P sources and unique environmental conditions. However, many aspects of P cycles in urban areas, especially within engineered aquatic ecosystems, remain largely unknown. Through this work, we aim to contribute to better understanding of P cycling in urban aquatic ecosystems by investigating P fractions in sediment and their relationship with ambient chemistry in surface water from six urban stormwater management ponds located in Ontario, Canada. We found that organic P contributed up to 75% of total P in pond sediment, but this percentage decreased significantly between our two sampling events in June and September 2012. This decrease coincided with increased rates of extracellular enzyme (especially phosphatase) activities, which is indicative of fast mineralization processes in these ecosystems. Moreover, the decreased sediment organic P was matched by increased water column P concentration. This inverse relationship suggests that the large organic P pool in pond sediment, and its fast decomposition, contributed to internal release of P from sediment and increased water column P concentrations. The dominance of organic P in sediment and the putative role of relevant biological processes (i.e., decomposition and productivity) in urban ponds found in this study strongly contrast with classic water management expectations of physicochemically controlled P dynamics and long-term P storage in sediment of aquatic ecosystems. This difference suggests that urban stormwater ponds may perform poorly in terms of P retention and thereby contribute to poor water quality in terms of P pollution to downstream urban watersheds. Thus, stormwater pond design and future management strategies should consider these biogeochemical features of urban ponds, including internal P release, to help prevent eutrophication of downstream ecosystems.																	0168-2563	1573-515X				JAN	2017	132	1-2					203	212		10.1007/s10533-017-0293-1								WOS:000394351700012

The experimental (isocaloric, isocalcium, and isophosphoric) diets were formulated to contain 270, 300, 330, and 360g kg(-1) CP. In experiment 1, 4320 Nile tilapia (13.5 +/- 0.82g) were used to evaluate the performance and hematological parameters. The experimental design was completely randomized and the fish were distributed in 24 net pens (1.0m(3)), with four diets, six replicates, and 180 fishes per experimental unit. In experiment 2, 40 Nile tilapia (22.5 +/- 0.56g) were used to evaluate the ammonia excretion. Fish were distributed in 40 aquaria (3.0L), with one fish per aquarium (n=10). No protein reduction effect was observed in feed intake and the hematocrit and hemoglobin values. Regarding the statistic models used in the present study, difference was observed between CP values. The optimal level estimated by the quadratic equation first interception with the linear response plateau (LRP) as a response to CP changes in the diet was determined for weight gain (324.3g kg(-1)) and feed conversion (317.8g kg(-1)). After reduction in the CP levels, a linear reduction was observed in the ammonia excretion in water. Based on the ideal protein concept for Nile tilapia reared in net pens, reducing the CP levels in the diets is possible, without change in the performance and hematological parameters, and with a reduction in the levels of ammonia excretion in water, since amino acids are supplemented.

Review on river bank filtration as an in situ water treatment process	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY												Surface and ground water are valuable sources for drinking water. Certain industrial, mining, and agricultural practices pollute these critical resources. Riverbank filtration (RBF) is a cost-effective in situ water treatment process, which removes suspended solids and organic and inorganic pollutants. The RBF process is defined as a natural filter of soils and aquifer sediments at the river site. In RBF, river water moves through the pores of the natural soils of the riverbed and riverbank. RBF improves several physical, chemical, and biological properties of the river water. Several treatment actions including, filtration, sorption, and biological degradation occur during this process. Under specific conditions, RBF could be used as a treatment or pretreatment process to remove or decrease pollutants in surface water. In this paper, the effectiveness of RBF in improving the river water quality is presented. RBF as a cost-effective water treatment process is also discussed. Furthermore, factors that affect the performance of the RBF process and its overall effectiveness for developing countries are also discussed.																	1618-954X	1618-9558					2017	19	2					349	359		10.1007/s10098-016-1266-0								WOS:000394319300006

This two and half-year study covering several wet and dry seasons evaluated the impacts of small headwater dams without a base flow on downstream herbaceous dynamics. Results showed herb aerial cover and diversity below dams (new stream sources) are unique and different to original stream sources as well as to a comparable unregulated reach. The geomorphological habitats formed subsequent to damming did not show major influence on aerial cover of herbs; nevertheless, diversity showed a clear dependence. Downstream of dams were dominated by Acorus gramineus, which had >40% aerial cover, and this figure increased up to 60% within 2years (in between a major flood event). Simultaneously, downstream herb diversity decreased by 33%. However, diversity and aerial cover of the unregulated reach and original sources remained more or less the same. Herb pulling tests (simulating an uprooting mechanism during a flood) showed A.gramineus can withstand an eightfold higher force than the other herbs, especially in concrete surfaces and rock/sand pools. The estimated shear force on bed during the major flood was several folds less than the observed. This suggests downstream of dams behave opposite to the conventional understanding that large floods are considered as an agent of restoration.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				JAN	2017	10	1							e1774	10.1002/eco.1774								WOS:000393870100014

Macroinvertebrate responses to flow and stream temperature variability across regulated and non-regulated rivers	ECOHYDROLOGY												Flow regulation via impoundments threatens lotic ecosystems and the services they provide globally. Impoundments drastically alter flow and stream temperature variability within fluvial environments, but efforts to quantify ecohydrological and ecothermal responses to flow regulation in conjunction have been sparsely explored to date. This study examined macroinvertebrate community responses to antecedent flow (discharge) and stream temperature variability across paired regulated and non-regulated systems associated with three reservoirs located in adjacent catchments. Community abundances, functional traits, and biomonitoring indices were examined, and ecological differences between non-regulated and regulated sites were quantified, with the most sensitive faunal response being correlated against a suite of flow and thermal indices. Regulated sites exhibited reduced low-flow variability and rapid increases in discharge during peak flows that regularly exceeded those conveyed by non-regulated sites, while stream temperature variability was highly congruent between sites. Macroinvertebrate functional traits were particularly sensitive to flow regulation, and incorporating biomonitoring indices marginally improved the ecological discrimination between regulated and non-regulated sites. Unlike community abundances, functional traits did not vary spatially between catchments, highlighting that such information could guide the implementation of regional environmental flows. Macroinvertebrate communities responded significantly to various hydrological parameters, particularly those associated with the timing of extreme flows, but were less sensitive to thermal controls. Future research should explore ecological responses to antecedent hydrological and stream temperature variability associated with flow regulation to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving biotic alterations, which could guide future environmental flow methodologies.

We found that nonparametric techniques offer a better mapping from, LFDA based EEMs scores and other measurements, to Microtox (R) measurements. The final decision on Microtox (R) measurement is given using an evidence fusion mechanism. In general, the novel LFDA based graphical model can be utilized in analyzing two dimensional data.

The plant growth and removal efficiencies under saline condition were evaluated. The evaluation was based entirely on routinely collected water quality data and the physical and chemical characteristics of the plants (Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, Iris wilsonii, and Scirpus planiculmis). The principal parameters of concern in the effluent were chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). The results showed that the CWs were able to remove COD, TN, and TP from ROC. S. planiculmis was not suitable for the treatment of high-saline wastewater. The sequence of metals accumulated in CW plants was K>Ca>Na>Mg>Zn>Cu. More than 70% of metals were accumulated in the aboveground of P. australis. The CW filled with gravel and manganese ore and planted with P. australis and T. latifolia had the best performance of pollutant removal, with average removal of 49.96%, 39.45%, and 72.01% for COD, TN, and TP, respectively. The effluent water quality met the regulation in China. These results suggested that HSF CW planted with P. australis and T. latifolia can be applied for ROC pollutants removal.				黄, 翔峰/C-3039-2017	黄, 翔峰/0000-0003-4898-7951												1522-6514	1549-7879					2017	19	3					262	269		10.1080/15226514.2016.1217392								WOS:000393783500008	27712090

Online field measurement for Nonsan-2 district meter area demonstrated that intermittent replenishment from large-demand customers could disrupt the normal operation of a water distribution system by taking large quantities of water in short times when filling the tanks from distribution mains. Based on the previous results of field measurement for hydraulic and water quality parameters, statistical analysis is performed for measured data in terms of autocorrelation, power spectral density, and cross-correlation. The statistical results show that the intermittent filling interval of 6.7 h and diurnal demand pattern of 23.3 h are detected through autocorrelation analyses, the similarities of the flow-pressure and the turbidity-particle count data are confirmed as a function of frequency through power spectral density analyses, and a strong cross-correlation is observed in the flow-pressure and turbidity-particle count analyses. In addition, physicochemical results show that the intermittent refill of storage tank from large-demand customers induces abnormal flow and pressure fluctuations and results in transient-induced turbid flow mainly composed of fine particles ranging within 2-4 mu m and constituting Fe, Si, and Al.

To evaluate the effects of high seawater temperature and phosphate enrichment on reef-building crustose coralline algae, fragments of Porolithon onkodes were cultured for 1 month under laboratory conditions. The calcification rate of the coralline algae was not affected at 30 degrees C, but it decreased to the negatives at 32 degrees C in comparison to the control treatment of 27 degrees C, indicating that the temperature threshold for maintaining positive production of calcium carbonate lies between 30 and 32 degrees C. Phosphate enrichment of 1-2 mu mol L-1 did not affect the calcification rate. The net oxygen production rate was enhanced by phosphate enrichment, suggesting that the photosynthetic rate was limited by the availability of phosphate. It was concluded that moderate phosphate enrichment does not directly deteriorate algal calcification but instead ameliorates the negative effects of high seawater temperature on algal photosynthesis.

J	Watts, DB; Torbert, HA				Watts, Dexter B.; Torbert, H. Allen			Three Annual Flue Gas Desulfurization Gypsum Applications on Macronutrient and Micronutrient Losses in Runoff From Bermudagrass Fertilized With Poultry Litter	SOIL SCIENCE												Considerable amounts of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum are being produced as a by-product of generating electricity. As a result, beneficial reuse of this by-product is being sought to reduce landfilling and its associated cost. The use of this by-product as a low-cost soil amendment for suppling Ca and S to crops, improving soil structure, or reducing P loss from agricultural fields may be a viable alternative for easing the burden of disposal. In order to better understand the influence FGD gypsum has on nutrient losses in surface water runoff, rainfall simulations were conducted on an Ultisol (Luverne sandy loam; fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Typic Hapludults) in a bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon L.) hayfield typical of the US Coastal Plains region. Treatments consisted of applying 0, 2.2, 4.4, and 8.9 Mg ha(-1) FGD gypsum with 13.4 Mg ha(-1) poultry litter (PL) plus a nonfertilized check (no PL or FGD gypsum) and 8.9 Mg ha(-1) FGD gypsumonly as controls. All treatments were applied each May from 2009 to 2011. In 2011, two simulated rainfall events (similar to 89 mm h(-1)) were created to promote runoff for 60 min, one immediately after treatment application and the other 6 months later (end of growing season). The greatest nutrient losses observed were generally during the initial runoff event immediately following PL application. The addition of FGD gypsum alone generally increased Ca and S losses regardless of when the simulated runoff event occurred. Poultry litter additions increased inorganic N (NO3-N and NH4-N) and total P losses in both runoff events and K in the initial runoff event only. Adding FGD gypsum with PL decreased total P concentration losses while increasing NH4-N, Mg, and Mn, primarily in the initial runoff event. Concentrations of Al and Fe in runoff were generally minimal or below detection limits.																	0038-075X	1538-9243				JAN	2017	182	1					18	27		10.1097/SS.0000000000000189								WOS:000394371700003

When Permaculture Principles are used in the creation of water purification and harvesting systems, there can be multiple environmental and economic benefits. In the context of energy descent, it may be considered desirable to treat wastewater using minimal energy. The constructed wetland design presented here is a low-entropy system in which wastewater is harvested and transformed into lush and productive wetland, eliminating the requirement for non-renewable energy in water purification, and also maximising benefits: biodiversity, flood resilience and yield. In permaculture design, the high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous compounds in sewage are viewed as valuable nutrients, resources to be harvested by a constructed wetland ecosystem and converted into useful yield. Similarly, rainwater runoff is not viewed as a problem which can cause flooding, but as a potential resource to be harvested to provide a yield.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested three factors of vulnerability; namely, exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity were used in this study with respect to water quantity and quality. In this study, 16 water quantity indicators and 13 water quality indicators were selected to identify the vulnerability using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. Environmental and socioeconomic data were obtained from the national statistics database, and hydrological data were simulated using the calibrated Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Expert surveys and Shannon entropy method were used to determine subjective and objective weights for all indicators, individually. As a result, water quantity-vulnerable sub-basins were associated with high water use and water leakage ratios. Water quality-vulnerable sub-basins were associated with relatively high values of maximum consecutive dry days and heatwave days. The water quantity indices of both weighting methods showed relatively similar spatial distributions, while the distribution of water quality indices was distinct. These results suggest that considering different weighting methods is important for assessing the robust water resource vulnerability of sub-basins.

The turbidity in Lake Imha which is the eighth largest multipurpose dam in Korea has been the cause of major water quality problems for use as drinking water. The turbidity rose to 882 NTU, and it remained over 30 NTU continuously for 170 days during 2002, as the result of significant amounts of soil erosion from the watershed during the Asian monsoon typhoon. In this study, characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate was investigated by comparing the variation of yearly suspended sediment loads and the ratio of maximum suspended sediment loads in a single event to yearly suspended sediment load from Lake Imha watershed using the Hydrologic Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF). The model calibration is performed according to the 2009-2010 events, and simulation results characterized suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate for 2001-2010. Water sampling and flow rate measurements were performed every 4-6 h, and calibration was performed using hourly simulated sediment loads. The calibration results demonstrated good agreement with the observed data. The characteristics of suspended sediment loadings under the Asian summer monsoon climate are a high variance of the yearly suspended sediment load and a significant of amount of suspended sediment load during a single event influenced by the typhoon intensity. The maximum yearly suspended sediment load was 10 times higher than the minimum yearly value. About half of the yearly suspended sediment load was loaded with a single event under the Asian summer monsoon climate and the ratio of suspended sediment loads by a single event to total yearly loads ranged from 29% to 90%. Structural best management practices (BMPs) to trap suspended sediment in stormwater such as stormwater ponds or wetlands rely on much more storage volume or area and non-structural BMPs to minimize soil erosion by source control such as mulching or revegetation in disturbed areas, which are important BMPs, especially in the Asian summer monsoon region.																	2071-1050					JAN	2017	9	1							44	10.3390/su9010044								WOS:000394842700044

This study aims to review the technological innovations applied for landfill leachate treatment, taking into consideration the experiences obtained during the past years and the solutions which have been implemented. The review showed that both biological and physiochemical treatments are not able to achieve the requested water quality level, according to the limits established by regulations, whether applied in a single treatment or multiple treatments. In order to respect sustainable release limits to guarantee environmental protection, the construction of depuration systems and combining biological and physiochemical treatment methods is considered of the utmost importance. The review looks at possible joint applications of different treatment techniques reviewed by other studies and considers the state of the art of current research. Combined technical solutions suggested within the 2016 peer-reviewed papers are presented and discussed as a sustainable way to effectively treat landfill leachate, giving particular attention to feasible solutions for developing countries.

The common objective considered in WDSs design is providing required water with the minimum construction cost. Less attention is paid to "water quality" as an objective in optimal design of WDSs. The aim of this paper is to include a water quality based objective in WDS design alongside other common objectives. For this purpose, the water quality reliability index developed based on "chlorine residual" and "water age", is used. EPANET2.0 is applied for WDS simulation and ACO (Ant-Colony-Optimization) has been used as the optimization algorithm. Head-Driven-Simulation-Method (HDSM) is also considered. The proposed model is applied to Jahrom (a city in the south of Iran) WDS. The outputs show that the proposed model would result in less construction costs in comparison to the original design and 4-10 % of construction cost can be reduced depending on the considered objectives and selected optimal solution by managers and decision makers while the resulted solutions include high water quality reliability (ranging from 93 to 99 %). Also using HDSM method for hydraulic analysis of WDS instead of DDSM can lead to solutions with less construction cost (U$10,000 in average) and acceptable water quality reliability.

J	Bhuiyan, C; Ray, PKC				Bhuiyan, Chandrashekhar; Ray, Prashant Kumar Champati			Groundwater Quality Zoning in the Perspective of Health Hazards	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Groundwater quality assessment with respect to natural chemical constituents is extremely important for checking health hazard risk. Information on spatial variation and level of anomalous concentration is crucial also for management of the available water resources. In the present study an attempt is made using geographic information systems (GIS) to identify and demarcate zones and levels of pollution. Groundwater quality zoning is carried out based on spatial analysis of groundwater quality data acquired from 51 wells of three administrative blocks of Udaipur district, Rajasthan (India). Concentrations of various natural chemical constituents of groundwater in the study area have been compared with the guidelines of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) for drinking water and irrigation water. The study has revealed that groundwater in many parts of the region is unsuitable either for drinking or for irrigation. Extreme high concentrations of hardness, fluoride, nitrate and calcium are observed in different parts of all the three administrative blocks. Mineralogy of the vadose zone and aquifer formations appear to be the chief controller of the groundwater quality. However, land-use/land-cover and agricultural practices such as use of fertilisers and pesticides may also have significant influence on the groundwater quality. Forest residue and solid waste may also influence the water quality of the wells located in the forest.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				JAN	2017	31	1					251	267		10.1007/s11269-016-1522-4								WOS:000393777100017						
J	Mohammed, R; Scholz, M				Mohammed, Ruqayah; Scholz, Miklas			Impact of Evapotranspiration Formulations at Various Elevations on the Reconnaissance Drought Index	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Numerous drought indices with various intricacy have been utilised in several climatic regions. Presently, the reconnaissance drought index (RDI), which is considered as a powerful index of meteorological drought, is acquisitioning approval primarily in semi-arid and arid climatologic areas. Because RDI is based on precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET), it assesses the ET estimation effects on the characterisation of drought severity computed by RDI. The current study sheds light on the impact of the ET methods, and the elevation and climate conditions on the RDI annual results, (particularly, the alpha form of the index (RDI alpha 12)), using three of the most widespread experimental ET estimates with low data requirements. These techniques are known as Thornthwaite, Hargreaves, and Blaney-Criddle, and are utilised in addition to the Food and Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith reference technique. Data from 24 stations for the period from 1979 to 2014 cover different elevations and climatic conditions. No significant (P > 0.05) impacts on both the standardised (RDIst) and normalised (RDIn) forms of the RDI were detected by applying the considered ET methods at various elevations for various climatic conditions. However, the RDI alpha 12 is directly influenced with a significant (P < 0.05) deviation that has been observed by various ET methods at different elevations and climate conditions. Accordingly, consideration should be paid to the ET estimation methodologies, in particular at high elevations. The use of various approaches may lead to flaws in availability of water resources and water quality forecasts.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				JAN	2017	31	1					531	548		10.1007/s11269-016-1546-9								WOS:000393777100033

A generic marginal value function for natural areas	ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE												We conduct a CV and a CE experiment using a generic rather than a situation-specific study design in order to obtain a generic marginal value function for different types of natural areas with different characteristics in the Netherlands. We develop a modelling approach in which we use CV and CE choice data in one model. The value function obtained shows that people attach value to the presence of natural areas, and that these values vary due to differences in the magnitude of areas, in distance to areas, and differences in accessibility and fragmentation of natural areas. We discuss how the value function can be used to incorporate potential substitution between natural areas. We also show that for approximately one-fifth of our sample there is no added value having any kind of natural area nearby and that people living in small municipalities tend to be indifferent between accessible and inaccessible areas. Our approach produces a generic marginal value function, which may be used to inform cost-benefit analyses and land use planning decisions that wish to incorporate positive and negative welfare externalities related to changes in the provision of natural areas. However, we also show that applying this value function to the regional or local scale may produce biased value estimates.

This population density, combined with poor wastewater management, results in aquatic ecosystems receiving a large volume of wastewater which may promote methane (CH4) emission. We measured water quality and CH4 emission from 11 aquatic ecosystems in Mexico City during 1 year, including reservoirs, rivers, lakes, canals and chinampas (system of floating garden on shallow lakes). The total CH4 emission from aquatic ecosystems was estimated as 3679 Mg CH4 year(-1), which represents 3.5 % of the annual CH4 emission of Mexico City. The main contributors are chinampas (33 %), followed by lakes (27 %), reservoirs (19 %), rivers (12 %) and canals (9 %). Water quality indicators were positively correlated with CH4 emission, therefore a decrease in untreated wastewater discharge may result in a significant reduction of the greenhouse gas footprint of Mexico City, after a transitional period during which the organic content of the sediment would be degraded.

J	Tiwari, AK; Singh, AK; Mahato, MK				Tiwari, Ashwani Kumar; Singh, Abhay Kumar; Mahato, Mukesh Kumar			GIS based evaluation of fluoride contamination and assessment of fluoride exposure dose in groundwater of a district in Uttar Pradesh, India	HUMAN AND ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT												Groundwater is the main source of drinking water in both rural and urban areas of the Pratapgarh district in the eastern Uttar Pradesh. Fifty-five groundwater samples were collected from 17 blocks of the Pratapgarh district and analyzed for fluoride (F-) and other water quality parameters (pH, EC, TDS, turbidity, Cl-, HCO3-, SO42-, NO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, silica and total hardness) to assess its suitability for drinking uses. The fluoride concentration in the analyzed groundwater of the Pratapgarh district varied between 0.41 and 3.99mg/L. Fluoride concentration in about 78% of the groundwater samples exceeded the acceptable level of 1.0mg/L, while in 70% samples it exceeded the maximum permissible limit of 1.5mg/L. A geographic information system (GIS) tool was used to study the spatial variation of fluoride concentrations in the groundwater of the Pratapgarh district. Fluoride is positively correlated with pH (0.36) and HCO3- (0.22) and negatively with Ca2+ (-0.23) and Mg2+ (-0.08), suggesting dissolution of fluoride-bearing minerals with the precipitation of Ca/Mg carbonate in the alkaline environment. The maximum exposure dose to fluoride for adults in the study area was found to be 6.8times higher than the minimum risk level (MRL) of 0.05mg kg(-1) day(-1) estimated by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR).

A correlation analysis determined statistically significant positive relationship for SO4-Cu, Fe-As, and Fe-Cu. In terms of historical behaviour, no statistically significant trends were detected for precipitation or temperature. In contrast, for flow, there is an overall decreasing pattern for the entire area of study, although only in one case this trend was statistically significant. Along with the aforementioned analysis, a characterization of the flow-water quality relationships is considered for the time period analyzed. Although erratic behaviours were confirmed, a negative (i.e., inverse) flow-concentration relationship was identified for SO4, a positive (i.e., direct) relationship for Fe, and undefined relationships for As and Cu were obtained. From these analyses and based on previous studies on projections regarding climate change for the Andean region, and in particular for the upper Elqui zone, an estimation of the possible effects of the change in water regimes on water quality in the area of study is developed. It is likely that a decrease in surface flow, as a consequence of climate change could translate into improvements in water quality in terms of Fe and eventually As and Cu, but into an impairment in the case of SO4. In any case, this is a complex situation that demands special attention in the face of industrial activities that could be developed in tributaries like the Claro River, which currently play an important role in depurating or diluting contaminants in the waters of the Elqui River. Finally, it should be noted that this study addresses an issue that goes beyond the local interest and could be used as a reference to compare other transitional environments containing sulphide ores or areas of hydrothermal alterations, which are considered to be highly vulnerable to climate change and variability.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				JAN	2017	31	3					498	513		10.1002/hyp.11086								WOS:000393558900001

Continuous field estimation of dissolved organic carbon concentration and biochemical oxygen demand using dual-wavelength fluorescence, turbidity and temperature	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality and quantity is not measured routinely in-situ limiting our ability to quantify DOM process dynamics. This is problematic given legislative obligations to determine event based variability; however, recent advances in field deployable optical sensing technology provide the opportunity to address this problem. In this paper, we outline a new approach for in-situ quantification of DOM quantity (Dissolved Organic Carbon: DOC) and a component of quality (Biochemical Oxygen Demand: BOD) using a multi-wavelength, through-flow fluorescence sensor. The sensor measured tryptophan-like (Peak T) and humic-like (Peak C) fluorescence, alongside water temperature and turbidity. Laboratory derived coefficients were developed to compensate for thermal quenching and turbidity interference (i.e., light attenuation and scattering). Field tests were undertaken on an urban river with ageing wastewater and stormwater infrastructure (Bourn Brook; Birmingham, UK). Sensor output was validated against laboratory determinations of DOC and BOD collected by discrete grab sampling during baseflow and stormflow conditions. Data driven regression models were then compared to laboratory correction methods. A combination of temperature and turbidity compensated Peak T and Peak C was found to be a good predictor of DOC concentration (R-2=0.92). Conversely, using temperature and turbidity correction coefficients provided low predictive power for BOD (R-2=0.46 and R-2=0.51, for Peak C and T, respectively). For this study system, turbidity appeared to be a reasonable proxy for BOD, R-2=0.86. However, a linear mixed effect model with temperature compensated Peak T and turbidity provided a robust BOD prediction (R-2=0.95). These findings indicate that with careful initial calibration, multi-wavelength fluorescence, coupled with turbidity, and temperature provides a feasible proxy for continuous, in-situ measurement of DOC concentration and BOD. This approach represents a cost effective monitoring solution, particularly when compared to UV - absorbance sensors and DOC analysers, and could be readily adopted for research and industrial applications.

The cost of irrigation sources and water treatment in greenhouse production	IRRIGATION SCIENCE												Uncertainty about the cost of water treatment is a potential barrier to adoption of irrigation treatment and recycling. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost of irrigation-water filtration and sanitation based on a survey of 11 greenhouse operations. Screen filtration of ebb-and-flood irrigation water cost ($0.02-$0.17 per 1000 gal) less than filtration using synthetic fiber rolls ($0.08-$2.97 per 1000 gal). Technologies to control pathogens and biofilm ranged between $0.07 per 1000 gal for chlorine gas to $1.00 per 1000 gal for a copper ionization system. Irrigation water sources ranged in cost from $0.02 per 1000 gal for pond water to $6.43 per 1000 gal for municipal water. Sanitation increased this cost by $0.07-$1.00, and water-soluble fertilizers added $3.80. Case studies of three growers illustrated that water quality issues such as equipment clogging or plant pathogens can increase production cost, and in many cases, water treatment and recirculation provide economic savings. Our analysis emphasizes that the cost and quality of the initial water source, the cost of production losses from quality issues, and the cost of treatment should all be considered to make informed decisions on irrigation water sources and system design.																	0342-7188	1432-1319				JAN	2017	35	1					43	54		10.1007/s00271-016-0517-5								WOS:000393636900004

In this study we examined the effects of feed composition and water quality on the population density of T. furcata over 20 days in large-scale culture. Results showed that the population density of T. furcata increased when fed a diet supplemented with yeast and corn flour (P< 0.05) and reached a greater mass compared to three other diet compositions. During culture, nitrite and phosphate concentrations in the water were positively correlated with the population density of T. furcata. The concentration levels of nitrate and ammonia nitrogen were low, and did not reveal any negative effects on the growth of T. furcata. We found that the feed formula that contained yeast and corn flour in given quantities did affect the quality of water, even in high culture densities. Yeast and corn flour could constitute promising candidates for feed supplements for T. furcata, or other copepod species in the future.																	0792-156X						2017	69																	WOS:000393911000002

Multiobjective Design of Water-Quality Monitoring Networks in River-Reservoir Systems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This study develops and tests a method for multiobjective optimization of water-quality monitoring networks in river-reservoir systems. The optimization method identifies optimal sampling locations to detect the sudden release of contaminants to a reservoir, and meets two objectives: (1) minimizing the prediction error of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) at the reservoir's outlet valve; and (2) minimizing the average time during which MTBE is detected at sampling locations. The optimization method considers 36 contaminant scenarios, corresponding to three volumes of contaminant release, three release locations, and four different seasonal release times. The MTBE pollutant chemograph was simulated at the outlet valve of the reservoir and at 16 possible sampling locations with the CE-QUAL-W2 model for each of the 36 scenarios of contaminant release. A support vector regression (SVR) tool is coupled to the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) to optimize the water-quality sampling locations. Implementation of the NSGAII-SVR method demonstrates its capacity to design water-quality monitoring networks that meet multiple objectives in a river-reservoir system.

For such purposes, the models to be used in water quality simulators must describe chlorine decay in the systems as accurately as possible, requiring a minimum number of parameters and still be sufficiently robust to predict chlorine residuals under changing operational conditions. In this paper, two second-order decay models (single reactant and two reactants) were examined for their ability to predict chlorine residuals in surface raw and treated waters at a range of initial chlorine and natural organic matter concentrations. The two reactants model is necessary for chlorine residuals prediction in raw waters. However, for treated waters it only performed marginally better than the simpler single reactant model, with half the number of parameters that needed to be estimated. In addition, correlations were observed between both models parameters for reactive natural organic matter (NOM) concentration and measured fluorescence and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic data associated with humic-like compounds. Such findings are likely to open the door for a more exact determination of the models' parameters and, thus, for improving the chlorine decay models' adequacy and accuracy.

J	Winston, RJ; Hunt, WF				Winston, R. J.; Hunt, W. F.			Characterizing Runoff from Roads: Particle Size Distributions, Nutrients, and Gross Solids	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Particulate matter, nutrients, and gross solids from roads contribute nonpoint-source pollution to waterways. To inform road runoff management, a field monitoring study was undertaken at eight road sites across North Carolina. Particle size distributions (PSD) of edge-of-pavement runoff samples were analyzed to understand the granulometry of the particulate matter. Knowledge of PSDs is critical when attempting to understand sediment fate and transport through stormwater control measures (SCMs), especially when the primary removal mechanism is particle settling. For 43 road runoff events, median particle size varied from 31 to 144 mu m. The median PSD from hot mix asphalt (HMA) was 2.6% clay, 44.8% silt, and 52.6% sand. PSD was not correlated to roadway classification or ecoregion; however, PSD was significantly correlated to the presence of a permeable friction course (PFC) overlay, which is a layer of porous asphalt placed over traditional HMA. The median d(90) for PFC (131 mu m) was significantly smaller than for HMA (428 mu m), with 11.5% less sand fraction present in the PFC runoff. Smaller particles emitted from PSD will diminish performance for downslope highway SCMs, including swales and filter strips. PFC also emitted lower median effluent total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations (9 mg/ L) than HMA (23 mg/L). Gross solids may represent a substantial portion of the total nutrient load from roads, but they are often entirely overlooked. Dry mass of leaf litter from roads in North Carolina was correlated to rainfall depth and peak rainfall intensity. Total nitrogen (TN) loads from gross solids varied from 0.2 to 0.9 kg/ ha/year, while total phosphorus (TP) loads ranged between 0.03 and 0.12 kg/ha/year, approximately one order of magnitude less than reported TN and TP nutrient loads in stormwater runoff. Given the typical fraction of TN and TP leaching into stormwater as leaves and organic matter break down, gross solids represented about 0.6% of TN and 3.6% of TP yearly nutrient loading for the evaluated highway sites, suggesting gross solids were a relatively inconsequential portion of the total nutrient load from roads.

Modeling Sediment Reduction in Grass Swales and Vegetated Filter Strips Using Particle Settling Theory	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Two of the most common and simple stormwater control measures are swales and filter strips. However, an overly simplistic one-size-fits-all design approach typically is used for these practices. To provide more flexibility in design, a coupled hydraulics and particle-settling model was created to predict swale and filter strip total suspended solids (TSS) reduction as a function of catchment area, longitudinal slope, side slope, cross section type (triangular swale, trapezoidal swale, or filter strip), and length. The hydraulics and hydrology models were based on Manning's equation and the rational method, respectively, with the underlying requirement that the water quality design storm does not exceed the height of the grass. The particle-settling model was underpinned by the Aberdeen equation. The model predicts that triangular swales produce the least and filter strips the most TSS removal because of increased hydraulic retention time; trapezoidal swales had on average 10% greater TSS removal than triangular swales with similar design characteristics. Grass filter stormwater controls performed better with decreasing slope, increasing length, smaller catchment area, and shallower side slopes. Filter strips registered the majority of their TSS reduction within the first meter of their width and were insensitive to increases in longitudinal slope. This water quality design storm-abating modeling approach could be coupled with modeling for infrequent-return-interval storms to obtain dual benefits of sediment reduction and conveyance. This water quality model may provide regulatory agencies a tool to provide variable TSS credit to swales and filter strips as a function of design.

J	Chin, DA; Jones, A				Chin, David A.; Jones, Athena			Optimal Sizing of Exfiltration Trenches	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												Optimal sizing of exfiltration trenches for both flood control and water-quality control is investigated for conventional and partially submerged trenches. An analytic formulation is presented, showing that the minimum required trench length for flood control can be determined directly from parameters that characterize the design rainfall, catchment, trench, and porous medium surrounding the trench. It is also shown that the minimum required trench length for water-quality control can be determined directly from the design water-quality depth, exfiltration time that is credited to water-quality control, and parameters that characterize the trench and catchment. Using these analytic relationships, a six-step procedure is presented for sizing trenches that simultaneously meet both flood-control and waterquality control objectives. Implementation of the design methodology is illustrated for both conventional and partially saturated trenches.

Residual soil NO3-N levels ranged from 3.4 to 31.6, 7.8 to 49.3, and 9.0 to 71.7kg ha(-1), respectively, in 0 to 15, 15 to 30, and 30 to 61cm depth increments, with cumulative NO3-N ranging from 23.5 to 114.5kg ha(-1) across sites-years. Where N fertilizer was reduced due to N crediting, yields and bushel weights at all 13 site-years showed no difference from those receiving full recommended N rates. A yield response to any level of added fertilizer N above the control was observed for only 6 of 13 site-years. These results indicate a high potential for success in crediting carryover soil NO3-N to 61cm as a means of reducing applied nitrogen fertilizer rates.																	0190-4167	1532-4087					2017	40	1					23	32		10.1080/01904167.2016.1184279								WOS:000393741300003

Multiobjective, Socioeconomic, Boundary-Emanating, Nearest Distance Algorithm for Stormwater Low-Impact BMP Selection and Placement	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Stormwater low-impact development (LID) has become an important method for the reduction of stormwater runoff emanating from impervious surfaces to local water bodies. The extra runoff from human-made impervious surfaces overloads water bodies with polluted runoff. Since many LID best management practices (BMPs) exist, and many areas have multiple subcatchments, it is important to carefully select which BMPs to place in each subcatchment and its placement in order to minimize cost, but also to give the highest chance of owner BMP maintenance. LID BMPs are often constructed on private land and maintenance can be at the owner's expense and, therefore, not guaranteed. A new algorithm, entitled multi-objective, socio-economic, boundary-emanating, nearest distance (MOSEBEND), that is easily used by practitioners is introduced and demonstrated here for a road in a community showing that the algorithm allows the selection of the set of BMPs on the various subcatchments with the lowest cost, highest runoff restoration to natural values, and highest likelihood of private-owner maintenance. The BMP selection and location starts at the downstream watershed boundary and propagates upstream, and then works in the upstream-to-downstream direction from the upstream watershed boundary. The multiple objectives addressed are cost-benefit ratio (CBR) and maintenance probability factor (MPF). The optimal solution is considered to be the one closest to the origin on a plot of CBR and MPF. It was found that the new algorithm resulted in a solution that is (1) low cost, (2) high benefit, and (3) more likely to be built and maintained than an analysis of any subset of these three objectives. The option with the highest cost-benefit-ratio is that in which LID BMPs are implemented in the upper and steeper portion of the catchment, for the watershed that the algorithm is demonstrated herein. However, that option has a less likely chance to be maintained and, therefore, is not ranked first by the MOSEBEND algorithm proposed here.

The variations in branch and loop combinatorics across large pipe network data sets are ideal for exploring graph-based structural patterns and linkages with engineered performance. To facilitate this exploration, a library of 10,001 lattice-like pipe networks is developed. Each network is equipped with hydraulic, water quality, and diurnal demand information for extended period simulations. Results show strong correlations exist among graph theory metrics (e.g., geodesic, spectral, and combinatorics-based) and performance measures (e.g., maximum hourly unit headloss, average water age, and average chemical concentration). These trends are extended with performance predictions using parametric and semiparametric statistical models. Predictive accuracies are evident for processes that follow diffusion-like behaviors, indicating coupled applications of graph theory and statistical methods may have strong abilities to characterize WDSs at lower computational and analytical costs. Evidence also reveals features from percolation theory, with sharp phase transitions in WDS performance at certain probabilistic thresholds of pipe network connectivity. This may support future probabilistic studies on WDS performance with percolation-like transitions.

This research investigated the role of land use change and its effect on soil degradation in cultivated, pasture, and urban lands, when compared with native forest in terms of declining of soil quality and fertility. Multivariate statistical methods including principal component analysis and cluster analysis were employed to determine the relative magnitude of anthropogenic and natural influences on soil quality. Partial least squares (PLS), principal component regression, and ordinary least squares regression were used to predict soil cation exchange capacity using soil characteristics. Principal component analysis identified five primary components of soil quality. PC1 explained 4101% of the total variance, PC2 accounted for 1529%, and PC3 accounted for 113%. PC4 and PC5 accounted for 737% and 419% of the total variance, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed that the lowest soil quality occurred in urban soils. An exponential semivariogram using PLS predictions revealed stronger spatial dependence among cation exchange capacity [r(2)=080, root mean square error (RMSE)=199] than the other methods, principal component regression [r(2)=084, RMSE=245] and ordinary least squares [r(2)=084, RMSE=245]. Therefore, the PLS method provided the best model for the data. In stepwise regression analysis, mean weight diameter and labile carbon were selected as influential variables in all soils. This study quantified reductions in numerous soil quality parameters resulting from extensive land-use changes and urbanization in the Ziarat watershed in northern Iran.

To evaluate such impacts, international laws require undertaking local studies based on direct sampling to establish baseline conditions of parameters modified by human activities. Mining takes place near the Alto Tajo Natural Park, where a suspended sediment concentration (SSC) baseline is required to determine whether mining affects water quality. To this end, we have monitored the Tajo River and its tributary the Tajuelo following Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) techniques, recommended by Australian and New Zealand laws, requiring a specific method based on continuous monitoring and sampling to enable evaluation of SSCs. An SSC baseline has been defined at stations situated upstream of the mining area and compared with those downstream. The highest detected SSC upstream of the Tajuelo mines was 24gl(-1) whereas the highest simultaneous downstream value was 391gl(-1), more than one order of magnitude higher than the supposed baseline (24gl(-1)). Additionally, this value is 1000 times more than the average concentration of 25mgl(-1), used by the European Union until 2015, to guarantee the quality of salmonid waters. Following a BACI approach, a statistically significant SSC impact has been identified. The mined areas are the only source that can explain this increase. This is the first instance that such an increase and baseline have been found using this method. BACI is a simple and reliable method recommended for studying degraded areas rather than an irrelevant, fixed standard as included in most international laws.

The objectives of this study were to develop paddy BMP scenarios and to evaluate their effectiveness on nutrient loads reduction using long-term model simulation. Totally five BMP scenarios were developed based on the three paddy farming factors of drainage outlet height, fertilizer type, and application amount and were compared with conventional practices. CREAMS-PADDY model was chosen for the paddy nutrient simulation, and two-year field experimental data were used for the model calibration and validation. The validated model was used to evaluate the developed BMP scenarios for the 46 years of simulation period. The observed nutrient loads were 15.2 and 1.45 kg/ha for nitrogen and phosphorus, respectively, and mainly occurred by early season drainage and rainfall runoff in summer. The long-term simulation showed that the soil test-based fertilization and drainage outlet raising practice were the two most effective methods in nutrient loads reduction. The combination of these two resulted in the greatest loads reduction by 29 and 37 % for T-N and T-P, respectively (p value < 0.001). Overall the effectiveness of the BMP scenarios was decreased in the wet season. As the conclusion, outlet height control and soil nutrient-based fertilization were suggested as the effective practices in paddy loads reduction and their combination can be a practicable BMP scenario for the paddy nutrient management.																	1611-2490	1611-2504				JAN	2017	15	1					59	69		10.1007/s10333-016-0528-0								WOS:000393961600006

Minimizing environmental and health issues related to nitrogen (N) losses through subsurface drainage systems provides suitable condition for sustainable agriculture in these fields. A field study was conducted to evaluate nitrogen loss and its health risk in the conventional and subsurface-drained paddy fields. Ammonium, nitrate, and total N concentrations of subsurface drainage effluents, surface runoff, and leachates were monitored during three successive rice-canola-rice growing seasons from July 2011 to August 2012. Different components of N balance and health risk of nitrate leaching to groundwater were also investigated. Ammonium in drainage effluents collected during the experimental period ranged from approximately zero to 1.72 mg L-1, while nitrate fluctuated from 0.5 to 28.6 mg L-1. Average nitrate concentration in leachates of subsurface-drained area was 7.7-81.4 % higher than that in subsurface drainage effluents, while it was 126.8 % higher than that in surface runoff for the conventional field. Subsurface drainage provided a better utilization of soil N through providing winter cropping and reduced the potential for non-carcinogenic risks of nitrate leaching to groundwater. The results are encouraging for producers engaged in rice-canola production in the study area with respect to the environment and human health quality.

The Impacts of Natural Flood Management Approaches on In-Channel Sediment Quality	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Natural Flood Management (NFM) techniques aim to reduce downstream flooding by storing and slowing the flow of stormwater to river channels. These techniques include a range of measures, including setback stormwater outfalls and the physical restoration of channels and floodplains, to improve the natural functioning of catchments. An additional benefit of NFM measures is the potential reduction in sediment and pollutant delivery to the channel. Urban development releases a variety of heavy metal and nutrient pollutants that enter rivers through stormwater outfalls with adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystem. In this study, the influence of channel modification and quality of the river habitat on the sediment quality surrounding stormwater outfalls was assessed. Sediment samples were taken at several outfalls within the Johnson Creek catchment, Oregon, USA, and analysed for a variety of urban pollutants. The level of river habitat quality and modification at each site were assessed using a semi-quantitative scoring methodology. Significant increases in pollutant levels were observed at outfalls, with a greater and more variable increase at direct compared to setback outfalls. Removal efficiency of certain pollutants was found to be significantly correlated to the level of habitat quality or modification (for Fe, Ba, Sn, Mg, P, K) indicating that more natural reaches had greater potential for pollutant removal. The findings highlight the multiple benefits associated with NFM and river restoration approaches in relation to sediment quality and pollutant content.

Water Quality Changes Shortly After Low-Head Dam Removal Examined With Cultural and Microbial Source Tracking Methods	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Short-term effects of low head dam removal on water quality of urbanized stream were evaluated, focusing on fecal pollution indicators. Composite river samples were analyzed for Escherichia coli concentrations, nitrates, phosphates, turbidity and human-specific marker (HF183) and antibiotic resistance marker (tetQ) before and after dam removal during dry weather conditions. The sampled Olentangy River water in summer before the dam removal showed poor water quality with mean E. coli concentration of 439 colony forming unit (CFU)/100mL, mean turbidity of 10 NTU and mean nutrient concentrations of 0.61 and 0.41mg/L for nitrate and phosphate, respectively. Surprisingly, even one month after the dam removal, E. coli numbers doubled and nitrate concentration tripled compared to pre-removal concentrations. Although the detected HF183 concentrations were below the quantifiable levels, they did not correlate with E. coli concentrations, suggesting E. coli from other than human fecal origin. The correlation between turbidity and E. coli during dry weather further suggests E. coli accumulation in impoundment sediments and release once dam was removed. These short-term effects of dam removal on water quality should be further evaluated, especially if recreation and other beneficial uses of water in the area are expected.

Effect of Thermal Stratification on Phytoplankton and Nutrient Dynamics in a Regulated River (Saar, Germany)	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The weir pool Serrig is the deepest one along the impounded river Saar. Damming caused massive changes in the river's hydrodynamics. We analyzed the spatio-temporal variability of thermal density stratification in the weir pool and its effect on phytoplankton and nutrient dynamics. In the analysis, continuous measurements from the years 2014 and 2015 were combined with three two-day sampling campaigns in spring 2015. Thermal stratification occurred regularly in the downstream section of the weir pool during spring and summer and showed a diurnal rhythm. Temperature differences >1K between the 1 and 2m water layer were observed during 34 out of 217days (16%) in 2014, with maximum temperature gradients up to 3.71K. Whereas the influence of thermal stratification on phytoplankton biomass and distribution was low during the algal bloom in early spring, stratification events between May and July promoted temporary algal blooms in the surface layer with chlorophyll a concentrations up to 98 mu g Chla l(-1) and a maximum difference between the 1 and 2m water layer of 36 mu g Chla l(-1). Some of the stratification events resulted in reduced concentrations of dissolved nutrients in the surface layer as a result of increased uptake by algae, with maximum gradients between the surface and the 8m water layer of 0.070mg ortho-PO43--P l(-1), 0.136mg NH4+-N l(-1) and 0.24mg NO3--Nl(-1). These vertical gradients should be considered in sampling protocols for the assessment of the water quality of temporarily stratified river sections.

This study shows that integrated rice-fish farming and integrated pest management strategies provide sustainable options to intensive rice farming, because of a more balanced use of multiple ecosystem services that benefit the farmers' health, economy and the environment. The study investigates and compares farming strategies among 40 rice and 20 rice-fish farmers in two locations in the Mekong Delta. Production costs and income are used to compare the systems' financial sustainability. The farmers' perception on how their farming practices influence on ecosystem services and their livelihoods are used as an indication of the systems' ecological and social sustainability. Although rice-fish farmers used lower amount of pesticides and fertilisers than rice farmers, there were no statistical differences in their rice yields or net income. Rice was seen as the most important ecosystem service from rice fields and related wetlands, but also several other ecosystem services, such as water quality, aquatic animals, plants, habitats, and natural enemies to pests, were seen as important to the farmers' livelihoods and wellbeing. All farmers perceived that there had been a general reduction in all these other ecosystem services, due to intensive rice farming during the last 15 years, and that they will continue to decline. The majority of the farmers were willing to reduce their rice yields slightly for an improved quality of the other ecosystem services.																	1862-4065	1862-4057				JAN	2017	12	1					137	154		10.1007/s11625-016-0409-x								WOS:000393593200009

Reducing nitrogen contamination from agricultural subsurface drainage with denitrification bioreactors and controlled drainage	BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING												Reactive nitrogen leaving agricultural fields through subsurface drainage systems enters aquatic systems and contributes to eutrophication, habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity. Denitrification bioreactors, in combination with controlled drainage, are proposed as a means of reducing nitrogen emitted through subsurface agricultural drainage systems, but their suitability in colder climates where soils and drainage systems freeze during winter is poorly understood. This study presents the first field scale evaluation of denitrification bioreactors under cold climate conditions during a three-year period in Quebec, Canada. Under a three-year crop rotation, about 55% of the total annual subsurface drainage water passed through bioreactors, which significantly lowered the total-nitrogen (72%) and nitrate-nitrogen (99%) median concentrations in the subsurface drainage outflows. Loadings of nitrate-nitrogen from the test fields to surface drainage ditches were reduced by 99%, equivalent to about 11 kg nitrate-nitrogen ha(-1) year(-1) removal in the test area and approximately 7 g nitrate-nitrogen removal m(-3) bioreactor volume d(-1). Aquatic environmental criteria non-compliance events declined by 96% for nitrate-nitrogen and by 50% for total-nitrogen during the three-year study. This study demonstrates that denitrification bioreactors, combined with controlled drainage, are an effective in-field technology for nitrogen removal from agricultural subsurface drainage water that will improve water quality under cold climate conditions.

Twenty physicochemical parameters were measured at 30 stations along the Batang Baramand its tributaries. The water quality of the Batang Baramwas categorized as "slightly polluted" where the chemical oxygen demand and total suspended solids were the most deteriorated parameters. The CA grouped the 30 stations into four clusters which shared similar characteristics within the same cluster, representing the upstream, middle, and downstream regions of the main river and the tributaries from the middle to downstream regions of the river. The PCA has determined a reduced number of six principal components that explained 83.6% of the data set variance. The first PC indicated that the total suspended solids, turbidity, and hydrogen sulphide were the dominant polluting factors which is attributed to the logging activities, followed by the five-day biochemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, organic nitrogen, and nitrate-nitrogen in the second PC which are related to the discharges from domestic wastewater. The components also imply that logging activities are the major anthropogenic activities responsible for water quality variations in the Batang Baram when compared to the domestic wastewater discharge.

Data analytics methodology for monitoring quality sensors and events in the Barcelona drinking water network	JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS												Water quality management is a key area to guarantee drinking water safety to users. This task is based on disinfection techniques, such as chlorination, applied to the drinking water network to prevent the growth of microorganisms present in the water. The continuous monitoring of water quality parameters is fundamental to assess the sanitary conditions of the drinking water and to detect unexpected events. The whole process is based on the assumption that the information retrieved from quality sensors is totally reliable, but due to the complexity of the calibration and maintenance of these chemical sensors, several factors affect the accuracy of the raw data collected. Consequently, any decision might be based on a non-solid base. Therefore, this work presents a data analytics monitoring methodology based on temporal and spatial models to discover if a sensor is detecting a real change in water quality parameters or is actually providing inconsistent information due to some malfunction. The methodology presented anticipated by 12.4 days, on average, the detection of a sensor problem before the fault was reported by the water utilities expert using knowledge accumulated with visual analysis. The proposed methodology has been satisfactorily tested on the Barcelona drinking water network.

Nitrogen Dynamics in Two Created Riparian Wetlands over Space and Time	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Temporal and spatial variations of nitrogen (N) soil storages and fluxes were examined at two 1-ha created riverine wetlands in the U.S. Midwest. Soil N content (total N, organic-N, NO3-N, and NH4-N), N accumulation rates, and soil C:N ratios were compared between the two wetlands constructed 15 years earlier (one was planted and the other left to naturally colonize). Differences in wetland soil N content and accumulation were also examined in relation to proximity of river input and relative to a range of topographic features related to wetland water depth. The planted and naturally colonized wetlands showed similar rates of N accumulation. However, differences were detected related to the content of mineralized forms of N (NO3-N and NH4-N) that may relate to the history of vegetation communities at these wetlands. Significant spatial variation of N accumulation was detected within the wetlands, with the highest rates found in the deeper open water communities compared to shallow emergent marsh/edge vegetation communities (23.5 +/- 2.0 versus 17.3 +/- 1.3/18.2 +/- 1.4 g N m(-2) y(-1)). Nitrogen budgets comparing two ages of the wetlands illustrate higher N accumulation rates (by 19%), higher N reduction in the surface water (47 to 52% reduction), and increased denitrification rates (by 13%) from year 10 to year 15. We also found out that nitrogen accumulation in the soil was 7.1 to 7.5% higher than were denitrification rates in these young wetlands. We discuss the importance of efforts such as this to support better understanding of N pathways in both created and natural wetlands, while providing critical data needed to improve modelling efforts and assess the long-term effectiveness of wetlands for improving water quality.

Years of environmental education and media coverage on pollution harm and health risks have not only provided information about pollution to the public, but have also strengthened people's concerns. However, an intense focus' on pollution is far from sufficient; at present, it is necessary to assess to what extent the public can identify specific environmental conditions and whether they are ready to cope with potential health risks from pollution. Through face-to-face surveys on trains and at railway stations nationwide, we investigated public experiences of environmental pollution accidents, perceptions of local environmental risks (focused on air and water quality) and responses to local environmental conditions. By comparing public perceptions with official environmental monitoring data-sets, we concluded that the accuracy of perceptions related to four environmental factors ranged from 40 to 60% at the individual scale. Furthermore, the accuracies increased approximately 2-10% at the county scale and 10-30% at the city scale, highlighting the possible benefits of collective intelligence in helping the public to identify existing environment conditions more accurately. Additionally, despite great concerns about pollution and health, public attitudes toward coping with the dangers of pollution and health risks were found to be indifferent. Our study revealed factors at the individual, social and governmental levels that led to low levels of perception accuracy and response scores. Thereout, we stressed potential pathways to improve the accuracy of public perception and the positivity of responses. The survey results indicate that there is a long way to go before the public is well prepared to cope with the risks of pollution; as a consequence, it is necessary to improve both personal environmental awareness as well as governmental, social and commercial responses to pollution events.																	1366-9877	1466-4461					2017	20	3					347	365		10.1080/13669877.2015.1057199								WOS:000393801500003

Hence, it is of considerable significance to develop highly sensitive and reliable probes for the detection of phosphate with the purpose of monitoring of water quality security and early-warning of eutrophication occurrence. In this work, uniform europium-based infinite coordination polymer (Eu-ICP) nanospheres are rationally constructed by a facile one-step solvothermal treatment. It is demonstrated that the newly developed sensing platform features excellent fluorescence properties, which can be efficiently quenched by the presence of phosphate ions (Pi). Typically, a good linearity exists between the decrease in fluorescence intensities and the Pi analyte content ranging from 2-100 mu M, allowing the reliable determination of Pi concentration. Accordingly, the detection limit is estimated to be 0.83 mu M, which is far below the detection requirement of phosphate discharge criteria in the water environment. It is noteworthy that the prepared Eu-ICP probe displays a specific recognition towards Pi, and is hardly affected by other possible existing species in natural water. More importantly, the proposed fluorescent probe can be utilized for reliable determination of Pi concentration in real water with acceptable recoveries, highlighting its feasibility in complicated environmental samples. Further research suggests that the underlying sensing mechanism is based on the strong affinity between europium centers and Pi, resulting in the collapse of the inherent structure of Eu-ICP and the corresponding fluorescence quenching. These findings show that the developed Eu-ICP probe holds great prospect in monitoring water quality and early warning of eutrophication based on the unique features associated with this simple preparation procedure, high selectivity, and excellent sensitivity.

Green algae (Chlorophyta) are a diverse and widely occurring group, which may be a good model for studying the factors that influence species richness at local and regional scales. Here, we tested the influence of local (water quality and structural complexity) and regional environmental factors (phyto-ecological regions) on the occurrence and species richness of macroscopic green algae (MGA) in subtropical streams. We sampled algae in 105 streams located in the four major phyto-ecological regions of the Brazilian subtropics. We used cross-transect technique in streams to sample algae and environmental variables. To determine the most important variables in species occurrence and richness, we used Hierarchical Partitioning analysis (HP). We found that canopy cover alone explained 34% of MGA occurrence, regardless of phyto-ecological region. At the sites where MGA occurred, the species richness was determined by both regional and local factors. The species richness was mainly influenced by phyto-ecological region, which explained 34% of the variation in species richness, along with canopy cover and pH which explaining 22% and 15% respectively. The highest richness was found in non-forested regions, in transects without canopy cover, and slightly acidic pH. Our results illustrate how the combination of regional and local factors can shape the spatial distribution of species richness and are pivotal to understanding richness patterns at broad spatial scales.

The water quality parameters include pH, COD, DO, alkalinity, hardness, chloride, TDS, total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, electric conductivity and phosphate. Regression analysis was performed using atmospherically corrected true reflectance values of original OLI bands, images after applying enhancement techniques (NDVI, principal components) and the values of the water quality parameters at different sample locations to obtain the empirical relationship. Most of the parameters were well correlated with single OLI bands with R-2 greater than 0.5, whereas phosphate showed a good correlation with NDVI image. The parameters like pH and DO showed a good relation with the principal component I and IV, respectively. The high concentration of pH, COD, turbidity and TSS and low concentration of DO infers the anthropogenic impact on lake.																	1010-6049	1752-0762					2017	32	3					274	285		10.1080/10106049.2016.1140818								WOS:000393207700004

This calls for explicit modeling of constraints and motivations that, respectively, obstruct and stimulate visits to selected outdoor destinations. Choice set formation is the result of screening and/or inclusion of specific sites (alternatives) to form the set of sites considered in real choices. Evidence shows that the omission of a structural representation of choice set formation is harmful to econometric inference. Yet, the literature has largely ignored the underlying behavioral phenomenon. We show, using a discrete choice experiment involving selection among seven recreational sites in an Italian national park, that choice set formation is behaviorally relevant, even after controlling for preference discrimination. Motivations (why visit?) are important determinants of preliminary site screening for choice set inclusion, as well as site selection, justifying the additional value of such modeling extension.

Low rainfall across the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia resulted in an unprecedented water level decline in the Lower Lakes (Lakes Alexandrina and Albert) at the downstream end of the river system. A comprehensive data covering pre-drought (2004-2006), drought (2007-2010) and post-drought (2010-2013) was firstly used to unravel drought effects on water quality in the contrasting main parts and margins of the two Lakes, particularly following water acidification resulting from acid sulfate soil oxidation. Salinity, nutrients and Chl-a significantly increased during the drought in the Lake main waterbody, while pH remained stable or showed minor shifts. In contrast to the Lake Alexandrina, total dissolved solid (TDS) and electrical conductivity (EC) during the post-drought more than doubled the pre-drought period in the Lake Albert as being a terminal lake system with narrow and shallow entrance. Rewetting of the exposed pyrite containing sediment resulted in very low pH (below 3) in Lake margins, which positively contributed to salinity increases via SO42- release and limestone dissolution. Very acidic water (pH 2-3) was neutralised naturally by lake refill, but aerial limestone dosing was required for neutralisation of water acidity during the drought period. The Lower Lakes are characterized as hypereutrophic with much higher salinity, nutrient and algae concentrations than guideline levels for aquatic ecosystem. These results suggest that, in the Lower Lakes, drought could cause water quality deterioration through water acidification and increased nutrient and Chl-a concentrations, more effective water management in the lake catchment is thus crucial to prevent the similar water quality deterioration since the projected intensification of droughts. A comparative assessment on lake resilience and recovering processes should be undertaken with a post-drought monitoring program. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, there is only limited information, and even fewer physical measurements, assessing the rate of sediment accumulation in reservoirs behind dams. Many of the dams within the Great Lakes Watershed were constructed between 100 and 120 years ago, and there is reasonable concern that these dams and their associated reservoirs may be reaching capacity with respect to sediment storage. As a reservoir reaches its sediment storage capacity, there are numerous risks. Excess sediment can compromise the water intake for supply systems. Dam failure or removal can potentially allow large quantities of impounded sediment to migrate downstream, negatively impacting fish habitat and water quality. This research investigates the historical function of dams as sediment storage points. Also, this research assesses the effect of anthropogenic influences including land use change and dam construction on sediment yield and accumulation within the Lake Rockwell and Ballville Dam watershed. To better understand the historical and current sediment yield within the Lake Erie watershed, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models of the Lake Rockwell and Ballville Dam watersheds were developed. The resulting model suggests that the average of sediment accumulation rate within Lake Rockwell Dam reservoir varies between the minimum of 1.6 and the maximum of 4.6 g/cm(2)/yr from 1988 to 2007. Within the Ballville Dam reservoir, the rate varies between the minimum of 2.6 and the maximum of 23.2 g/cm(2)/yr from 1980 to 1999. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, calibration of the agricultural-hydrological system models is challenging because of model complexity, the existence of strong parameter correlation, and significant computational requirements. Therefore, only a limited number of simulations can be allowed in any attempt to find a near-optimal solution within an affordable time, which greatly restricts the successful application of the model. The goal of this study is to locate the optimal solution of the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) given a limited simulation time, so as to improve the model simulation and help make rational and effective agricultural-hydrological decisions. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient global optimization procedure using sparse-grid based surrogates. We first used advanced sparse grid (SG) interpolation to construct a surrogate system of the actual RZWQM2, and then we calibrate the surrogate model using the global optimization algorithm, Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). As the surrogate model is a polynomial with fast evaluation, it can be efficiently evaluated with a sufficiently large number of times during the optimization, which facilitates the global search. We calibrate seven model parameters against five years of yield, drain flow, and NO3-N loss data from a subsurface-drained corn-soybean field in Iowa. Results indicate that an accurate surrogate model can be created for the RZWQM2 with a relatively small number of SG points (i.e., RZWQM2 runs). Compared to the conventional QPSO algorithm, our surrogate based optimization method can achieve a smaller objective function value and better calibration performance using a fewer number of expensive RZWQM2 executions, which greatly improves computational efficiency.

J	Gagnon, P; Chretien, F; Theriault, G				Gagnon, Patrick; Chretien, Francois; Theriault, Georges			Land leveling impact on surface runoff and soil losses: Estimation with coupled deterministic/stochastic models for a Quebec agricultural field	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Land leveling impact on water quality had not received much attention for fields in humid continental climate. The objectives of this study were to isolate the impact of land leveling, performed on an agricultural field (Quebec, Canada) in spring 2012, on runoff and TSS load and to make recommendations to attenuate adverse environmental impacts of land leveling, if any. A total of 66 runoff events, including 22 with total suspended sediments (TSS) load estimates, from 2010 to 2014 were analyzed. To this end, deterministic models were coupled to an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate the unknown distribution of the parameters representing the most important effects, namely land leveling, tillage, and crop cover. Simulated runoff events were generated by the hydrological model SWMM version 5 while simulated TSS loads were generated by an empirical equation based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation version 2 (RUSLE2). Thanks to the algorithm used, it was demonstrated that land leveling significantly decreased total runoff volume at least for the two following years. The impact on peak flow was mixed: land leveling significantly decreased peak flow for a typical stratiform rainfall event but the effect was unclear for a typical convective rainfall event. Based on 90% confidence interval, TSS load increased from 10 to 1000 times immediately after land leveling"(spring 2012) compared to pre-land leveling events. The TSS load increase remained significant one year after land leveling, with TSS loads 5-20 times higher compared to pre-land leveling events. It would thus be recommended to grow crops with high ground coverage ratios coupled with cover crops during the year when land leveling is done. Sediment retention structures could also be installed at the beginning of the land leveling process to provide protection against the short term and delayed impact on water quality.

The EFT process with an ORP control was able to improve the current efficiency from 16.9% to 73.6-81.9%. A superior performance for both the current efficiency and the treated water quality was recorded by the EFT process with an ORP control of 1000 mV. This superior result was ascribed to the approach preventing an excessive accumulation of hypochlorous acid. Two combined processes, namely, an activated sludge process followed by the EFT process with an ORP control (AS-EFT process) and the EFT process with an ORP control followed by an activated sludge process (EFT-AS process), were examined by using 1,4-dioxane contaminated municipal wastewater. As a result, the AS-EFT process was superior to the EFT-AS process in respects of both energy consumption and the performance of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, as well as the removal of 1,4-dioxane, due to the smaller COD loading onto the EFT reactor in the AS-EFT process.

Differential white blood cell counting was performed, as well as the counting of total leukocytes and thrombocytes (in 2000 cells). Physicochemical parameters of the water from both sites were analyzed. The water from the polluted area was found to have high conductivity and low levels of dissolved oxygen, factors that indicate poor environmental quality. Fish collected from the polluted site presented higher percentages of eosinophils and monocytes and fewer thrombocytes because of exposure to pollution and hypoxic conditions.

Colorimetric Detection of Staphylococcus aureus Contaminated Solutions without Purification	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY												Current water quality monitoring methods rely on growth-based measurements to detect fecal indicator bacteria, such as Escherichia coli and enterococci, and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). These growth-based measurements, however, can take days to complete. This is a significant limitation in the evaluation of contaminated food and water sources. Various methods for selective in vitro detection of S. aureus have also been reported; however, these strategies, such as ELISA, agar diffusion, PCR, or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, all require overnight culturing or sophisticated instrumentation. There is a pressing need for a portable, simple diagnostic for S. aureus. Here, we demonstrate that oligonucleotide-functionalized gold nanoparticles (Oligo-AuNPs) can be designed to rapidly and selectively detect S. aureus with a colorimetric readout. We have functionalized a chemically modified 11-mer sequence onto AuNPs and have found that aggregation occurs in the presence of S. aureus supernantants. The particles can be stored as a lyophilized powder and reconstituted at time of use, and this has been tested in biologically relevant samples such as creek and ocean water. This approach requires minimal sample preparation and requires no extraneous instrumentation, leading to a rapid and simple diagnostic read-out that could be used in field tests to monitor food and water sources.

In this study, correlations between cyanobacterial blooms and hydro-meteorological factors, including water quality, temperature and precipitation were investigated. Results demonstrated that South Taihu Lake was heavily affected by cyanobacteria and the proliferation of cyanobacteria due to variations in hydro-meteorological factors and water quality conditions. Water quality parameters, including COD, NH3-N, TN and TP improved significantly since 2008 even at an elevated cyanobacterial bloom situation. Correlation analyses have shown that the development of cyanobacterial density and chlorophyll a concentration was sensitive to a wider temperature variation. The optimum temperature for cyanobacteria was 20 degrees C, while extremely low and high temperatures were found to suppress their growth. Moreover, unusual rainfall patterns were measured during the study period (2003-2009), which showed an adverse impact on cyanobacterial development. Findings from this study suggested that seasonal lake's water quality monitoring; suitable treatment of cyanobacterial blooms and strict policy implementation can solve the water quality issues in highly eutrophic lakes like Taihu.																	0275-7540	1029-0370				JAN	2017	33	1					76	87		10.1080/02757540.2016.1261122								WOS:000392971400006

Eight different treatments were tested varying the presence or absence of a toxicant (NaOCl) and two disturbances: the passing of a shadow (mimicking a predator) and entrapment of the fish. The concentration tested corresponded to a sublethal (1 % 24 h-LC50) and short term exposure (2 h). A total of 56 organisms were tested resulting in 112 diagnoses (before and after the contamination). A statistical model of diagnosis was developed using Self-organizing Map (SOM) and Correspondence Analysis (CA). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false positive and false negative values were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance. The disturbances did not negatively affect the capability of the model. In the presence of at least one of these variables, the diagnostic performance was similar or even superior to the baseline results without disturbances. Furthermore, the system produced a large number of correct diagnoses, at an ecologically relevant concentration of exposure, in a non-invasive way.

Monitoring the seasonal dynamics of physicochemical parameters from Atoyac River basin (Puebla), Central Mexico: multivariate approach	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Spatiotemporal variations of ten physicochemical parameters in the water quality of Atoyac River basin, Central Mexico, were obtained from 22 sampling sites (66 samples in total) located all along the basin for three different seasons (dry, rainy and winter). Multivariate statistical techniques such as correlation matrix, factor analysis (FA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used as a tool to understand the process. Physicochemical parameters such as temperature (T), pH, conductivity (lambda), dissolved oxygen (DO), spectral absorption coefficient (SAC), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), turbidity, 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS) were analyzed. Extremely high values of pH (10.24), conductivity (1870 mu S/cm) and reduced redox potential (-370.1 mV) were observed in the dry season, whereas elevated TSS of 2996 mg/L was detected during the rainy season. The results elucidated high influence from the adjoining industrial, agricultural and urban zones, making the river unsuitable for life. FA generated varifactors, which accounted for cumulative % of 75.04 (dry), 76.22 (rainy) and 79.96 (winter) clearly grouping the external factors responsible for these significant values indicating the source of contamination. Cluster analysis facilitated the ease of classifying the sampling sites based on the similarities of physicochemical parameters. This study carried out in different seasons using multivariate statistical techniques would definitely prove to be an efficient tool for the restoration and establishing the real-time monitoring stations along this important river basin of Mexico.

Cross-sectional surveys were carried out in March and June 2015. A Delagua water quality testing kit was employed on 634 water samples obtained from 16 purposively selected schools, 40 community water sources, and 562 households to examine water quality. Aflame atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to test lead and arsenic content of the same samples. Additionally, a questionnaire survey was conducted to obtain WASH predictors. A total of 75% of school drinking water source samples and 76.9% point-of-use samples (water bottles) at schools, 39.5% water source samples in the community, and 27.4% point-of-use samples at household levels were contaminated with thermo-tolerant coliforms. The values of water samples for pH (6.8-7.6), free and total residual chlorine (0.1-0.5 mg/L), mean lead concentration (0.01 mg/L), and mean arsenic concentration (0.05 mg/L) were within national drinking water quality standards. The presence of domestic animals roaming inside schoolchildren's homes was significantly associated with drinking water contamination (adjusted odds ratio: 1.64; 95% confidence interval: 1.08-2.50; p = 0.02). Our findings call for an improvement of WASH conditions at the unit of school, households, and communities.																	1660-4601					JAN	2017	14	1							89	10.3390/ijerph14010089								WOS:000392578200087

A test of trophic cascade theory: fish and benthic assemblages across a predator density gradient on coral reefs	OECOLOGIA												Removal of predators is often hypothesized to alter community structure through trophic cascades. However, despite recent advances in our understanding of trophic cascades, evidence is often circumstantial on coral reefs because fishing pressure frequently co-varies with other anthropogenic effects, such as fishing for herbivorous fishes and changes in water quality due to pollution. Australia's outer Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has experienced fishing-induced declines of apex predators and mesopredators, but pollution and targeting of herbivorous fishes are minimal. Here, we quantify fish and benthic assemblages across a fishing-induced predator density gradient on the outer GBR, including apex predators and mesopredators to herbivores and benthic assemblages, to test for evidence of trophic cascades and alternative hypotheses to trophic cascade theory. Using structural equation models, we found no cascading effects from apex predators to lower trophic levels: a loss of apex predators did not lead to higher levels of mesopredators, and this did not suppress mobile herbivores and drive algal proliferation. Likewise, we found no effects of mesopredators on lower trophic levels: a decline of mesopredators was not associated with higher abundances of algae-farming damselfishes and algae-dominated reefs. These findings indicate that top-down forces on coral reefs are weak, at least on the outer GBR. We conclude that predator-mediated trophic cascades are probably the exception rather than the rule in complex ecosystems such as the outer GBR.

J	Zhou, B; Bian, C; Tong, JH; Xia, SH				Zhou, Bo; Bian, Chao; Tong, Jianhua; Xia, Shanhong			Fabrication of a Miniature Multi-Parameter Sensor Chip for Water Quality Assessment	SENSORS												Water contamination is a main inducement of human diseases. It is an important step to monitor the water quality in the water distribution system. Due to the features of large size, high cost, and complicated structure of traditional water determination sensors and devices, it is difficult to realize real-time water monitoring on a large scale. In this paper, we present a multi-parameter sensor chip, which is miniature, low-cost, and robust, to detect the pH, conductivity, and temperature of water simultaneously. The sensor chip was fabricated using micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) techniques. Iridium oxide film was electrodeposited as the pH-sensing material. The atomic ratio of Ir(III) to Ir(IV) is about 1.38 according to the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The pH sensing electrode showed super-Nernstian response (67.60 mV/pH) and good linearity (R-2 = 0.9997), in the range of pH 2.22 to pH 11.81. KCl-agar and epoxy were used as the electrolyte layer and liquid junction for the solid-state reference electrode, respectively, and its potential stability in deionized water was 56 h. The conductivity cell exhibited a linear determination range from 21.43 mu S/cm to 1.99 mS/cm, and the electrode constant was 1.566 cm(-1). Sensitivity of the temperature sensor was 5.46 Omega/degrees C. The results indicate that the developed sensor chip has potential application in water quality measurements.																	1424-8220					JAN	2017	17	1							157	10.3390/s17010157								WOS:000393021000156	28098824

Potential sources of bias in the use of Escherichia coli to measure waterborne diarrhoea risk in low-income settings	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH												ObjectivesEscherichia coli is the standard water quality indicator for diarrhoea risk. Yet, the association between E. coli and diarrhoea is inconsistent across studies without a systematic assessment of methodological differences behind this variation. Most studies measure water quality cross-sectionally with diarrhoea, risking exposure misclassification and reverse causation. Studies use different recall windows for self-reported diarrhoea; longer periods increase potential outcome misclassification through misrecall. Control of confounding is inconsistent across studies. Additionally, diarrhoea measured in unblinded intervention trials can present courtesy bias. We utilised measurements from a randomised trial of water interventions in Bangladesh to assess how these factors affect the E. coli-diarrhoea association. MethodsWe compared cross-sectional versus prospective measurements of water quality and diarrhoea, 2-versus 7-day symptom recall periods, estimates with and without controlling for confounding and using measurements from control versus intervention arms of the trial. ResultsIn the control arm, 2-day diarrhoea prevalence, measured prospectively 1 month after water quality, significantly increased with log(10)E. coli (PR = 1.50, 1.02-2.20). This association weakened when we used 7-day recall (PR = 1.18, 0.88-1.57), cross-sectional measurements of E. coli and diarrhoea (PR = 1.11, 0.79-1.56) or did not control for confounding (PR = 1.20, 0.88-1.62). Including data from intervention arms led to less interpretable associations, potentially due to courtesy bias, effect modification and/or reverse causation. ConclusionsBy systematically addressing potential sources of bias, our analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between E. coli in drinking water and diarrhoea, suggesting that the continued use of E. coli as an indicator of waterborne diarrhoea risk is justified. ObjectifsEscherichia coli est l'indicateur standard de la qualite de l'eau pour le risque de diarrhee. Pourtant, l'association entre E. coli et la diarrhee est inconsistante entre les etudes, sans une evaluation systematique des differences methodologiques liees a cette variation. La plupart des etudes mesurent la qualite de l'eau de facon transversale avec la diarrhee, risquant une mauvaise classification de l'exposition et l'inversion de la causalite. Les etudes utilisent differentes fenetres de rappel pour la diarrhee auto-declaree; Des periodes plus longues augmentent la possibilite de classification erronee des resultats due aux rappels errones. L'ajustement pour les facteurs confusionnels est inconsistant entre les etudes. De plus, la diarrhee mesuree non en aveugle dans les essais d'intervention peut presenter un biais de courtoisie. Nous avons utilise les mesures d'un essai randomise d'interventions sur l'eau au Bangladesh pour evaluer comment ces facteurs affectent l'association entre E. coli et la diarrhee. MethodesNous avons compare les mesures transversales aux mesures prospectives de la qualite de l'eau et de la diarrhee, des periodes de rappel des symptomes a deux versus sept jours, des estimations avec et sans ajustement pour les facteurs confusionnelles et en utilisant les mesures du bras temoin versus celles du bras d'intervention de l'essai. ResultatsDans le bras temoin, la prevalence de la diarrhee a deux jours de rappel, mesuree prospectivement un mois apres la qualite de l'eau, a augmente de facon significative avec un log(10)E. coli (PR=1,50; 1,02-2,20). Cette association s'est affaiblie lorsque nous avons utilise le rappel a sept jours (PR=1,18; 0,88-1,57), les mesures transversales de E. coli et de la diarrhee (PR=1,11; 0,79-1,56) ou n'avons pas ajuste pour les facteurs confusionnels (PR=1,20; 0,88-1,62). L'inclusion des donnees provenant des bras d'intervention a conduit a des associations moins interpretables, potentiellement dues a un biais de courtoisie, a une modification de l'effet et/ou a une inversion de la causalite. ConclusionsEn analysant systematiquement les sources potentielles de biais, notre analyse demontre une relation claire entre E.coli dans l'eau de boisson et la diarrhee, ce qui suggere que l'utilisation continue d'E.Coli comme indicateur du risque de diarrhee hydrique est justifiee. ObjetivosEscherichia coli es el indicador estandar de calidad del agua y riesgo de diarrea. Sin embargo, se observan inconsistencias entre estudios en lo que respecta a la asociacion entre E. coli y diarrea, sin una evaluacion sistematica de diferencias metodologicas detras de esta variacion. La mayoria de los estudios miden la calidad del agua de forma transversal con la diarrea, con el consecuente riesgo de exposicion a una mala clasificacion y a la causacion reversa. Los estudios utilizan diferentes ventanas de recuerdo para la diarrea autoreportada; periodos mas largos potencian una clasificacion erronea debido a recuerdos incorrectos. El control de los factores confusores tampoco es consistente entre estudios. Adicionalmente, la diarrea medida en ensayos de intervencion abiertos puede presentar un sesgo de cortesia. Hemos utilizado medidas de un ensayo aleatorizado de intervencion del agua en Bangladesh para evaluar como estos factores afectan la asociacion entre E. Coli y diarrea. MetodosHemos comparado medidas croseccionales versus medidas prospectivas sobre la calidad del agua y la diarrea, con ventanas de recuerdo de dos- versus siete dias, calculando con y sin control para confusores y utilizando las medidas de los brazos control versus intervencion del ensayo. ResultadosEn el brazo control, la prevalencia de dos dias de diarrea, medida de forma prospectiva un mes despues de la calidad del agua, aumento significativamente con log(10)E. coli (PR=1.50, 1.02-2.20). Esta asociacion se debilitaba cuando utilizabamos la ventana de siete dias de recuerdo (PR=1.18, 0.88-1.57), medidas transversales de E. coli y diarrea (PR=1.11, 0.79-1.56) o no controlabamos para confusores (PR=1.20, 0.88-1.62). Incluir datos del brazo de intervencion conllevaba a asociaciones menos interpretables, potencialmente debido al sesgo de cortesia, al efecto de modificacion y/o la causacion reversa. ConclusionesAbordando de forma sistematica las posibles fuentes de sesgo en nuestro analisis, demostramos una clara relacion entre la presencia de E. coli en agua potable y diarrea, lo cual sugiere que el uso continuo de E. coli como un indicador de riesgo de diarrea transmitida por agua puede justificarse.

J	Baba, A; Gunduz, O				Baba, Alper; Gunduz, Orhan			Effect of Geogenic Factors on Water Quality and Its Relation to Human Health around Mount Ida, Turkey	Water												Water-rock interactions strongly influence water quality. Waters originating from highly altered zones affect human health. Mount Ida region in western Anatolia is an example for such geogenic interactions and additional anthropogenic impacts. A water quality monitoring study was held and a total of 189 samples were collected from 63 monitoring stations to characterize the quality of water resources and its relation with human health. The results indicated that waters originating from altered volcanic rocks that are mainly used for drinking purposes have low pH, high conductivity and elevated trace element levels. In addition, a number of acidic mining lakes were formed in the open pits of abandoned mine sites in the study area and pyrite oxidation in altered volcanic rocks resulted in extremely acidic, high mineral content and toxic waters that demonstrate an eminent threat for the environmental health in the area. Overall, the water quality constituents in Mount Ida region had a spatially variable pattern and were locally found to exceed the national and international standards, mainly due to geogenic alteration zones and anthropogenic intervention.

J	Cheng, XJ; Zhu, DT; Wang, XX; Yu, DG; Xie, J				Cheng, Xiangju; Zhu, Dantong; Wang, Xixi; Yu, Deguang; Xie, Jun			Effects of Nonaerated Circulation Water Velocity on Nutrient Release from Aquaculture Pond Sediments	Water												Sustaining good water quality in aquaculture ponds is vital. Without an aerator, the dissolved oxygen in ponds comes primarily from mass transfer at the water-ambient atmosphere interface. As sediment can seriously affect water quality, this study used indoor experiments to examine the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) release mechanisms and fluxes from sediment in aquaculture ponds with moving water but no aeration. The results showed that the ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) concentration in the overlying water was inversely proportional to flow velocity and that a higher flow velocity tended to result in a lower concentration in the overlying water, a steeper vertical gradient of concentration within the bed sediments, and a faster release rate from the sediments. The sediment disturbed by flowing water released more nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N) into the overlying water and NO2-N could become oxidized into NO3-N. In still water, NO3-N was released gradually and some anaerobic NO3-N was nitrified into NO2-N. Phosphorus release from the sediments was controlled by the adsorption-desorption balance, with the phosphorus concentration in the overlying water dropping gradually to a steady value from its initial maximum. The relationship between NH3-N release flux and flow rate is described by a cubic function.

J	Ge, M; Wu, FP; You, M				Ge, Min; Wu, Feng-Ping; You, Min			Initial Provincial Water Rights Dynamic Projection Pursuit Allocation Based on the Most Stringent Water Resources Management: A Case Study of Taihu Basin, China	Water												Clarification of initial water rights is the basis and prerequisite for a water rights trade-off market and also an effective solution to the problem of water scarcity and water conflicts. According to the new requirements for the most stringent water resources management in China, an initial provincial water rights allocation model is proposed. Firstly, based on analysis of multiple principles for initial provincial water rights allocation including total water use, water use efficiency, water quality of water function zones, regional coordination and sharing, an index system of initial provincial water rights allocation is designed. Secondly, according to dynamic projection pursuit technique, an initial provincial water rights allocation model with the total water use control is set up. Moreover, the self-adaptive chaotic optimization algorithm is applied to tackle the model. Finally, a case study of Taihu Basin is adopted. Considering the multiple scenarios of three different water frequencies (50%, 75% and 90%) and planning year 2030, the empirical results show Jiangsu Province always obtains the most initial water rights. When the developing situation of provinces are given more consideration, Shanghai should acquire more initial water rights than Zhejiang Province; but when the dynamic increment evolving trend of provinces is taken more into account, Shanghai should obtain less initial water rights than Zhejiang Province. The case about Taihu Lake further verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model and provides a multiple-scenarios decision making support for entitling the initial water rights with the most stringent water resources management constrains in Taihu Basin.

J	Jetoo, S				Jetoo, Savitri			The Role of Transnational Municipal Networks in Transboundary Water Governance	Water												The transboundary nature of stressors impacting shared water bodies has been traditionally recognized in agreements between nation states. Several developments have led to new layers of cross border environmental actors, including regional and city level interactions. This proliferation of non-state actors is witnessed in two large water bodies, the Baltic Sea and the North American Great Lakes. In both regions, transboundary water governance was led by nation states in agreements to improve heavily contaminated waters, the Helsinki Convention (1974) and the North American Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (1972), respectively. Whilst there has been much research on transnational regional networks, especially in Europe, there has been less theoretical work done on transnational municipal transboundary water networks due to the delay of recognition of the legitimacy of these local government actors. This paper aims to examine the role of the transnational municipal networks in transboundary water governance by looking at the case studies of the Union of Baltic cities in the Baltic Sea region and the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative in the North American Great Lakes Basin. It does this by assessing the role of these transnational municipal networks in bridging water governance gaps in these regions.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							40	10.3390/w9010040								WOS:000392939900040

An experiment was performed in an outdoor large-scale mesocosm three times from 2011 to 2012 by comparing the responses to adjustment as a function of the volume of JFS in the control and experimental groups. Analysis results of the environmental monitoring over three periods indicated only minor differences in the physicochemical characteristics of the water quality and phyto-and zoo-plankton biomass, thereby enabling a comparative analysis of the feeding ecology. However, the water temperature exhibited large fluctuations, ranging from 16.4 to 27.6 degrees C, and high water temperature conditions (Period 1, 25.6 +/- 2.0 degrees C) enhanced the predation activity of the piscivorous fish Coreoperca herzi (C. herzi, size 89 +/- 4 mm). Statistically, the survival rates of the prey fish, Rhynchocypris oxycephalus (R. oxycephalus, size 29 +/- 1 mm), with JFSs were greater by 35.9%-46.7%, and improved as the patch volume of JFS increased. Based on both experimental observations and statistical analysis, the JFS developed in this study could reduce the chances of predator-prey encounters, minimize prey vulnerability, and thereby increase prey survival rates.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							36	10.3390/w9010036								WOS:000392939900036

Here, we present and analyse 30 years of chemical and biological data from the shallow and 16 ha large Lake Vaeng, Denmark, which has been biomanipulated twice with a 20-year interval by removing roach (Rutilus rutilus) and bream (Abramis brama). After both biomanipulations, Lake Vaeng shifted from a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state to a clear, water macrophyte-dominated state. Chlorophyll a was reduced from 60-80 mu g.L-1 to 10-30 mu g.L-1 and the coverage of submerged macrophytes, dominated by Elodea canadensis, increased from <0.1% to 70%-80%. Mean summer total phosphorus was reduced from about 0.12 to 0.07 mg.L-1 and total nitrogen decreased from 1.0 to 0.4 mg.L-1. On a seasonal scale, phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations changed from a summer maximum during turbid conditions to a winter maximum under clear conditions. The future of Lake Vaeng is uncertain and a relatively high phosphorus loading via the groundwater, and the accumulation of a mobile P pool in the sediment make it likely that the lake eventually will return to turbid conditions. Repeated fish removals might be a relevant management strategy to apply in shallow lakes with a relatively high external nutrient loading.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							43	10.3390/w9010043								WOS:000392939900043

The Impact of Para Rubber Expansion on Streamflow and Other Water Balance Components of the Nam Loei River Basin, Thailand	Water												At present, Para rubber is an economical crop which provides a high priced product and is in demand by global markets. Consequently, the government of Thailand is promoting the expansion of Para rubber plantations throughout the country. Traditionally, Para rubber was planted and grown only in the southern areas of the country. However, due to the Government's support and promotion as well as economic reasons, the expansion of Para rubber plantations in the northeast has increased rapidly. This support has occurred without accounting for suitable cultivation of Para rubber conditions, particularly in areas with steep slopes and other factors which have significant impacts on hydrology and water quality. This study presents the impacts of Para rubber expansion by applying the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model on the hydrology and water balance of the Nam Loei River Basin, Loei Province. The results showed that the displacement of original local field crops and disturbed forest land by Para rubber production resulted in an overall increase of evapotranspiration (ET) of roughly 3%. The major factors are the rubber canopy and precipitation. Moreover, the water balance results showed an annual reduction of about 3% in the basin average water yield, especially during the dry season.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							1	10.3390/w9010001								WOS:000392939900001

This review examines fish welfare in relation to rearing water quality, fish feed and fish waste and faeces to develop a sustainable aquaponic system where the co-cultured organisms, fish, bacteria in biofilters and plants, should be considered holistically in all aquaponics operations. Water quality parameters are the primary environmental consideration for optimizing aquaponic production and for directly impacting fish welfare/ health issues and plant needs. In aquaponic systems, the uptake of nutrients should be maximised for the healthy production of the plant biomass but without neglecting the best welfare conditions for the fish in terms of water quality. Measures to reduce the risks of the introduction or spread of diseases or infection and to increase biosecurity in aquaponics are also important. In addition, the possible impacts of allelochemicals, i.e., chemicals released by the plants, should be taken into account. Moreover, the effect of diet digestibility, faeces particle size and settling ratio on water quality should be carefully considered. As available information is very limited, research should be undertaken to better elucidate the relationship between appropriate levels of minerals needed by plants, and fish metabolism, health and welfare. It remains to be investigated whether and to what extent the concentrations of suspended solids that can be found in aquaponic systems can compromise the health of fish. Water quality, which directly affects fish health and well-being, is the key factor to be considered in all aquaponic systems.

J	Zhou, JJ; Zhang, WJ; Liu, D; Wang, Z; Li, S				Zhou, Jingjing; Zhang, Wenjing; Liu, Dan; Wang, Zhuo; Li, Shuo			Influence of Humic Acid on the Transport and Deposition of Colloidal Silica under Different Hydrogeochemical Conditions	WATER												The transport and deposition of colloids in aquifers plays an important role in managed aquifer recharge (MAR) schemes. Here, the processes of colloidal silica transport and deposition were studied by displacing groundwater with recharge water. The results showed that significant amounts of colloidal silica transport occurred when native groundwater was displaced by HA solution. Solution contains varying conditions of ionic strength and ion valence. The presence of humic acid could affect the zeta potential and size of the colloidal silica, which led to obvious colloidal silica aggregation in the divalent ion solution. Humic acid increased colloidal silica transport by formation of non-adsorbing aqueous phase silica-HA complexes. The experimental and modeling results showed good agreement, indicating that the essential physics were accurately captured by the model. The deposition rates were less than 10(-8) s(-1) in deionized water and monovalent ion solution. Moreover, the addition of Ca2+ and increase of IS resulted in the deposition rates increasing by five orders of magnitude to 10(-4) s(-1). In all experiments, the deposition rates decreased in the presence of humic acid. Overall, the promotion of humic acid in colloidal silica was strongly associated with changes in water quality, indicating that they should receive greater attention during MAR.																	2073-4441					JAN	2017	9	1							10	10.3390/w9010010								WOS:000392939900010

Totally, nine earthen ponds of 600 m(2) (three treatments with three replicates) were prepared in the Gwadar area (located in the coastal area of Oman Sea, southeast of Iran) for our experiment. The L. vannamei post-larvae (PLs) (average body weight: 0.007 +/- 0.001 g) were stocked at a density of 20 PLs m(-2) in each experimental pond. After 40 days of storage, mullets with size of 20-50 cm were stocked at densities of 0 (T-1), 2 (T-2) and 4 (T-3) fish per 100 m(2) of ponds, respectively. The growth parameters (including: specific growth rate, mean weight), food conversion ratio (FCR) and survival rate (SR) of shrimps were measured during the experiment. After 107 days of the experiment, the highest shrimp biomass was obtained in T-3 (212 kg) and T-1 yielded the lowest biomass (187 kg). The mean body weight of each shrimp was 18.4 and 16.23 g in T-3 and T-1, respectively (P < 0.05). The SR and FCR did not show significant differences between treatments (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the present experiment demonstrated that polyculture of western white shrimp with mullet improves growth and subsequently the production of western shrimp.

In this study, bacterial community radial-spatial distribution in biofilms along the pipe wall in a chlorinated DWDS of East China was investigated. Three pipes of large diameter (300, 600, and 600 mm) were sampled in this DWDS, including a ductile cast iron pipe (DCIP) with pipe age of 11 years and two gray cast iron pipes (GCIP) with pipe ages of 17 and 19 years, and biofilms in the upper, middle, and lower parts of each pipe wall were collected. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and culture-based method were used to quantify bacteria. 454 pyrosequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. The results showed that the biofilm density and total solid (TS) and volatile solid (VS) contents increased gradually from the top to the bottom along the pipe wall. Microorganisms were concentrated in the upper and lower parts of the pipe wall, together accounting for more than 80 % of the total biomass in the biofilms. The bacterial communities in biofilms were significantly different in different areas of the pipe wall and had no strong interaction. Compared with the upper and lower parts of the pipe wall, the bacterial community in the middle of the pipe wall was distributed evenly and had the highest diversity. The 16S rRNA genes of various possible pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella enterica, were detected in the biofilms, and the abundances of these possible pathogens were highest in the middle of the pipe wall among three areas. The detachment of the biofilms is the main reason for the deterioration of the water quality in DWDSs. The results of this study suggest that the biofilms in the middle of the pipe wall have highly potential risk for drinking water safety, which provides new ideas for the study of the microbial ecology in DWDS.																	0175-7598	1432-0614				JAN	2017	101	2					749	759		10.1007/s00253-016-7887-8								WOS:000392060500023	27761636

Effects of Suspended Sediment on Early Life Stages of Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu)	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The resuspension of sediments caused by activities, such as dredging operations, is a concern in Great Lakes harbors where multiple fish species spawn. To address such concerns, smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) were exposed to uncontaminated suspended sediment (nominally 0, 100, 250, and 500 mg/L) continuously for 72 h to determine the effects on egg-hatching success and swim-up fry survival and growth. The test sediments were collected from two harbors: (1) fine-grained sediment in Grand Haven Harbor, Lake Michigan, and (2) coarser-grained sediment in Fairport Harbor, Lake Erie. Eggs exposed to total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations > 100 mg/L resulted in decreased survival of post-hatch larval fish. Fry survival was > 90 % at the highest exposure concentration (500 mg/L), but growth was decreased when the exposure concentration was > 100 mg/L. Growth and survival of swim-up fry held for a 7- and 26-day post-exposure the grow-out period was variable suggesting that the sediment grain size and strain of fish may influence lingering effects after the cessation of exposure. The results suggest that exposed eggs hatched normally; however, newly hatched larvae, which are temporarily immobile, are more vulnerable to the effects of suspended sediment. The swim-up fry were found to be more sensitive to high TSS concentrations in sandy relative to silty sediment. These data represent a conservative exposure scenario that can be extrapolated to high-energy systems in the field to inform management decisions regarding the necessity for dredging windows or need to implement controls to protect M. dolomieu.																	0090-4341	1432-0703				JAN	2017	72	1					119	131		10.1007/s00244-016-0322-4								WOS:000392305400011	27778053					
J	Wang, WB; Liang, QB; Zhao, J; Chen, R				Wang, Wanbin; Liang, Qibin; Zhao, Jing; Chen, Rui			Application of Biotic Ligand Model in Predicting Copper Acute Toxicity to Carp (Cyprinidae)	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Three representative species of Cyprinidae fishes (Aristichthys nobilis, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, and Cyprinus carpio), which are abundant in Chinese surface waters, were studied to determine their sensitivity to copper (Cu) in acute exposures. We first performed acute toxicity tests to determine the Cu LC50 value for each species in water with varying characteristics. The biotic ligand model (BLM) was then calibrated using the toxicity data for these species together with binding properties specific to Cu. The BLM calibration involved the calculation of the level of Cu accumulation in the gills that resulted in 50% lethality (i.e., LA(50)). The LA(50) values for A. nobilis, C. idellus and C. carpio were 5.16, 11.60 and 9.00 nmol g(-1). The model calibrated to these data was improved by adjusting the Cu-proton exchange constant (pK (CuHA-A)) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to values of 1.84 and 4.67E-3 mol g(-1), respectively. The calibrated Cu-BLM was validated for these three common fish species by comparing predicted and observed LC50 values, which were in agreement to within a factor of 2. The results of this study provide an important contribution to ecological risk assessment and establishment of water quality criteria for Cu in China.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				JAN	2017	98	1					22	26		10.1007/s00128-016-1999-9								WOS:000392321300005	27928618

Two new in situ passive sampling techniques, high-resolution pore-water equilibrators (HR-Peeper) and zirconium oxide-based diffusive gradients in thin films (Zr-oxide DGT), were combined to measure dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) (C-Peeper) and labile phosphorus (C-DGT) at five sites in South Dongting and West Dongting Lakes. The vertical distribution of C-Peeper and C-DGT displayed similarity, which demonstrated that the buffering capacity of the labile P in sediments was similar at different depths. The diffusion flux of P from the sediments at the sediment-water interface ranged from 1.9 to 88 ng m(-2) day(-1), with an average value of 38 ng m(-2) day(-1). The P flux at the entrances to the Yuan, Li and Zi Rivers was fairly large at all five sites. The sediments at the five sites released P into overlying water, indicating that the sediments are an important source of P for Dongting Lake.																	1448-2517	1449-8979					2017	14	1					48	54		10.1071/EN16072								WOS:000392205800006						
J	Arslan, H				Arslan, Hakan			Determination of temporal and spatial variability of groundwater irrigation quality using geostatistical techniques on the coastal aquifer of Carsamba Plain, Turkey, from 1990 to 2012	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study was conducted to investigate variations in groundwater quality parameters between 1990 and 2012, and to assess the suitability of groundwater for irrigation. Groundwater samples were taken in the summers of 1990 and 2012, and hydrochemical characteristics were investigated through Piper and USSL diagrams. The electrical conductivity (EC), sodium percentage (% Na), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), magnesium hazard (MR), potential salinity (PS), and Kelly's ratios (KI) were used as the indicators for the water quality. Water quality parameters were assessed through geostatistical techniques and geographical information systems. Initially, semivariograms were determined for each water quality index, and spatial distribution maps were created for each sampling period through ordinary kriging techniques. Results revealed excessive increases in EC, Na, and Cl values with time. EC values of groundwater were over 1.25 dS/m in 4.64% of the study area in 1990. The area increased to 37.38% in the year 2012. With regard to the Kelly Index, there were not any problems in the study area in 1990, but problems were encountered over 5.75% of the study area in the year 2012. While the ratio of problematic sites with regard to RSC was 2.44% in 1990, the ratio increased to 12.13% in the year 2012. Similar increases were also observed in other water quality parameters except for MR. Higher deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters through the eastern sections of the study area. From 1990 to 2012, increased deteriorations were observed in water quality parameters, and excessive groundwater withdrawal and resultant seawater intrusion were considered as the basic reasons for such deteriorations. Therefore, groundwater withdrawals along the coastal lines should be performed in a controlled fashion, and water quality should continuously be monitored.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							38	10.1007/s12665-016-6375-x								WOS:000392286300038

The threat to groundwater contamination is increasing day by day due to rapid increase in industrialization and urbanization. The present study aims at assessing the groundwater quality contamination threat around industrial cluster at Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation (RIICO) in Jaipur district of Rajasthan, India. The cluster does not have common effluent treatment plant, and very few units have their effluent treatment plants. Groundwater samples were collected around the industrial cluster and its vicinity and analyzed for major cations, anions and trace elements. The water quality data indicate that total dissolved solids exceed the drinking water standard set by the Bureau of Indian Standards in few samples, and trace elements of health significance are not detected in any sample. The soil analysis indicates that only the top surface near the point of disposal of the treated effluent is affected. In view of the thick alluvium of 60-80 m and the water table above 30 m, the effluents are retarded significantly before reaching the water table. The sodium adsorption ratio of water samples indicates its suitability for irrigation and falls in the category of fairly suitable to excellent. Piper plot reveals that dominant cations are Na+, K++ and Mg++ and dominant anions are HCO3- and CO3-. The Gibbs plot indicates that rock-water interactions influence the groundwater quality. The study reveals that the groundwater quality from most of the sources meets the requirements of drinking water standards, and there is enough environmental space available for the expansion of industrial belt in this RIICO hub.

Reconstructing the formation of a costal aquifer in Nampula province, Mozambique, from ERT and IP methods for water prospection	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												In continental margin basins, the hydrogeological setting is complex due to transgression/regression events that removed old sediments in the basin and formed new geologic units. Due to the geological complexity, the use of vertical electrical sounding has proven to be insufficient for groundwater explorations. The lack of understanding the geological underground has resulted in many boreholes with low yield or poor water quality. By performing electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and induced polarization (IP) measurements in 11 villages in Mongicual district, three different layers covering the basement were identified: a weathered autochthon layer, a weathered allochthon layer (paleo-coastal dune) and eolian white sand layer. The drilling at successful boreholes penetrates formations where the resistivity value is between 220 and 770 Omega m, whereas at unsuccessful boreholes the lower parts of the drilled range have resistivity values higher than 770 Omega m. Also, the thickness ratio of the weathered and semi-weathered layer in the unsuccessful boreholes is less than 1/3, whereas in all successful boreholes the ration is higher than 1/2. The difference between autochthon and allochthon layers was detected by heavy minerals content in the red eolian sand layer (Tupuito formation) that increased the chargeability value. The groundwater with a conductivity higher than 2000 mu S/cm is linked to the white eolian sand. The surface extension of white eolian sand layer is small to be mapped; therefore, bymapping the eolian white sand formation and the use of ERT and enhanced with IP method would lower the failure rate.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							36	10.1007/s12665-016-6364-0								WOS:000392286300036

This study has been done according to available information in the databank of Khuzestan Water and Power Authority and also new measures in the area. Based on available data, the water quality of Kheirabad and Zohre River in sampling stations is not suitable for drinking. The study area is located on Khuzestan Province-Behbahan city, Iran. The hardness of water samples is in the category of very hard (over 300 ppm CaCO3), and Fe, Mn and Pb values are more than standards. In new sampling and 12-month monitoring of anions, cations, heavy metals and microbial parameters indicate that Hg, Cd, Cr, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, OC, T-coliforms and fecal coliforms in all stations for agricultural purposes and surface waters are more than standards and the sewage factories near the river have a noticeable effect on these contaminations. Furthermore, the high values of phosphate, ammonia and nitrate of some stations in wet seasons can be generated from agriculture wastes near the villages of the study area. In addition, because of outcrops of Gachsaran Formation in some stations, the concentration of ions is more than standards. So the results of Schuler diagrams indicate the water surface in the most cases is not suitable for drinking and based on Wilcox diagram all stations are located in C4S4 class.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							15	10.1007/s12665-016-6291-0								WOS:000392286300015

Surface water pathways and fluxes of metals under changing environmental conditions and human interventions in the Selenga River system	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												This paper presents the results of novel field campaigns in the extensive (447,000 km(2)) Selenga River basin, through which 304 samples of river water and 308 samples of suspended matter were collected during high and low water periods between 2011 and 2013. The Selenga River is the largest tributary (more than 50% of the inflow) to the Lake Baikal. Due to ongoing hydroclimatic change and human pressures under conditions of economic growth, the rivers of the area experience significant change in water quality. A key issue for improved understanding of regional impacts of the environmental change is to disentangle the influence of climate change from that of other pressures within the catchment. Our research aims to evaluate the pathways and mass flows of heavy metals and metalloids both in dissolved and suspended forms, taking a basin- scale perspective that previously has not been fully pursued in the Lake Baikal region. Results showed quality deterioration over short distances due to strong impact of hot spots from urban and industrial activities, including mining. The determined enrichment of dissolved metals in waters of Selenga River as well as the spatial and temporal variability of water and suspended sediment composition is further analyzed in the context of climatic, hydrological and land use drivers.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2017	76	1							1	10.1007/s12665-016-6304-z								WOS:000392286300001

Leather processing and its possible impact on groundwater quality in Silk Road sites: a case study from Chennai, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Water plays an important role in human civilisation. Since ancient times people started to settle in regions with ensured water availability. Trade was an important factor for the development of civilisation. Silk Road is an important route used for the trading between China and other countries across Eurasia. Not only silk, many goods including leather were exchanged during trading. Leather was processing lead to release of large amount of wastewater. This study was carried out to understand how the leather processing would have affected the groundwater quality in Silk Road sites by studying the current scenarios of groundwater quality near tanning industries. Chennai and nearby cities such as Ranipet and Vaniyambadi are chosen for case studies. Groundwater quality around the tanneries was poor due to high electrical conductivity and concentration of chromium. This is due to the effluents released by the tanneries into the ground or open drains without proper treatment. Similarly, the leather processing in Silk Road sites would have also affected the groundwater quality.

Some of these geothermal resources have been used for power generation and direct heating. Most of the high enthalpy geothermal systems are located in western part of Turkey. Alasehir is the most important geothermal site in western part of Turkey. Many geothermal wells have been drilled in Alasehir Plain to produce the geothermal fluid from the deep reservoir in the last 10 years. A blowout accident happened during a geothermal well drilling operation in Alasehir Plain, and significant amount of geothermal fluid surfaced out along the fault zone in three locations. When drilling string entered the reservoir rock about 1000 m, blowout occurred. As the well head preventer system was closed because of the blowout, high-pressure fluid surfaced out along the fault zone cutting the Neogene formation. In order to understand the geothermal fluid effects on groundwater chemistry, physical and chemical compositions of local cold groundwater were monitored from May 2012 to September 2014 in the study area. The geothermal fluid was found to be of Na-HCO3 water type, and especially, arsenic and boron concentrations reached levels as high as 3 and 127 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of arsenic and boron in the geothermal fluid and groundwater exceeded the maximum allowable limits given in the national and international standards for drinking water quality. According to temporally monitored results, geothermal fluid has extremely high mineral content which influenced the quality of groundwater resources of the area where water resource is commonly used for agricultural irrigation.

J	Varanka, S; Hjort, J				Varanka, Sanna; Hjort, Jan			Spatio-temporal aspects of the environmental factors affecting water quality in boreal rivers	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												River water quality is the outcome of multiple processes and factors, which vary spatially and temporally. In this study, the key spatial and temporal scales and the most important environmental factors explaining river water quality at these scales were analysed by generalized additive models (GAMs). Water quality was studied through total phosphorus (median = 61.9 mu g l(-1)) and nitrogen (1388.1 mu g l(-1)), pH (6.7) and water colour (143.3 mg Pt l(-1)). Environmental factors covered variables from land use/cover, climate and other landscape characteristics. The spatial scales used were the closest 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 m buffer zones around the river channel, in addition to the entire catchment area. Temporality was studied through the entire year and four periods, which were determined by the natural variation in discharge. In the comparison of spatial scales of environmental factors, the variation in phosphorus, nitrogen and water colour was best explained using environmental data from the broadest scale, the entire catchment. In contrast, the variation in pH was best explained using data from the closest (50 m) buffer zone, the riparian area. In modelling temporal scales, the variation in water quality variables was best explained during discharge maximum periods and when the environmental data covering the entire year were considered. Nutrients were related specifically to agriculture, water colour to lake percentage and pH to pastures. The results showed the suitability of GAMs in water quality studies.

Wastewater treatment using onsite sewage treatment and disposal systems (aka septic systems) is one source of nitrogen sources in the environment. This study presents a numerical study for estimating nitrogen load from septic systems to surface water bodies in the St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin, Florida, USA. The load estimation is conducted using an ArcGIS-based nitrogen load estimation toolkit, a screening-level modeling software that considers key mechanisms (i.e., advection, dispersion, and denitrification) controlling nitrogen transport as well as spatial variability of model parameters (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, porosity, septic system locations, and surface water bodies). The simulated nitrogen plumes and load estimates demonstrate the importance of considering spatial variability in the load estimation for nitrogen pollution management. The load estimates are strongly correlated with nitrogen concentrations in surface water quality data, suggesting that septic systems are an important factor for water quality deterioration in the St. Lucie River. The estimates can be used directly to support Basin Management Action Plan (BMAP). Evaluating the load estimates in the BMAP context indicates that nitrogen load from septic systems is a significant nitrogen source in the St. Lucie River and Estuary Basin. It is found in this study that the load estimates depend on lengths of flow paths, groundwater flow velocities, and soil drainage conditions. These findings are useful for nitrogen pollution management in similar areas facing nitrogen pollution problems.

J	Sarvilinna, A; Lehtoranta, V; Hjerppe, T				Sarvilinna, Auri; Lehtoranta, Virpi; Hjerppe, Turo			Are Urban Stream Restoration Plans Worth Implementing?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												To manage and conserve ecosystems in a more sustainable way, it is important to identify the importance of the ecosystem services they provide and understand the connection between natural and socio-economic systems. Historically, streams have been an underrated part of the urban environment. Many of them have been straightened and often channelized under pressure of urbanization. However, little knowledge exists concerning the economic value of stream restoration or the value of the improved ecosystem services. We used the contingent valuation method to assess the social acceptability of a policy-level water management plan in the city of Helsinki, Finland, and the values placed on improvements in a set of ecosystem services, accounting for preference uncertainty. According to our study, the action plan would provide high returns on restoration investments, since the benefit-cost ratio was 15-37. Moreover, seventy-two percent of the respondents willing to pay for stream restoration chose "I want to conserve streams as a part of urban nature for future generations" as the most motivating reason. Our study indicates that the water management plan for urban streams in Helsinki has strong public support. If better marketed to the population within the watershed, the future projects could be partly funded by the local residents, making the projects easier to accomplish. The results of this study can be used in planning, management and decision making related to small urban watercourses.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				JAN	2017	59	1					10	20		10.1007/s00267-016-0778-z								WOS:000392061800002	27812794					
J	Akurut, M; Niwagaba, CB; Willems, P				Akurut, Mary; Niwagaba, Charles B.; Willems, Patrick			Long-term variations of water quality in the Inner Murchison Bay, Lake Victoria	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The water quality in the Inner Murchison Bay (IMB) located in Uganda on the northern shores of Lake Victoria is affected by a complex mixture of processes and driving factors including pollution, river inflows, lake water levels, wetland management and flora and fauna populations. This study attempts to explain long-term variations of the IMB water quality and to provide a plausible water quality model. Because intermittent monitoring around the Bay hinders accurate determination of pollution, concentrations at the extreme northern shores (hotspots) are considered indicative of the pollutant loading into the bay. Delft3D-Flow was applied to study the Bay hydrodynamics and coupled with the Delwaq module to investigate water quality processes related to oxygen: organic and nutrient components i.e. dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonium (NH4+). It is found that the IMB water quality deteriorated exponentially in the period 2001-2014 due to increased pollution and the high residence time of water. The worst water quality was in 2010 when diffuse pollution intensified due to the lining of more drainage channels within Kampala City in addition to the declining wetland effect. The water quality towards the Outer Murchison Bay (OMB) deteriorated over time with dilution accounting for 40-60% of pollutant reduction. Although the effect of lake level variations is negligible compared to pollution into the IMB, increased lake levels after 2011 improved DO levels and mixing and hence BOD levels in the IMB.

Metal pollution, in particular, is a reported consequence of elevated anthropogenic inputs, especially from urbanized areas. The objectives of this study were to quantify metal (Cu, Al, Cd, Ni, and Pb) concentrations in the waters and biota of four streams in South Georgia, USA, and relate metal concentrations to land use and abiotic and biotic stream processes. Additionally, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish were identified to assess biodiversity at each site. Metal concentrations in the three trophic levels differed among sites and species, correlating to differences in land use surrounding the rivers. The highest metal concentrations (except Al) were found in the streams most impacted by urbanization and development. Al concentrations were highest in streams surrounded by land dominated by forested areas. Metal content in macrophytes reflected metal concentrations in the water and was at least three orders of magnitude higher than any other trophic level. Despite metal concentration differences, all four streams contained similar water quality and were healthy based on macroinvertebrate community structure. This study provides insight into the impact of urbanization and the fate and effects of metals in river ecosystems with varying degrees of anthropogenic impact.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2017	189	1							23	10.1007/s10661-016-5738-9								WOS:000392300300023	27987131

Thermotolerant coliform loadings to coastal areas of Santa Catarina (Brazil) evidence the effect of growing urbanisation and insufficient provision of sewerage infrastructure	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Thermotolerant coliform (TC) loadings were quantified for 49 catchments draining into the North and South Bays of Santa Catarina (SC, southeastern Brazil), an area known for its tourism and aquaculture. TC loadings were calculated based on flow measurements taken in 26 rivers. TC concentrations ere quantified based on surface water samples collected at 49 catchment outlets in 2012 and 2013. Median TC loads ranged from 3.7 x 10(3) to 6.8 x 10(8) MPN s(-1). TC loadings in the catchments increased in proportion to increases in resident human population, population density and percentage of urbanised area. Catchments with more than 60% of area covered by wastewater collection and treatment systems had higher TC loads per person than catchments with less than 25%. Based on the study catchments, these results indicate that current sewerage infrastructure is ineffective in reducing contamination of faecal origin to surface waters. These findings have important implications for the management of microbiological health hazards in bathing, recreational and shellfish aquaculture waters in the North and South Bays of Santa Catarina Island.

J	Jones, C; Kim, SW; Schilling, K				Jones, Christopher; Kim, Sea-Won; Schilling, Keith			Use of continuous monitoring to assess stream nitrate flux and transformation patterns	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Delivery of nitrogen from farmed fields to the stream network is an ongoing water quality issue in central North America and other parts of the world. Although fertilization and other farming practices have been refined to produce environmental improvements, stemming loss of nitrogen, especially in the soluble nitrate form, is a problem that has seemingly defied solution. The Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy is a policy initiative designed to implement conservation and other farm management practices to produce reductions in nitrate loading. The strategy does not focus on how the streams themselves may or may not be processing nitrogen and reducing downstream loading. We used continuous high-frequency nitrate and discharge monitoring over 3 years at two sites separated by 18 km in a low-order, agricultural stream in eastern Iowa to estimate how nitrogen is processed, and whether or not these processes are reducing downstream loading. We conclude that the upstream to downstream nitrate concentration decline between the two sites was not driven by denitrification. These data also show that nitrate concentrations are closely coupled to discharge during periods of adequate moisture, but decoupling of concentration from discharge occurs during dry periods. This decoupling is a possible indicator of in-stream nitrate processing. Finally, nitrate concentrations are likely diluted by water sourced from non-row crop land covers in the lower reaches of the watershed.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JAN	2017	189	1							35	10.1007/s10661-016-5749-6								WOS:000392300300035	28013474

Trophic state assessment of Bhindawas Lake, Haryana, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Trophic state allows for identification of problems and pressures that an ecosystem faces as well as demarcation of remedial measures. This study focuses on spatial and temporal variations in the trophic state and detection of possible causes of its divergence in Bhindawas Lake, India. The trophic state of the lake undulated between eutrophic and hyper-eutrophic state throughout the study period. Higher phosphorus concentration within the lake ecosystem is the dominant causal factor for its eutrophic state. The influence of other water quality parameters has also been analyzed using Spearman's coefficient of correlation. Deviations between trophic state index (TSI)-chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), TSI-total phosphorus (TP), and TSI-Secchi depth (SD) pointed out that the lake is principally phosphorus limited, and its trophic status is influenced by non-algal turbidity to a large extent. Spatial analysis of trophic levels in geographic information system (GIS) helped in identification of pollution sources and chemical attributes affecting the trophic state of the lake. This study provides a rationale for further investigation of nutrient and sediment loading into the lake system and development of sustainable management and conservation strategy identifying suitable measures ascertaining the ecosystem integrity.

A way to detect Ni is the use of whole-cell biosensors. The aim of the present work was to build a light-emitting bacterial biosensor for the detection of Ni with high specificity and low detection limit properties. For that purpose, the regulatory circuit implemented relied on the RcnR Ni/Co metallo-regulator and its rcnA natural target promoter fused to the lux reporter genes. To convert RcnR to specifically detect Ni, several mutations were tested and the C35A retained. Deleting the Ni efflux pump rcnA and introducing genes encoding several Niuptake systems lowered the detection thresholds. When these constructs were assayed in several Escherichia coli strains, it appeared that the detection thresholds were highly variable. The TD2158 wild-type E. coli gave rise to a biosensor ten times more active and sensitive than its W3110 E. coli K12 equivalent. This biosensor was able to confidently detect Ni concentrations as little as 80 nM (4.7 mu g l(-1)), which makes its use compatible with the norms governing the drinking water quality.

The key challenge of the COMBITOX project is to develop a unique instrument that can accommodate several biodetector systems (see the accompanying COMBITOX papers) able to detect different pollutants such as bacteria, toxins, and heavy metals. The output signal chosen by our consortium is based on luminescence detection. Our group recently developed phage-based biosensors using gfp as a reporter gene to detect enteric bacteria in complex environments such as sea water, and the main challenge we faced was to adapt our biodetector to a luminescent signal that could fit the COMBITOX project requirements. Another key point was to use a substrate-independent reporter system in order to avoid substrate addition in the detection prototype. This paper describes the development of a phage-based biodetector using a luminescent and substrate-independent output to detect some enteric bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, in water samples. We have successfully engineered various prototypes using the HK620 and HK97 bacteriophages that use different packaging systems, and both proved functional for the integration of the full luxCDABE operon controlled by two different bacterial promoters. We show that the luxCDABE operon controlled by the PrplU bacterial promoter is the most efficient in terms of signal emission. The emission of luminescence is specific and allows the detection of 10(4) bacteria per milliliter in 1.5 h post-infection with neither a concentration nor enrichment step.

Results of the continuous 68-day experiment showed that calcium nitrate was the most effective for controlling phosphorus concentration in overlying and interstitial water, where the efficiency of locking phosphorus was > 97 and 90 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the addition of calcium nitrate caused Fe/Al-bound phosphorus (Fe/Al-P) content in sediment declining but Ca-bound phosphorus (Ca-P) and organic phosphorus (OP) content ascending. The phosphorus-locking efficiency of sponge-iron in overlying and interstitial water was > 72 and 66 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the total phosphorus (TP), OP, Fe/Al-P, and Ca-P content in sediment increased by 33.8, 7.7, 23.1, and 23.1 %, respectively, implying that under the action of sponge-iron, the locked phosphorus in sediment was mainly inorganic form and the phosphorus-locking efficiency of sponge-iron could be stable and persistent. In addition, the phosphorus-locking efficiency of fly ash was transient and limited, let alone silica alumina clay had almost no capacity for phosphorus-locking efficiency. Therefore, calcium nitrate and sponge-iron were excellent phosphorus-locking agents to repair the seriously polluted water derived from an internal source.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2017	24	1					264	274		10.1007/s11356-016-7796-5								WOS:000392105700025	27714656

However, the DIN sources are poorly constrained. In this study, the contributions of major sources in the Taipei metropolitan area to the DIN export in the Danshui River were investigated. It is observed that ammonium is the major DIN species in the downstream reaches, resulting from the ammonium-dominated inputs of the effluents of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and rain water pumping stations (RWPS). DIN concentrations in the downstream (urban) reaches are substantially elevated. The upstream tributaries annually discharge similar to 2709 t DIN to the downstream reaches. However, the DIN discharge off the downstream reaches rises to similar to 17,918 t, resulting from the contribution of RWPS-collected water, i.e., similar to 14,632 t, and the effluents of two WWTP, i.e., similar to 577 t. RWPS-collected water inherently contains the contribution of atmospheric deposition, similar to 2937 t DIN. This finding implies that similar to 11,695 t (similar to 66 % of the downstream output) DIN flux off the Danshui River is from urban runoff and can be attributed to human activities in the Taipei metropolitan area. To improve the water quality in the Danshui River, water quality controls in urban runoff are important.

Despite the potential use of sewage water in crop irrigation as effective and sustainable strategy, the environmental and human risks behind this use need to be deeply investigated. In this regard, an experiment was carried out under field conditions in Nursery, University College of Agriculture Sargodha, to evaluate the possible health risks of undesirable metals in wheat grains. Wheat variety Sarang was cultivated and irrigated with different combinations of ground (GW) and sewage water (SW). The concentrations of heavy metals (Cr, Cd, Ni, and Pb) and trace elements (Cu, Zn, and Fe) in wheat grains as well as in soil were determined. Moreover, the pollution load index (PLI), accumulation factor (AF), daily intake of metals (DIM), and health risk index (HRI) were calculated. Results showed that the concentration trend of heavy metals was Pb<Cr<Cu<Ni<Cd<Zn<Fe and Cr<Cu<Pb<Cd<Ni<Fe<Zn in soil and wheat, respectively. Among metals, Cd concentration in wheat exceeded the permissible limits regardless water quality, whereas Pb concentration in grain was within the acceptable levels as suggested by World Health Organization, when 100 % of SW was used for irrigation. Similar observation was reported for Cd concentration in the soil when wheat was irrigated with 100 % SW. In comparison to soil, the edible part of wheat presented lower concentration of all studied metals, except for Zn which was much higher compared to the tested soil samples. The higher concentration of Zn was responsible for increasing the DIM of Zn where, in average, the highest value was reported, particularly in 75 % SW treatment. This was reflected also in HRI where the maximum value was reported for Zinc under the same treatment. Higher value of HRI for wheat cultivated on polluted soils suggested that appropriate management of cultivated area is necessary for food safety and thus for public health. The results are expected to create awareness among the public on the safety of consuming food products grown in particular areas.

The results showed that the optimal growth conditions of strain F11 were (1) ammonia-nitrogen (N), nitrite-N, or nitrate-N as sole N source; (2) initial ammonia-N concentration of 10-30 mg N/l; (3), initial nitrite-N concentration of 200 mg N/l; (4) sodium citrate as carbon source; (5) rotation (r) speed of 200 r/min; a C:N ratio of between 2 and 10; (6) culture at 32-37 A degrees C. The addition of P. stutzeri F11 to the experimental grass carp aquaculture system reduced the levels of ammonia-N, nitrite-N, and total N in the water over an extended range, but had no effect on nitrate-N level. Results of the 454 pyrosequencing analysis indicated that the structure of the microbial community in the aquaculture water changed significantly after the addition of P. stutzeri F11 preparations. The addition of P. stutzeri F11 to the aquaculture system also altered the microbiome metabolism in the water, especially the bacteria involved in nitrogen metabolism. These results suggest that the addition of P. stutzeri F11 to an experimental grass carp aquaculture system decrease nitrogen levels and alter the microbial community structure of the water; as such, this bacterial strain could be a potential candidate for the regulation of water quality in aquaculture systems.																	0919-9268	1444-2906				JAN	2017	83	1					89	98		10.1007/s12562-016-1038-0								WOS:000392065700010

The Multiple Stressor Ecological Risk Assessment for the Mercury-Contaminated South River and Upper Shenandoah River Using the Bayesian Network-Relative Risk Model	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												We have conducted a regional scale risk assessment using the Bayesian Network Relative Risk Model (BN-RRM) to calculate the ecological risks to the South River and upper Shenandoah River study area. Four biological endpoints (smallmouth bass, white sucker, Belted Kingfisher, and Carolina Wren) and 4 abiotic endpoints (Fishing River Use, Swimming River Use, Boating River Use, and Water Quality Standards) were included in this risk assessment, based on stakeholder input. Although mercury (Hg) contamination was the original impetus for the site being remediated, other chemical and physical stressors were evaluated. There were 3 primary conclusions from the BN-RRM results. First, risk varies according to location, type and quality of habitat, and exposure to stressors within the landscape. The patterns of risk can be evaluated with reasonable certitude. Second, overall risk to abiotic endpoints was greater than overall risk to biotic endpoints. By including both biotic and abiotic endpoints, we are able to compare risk to endpoints that represent a wide range of stakeholder values. Third, whereas Hg reduction is the regulatory priority for the South River, Hg is not the only stressor driving risk to the endpoints. Ecological and habitat stressors contribute risk to the endpoints and should be considered when managing this site. This research provides the foundation for evaluating the risks of multiple stressors of the South River to a variety of endpoints. From this foundation, tools for the evaluation of management options and an adaptive management tools have been forged. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017; 13: 85-99.

The 2 remediation options were 1) bank stabilization (BST) and 2) the implementation of best management practices for agriculture (AgBMPs) to reduce Hg input in to the river. Eight endpoints were chosen to be part of the risk assessment, based on stakeholder input. Although Hg contamination was the original impetus for the site being remediated, multiple chemical and physical stressors were evaluated in this analysis. Specific models were built that incorporated the changes expected from AgBMP and BST and were based on our previous research. Changes in risk were calculated, and sensitivity and influence analyses were conducted on the models. The assessments indicated that AgBMP would only slightly change risk in the study area but that negative impacts were also unlikely. Bank stabilization would reduce risk to Hg for the smallmouth bass and belted kingfisher and increase risk to abiotic water quality endpoints. However, if care were not taken to prevent loss of nesting habitat to belted kingfisher, an increase in risk to that species would occur. Because Hg was only one of several stressors contributing to risk, the change in risk depended on the specific endpoint. Sensitivity analysis provided a list of variables to be measured as part of a monitoring program. Influence analysis provided the range of maximum and minimum risk values for each endpoint and remediation option. This research demonstrates the applicability of ecological risk assessment and specifically the BN-RRM as part of a long-term adaptive management scheme for managing contaminated sites.

There are few reports on the domestic water availability in Lao PDR, which is composed of quality and quantity. The aim of this study was set to determine actual domestic water use and quality conditions during the rainy season in Vientiane, Laos to reveal seasonal variations in domestic water quality. In the target region, the supplied water and the deep and shallow well water were used for the domestic water sources. The different sources were taken depending on the purpose. On the whole, the quality of the supplied water was much better than that of the deep well water, which contrasted with the residents' understanding. The quality of the shallow well water varied in the rainy season due to a dilution effect on many items except NH4+, TP, PO43- and coliform bacteria. Some shallow well with a very high NH4+ concentration implied contamination from a leaking sewer through the groundwater. The shallow well water used in the kitchens of some households may have bad health effects because of coliform contamination.																	0021-8588	1881-0136				JAN	2017	73	1			SI		45	50		10.2480/agrmet.D-16-00001								WOS:000392260100007

Numerical Investigation of Temporal Variation of Density Flow and Parameters	JOURNAL OF APPLIED FLUID MECHANICS												Experimental investigations and observations indicate that water quality modeling is related to the formation of flows in the dam reservoirs. Correct estimation of dam reservoir flow, plunging point and plunging depth are very important for the dam reservoir sedimentation and water quality problem. Therefore, inflow river water into a dam is modeled in two dimensions through a reservoir with sloping bottom. The model is developed using nonlinear and unsteady continuity, momentum, energy and k-epsilon turbulence model equations. The equations of the model are solved based on the initial and boundary conditions of the dam reservoir flow for a range of bottom slopes. In addition to velocity, temperature and turbulence viscosity variation through the dam reservoir, the effects of density flow parameters such as plunging depths, plunging points, mixing fate are determined from the simulation results. The results of the present model are compared to the previous experimental works and the mathematical models.																	1735-3572	1735-3645				JAN	2017	10	1	1				81	94										WOS:000392357300008

Passive Biological Treatment of Mine Water to Reduce Conductivity: Potential Designs, Challenges, and Research Needs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The remediation of mine water to preserve receiving water quality has advanced substantially over the past half century, but prospective regulations to limit the conductivity of mining-impacted waters pose a significant new challenge. Conventional approaches to reduce high levels of conductivity in these mine waters are often costly, requiring high levels of maintenance and significant inputs of energy and refined chemicals. In contrast, passive biological treatment (PBT) systems are a relatively low-cost, low-maintenance treatment technology for mine waters that have been used for over three decades. However, their practical ability to reduce conductivity is unclear, given previous research reports focused on the removal of metals, acidity, and solids. A systematic literature review to identify previous reports of PBT systems at the laboratory or field scale that include evaluations of changes in conductivity suggests that decreases in conductivity of 30 to 40% are achievable. Substantial variability in performance is common, however, and conductivity increased markedly in some systems. This variation may be associated with the dissolution of limestone, which is a key treatment material in some systems. Although the development of PBT to serve as pre, post-, or stand-alone treatment systems targeting conductivity may reduce overall treatment cost in some settings, optimization of these designs requires an increase in the number of published conductivity datasets from similar systems, detailed reports on the key ions contributing to elevated conductivity region to region, and further investigation of the underlying biochemical processes responsible for conductivity reductions.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2017	46	1					1	9		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0216								WOS:000392271400001	28177423

Modeling Patterns of Total Dissolved Solids Release from Central Appalachia, USA, Mine Spoils	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Surface mining in the central Appalachian coalfields (USA) influences water quality because the interaction of infiltrated waters and O-2 with freshly exposed mine spoils releases elevated levels of total dissolved solids (TDS) to streams. Modeling and predicting the short-and long-term TDS release potentials of mine spoils can aid in the management of current and future mining-influenced watersheds and landscapes. In this study, the specific conductance (SC, a proxy variable for TDS) patterns of 39 mine spoils during a sequence of 40 leaching events were modeled using a five-parameter nonlinear regression. Estimated parameter values were compared to six rapid spoil assessment techniques (RSATs) to assess predictive relationships between model parameters and RSATs. Spoil leachates reached maximum values, 1108 +/- 161 mu S cm(-1) on average, within the first three leaching events, then declined exponentially to a breakpoint at the 16th leaching event on average. After the breakpoint, SC release remained linear, with most spoil samples exhibiting declines in SC release with successive leaching events. The SC asymptote averaged 276 +/- 25 mu S cm(-1). Only three samples had SCs > 500 mu S cm(-1) at the end of the 40 leaching events. Model parameters varied with mine spoil rock and weathering type, and RSATs were predictive of four model parameters. Unweathered samples released higher SCs throughout the leaching period relative to weathered samples, and rock type influenced the rate of SC release. The RSATs for SC, total S, and neutralization potential may best predict certain phases of mine spoil TDS release.

Small Reservoirs as a Beneficial Management Practice for Nitrogen Removal	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												There are few beneficial management practices (BMPs) with demonstrated efficacy in snowmelt-dominated regions. Small reservoirs are a BMP that can help mitigate flooding and reduce sediment transport, while reducing export of dissolved nutrients. To understand controls on nitrate removal and assess how this ecosystem service can be optimized, denitrification activity was measured in reservoirs and stream pools of the Tobacco Creek Model Watershed (Manitoba, Canada) via the chloramphenicol-amended acetylene block technique. Denitrification activity was positively correlated with nitrate and sediment organic carbon (SOC), and negatively correlated with sediment particle size and pH. Reservoirs exhibited higher denitrification activity than stream pools and were associated with higher levels of SOC, higher nitrate in early summer, and lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Nitrate was added to a set of samples to test for nitrate saturation, an indicator of poor ecological status, where nitrate concentrations exceed the denitrification capacity of microbes. Forty-nine percent of measurements demonstrated nitrate saturation, indicative of the need for additional remediation activity. Findings from this research suggest this BMP has higher capacity for nitrogen removal than stream pools because of higher denitrification rates and a higher apparent threshold for nitrate saturation, coupled with increased residence times. Results also inform the construction of additional reservoirs, which have been identified as a priority BMP in this region. Siting reservoirs in areas where conditions contribute to buildup of fine sediments and planting riparian vegetation to foster high organic C availability may help optimize denitrification, although tradeoffs in terms of other ecosystem services must be considered.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2017	46	1					96	104		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0252								WOS:000392271400012	28177420

The Relationship between Land Use and Vulnerability to Nitrogen and Phosphorus Pollution in an Urban Watershed	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Characterization of the vulnerability of water bodies to pollution from natural and anthropogenic sources requires understanding the relationship between land use and water quality. This study aims (i) to explore the influence of upstream land use on annual stream water concentrations and loads of total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) and (ii) to characterize the vulnerability of water bodies to TN and TP pollution as a function of land use under varying climatic conditions. Multiple linear regression models were used across 23 stream locations within the Jordan Lake watershed in North Carolina between 1992 and 2012 to explore land use-water quality relationships. The percentage of urban land use and wastewater treatment plant capacity were the most important factors with strong (R-2 > 0.7) and significant (p < 0.01) positive correlations with annual TN and TP concentrations and loads. Percent agricultural land was negatively correlated with TN in 18 out of 21 yr of the study period. Using analysis of covariance, significant (p < 0.01) differences were determined between models developed for urban land use with TN and TP loads based on annual precipitation. Using concentrations instead of loads resulted in a nonsignificant difference between models for average and wet years. Finally, a procedure was developed to characterize the vulnerability to TN and TP pollution, computed as the probability of exceeding the nutrient standard limits. Results indicated that the vulnerability to TN and TP was controlled primarily by urban land use, with higher values in dry years than normal and wet years.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2017	46	1					113	122		10.2134/jeq2016.06.0239								WOS:000392271400014	28177402

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Cumulative daily load time series show that the early 2000s marked a step-change increase in riverine soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) loads entering the Western Lake Erie Basin from three major tributaries: the Maumee, Sandusky, and Raisin Rivers. These elevated SRP loads have been sustained over the last 12 yr. Empirical regression models were used to estimate the contributions from (i) increased runoff from changing weather and precipitation patterns and (ii) increased SRP delivery (the combined effects of increased source availability and/or increased transport efficiency of labile phosphorus [P] fractions). Approximately 65% of the SRP load increase after 2002 was attributable to increased SRP delivery, with higher runoff volumes accounting for the remaining 35%. Increased SRP delivery occurred concomitantly with declining watershed P budgets. However, within these watersheds, there have been long-term, largescale changes in land management: reduced tillage to minimize erosion and particulate P loss, and increased tile drainage to improve field operations and profitability. These practices can inadvertently increase labile P fractions at the soil surface and transmission of soluble P via subsurface drainage. Our findings suggest that changes in agricultural practices, including some conservation practices designed to reduce erosion and particulate P transport, may have had unintended, cumulative, and converging impacts contributing to the increased SRP loads, reaching a critical threshold around 2002.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2017	46	1					123	132		10.2134/jeq2016.07.0248								WOS:000392271400015	28177409

Effects on the Underlying Water Column by Extensive Floating Treatment Wetlands	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are an emerging engineering option with promise for simultaneous water quality improvement and habitat creation. Relatively little research has been published regarding their construction or effects on the underlying water column. In this field-scale experiment, four different extensive FTW designs were constructed using minimal materials, including drainpipe, burlap, mulch, utility netting, and reused polyethylene bottles. The FTWs were then planted with Typha spp. (cattail) and Juncus effusus L. (common rush). Over 28 mo, the water column beneath FTWs in two test ponds was compared to that in an open water control pond. The ponds (190 +/- 10 m(2)) were fed with well water enriched with nitrate to emulate agricultural ponds. Although observed differences were relatively small, statistically significant differences were noted. With respect to the control, waters underneath FTWs had lower dissolved oxygen, sulfate, nitrate, and pH, dampened diurnal temperature fluctuations, and greater alkalinity. The FTWs created habitat and were colonized by species of insects, birds, amphibians, snails, and spiders. Results indicated that Typha spp. is suitable for FTW creation. However, a more supportive planting matrix is suggested to encourage faster plant growth and protect against wind and wave action damage. Although plant growth was limited, results suggest that FTWs may be applied to encourage less aerobic and more organic rich and thermally insulated conditions for water quality improvement in agricultural ponds and other aquatic systems while also creating valuable habitat.

Use pattern of pesticides and their predicted mobility into shallow groundwater and surface water bodies of paddy lands in Mahaweli river basin in Sri Lanka	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES												Pesticides applied on agricultural lands reach groundwater by leaching, and move to offsite water bodies by direct runoff, erosion and spray drift. Therefore, an assessment of the mobility of pesticides in water resources is important to safeguard such resources. Mobility of pesticides on agricultural lands of Mahaweli river basin in Sri Lanka has not been reported to date. In this context, the mobility potential of 32 pesticides on surface water and groundwater was assessed by widely used pesticide risk indicators, such as Attenuation Factor (AF) index and the Pesticide Impact Rating Index (PIRI) with some modifications. Four surface water bodies having greater than 20% land use of the catchment under agriculture, and shallow groundwater table at 3.0m depth were selected for the risk assessment. According to AF, carbofuran, quinclorac and thiamethoxam are three most leachable pesticides having AF values 1.44 x 10(-2), 1.87 x 10(-3) and 5.70 x 10(-4), respectively. Using PIRI, offsite movement of pesticides by direct runoff was found to be greater than with the erosion of soil particles for the study area. Carbofuran and quinclorac are most mobile pesticides by direct runoff with runoff fractions of 0.01 and 0.08, respectively, at the studied area. Thiamethoxam and novaluron are the most mobile pesticides by erosion with erosion factions of 1.02 x 10(-4) and 1.05 x 10(-4), respectively. Expected pesticide residue levels in both surface and groundwater were predicted to remain below the USEPA health advisory levels, except for carbofuran, indicating that pesticide pollution is unlikely to exceed the available health guidelines in the Mahaweli river basin in Sri Lanka.

The quality and the renewability of irrigation groundwater are essential for the stock raising and agricultural production. Shallow groundwater was sampled and analyzed for various variables. The salinity sodium concentration and bicarbonate hazard, were examined with regard to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) irrigation water standards. The concentration of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was determined to analyze the age of groundwater. Most groundwater samples labeled as excellent to good for irrigation with low salinity hazard or medium salinity hazard. Four groundwater samples were good and suspected for irrigation with high salinity hazard. Generally groundwater in Sanjiang Plain was younger than the groundwater in Songnen Plain. Meanwhile, groundwater nearby river is younger than the groundwater further away inside the watershed. The mean age of groundwater in Sanjiang Plain is in average of 44.1, 47.9 and 32.8 years by CFC-11 (CCI3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2) and CFC-113 (C2CI3F3), respectively. The mean ages of groundwater in Songnen Plain is in average of 46.1, 53.4, and 40.7 years by CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-113, respectively. Thus, groundwater nearby rivers could be directly exploited as irrigation water. Partial groundwater has to be processed to lower the salt concentration rather than directly utilized as irrigation water in Songnen Plain. Both water quality and renewability should be put in mind for sustainable agricultural development and water resources management.				zhang, bing/C-1476-2010	zhang, bing/0000-0003-3904-3107												2095-3119						2017	16	1					229	238		10.1016/S2095-3119(16)61349-7								WOS:000392368400024

The total amount of organic carbon recorded during the period 2000-2014 was 11.4 times that of SO4 (2-). The amounts of organic carbon and SO4 (2-) removed through landfill gas were 16.0 and 6.1 %, respectively, during the same period. The COD/SO4 (2-) ratio of the leachate was 10.9 in 2001, which drastically decreased to 4.5 in 2007 by the increase in CH4 concentration; thereafter, no great variations in this ratio were observed up to 2014. It was found that the concentration of H2S sharply increased after methane concentrations reached their highest levels. The year around 2006 may be the equilibrium time point among the waste supply, LFG generation, and leachate water quality. In conclusion, if the ratio of landfill organic carbon to SO4 (2-) is about 10, and the COD/SO4 (2-) ratio is about 9 in the state of equilibrium, there appears to be no hindrance to the generation of CH4 and H2S.																	1438-4957	1611-8227				JAN	2017	19	1					443	452		10.1007/s10163-015-0441-4								WOS:000392385300045

Spatial fit between water quality policies and hydrologic ecosystem services in an urbanizing agricultural landscape	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Sustaining hydrologic ecosystem services is critical for human wellbeing but challenged by land use for agriculture and urban development. Water policy and management strive to safeguard hydrologic services, yet implementation is often fragmented. Understanding the spatial fit between water polices and hydrologic services is needed to assess the spatial targeting of policy portfolios at landscape scales. We investigated spatial fit between 30 different public water policies and four hydrologic services (surface and groundwater quality, freshwater supply, and flood regulation) in the Yahara Watershed (Wisconsin, USA)-a Midwestern landscape that typifies tensions between agriculture, urban development, and freshwater resources. Spatial extent of water policy implementation was mapped, and indicators of hydrologic services were quantified for subwatersheds using empirical estimates and validated spatial models. We found a spatial misfit between the overall spatial implementation of water policy and regions of water quality concern, indicating a need for better targeting. Water quality policies can also be leveraged to protect other hydrologic services such as freshwater supply and flood regulation. Individual policy application areas varied substantially in their spatial congruence with each hydrologic service, indicating that not all services are protected by a single policy and highlighting the need for a broad spectrum of policies to sustain hydrologic services in diverse landscapes. We also identified where future policies could be targeted for improving hydrologic services. Joint spatial analysis of policies and ecosystem services is effective for assessing spatial aspects of institutional fit, and provides a foundation for guiding future policy efforts.

J	Tsuji, S; Yamanaka, H; Minamoto, T				Tsuji, Satsuki; Yamanaka, Hiroki; Minamoto, Toshifumi			Effects of water pH and proteinase K treatment on the yield of environmental DNA from water samples	LIMNOLOGY												Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has recently been applied to the study of aquatic macroorganisms. In most studies, sample water was filtered and the extracted DNA from the residues on the filter used for the following molecular analysis to detect species of interest. This quick, new biomonitoring method has received broad attention, but some unknowns remain, such as the eDNA yield in relation to water quality. Previous studies suggest that eDNA is composed of various forms, such as the free-floating naked form and in organelles and cells. Therefore, the eDNA yield in the filtration and extraction steps might change depending on the composition of eDNA. Especially the filtration efficiency of free-floating DNA would be affected by the electrical effect of water pH. In this study, not only the free-floating naked DNA, but also all DNA fragments released from the organisms and contained in the water were defined as eDNA, including cells and organelles. We examined (1) the effect of water pH on the eDNA yield at filtration and (2) the effect of proteinase K treatment on the extraction efficiency of DNA from filter samples, with consideration of the variety of the eDNA forms in water. In a laboratory experiment using the purified DNA of common carp (Cyprinus carpio carpio) spiked into ultrapure water, the water pH and DNA yield showed a negative relationship within the pH range of 5-9, that is, the DNA yield was higher in acidic conditions, plausibly because of pH-dependent adsorption onto the glass fiber filter at the filtration step. In case the field water contained eDNA derived from the inhabiting common carp and the purified DNA of ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis) spiked in the sample as an internal standard, adjustment of the pH to 5 prior to filtration did not increase the eDNA yield of common carp, and the spiked ayu DNA was not detected at all. During the DNA extraction step, a standard protocol including proteinase K treatment marked higher DNA yield than that without proteinase K treatment. Overall, the present results indicate successful collection of eDNA using filters without any special attention to the pH of the sample water, and a conventional protocol with proteinase K treatment is appropriate for eDNA recovery.

In this study, the river was divided into four reaches, and a field survey of fish, benthic macroinvertebrates, and riparian plants was undertaken. Data from historical records were used for reference. The scoring system used weighting to adjust for differences in the importance of the chosen indicators and the relative efficiency of the sampling effort. The results indicated that the biological health of the lower Yellow River is distant from historical reference conditions, with its condition generally declining in the downstream direction. This result is consistent with the river's history of impairment of hydrology, water quality, wetland area and character, and physical form. We conclude that the reference river state based on historical conditions is unlikely to equate to the best attainable river health because certain changes have occurred in the river that may prohibit a return to the previous state of ecological health. On the basis of the results of this assessment as well as a review of the literature, we propose field data collection methodologies and indicators that can be applied in future assessments.

However, with the exception of standard organisms, ecotoxicological knowledge is still scarce. Here, we examined the influence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations on acute toxicity of Cu toward a cladoceran, Daphnia galeata Sars. We found that the protective effects of Ca2+ against copper toxicity were larger than those of Mg2+. BLM parameters (log Ks) for Ca and Mg estimated based on our 48-h LC50 (50 % lethal concentration), respectively, were 3.14 and 2.29. The log K of Ca was similar to that reported in previous studies using Daphnia magna; however, the log K of Mg was lower by one order of magnitude. Our results suggest that there is some mechanistic difference related to the Mg uptake between D. magna and D. galeata.

The seasonal flow regime defines the following key periods of water-quality risk over the annual hydrological cycle for diverseGBRCAecosystems: initial 'pre-flush' flows during the transition from the dry to the wet season; early wet-season 'first flush' flows; peak wet-season flood flows; and sustained base flow or periods of disconnection during the dry season. The level of seasonal contrast varies from the perennial systems of the wet tropics to the intermittent systems of the dry tropics. Major water-quality stressors may be catchment scale (e.g. in streams draining broad-scale agriculture) or more localised (e.g. cattle access, irrigation tail water). Water-quality stressors such as ammonia toxicity and hypoxia (due to organic or nutrient run-off and enhanced plant productivity) are of low relevance to downstream GBR ecosystems but are major threats to fresh waters. Similarly, whereas high contaminant loads in wet-season floods present the highest water-quality risk to marine ecosystems, the greatest risk in fresh waters is often from acute contamination during early wet-season 'pre-flush' flows into lentic waters, or continuous input of contaminants over long periods of base flow. Because of differences in the nature of risk periods, water-quality threats and pollutant-delivery mechanisms, the benefits of different management options to improve water quality can also differ among freshwater habitats and between freshwater and marine environments.																	1323-1650	1448-6059					2017	68	1					1	19		10.1071/MF15301								WOS:000391577700001						
J	Torres, C; Hanley, N				Torres, Cati; Hanley, Nick			Communicating research on the economic valuation of coastal and marine ecosystem services	MARINE POLICY												Quantifying the monetary value of ecosystem services (ES) provided by coastal and marine resources can help policy makers assess the trade-offs and synergies inherent in ecosystem-based management of marine and coastal environments, thus increasing the social efficiency of decision-making processes. As shown by the valuation literature, the number of coastal and marine management settings where valuation researchers have attempted to make a contribution is rising fast. However, this rise in research activity has not been matched by the increase in the use of economic valuation (EV) in the actual management of coastal and marine resources. This raises an interesting question: is EV responding to the needs of policy makers? This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the knowledge base regarding the economic values for coastal and marine ecosystems. It then discusses how to improve the uptake of ES valuation research by focussing on two core issues which are thought to be essential for more effective communication with the policy community.																	0308-597X	1872-9460				JAN	2017	75						99	107		10.1016/j.marpol.2016.10.017								WOS:000391904500013						
J	Peng, Y; Chu, JG; Xue, ZC				Peng, Yong; Chu, JingGang; Xue, ZhiChun			Basin flood control system risk evaluation based on variable sets	SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Flood control system risk evaluation is an effective measure for flood risk management and decisions. In order to make better flood risk decisions and thereby improve social and economic benefits, the flood control risk evaluation index system should be built to quantify and normalize flood risk effectively and efficiently. Because the current evaluation index has the binary miscibility characteristic of fuzziness and clarity, this paper establishes a new flood control system risk evaluation method based on the theory of variable sets (VS). Through a comparison of flood control risk evaluation with variable fuzzy sets (VFS) in the same basin flood control system risk evaluation, it is revealed that the new method, i.e., flood control risk evaluation with variable fuzzy/clear mixture sets (variable sets), will be reasonable in all cases. Finally, in one case study, i.e., the flood control system risk evaluation of Fengman Reservoir Basin, which is located in the southeast central of Jilin Province in China, the risk evaluation levels for each county in the basin as well as the whole flood risk distribution map of the basin could be provided with the new method. This provides useful information for basin flood control planning and design.																	1674-7321	1869-1900				JAN	2017	60	1					153	165		10.1007/s11431-016-0234-0								WOS:000392149400016

In order to help geologist and environmentalist to obtain on-site experimental data, there is an urgent need to develop portable analysis techniques of water quality, which can be used to give an timely and accurate assessment of water quality of the contaminated area with low cost and to monitor water environment conveniently in daily preventing and controlling work of water pollution. Based on adsorption with Purolite S930 chelating resin at pH 4 and thin-film sample preparation technique, a rapid and simple on-site-oriented analysis method of heavy metal ions, namely Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn and Pb in aqueous solutions, was developed utilizing a handheld energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence in this paper. The correlation coefficients of the calibration curves were greater than 0. 992 for all six metal ions, the lower limits of detection were between 5. 8 and 18. 6 mu g . L-1. Precision tests carried out on multi-element mixed solutions showed that the relative standard deviations (RSD, n=10) were better than 15%. The method has been used on-site to analysis 21 water samples collected from different river or well sites near a mining area northeast China. Out of the five underground water samples, one was found contaminated by Cu and Zn (Class Id), one by Zn and Fe (Class I[), and one by Fe(in between Class II to III). Surface water samples showed better qualities. But two out of the sixteen were found to be contaminated by Mn heavily (Class IV). Laboratory ICPMS was used to analyze the same samples. The results for Cu, Ni and Pb were coincident with the on-site data in general. But for Zn and Mn with higher concentrations, on-site data were lower than that by ICPMS. The reason for that might be the inclusion of the fine suspending particles in the samples by ICPMS. We conclude that the on-site data were effective. With the described method, an overall data acquisition time, including sampling, processing and measuring, can be within 12 hours for a batch of 10 samples. The pre-concentration device and the XRF instrument are both small, light, portable and can operate without external power supply. So, the method is suitable for on-site water sample analysis, especially in remote areas.																	1000-0593					JAN	2017	37	1					267	272		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2017)01-0267-06								WOS:000392359300050

A holistic assessment of discolouration processes in water distribution networks	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Reducing discolouration events in aging water supply networks is a major challenge facing water utilities worldwide as they are required to comply with increasingly stringent water quality regulations in a proactive and cost-effective manner. Emerging control methods for dynamic reconfiguration of network topologies could reduce the risk of discolouration by regulating hydrodynamic conditions to facilitate the implementation of self-cleaning networks. This review paper provides a holistic assessment of mechanisms and pathways which govern discolouration processes, associated models and the impact of system hydraulics so that control rules can be formulated. The possible role of biofilms in conditioning the wall-bound cohesive layers is identified and methods for their effective removal are discussed. The information presented identifies key variables and research gaps to facilitate the development of near real-time hydraulic and network topology control for the long-term and proactive management of discolouration risk.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	3					263	277		10.1080/1573062X.2015.1111912								WOS:000392208900005

Stormwater control measure (SCM) maintenance considerations to ensure designed functionality	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Great investment is made in the design and installation of stormwater control measures (SCMs). Substantial research investment, too, is made to optimise the performance of SCMs. However, once installed, SCMs often suffer from lack of maintenance or even outright neglect. Key maintenance needs for wet ponds, constructed stormwater wetlands, bioretention, infiltration practices, permeable pavement, swales, and rainwater harvesting systems are reviewed with many tasks, such as the cleaning of pre-treatment areas and the preservation of infiltration surfaces, being common maintenance themes among SCMs. Consequences of lacking maintenance are illustrated (mainly insufficient function or failure). Probable reasons for neglect include insufficient communication, unclear responsibilities, lack of knowledge, financial barriers, and decentralised measures. In future designs and research, maintenance (and lack thereof) should be considered. Assessing the performance of SCMs conservatively and including safety factors may prevent consequences of under-maintenance; and requiring regular inspection may help to enforce sufficient maintenance.																	1573-062X	1744-9006					2017	14	3					278	290		10.1080/1573062X.2015.1111913								WOS:000392208900006						
J	Wang, SW; Li, ZW; Yu, QL				Wang, Shunwu; Li, Ziwang; Yu, Qinglong			Kinetic degradation of guar gum in oilfield wastewater by photo-Fenton process	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Guar gum is considered as a main component of oilfield wastewater. This work is intended to optimize the experimental conditions (H2O2 dosage, Fe2+ dosage, initial concentration of organics, initial pH and temperature) for the maximum oxidative degradation of guar gum by Fenton's reagent. The kinetics of guar gum removal were evaluated by means of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the absorbance measurements. The batch experiment results showed that the optimum conditions were: H2O2 dosage, 10,000 mg/L; Fe2+ dosage, 2,000 mg/L; initial concentration of organics, 413 mg/L; pH, 3 and temperature, 35 degrees C, under which the COD removal could reach 61.07% and fairly good stability could be obtained. Under the optimum experimental conditions, using UV irradiation to treat the wastewater, the photo-Fenton systems can successfully eliminate COD from guar gum solution. The COD removal always obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics and the degradation rate (k(app)) was increased by 25.7% in the photo-Fenton process compared to the Fenton process. The photo-Fenton system needed less time and consequently less quantity of H2O2 to obtain the same results as the Fenton process. The photo-Fenton process needs a dose of H2O2 20.46% lower than that used in the Fenton process to remove 79.54% of COD. The cost of the photo/ Fenton process amounted to RMB9.43/m(3), which was lower than that of the classic Fenton process alone (RMB10.58/m(3)) and the overall water quality of the final effluent could meet the class. national wastewater discharge standard for the petrochemical industry of China.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JAN	2017	75	1					11	19		10.2166/wst.2016.470								WOS:000392391100002	28067641

The response of phytoplankton and microlayer-adapted bacteria to monolayer application in a humic, eutrophic irrigation dam	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Repeat applications of artificial monolayers to farm irrigation dams to reduce evaporative loss may adversely affect water quality by enhancing populations of microlayer-adapted bacteria and blue-green algae. The microlayer, subsurface and water column of a 16 ha dam were monitored every two weeks for 18 months, to benchmark the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and microlayer-adapted bacteria prior to monolayer application. Results for Secchi depth, total P, total N, chlorophyll a, phytobiovolume and UV254 absorbance, characterise Logan's Dam as humic and hypereutrophic. Seasonal peaks in the cyanobacterial species Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena sp. associated with regular thermal stratification periods over summer, exceeded the Queensland algal bloom alert level. Dissolved organic matter derived from aromatic char in the black soil used to construct the dam was the main substrate for microlayer-adapted bacteria. Intermittent monolayer application over seven weeks in late summer temporarily increased surface pressure, indicating a condensed monolayer had formed, with no increase in chemical oxygen demand or in populations of cyanobacteria or microlayer-adapted bacteria. The increase in dissolved organic carbon was well below the concentration recorded after a pump ingress event in late spring. In this humic hypereutrophic irrigation dam, repeat applications of the experimental monolayer formulation did not adversely affect water quality.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JAN	2017	75	2					322	327		10.2166/wst.2016.515								WOS:000392395800009	28112659

The integration of geochemical methods, multivariate statistical analysis, and geostatistical approaches were carried out on 169 groundwater samples to elucidate the regional factors and processes that influencing the geochemical composition of groundwater in coastal shallow aquifer of Terengganu, Malaysia. Hydrochemical modelling revealed that the abundance of Ca and Mg was contributed by carbonate and silicate weathering while higher HCO3 and Cl were resulted from reverse ion exchange reaction. Therefore, the dominant hydrogeochemical facies of groundwater was Ca-Mg-HCO3-Cl type. The influence of salinization resulting from seawater mixing to the groundwater was corroborated by Cl/HCO3 ratio, which affected around 50.9% of the groundwater samples slightly or moderately. Spatial mapping using ordinary kriging found that the threat of sea water intrusion is more prominent in the major river confluence especially around Terengganu and Marang River in the northeast and Dungun and Kemaman River confluence in southeast of study area. Moreover, factor analyses concluded that salinization, anthropogenic activities, reverse ion exchange, weathering processes, agricultural impact, and seasonal variations were the factors that regulate 63% of the major ion chemistry in study area. Finally, these findings showed the importance of understanding the hydrochemical characteristics for effective utilization, aquifer protection, and prediction of changes to minimize the effects of salinization and reduce human pollution such as agriculture and urbanization. It is essential steps in order to safeguard the utilization of groundwater resources for future generations.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JAN	2017	10	2							49	10.1007/s12517-016-2828-5								WOS:000392065200029

Since it is not possible to analyze every single substance, a prioritization methodology is needed for the selection of those to be monitored. Existing well-developed models require significant amount of data for reliable outcomes. This paper presents a methodology to prioritize the dangerous substances having adverse effects on freshwaters in Turkey, where data are scarce. Such a methodology will also serve as a solid model for other countries with limited background data. The adopted methodology enabled the elimination of chemicals to generate a candidate list composed of 608 substances among more than 5000 substances. Further screening and prioritization were conducted using different assessment methods (i.e., Total Hazard Value, Total Impact Value, Combined Monitoring-based, and Modelling-based Priority Setting) to obtain a proposed Final Candidate Specific Pollutants List of 150 dangerous substances. The proposed Candidate National Pollutant List of Turkey was established by combining 45 priority pollutants of the European Union with a list of candidate specific pollutants. According to the outcomes of this study, monitoring and controlling of 195 dangerous substances in freshwaters are recommended. Further detailed studies should be conducted in order to observe the actual levels of these dangerous substances in freshwaters followed by a review of the monitoring list accordingly. Moreover, further revisions might be required in the proposed list due to some possible versatile conditions in terms of sampling points (i.e., change in the location of industries).

Oceans in Peril: Grand Challenges in Applied Water Quality Research for the 21st Century	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Oceans cover most of the planet and 60% of the world's population lives near the coast. Anthropogenic activities along coastlines and in the open ocean have placed the oceans in peril. According to a Pew Oceans Commission Report, among the greatest threats to the ocean are land-based runoff from coastal development, nutrient pollution, overfishing, and invasive species. Here, we describe threats due to microbial, nutrient, chemical, and plastic pollution in addition to declining biodiversity and describe fundamental and applied research needed to mitigate the threats. While the research needs are diverse, we identify several research foci that transcend individual threats: monitoring, fate and transport studies, modeling, innovative natural and engineered treatment systems, and toxicity and health studies. Research within the environmental engineering and science community that addresses these needs will contribute to improving ocean health.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				JAN	2017	34	1			SI		3	15		10.1089/ees.2015.0252								WOS:000391851300002						
J	Staehr, PA; Testa, J; Carstensen, J				Staehr, Peter A.; Testa, Jeremy; Carstensen, Jacob			Decadal Changes in Water Quality and Net Productivity of a Shallow Danish Estuary Following Significant Nutrient Reductions	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												We utilized an extensive data set (1977-2013) from a water quality monitoring program to investigate the recovery of a Danish estuary following large reductions in total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) loading. Monthly rates of net transport and biogeochemical transformation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) were computed in two basins of the estuary using a box model approach, and oxygen-based rates of net ecosystem production (NEP) were determined. Since 1990, nutrient loading was reduced by 58 % for nitrogen and 80 % for phosphorus, causing significant decreases in DIN (60 %) and DIP (85 %) concentrations. Reductions in nutrient loadings and concentrations reduced annual chlorophyll levels by 50 % in the inner estuary and improved Secchi depth by approximately 1 m during the same period, particularly in the summer period. In the outer, deeper region of the estuary trends in water quality was less evident. Improvements in the inner estuary were strongly coupled to declines in DIN. Thresholds of DIN and DIP concentrations limiting phytoplankton growth indicated that both regions of the estuary were nitrogen limited. NEP rates indicated the development of more net autotrophic conditions over time that were likely associated with higher benthic primary production stimulated by improved light conditions. Box model computations revealed a modest reduction in summer net production of DIP over time, despite the persistence of elevated fluxes for several years after external loads were reduced. Since the mid-1990s, nutrient loading and transformation were stable while nutrient concentrations continued to decline and water quality improved in the inner estuary. The oligotrophication trajectory involved an initial fast transformation and modest retention of nutrients followed by a gradual decline in the rate of improvement towards a new stable condition.

The Influence of Storms on Water Quality and Phytoplankton Dynamics in the Tidal James River	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Due to the unpredictable nature of intense storms and logistical constraints of sampling during storms, little is known about their immediate and long-term impacts on water quality in adjacent aquatic ecosystems. By combining targeted experiments with routine monitoring, we evaluated immediate impacts of two successive storm events on water quality and phytoplankton community response in the tidal James River and compared these findings to a non-storm year. The James River is a subestuary of the Chesapeake Bay and sampling was conducted before, during, and after Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm (TS) Lee in 2011 and during the same time period (late summer/early fall) in 2012 when there were no storms. We collected and compiled data on nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, phytoplankton abundance, nitrogen uptake, primary productivity rates, and surface salinity, temperature, and turbidity in the meso- and polyhaline segments of the James River. Hurricane Irene introduced significant amounts of freshwater over the entire James River and Chesapeake Bay watersheds, while rainfall from TS Lee fell primarily on the tidal fresh region of the James River and headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay. Dinoflagellates dominated the algal community in the meso- and polyhaline segments prior to the storms in 2011, and a mixed diatom community emerged after the storms. In the mesohaline river segment, cyanobacteria abundance increased after TS Lee when salinities were depressed, likely due to washout from the oligohaline and tidal fresh regions of the river. In 2012, dinoflagellates dominated the community in both segments of the river during late summer but diatoms were also abundant and their biomass fluctuated throughout the summer and fall. Cyanobacteria were not present in either segment. Overall, we observed that the high-intensity rainfall from Hurricane Irene combined with high flushing in the headwaters as a result of TS Lee likely reduced primary productivity and altered community composition in the mesohaline segment but not the more estuarine-influenced polyhaline segment. Understanding the influence of high freshwater flow with a short residence time associated with storms is key to the planning and management of estuarine restoration as such disturbances are projected to increase as a result of climate change.

Removal of cyanobacteria from the water column using a combination of coagulant and ballast is a promising technique for mitigation and an alternative to the use of algaecides. In laboratory, we tested experimentally the efficiency of two coagulants, polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and chitosan (made of shrimp shells), alone and combined with two ballasts: red soil (RS) and the own lagoon sediment, to remove natural populations of cyanobacteria, from an urban brackish coastal lagoon. PAC was a very effective coagulant when applied at low doses (ae<currency>8 mg Al L-1) and settled the cyanobacteria, while at high doses (ae<yen>16 mg Al L-1) large flocks aggregated in the top of test tubes. In contrast, chitosan was not able to form flocks, even in high doses (> 16 mg L-1) and did not efficiently settle down cyanobacteria when combined with ballast. The RS itself removed 33-47 % of the cyanobacteria. This removal was strongly enhanced when combined with PAC in a dose-dependent matter; 8 mg Al L-1 was considered the best dose to be applied. The lagoon sediment alone did not promote any settling of cyanobacteria but removal was high when combined with PAC. Combined coagulant and ballast seems a very efficient, cheap, fast and safe curative measure to lessen the harmful cyanobacteria bloom nuisance in periods when particularly needed, such as around the 2016 Olympics in Jacarepagua Lagoon.

This study used statistical methods to examine long-term variations and primary causal factors of backflow from the Yangtze River to a laterally connected, large floodplain lake (Poyang Lake, China). Additionally, the effects of backflow on the lake hydrology were explored using a physically based hydrodynamic model and a particle-tracking model. Although backflow into Poyang Lake occurs frequently, with an average of 16 backflow events per year, and varies greatly in magnitude between years, statistical analysis indicates that both the frequency and magnitude of backflow reduced significantly during 2001-2010 relative to the previous period of 1960-2000. The ratio of Poyang Lake catchment inflows to Yangtze River discharge can be used as an indication of the daily occurrence of backflow, which is most likely to occur during periods when this ratio is lower than 5%. Statistical analysis also indicates that the Yangtze River discharge is the main controlling factor of backflow during July to October, rather than catchment inflows to the lake. Hydrodynamic modelling reveals that, in general, backflow disturbs the normal northward water flow direction in Poyang Lake and transports mass similar to 20 km southward into the lake. The effects of backflow on flow direction, water velocities and water levels propagate to virtually its upstream extremity. The current study represents a first attempt to explore backflow and causal factors for a highly dynamic floodplain lake system. An improved understanding of Poyang Lake backflow is critical for guiding future strategies to manage the lake, its water quality and ecosystem value, given proposals to modify the lake-river connectivity.

These particles can significantly change the speciation of toxic metals and metalloids throughout drainage networks via sorption, desorption, and settling processes. However, little is known about the behavior of particle size distributions (PSDs) in streams affected by acid drainage and their relationship to metal speciation. This work studied: (a) the PSDs for a wide range of mixing ratios found at a fluvial confluence affected by acid drainage, and (b) the response of PSDs and arsenic speciation to environmental changes found when the particles approach complete mixing conditions. The confluence between the Azufre River (pH similar to 2, high concentration of dissolved metals) and Caracarani River (pH = 8.6, low concentration of dissolved metals) was used as a representative model for study. Field measurements show a bimodal PSD with modal diameters of similar to 50 and 300 mu m. At shorter distances from the junction, the smaller modes with smaller particle volumes were dominant across the stream cross-sections. A systematic shift towards larger particle sizes and larger particle volumes occurred downstream. The analysis of laboratory PSDs for Azufre/Caracarani mixing ratios between 0.01 and 0.5 (pH from 6.2 to 2.3) showed a bimodal trend with similar to 15 and 50 mu m characteristic diameters; larger particles formed at pH>4. When particle suspensions were transferred in laboratory experiments from very low pH to full mixing conditions (pH similar to 2.8 and mixing ratio similar to 0.25) particle sizes varied, and the dissolved arsenic concentration decreased. The observed reaction kinetics were slow compared to the time scale of advective transport, creating opportunities for engineered controls for arsenic. This work contributes to a better understanding of the chemical-hydrodynamic interactions in watersheds affected by mining, and identifying opportunities to improve water quality at points of use.

Association of synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns with flash flooding in watersheds of the New York City water supply system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Understanding flash floods in watersheds of the New York City water supply system (NYCWSS) is important, as turbidity associated with flooding degrades water quality in the unfiltered portions of this water supply system. We examined synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions most frequently associated with flash flooding in this region. Flash floods between 1987 and 2013 were identified in two small watersheds of the NYCWSS using USGS 15-min discharge data at the Esopus Creek near Allaben, NY and Neversink River at Claryville, NY gauges, both located in the Catskill Mountains. A total of 25 flash floods were detected in these watersheds and there were 17 separate flash flood days. The Spatial Synoptic Typer Tools 4.0 were used to characterize the synoptic-scale atmospheric patterns influencing the study area based on NCEP/NCAR 500-mb geopotential height reanalysis data. Through this procedure, 17 unique synoptic patterns were identified. Three of these types were found to be strongly associated with flash flooding events. Composites of these types show southwesterly flow which suggests advection of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean. The flash flood days were compared to the National Weather Service flash flood warnings. The flash flood warnings issued for Ulster County compared to the flash floods in the study watersheds highlight the highly localized nature of flash flooding in this region.																	0899-8418	1097-0088				JAN	2017	37	1					358	370		10.1002/joc.4709								WOS:000392415700026

Thus, investigation of nitrate contamination as one of the most important environmental problems in groundwater is necessary. In the present study, modeling and estimation of nitrate pollution in groundwater of marginal area of Zayandeh-rood River, Isfahan, Iran, was investigated using water quality and artificial neural networks. 100 wells (77 agriculture well, 13 drinking well and 10 gardens well) in the marginal area of Zayandeh-rood River, Isfahan, Iran were selected. MATLAB software and three-layer Perceptron network were used. The back-propagation learning rule and sigmoid activation function were applied for the training process. After frequent experiments, a network with one hidden layer and 19 neurons make the least error in the process of network training, testing and validation. ANN models can be applied for the investigation of water quality parameters.

We investigated monthly nutrient concentrations at 11 stations located in the Hii River, Japan. The nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios in nitrate were applied to distinguish the origin of nitrogen, i.e., from fertilizers applied to paddy fields or from sewage. Although total nitrogen (TN), presumably from transboundary air pollution, was mainly loaded during the cooler season, nitrate originating from fertilizers applied to paddy fields became the main source of nitrogen in the river water during the warmer season. Phosphorus was mainly added in particulate form, and showed increased loading at the upstream stations in the warmer season, but not in the cooler season. Potassium and magnesium-components of fertilizers-showed an increasing trend in the downstream section of the paddy fields. Our results suggest that controlled application of fertilizers is necessary to decrease the nitrogen loads originating from farmlands, particularly from paddy fields. Since the nitrogen isotope of TN in fertilizer showed significantly lower values (mean value -4.6 aEuro degrees) than that in river water (mean value 1.8 aEuro degrees) or treated water (mean value 21.9 aEuro degrees), we could use these values to determine the contribution of TN from fertilizers to river water quality, and can use them to monitor fertilization levels in watersheds.																	1860-1871	1860-188X				JAN	2017	13	1					119	129		10.1007/s11355-016-0307-5								WOS:000391940700011

Development of an Index of Biotic Integrity for the Sand Hills Ecoregion of the Southeastern United States	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We developed an index of biotic integrity (IBI) for the Sand Hills ecoregion within the upper Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. This ecoregion exhibits differences in species composition among river basins and possesses a relatively depauperate fish fauna that has been affected by faunal homogenization. We also investigated whether this IBI could be improved by adding benthic macroinvertebrate information. Data collected from 70 wadeable stream sites were used to calculate 45 fish assemblage metrics. Twelve metrics within the categories of species richness, species composition, habitat guild, trophic guild, tolerance level, alien/invasive species, and individual fish condition were retained after screening all metrics for sensitivity to disturbance, redundancy, and ecological content. Heterogeneity of species composition among basins led to a greater reliance on richness, indicator species, trophic guild, and habitat guild metrics rather than on more geographically variable species composition metrics. Characteristic headwater assemblages provided the basis for some metrics, and invader species metrics were included to address faunal homogenization. The Sand Hills IBI (SHIBI) was more accurate ecoregion-wide than IBIs that were developed for portions of the Sand Hills, correctly classifying about 60% of the disturbed sites compared with less than 30% for the other IBIs. However, the SHIBI was not highly responsive to gradients in site quality, as indicated by an R-2 of 0.30 between SHIBI scores and instream habitat quality scores. This R2 value was improved to 0.49 by supplementing the SHIBI with a benthic macroinvertebrate index (the Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera index). We conclude that ecoregion-wide IBIs should (1) be based on ecoregion-wide data that characterize responses to disturbance and natural habitat gradients, (2) maintain a substantial ecological basis by including several metric classes, and (3) include metrics that address faunal homogenization where disturbance has increased the dispersion of nonnative species and native generalist species. In addition, combining information from different assemblages can enhance IBI responsiveness to disturbance and improve performance.																	0002-8487	1548-8659					2017	146	1					112	127		10.1080/00028487.2016.1240104								WOS:000391851200011

However, its effectiveness in the environmental aspect of toxic heavy metal removal required improvement by tuning the interface between CNF and heavy metals, and by understanding removal mechanisms. Herein, we synthesized four types of surface-functionalized CNF from waste coffee-filters for enhanced uptake of As-V and Cr-VI in the different water matrices. Among them, Fe3+-cross-linked CNF-Fe2O3 (FF) and mussel-inspired dopamine conjugated CNF (DP) demonstrated significant performance in water treatment for As-V and Cr-VI, respectively, than commercial activated carbon based adsorbents. Combined X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, and data fitting elucidated the complexation mode of As-V and Cr-VI to each CNF derivative which suggested that As-V binds through a bidentate-binuclear complex and that Cr-VI binds to catecholic OH as a trinuclear complex. Simultaneously, the transformation of harmful Cr-VI into nontoxic Cr-III was observed in DP which supports their potential practical applications. Taken together, our comprehensive data not only provide the material fabrication, interface behavior, and impact of water quality parameters in simulated and real contaminated waters but also explore the holistic understanding of the heavy metal removal mechanism and adsorbate-adsorbent interfacial interaction of these novel CNF derivatives.

Global transcriptomic profiling in barramundi (Lates calcarifer) from rivers impacted by differing agricultural land uses	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Most catchments discharging into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon have elevated loads of suspended sediment, nutrients, and pesticides, including photosystem II inhibiting herbicides, associated with upstream agricultural land use. To investigate potential impacts of declining water quality on fish physiology, RNA sequencing (RNASeq) was used to characterize and compare the hepatic transcriptomes of barramundi (Lates calcarifer) captured from 2 of these tropical river catchments in Queensland, Australia. The Daintree and Tully Rivers differ in upstream land uses, as well as sediment, nutrient, and pesticide loads, with the area of agricultural land use and contaminant loads lower in the Daintree. In fish collected from the Tully River, transcripts involved in fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and citrate cycling were also more abundant, suggesting elevated circulating cortisol concentrations, whereas transcripts involved in immune responses were less abundant. Fish from the Tully also had an increased abundance of transcripts associated with xenobiotic metabolism. Previous laboratory-based studies observed similar patterns in fish and amphibians exposed to the agricultural herbicide atrazine. If these transcriptomic patterns are manifested at the whole organism level, the differences in water quality between the 2 rivers may alter fish growth and fitness.

Biomining utilizes microbes to extract metals from the ore, and it has been suggested as a new sustainable way to produce metals. However, little is known of the potential ecotoxicological effects of biomining. In the present study, biomining impacts were assessed using survival and behavioral responses of aquatic macroinvertebrates at in situ exposures in streams. The authors used an impedance conversion technique to measure quantitatively in situ behavioral responses of larvae of the regionally common mayfly, Heptagenia dalecarlica, to discharges from the Talvivaara mine (Sotkamo, Northern Finland), which uses a biomining technique. Behavioral responses measured in 3 mine-impacted streams were compared with those measured in 3 reference streams. In addition, 3-d survival of the mayfly larvae and the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was measured in the study sites. Biomining impacts on stream water quality included increased concentrations of sulfur, sulfate, and metals, especially manganese, cadmium, zinc, sodium, and calcium. Survival of the invertebrates in the short term was not affected by the mine effluents. In contrast, apparent behavioral changes in mayfly larvae were detected, but these responses were not consistent among sites, which may reflect differing natural water chemistry of the study sites.

Trace element distribution and risk assessment in South Indian surface waterways	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The concentrations of 27 major and trace elements are determined in surface water samples collected from 48 sites of diverse waterways in four states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Telangana) of South India. The aims of this study are to identify the element distribution, comparatively assess the pollution risk, and evaluate human health risks related to diverse waterways in the study area. The results indicate that elements such as Cr, Se, As, Fe, and Mn are the major pollutants, as their concentrations exceeded the acceptable national and international water quality standards in several sites of Ennore, Adyar, Cooum, Periyar, and Vrishabhavathi rivers. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals that the Ennore, Adyar, Cooum, Periyar, and Kaveri river basins are affected by various anthropogenic activities, leading to moderate-to-high pollution by As, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Se. Potential pollution sources are industrial waste, sewage intrusion, paint industry waste, and automobile runoff. Overall, the investigated sites are categorized into three major groups: highly, moderately, and least polluted. Risk on human health by metals is then evaluated using hazard quotients (HQs) and carcinogenic risk evaluation; the results indicated that As with HQ > 1 is the most hazardous pollutant, which could lead to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic concerns, particularly in children. This study helps in establishing pollutant loading reduction goal and the total maximum daily loads and consequently contributes to preserving public health and developing water conservation strategies.

Between 1990 and 2013, an observational study of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) was conducted in the Port River estuary (Adelaide, Australia). The estuary has received pollution from industry, sewage plants and storm water. In recent years, pollution entering the system has reduced and the establishment of the Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary (ADS) increased dolphin protection from harassment and deliberate attacks. Nevertheless, the estuary remains a busy port. Over a 24 yr period, we conducted boat-based surveys (n = 735) for dolphin groups (n = 3,634) along a predetermined route in the Inner and Outer Estuary of Adelaide's Port River estuary. It is our conjecture that major infrastructure changes and pollution abatement have yielded a more favorable marine environment for dolphins, resulting in an estimated 6% annual increase in sightings, from a near absence of sightings in the 1980s. Increased dolphin numbers were likely the result of improved water quality, augmented by surveillance and education arising from the proclamation of the ADS. This study highlights the importance of long-term monitoring and has implications for dolphin conservation in heavily impacted urban areas and their protection via protected areas.

The value of wetlands in Quebec: a comparison between contingent valuation and choice experiment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY												This study aims to evaluate the non-market values of ecosystem services generated by wetlands in southern Quebec. To accomplish this, we evaluated the value of wetland services related to (1) habitat for biodiversity, (2) flood control, (3) water quality and (4) climate regulation. Two non-market valuation methods are proposed, contingent valuation and choice experiment. Our study aims to measure both the population's willingness to pay (WTP) for wetland preservation and restoration and to understand which environmental attributes and socioeconomic characteristics motivate people's responses. We also compared the results of the two methods. Our conclusion suggests that the two methods provide statistically convergent WTP values, both in total value and in relative importance for different attributes involved. Our result also confirms the coefficient equivalence between the estimation models using the data from the two methods.																	2160-6544	2160-6552					2017	6	1					51	78		10.1080/21606544.2016.1199976								WOS:000391143100004

Upper Susquehanna watershed and New York State improvements in nitrogen and phosphorus mass balances of dairy farms	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW) are required to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads from agriculture to achieve water quality goals for 2025. Assessing nutrient mass balances (NMBs) on farms over multiple years allows for evaluation of trends in nutrient accumulation and potential losses in geographic regions. Between 2004 and 2013, 570 NMBs were conducted for 189 dairy farms in NewYork, including 91 farms (293(.) NMBs) in the Upper Susquehanna watershed (USW), headwaters of the CBW. The average NMBs per hectare and per megagram of milk were lower for farms in the USW than statewide. Data showed a decline in NMBs per hectare over 10 years that ranged from 29% to 42% (statewide) and from 29% to 51% (for the USW dairies), depending on the nutrient, while milk production remained constant in both regions. Reductions in NMBs resulted primarily from reductions in nutrient imports, particularly through feed management. These source reductions reflect increased efficiency of production and reduced risk of N and P loss to the CBW. Extrapolation of comparisons in NMBs between 2004 and 2013 suggest that dairies in the USW reduced total N and P imports by 30% and 20%, respectively, contributing to a 29% to 50% decrease in total N pool and 51% decrease in P pool. We conclude that USW dairy farms can deliver up to 49% of their 2013 N pool and up to 72% of their 2013 P pool at the edge of the farms (their NMB) and still meet the total maximum daily load (TMDL) for N and P set for 2025 for New York agriculture. This study illustrates that significant nutrient source reduction can be obtained by implementing nutrient conservation practices, such as precision feeding and fertilizer management, combined with annual assessment of whole farm balances. Such a reduction in nutrient imports onto farms results in a reduction of the pool of nutrients available for accumulation in the soil or direct loss to water bodies and the atmosphere.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JAN-FEB	2017	72	1					1	11		10.2489/jswc.72.1.1								WOS:000391160500003

Relationship between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity at construction sites	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Stormwater runoff from construction sites can transport eroded sediment to nearby water bodies, degrading water quality and impairing biotic communities. Turbidity is a relatively easy characteristic to measure and can be used to estimate sediment loads from construction sites if reliable relationships between turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) are established. These relationships are investigated in this study for construction sites in Minnesota. Laboratory protocols have been developed herein for studying the factors that impact turbidity from construction site soils. Experimental procedures include the use of a rainfall simulator to generate runoff and turbidity values from soils carefully packed in appropriate test boxes. Turbidity characteristics of 14 different soils from construction sites were investigated using the laboratory protocols. Trends in turbidity with sediment concentrations were well represented by power functions. The exponent of these power functions was relatively constant between soils. The log-intercept, or scaling parameter, varied substantially among the different soils. Multiple soil properties were evaluated for each soil. An extensive regression analysis resulted in a model using percentage silt, interrill erodibility, and maximum abstraction that best represented the intercept term. A power value of 7/5 was chosen to represent all soils..																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JAN-FEB	2017	72	1					26	35		10.2489/jswc.72.1.26								WOS:000391160500005

Soluble nutrient concentrations in the effluent averaged 0.56 and 0.19 mg/L for total nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphate, respectively. Seeds were sown into Styrofoam trays filled with vermiculite and placed directly into the plant growing channels. Lettuce was harvested at 6, 9, and 12 weeks for a total mean harvest biomass of 4.5 kg/m(2). Kohlrabi and Swiss chard were harvested at 12 weeks, with a mean harvest biomass of 15.4 and 7.5 kg/m(2), respectively. Harvest biomass of kohlrabi was significantly greater than that of lettuce or Swiss chard. Nasturtium flowers were harvested at 9 and 12 weeks, while calendula did not begin to produce flowers until 12 weeks. There were no significant differences in percent removal of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrate, or phosphate at 6 weeks. However, at 9 weeks, kohlrabi, Swiss chard, and nasturtium removed significantly more TAN and nitrate than lettuce and calendula. Total ammonia nitrogen removal decreased at 12 weeks while nitrate removal increased for kohlrabi, Swiss chard, and calendula. Phosphate removal was low for all cultivars and may be the result of high phosphate concentrations in the source water. Careful crop selection will be necessary to maximize the benefits of aquaponics as crops varied in growth rates, overall nutrient removal capacity, and timing of nutrient removal.																	1522-2055	1548-8454					2017	79	1					53	60		10.1080/15222055.2016.1221010								WOS:000390875000009

Their computation is based on streamflow data, and if measured data are not available, hydrological models can be used to generate flow data. The present paper describes a study that aimed to predict streamflow in a temporary river and to analyze the general reliability of some hydrological indicators evaluated by using simulated data instead of measured flow data. The SWAT model was used to predict daily streamflow in a river section of the Celone river (Puglia, Italy). Several HIs characterizing the patterns of river flow or specific hydrological components were evaluated using observed and simulated streamflow. The results show that the SWAT model is able to simulate streamflow in temporary river systems, but its performance under extreme low flow conditions may be a weak point. When simulated streamflow time series were used, the replicability of the His evaluated using a rigorous statistical methodology ranged from good to limited. Good performance was found for the magnitude of discharge in wet months (average monthly flow from November to May), for the high flow indicators (annual maxima, 1-, 3-, 7-, 30-, 90-day mean flow) and timing, while limited performance was detected for low flow indicators (annual minimum 1-, 3-, 7-, 30-, 90-day mean flow) and the number of zero flow days. Better performance for low flow indicators was found after introducing the zero-flow threshold. This type of eco-hydrological study may contribute to characterizing the flow regime and its alterations in regions with scarce data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simulating hydrological and nonpoint source pollution processes in a karst watershed: A variable source area hydrology model evaluation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												An ecohydrological watershed model can be used to develop an efficient watershed management plan for improving water quality. However, karst geology poses unique challenges in accurately simulating management impacts to both surface and groundwater hydrology. Two versions of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), Regular-SWAT and Topo-SWAT (which incorporates variable source area hydrology), were assessed for their robustness in simulating hydrology of the karstic Spring Creek watershed of Centre County, Pennsylvania, USA. Appropriate representations of surface water - groundwater interactions and of spring recharge - discharge areas were critical for simulating this karst watershed. Both Regular-SWAT and Topo-SWAT described the watershed discharge adequately with daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) ranging from 0.77 to 0.79 for calibration and 0.68-0.73 for validation, respectively. Because Topo-SWAT more accurately represented measured daily streamflow, with statistically significant improvement of NSE over Regular-SWAT during validation (p-value = 0.05) and, unlike Regular-SWAT, had the capability of spatially mapping recharge/infiltration and runoff generation areas within the watershed, Topo-SWAT was selected to predict nutrient and sediment loads. Total watershed load estimates (518 t nitrogen/year, 45 t phosphorus/year, and 13600 t sediment/year) were within 10% of observed values (-9.2% percent bias for nitrogen, 6.6% for phosphorous, and 5.4% for sediment). Nutrient distributions among transport pathways, such as leaching and overland flow, corresponded with observed values. This study demonstrates that Topo-SWAT can be a valuable tool in future studies of agricultural land management change in karst regions.

This study investigated spatial and temporal variability in sediment and nutrient loads and load reductions achieved by implementing conservation practices to understand the implications of landscape heterogeneity and seasonal land-phase hydrologic variation on the effectiveness of the practices. Field-scale effects of nine conservation practices were evaluated in an agricultural watershed in the Midwest using the SWAT model. Results show that the conservation practice effectiveness, and the variability of the practice effectiveness at different locations, vary widely. Most practices are more effective in reducing nutrients in particulate than soluble forms. Practices applied to fields with higher nutrient loads do not necessarily lead to greater load reduction, indicating that an assumption of a proportional relationship between load and expected load reduction on which common targeting strategies for conservation practice placement are based may not be valid for nutrient, in particular soluble forms. The variation of the practices by fields and seasons suggests that achievement of water quality improvement requires careful selection of conservation practices and target areas considering hydrologic variations.

Agricultural production, water use and food availability in Pakistan: Historical trends, and projections to 2050	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Forty seven percent of the population of Pakistan is food insecure, access to food is uneven and malnutrition is widespread. In addition, food production depends greatly on irrigation, including the use of substantial volumes of water from already stressed aquifers. Our aim in this paper is to examine the implications of continued population growth on the required production of food and the implied water demand. We examine the historical trends of crop production, water use, food availability and population growth in Pakistan, and project them forward to 2050. Food availability has improved over recent decades, mostly as a result of increasing the area and water use of crops and fodder, and partly as a result of importing more pulses and cooking oils. We show that a continuation of current trends leads to nearly a doubling of the (already unsustainable) groundwater use. There is uncertainty in the magnitude of climate change impacts, but climate change may further exacerbate matters. To avoid further increases of groundwater use, some combination,would be required of: more dams and other irrigation infrastructure; increasing crop yields (particularly yields per unit volume of water) at a greater rate than in the past; a change in crop mix away from high water use crops like rice and sugarcane, to crops that use less water; and, exporting less and importing more food. The alternatives appear difficult to implement quickly, so it appears likely that in the short to medium term more groundwater will be consumed, with attendant problems of water quality and sustainability. Our analysis provides new perspectives on past trends and future food and water (including groundwater) challenges. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Physico-chemical and biological characterization of urban municipal landfill leachate	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Unscientific management and ad-hoc approaches in municipal solid waste management have led to a generation of voluminous leachate in urban conglomerates. Quantification, quality assessment, following treatment and management of leachate has become a serious problem worldwide. In this context, the present study investigates the physico-chemical and biological characterization of landfill leachate and nearby water sources and attempts to identify relationships between the key parameters together with understanding the various processes for chemical transformations. The analysis shows an intermediate leachate age (5-10 years) with higher nutrient levels of 10,000-12,000 mg/ls and similar to 2000-3000 mg/l of carbon (COD) and nitrogen (TKN) respectively. Elemental analysis and underlying mechanisms reveal chemical precipitation and co-precipitation as the vital processes in leachate pond systems resulting in accumulation of trace metals. Based on the above criteria the samples were clustered into major groups that showed a clear distinction between leachate and water bodies. The microbial analysis showed bacterial communities correlating with specific factors relevant to redox environments indicating a gradient in nature and abundance of biotic diversity with a change in leachate environment. Finally, the quality and the contamination potential of the samples were evaluated with the help of leachate pollution index (LPI) and water quality index (WQI) analysis. The study helps in understanding the contamination potential of landfill leachate and establishes linkages between microbial communities and physico-chemical parameters for effective management of landfill leachate.

To compensate for the effects of temporal variability, we deployed polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) in 100 small streams across the Midwest for about 5 weeks during summer 2013 and analyzed the extracts for 227 pesticide compounds. Analysis of water samples collected weekly for pesticides during POCIS deployment allowed for comparison of POCIS results with periodic water-sampling results. The median number of pesticides detected in POCIS extracts was 62, and 141 compounds were detected at least once, indicating a high level of pesticide contamination of streams in the region. Sixty-five of the 141 compounds detected were pesticide degradates. Mean water concentrations estimated using published POCIS sampling rates strongly correlated with means of weekly water samples collected concurrently, however, the POCIS-estimated concentrations generally were lower than the measured water concentrations. Summed herbicide concentrations (units of ng/POCIS) were greater at agricultural sites than at urban sites but summed concentrations of insecticides and fungicides were greater at urban sites. Consistent with these differences, summed concentrations of herbicides correlate to percent cultivated crops in the watersheds and summed concentrations of insecticides and fungicides correlate to percent urban land use. With the exception of malathion concentrations at nine sites, POCIS-estimated water concentrations of pesticides were lower than aquatic-life benchmarks. The POCIS provide an alternative approach to traditional water sampling for characterizing chronic exposure to pesticides in streams across the Midwest region. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal variation in the nature of DOM in a river and drinking water reservoir of a closed catchment	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in surface waters used for drinking purposes can vary markedly in character depending on its source within catchments and the timing and intensity of rainfall events. Here we report the findings of a study on the character and concentration of DOM in waters collected during different seasons from Myponga River and Reservoir, South Australia. The character of DOM was assessed in terms of its treatability by enhanced coagulation and potential for disinfection by-product i.e. trihalomethane (THM) formation. During the wet seasons (winter and spring), water samples from the river had higher DOC concentrations ((X) over bar: 21 mg/L) and DOM of higher average molecular weight (AMW: 1526 Da) than waters collected during the dry seasons (summer and autumn: DOC: 13 mg/L; AMW: 1385 Da). Even though these features led to an increase in the percentage removal of organics by coagulation with alum (64% for wet compared with 53% for dry season samples) and a lower alum dose rate (10 versus 15 mg alum/mg DOC removal), there was a higher THM formation potential (THMFP) from wet season waters (treated waters: 217 mu g/L vs 172 mu g/L). For reservoir waters, samples collected during the wet seasons had an average DOC concentration (X: 15 mg/L), percentage removal of organics by alum (54%), alum dose rates (13 mg/mg DOC) and THMFP (treated waters: 207 mu g/L) that were similar to samples collected during the dry seasons (mean DOC: 15 mg/L; removal of organics: 52%; alum dose rate: 13 mg/mg DOC; THMFP: 212 mu g/L, for treated waters). These results show that DOM present in river waters and treatability by alum are highly impacted by seasonal environmental variations. However these in reservoir waters exhibit less seasonal variability. Storage of large volumes of water in the reservoir enables mixing of influent waters and stabilization of water quality.

J	Crawford, SE; Lofts, S; Liber, K				Crawford, Sarah E.; Lofts, Stephen; Liber, Karsten			The role of sediment properties and solution pH in the adsorption of uranium(VI) to freshwater sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Uranium (U) can enter aquatic environments from natural and anthropogenic processes, accumulating in sediments to concentrations that could, if bioavailable, adversely affect benthic organisms. To better predict the sorption and mobility of U in aquatic ecosystems, we investigated the sediment-solution partition coefficients (K-d) of U for nine uncontaminated freshwater sediments with a wide range of physicochemical characteristics over an environmentally relevant pH range. Test solutions were reconstituted to mimic water quality conditions and U(VI) concentrations (0.023-2.3 mg U/L) found downstream of Canadian U mines. Adsorption of U(VI) to each sediment was greatest at pH 6 and 7, and significantly reduced at pH 8. There were significant differences in pH-dependent sorption among sediments with different physicochemical properties, with sorption increasing up until thresholds of 12% total organic carbon, 37% fine fraction (<= 50 mu m), and 29 g/kg of iron content. The Kd values for U(VI) were predicted using the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM) using total U(VI) concentrations, and water and sediment physicochemical parameters. Predicted K-d-U values were generally within a factor of three of the observed values. These results improve the understanding and assessment of U sorption to field sediment, and quantify the relationship with sediment properties that may influence the bioavailability and ecological risk of U-contaminated sediments.

Widespread, routine occurrence of pharmaceuticals in sewage effluent, combined sewer overflows and receiving waters	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Research addressing the occurrence, fate and effects of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment has expanded rapidly over the past two decades, primarily due to the development of improved chemical analysis methods. Significant research gaps still remain, however, including a lack of longer term, repeated monitoring of rivers, determination of temporal and spatial changes in pharmaceutical concentrations, and inputs from sources other than wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), such as combined sewer overflows (CSOs). In addressing these gaps it was found that the five pharmaceuticals studied were routinely (51-94% of the time) present in effluents and receiving waters at concentrations ranging from single ng to mu g L-1. Mean concentrations were in the tens to hundreds ng L-1 range and CSOs appear to be a significant source of pharmaceuticals to water courses in addition to WWTPs. Receiving water concentrations varied throughout the day although there were no pronounced peaks at particular times. Similarly, concentrations varied throughout the year although no consistent patterns were observed. No dissipation of the study compounds was found over a 5 km length of river despite no other known inputs to the river. In conclusion, pharmaceuticals are routinely present in semi-rural and urban rivers and require management alongside more traditional pollutants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The five dimensions of soil security each have ties to soils and their influence on human health. Capability is related to the ability of soils to produce adequate and high-quality food and filter waste products to provide a clean environment, particularly clean, safe water supplies. Condition influences the nutritional quality of agricultural products produced in a given soil. Capital recognizes that there is value to the services soil provides in promoting human health, costs when soil constituents are detrimental to human health, and significant value in products such as medications that come from soil. Connectivity recognizes that societal interactions with and perspectives of soil influence the value we place on soil and the management strategies we use; this in turn influences human health through capability. Connectivity also recognizes that loss of land as a public good may negatively influence human health. Codification has typically focused on soil and water conservation rather than directly on human health. However, conservation policies have led to improvements in water quality and increased soil health, leading to the production of higher-quality agricultural products in those soils. Therefore, there are significant opportunities to advance soils and human health studies and our understanding of these relationships under the soil security concept.																	2352-4774		978-3-319-43394-3; 978-3-319-43393-6				2017							261	274		10.1007/978-3-319-43394-3_24								WOS:000390822400024

This case study in the permanent protection area of Sana river (PPA-Sana), Brazil, addresses the relationship between soil security and water security. It explores the soil function "the provision of clean water and its storage, as well as filtering the contamination of water ways." The study also presents a formal way to put soil security into practice applying the meta soil model. Meta soil modeling is built on integral theory that facilitates to understand the complexity of soil, water, and other securities. The soil and water securities in the PPA-Sana are interconnected and at risk. Specifically, one of the main problems is the discharge of soil sediments in the rivers as a consequence of soil erosion. Soil erosion and compaction constrain soil and water security, and these were monitored and mapped in order to provide support for policy interventions. However, our findings suggest that producing better soil maps and more monitoring are not enough to improve soil and water security. On the contrary, awareness building, creating trust among stakeholders, and better integration among quadrants of the integral model would lead to an enhancement of soil and water security. In essence, cognizance (the sixth dimension of soil and other securities) is profoundly important to allow integration of human and biophysical system dimensions.																	2352-4774		978-3-319-43394-3; 978-3-319-43393-6				2017							331	340		10.1007/978-3-319-43394-3_29								WOS:000390822400029

Unfortunately, the program is structured so that it does not recognize soil security and may actually be putting American soil resources at risk. The FCIP is highly subsidized; on average, 62 % of individual premium costs are paid for by the federal government. As climate change causes more extreme weather and the cost of the FCIP continues to rise, lawmakers will be forced to consider whether the US government can continue to afford the heavy subsidies offered by the FCIP without changes to the program. The FCIP is currently structured using a flawed formula that lets high-risk farmland and management off the hook and ignores soil regenerative practices that would secure the soil. What if the FCIP rewarded good stewardship practices, like cover crops, that could result in lower indemnity payments and also improve carbon sequestration, water quality, and biodiversity? NRDC proposes the development of a pilot crop insurance program offered by the FCIP in select areas of the Mississippi River Basin. The 508(h) pilot program would offer actuarially sound crop insurance discounts to producers whose appropriate use of cover crops puts them at a lower risk for crop loss.																	2352-4774		978-3-319-43394-3; 978-3-319-43393-6				2017							403	409		10.1007/978-3-319-43394-3_37								WOS:000390822400037

This chapter explores those programs and ways in which they contribute toward National and International Soil Security. The two primary roles where FSA programs contribute are establishing minimum working land conservation requirements related to program support and conserving environmentally sensitive land. Most farms and ranches in the United States receive payments through at least one of the disaster assistance, safety net, and/or conservation programs administered through FSA, and all farms that participate in FSA farm programs and farm loan programs as well as other conservation and crop insurance programs administered by USDA are subject to conservation compliance provisions. Conservation compliance is focused on both preventing the loss of wetlands and ensuring that soil erosion is minimized through following sitespecific conservation plans. Celebrating its 30th anniversary, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is by far FSA's flagship program related to soil conservation with about 24 million acres nationwide. In general, in exchange for a yearly rental payment, farmers voluntarily agree to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that improve environmental health and quality for the life of their 10-15-year contract. By targeting fragile cropland and placing these lands into protective conservation covers, CRP conserves wildlife habitat, improves water quality, and has reduced soil erosion by more than 8 billion tons and enhanced soil productivity significantly since 1986. CRP also sequesters more carbon on private lands than any other federally administered program and reduces greenhouse gases equivalent to removing 8.7 million cars from the road annually.																	2352-4774		978-3-319-43394-3; 978-3-319-43393-6				2017							411	424		10.1007/978-3-319-43394-3_38								WOS:000390822400038

Quantifying tap-to-household water quality deterioration in urban communities in Vellore, India: The impact of spatial assumptions	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Municipal water sources in India have been found to be highly contaminated, with further water quality deterioration occurring during household storage. Quantifying water quality deterioration requires knowledge about the exact source tap and length of water storage at the household, which is not usually known. This study presents a methodology to link source and household stored water, and explores the effects of spatial assumptions on the association between tap-to-household water quality deterioration and enteric infections in two semi-urban slums of Vellore, India. To determine a possible water source for each household sample, we paired household and tap samples collected on the same day using three spatial approaches implemented in GIS: minimum Euclidean distance; minimum network distance; and inverse network-distance weighted average. Logistic and Poisson regression models were used to determine associations between water quality deterioration and household-level characteristics, and between diarrheal cases and water quality deterioration. On average, 60% of households had higher fecal coliform concentrations in household samples than at source taps. Only the weighted average approach detected a higher risk of water quality deterioration for households that do not purify water and that have animals in the home (RR = 1.50 [1.03, 2.181, p = 0:033); and showed that households with water quality deterioration were more likely to report diarrheal cases (OR = 3.08 [1.21, 8.181, p = 0.02). Studies to assess contamination between source and household are rare due to methodological challenges and high costs associated with collecting paired samples. Our study demonstrated it is possible to derive useful spatial links between samples post hoc; and that the pairing approach affects the conclusions related to associations between enteric infections and water quality deterioration.

Many different restoration methods have already implemented in order to improve the quality of lake water in Poland and around the world. Science reports on lake restoration mostly present short-term results achieved with one method, sometimes with a combination of few technologies, methods. Noteworthy is the scarcity of longitudinal observations and descriptions of persisting changes in environmental conditions and trophic status after a lake restoration process. The aim of the study was to present long-term changes in the trophic status of an urban lake which were been achieved through artificial aeration with thermal destratification and phosphorus inactivation, based on water quality parameters and an analysis of biotic and abiotic conditions prevailing in this lake. The study was conducted on Dlugie Lake, situated in the town of Olsztyn. This lake had acted as a sink of raw domestic sewage (400 m(3) day(-1)) for 20 years. After preliminary conservation operations, the lake was restored by the artificial circulation and phosphorus inactivation methods. Prior to the restoration effort, the lake had been classified as hypertrophic, with an average TSI index value of 79. The average chlorophyll a concentration was 63 mu g l(-1) and water transparency did not exceed 0.3 m. The implementation of two restoration methods improved the trophic level and the lake became mesotrophic. The improvement seems permanent, as the mean TSI index is 50 ten years since the termination of the restoration procedures.

The study included two sampling events: in June and October 2014. The aim of this study was to determine the quality of groundwater and to test the use of boron and tritium isotopes as tracers of contamination due to the presence of the landfill. The results of chemical analyses indicate that the samples collected from boreholes located downgradient from the landfill are contaminated. The principal contaminants are Cl-, NH4+, Fe, As, Cr, B, Hg and Zn, which were detected at maximum levels during the June sampling event. The boron and tritium isotopic composition of the collected water samples was analysed to evaluate the source of contamination. The results indicated a delta B-11 value of 19.31 parts per thousand for uncontaminated groundwater, while d11B values between 4.37 and 9.41 parts per thousand were reported for contaminated groundwater. The correlation between boron and chloride provided a basis for evaluating the plumedirection. Tritium (H-3) isotopes were analysed during the second sampling event (October). The results indicate that H-3 values ranging between 2.7 and 3.6 TU were reported for uncontaminated waters; this groundwater has a short residence time in the aquifer. A H-3 value of 34.5 TU was reported for one groundwater sample (Sample 7). This value is indicative of contamination by landfill leachate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We obtained and compiled the recent 30 years' field observational data on nutrients and phytoplankton communities to explore the changing ecosystem. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration (DIN) has significantly increased, while phosphate concentration (DIP) dramatically decreased because of costal anthropogenic influence. The limited factors for phytoplankton have changed from nitrogen in the 1980s to phosphate in the mid-1990s. The net-collected phytoplankton communities has the miniaturized trend, while there is drastic increase of Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. Even though the diatoms still dominate in phytoplankton community, the dominant species have slightly changed. The alga bloom greatly changed from diatoms dominated to dinoflagellates due to changes of nutrient structure. All these changes on nutrients and phytoplankton communities appear to be closely associated with human activities along the coast of the Daya Bay. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The Implicit Price of Aquatic Grasses	MARINE RESOURCE ECONOMICS												Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in the Chesapeake Bay is well below half of its historic levels, largely due to excessive nutrient and sediment loads degrading water quality. SAV provides important ecosystem functions, many of which are beneficial to local residents. To understand the implicit value residents place on SAV and the ecosystem services it provides, we undertake a hedonic property value study using residential transactions in 11 Maryland counties adjacent to the Chesapeake Bay. These data are matched to high resolution maps of SAV coverage. We pose a quasi-experimental comparison and examine how the prices of homes near the waterfront vary with the presence of SAV. On average, waterfront and near-waterfront homes within 200 meters of the shore sell at about a 6.5% premium when SAV is present. Applying these estimates to the 185,000-acre SAV attainment goal suggests total property value gains on the order of $436 million.																	0738-1360	2334-5985					2017	32	1					21	41		10.1086/689201								WOS:000390519900002

Recreational Demand for Shellfish Harvesting Under Environmental Closures	MARINE RESOURCE ECONOMICS												The Puget Sound estuary provides one of the most valuable shellfish habitats in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Shellfish are important economically, ecologically, and socially to the Puget Sound basin. The State of Washington manages the safety of shellfish harvest areas by assessing water quality on an ongoing basis and instituting advisories and closures based on water quality thresholds. Managers currently have little information to understand the effect of these closures on harvesting effort or economic values. In order to address this important need, we recently conducted a contingent behavior survey of recreational shellfish harvesters that use Puget Sound beaches. The survey elicited the number of annual trips respondents would expect to take under alternative closure scenarios, including a baseline of no closure. We estimate the demand for recreational trips using a count model system, quantifying the economic value lost to harvesters when beaches are closed due to pollution or biotoxins.																	0738-1360	2334-5985					2017	32	1					43	57		10.1086/688975								WOS:000390519900003

Bacteriological quality of the wastewater used for irrigation at the vegetable farms in Korle-bu Teaching Hospital, Accra Metropolis, Ghana	TROPICAL DOCTOR												Many developing countries, including Ghana, are water stressed. As such, farmers, particularly those in urban areas, have adopted the use of wastewater for irrigation. This study evaluated the bacteriological water quality of the wastewater used for irrigation in the vegetable farms at Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH), Accra Metropolis, Ghana. In all, 40 wastewater samples were collected and analysed bacteriologically using the total aerobic plate count method. The isolated bacteria were identified biochemically using Bergey's manual for determinative bacteriology. Mean total bacterial colony count values in the range of 2.75-4.44x10(5) CFU/100mL were isolated which far exceeds values of 1x10(3)/100mL recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for unrestricted irrigation of crops likely to be eaten raw. Enterobacter cloacae (51.4%), Klebsiella sp. (24.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.3%), Salmonella typhi (10.6%), Escherichia coli (2.2%) and Proteus sp. (0.4%) were the predominant bacteria isolated. Growers should use treated wastewater for farming while processors and consumers should minimize contamination risks of produce from the vegetable farms/garden to the plate.																	0049-4755	1758-1133				JAN	2017	47	1					15	19		10.1177/0049475516629534								WOS:000390557700005	26862131

Monitoring and modelling total phosphorus contributions to a freshwater lake with cage-aquaculture	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												A mass-balance modelling approach combined with a sensitivity analysis was utilized to gain an improved understanding of the relative contributions of phosphorus (P) loading from various anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic sources into Lake Wolsey (Manitoulin Island, Ontario, Canada), a Type 2 freshwater lake with a cage-aquaculture facility. Total P loadings were estimated from eight sources (inlet exchange, non-point sources, cage-aquaculture facility, internal loading, groundwater seepage, atmospheric deposition, leaf litter and dwellings) and three sinks (outlet exchange, sedimentation and sportfishing). Results indicated that over the study period (May-November 2007) the non-point sources were the leading contributor of total P to Lake Wolsey (1120kg P) followed by the cage-aquaculture facility loading (915kg P), inlet exchange (539kg P), groundwater inputs (305kg P), dwellings (219kg P), internal P recycling loads from the hypoxic hypolimnion (186kg P), atmospheric deposition (79kg P) and decomposing leaf litter (8.1kg P). When comparing the loadings in this study, the sensitivity analysis showed that non-point sources were the only significant input parameter of total P loading to the in-lake concentrations of P in Lake Wolsey(P=0.05). Information from this project will provide water quality managers with sound scientific information to make defencible decisions pertaining to policy and regulatory approaches for water quality risk assessment and management of cage-aquaculture in Type 2 sites.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				JAN	2017	48	1					283	297		10.1111/are.12881								WOS:000390268300024

Assessing the potential impacts of WWTP effluent reductions within the Reedy River watershed	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The Reedy River Basin originates along the northern fringe of the Greenville Metro Area and flows southward through downtown Greenville and continues for about 40 miles through increasingly rural lands until it empties into Lake Greenwood. This project evaluated the potential downstream impact to the Reedy River, Boyd Millpond, and Lake Greenwood from the removal of 100% of the effluent generated from various wastewater treatment plants along the river. Evaluation was performed using the Reedy River Model which is a combination of different programs including the EPA's Loading Simulation Program in C++ (LSPC) and the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP). Both water quality and quantity were analyzed as part of this study. The nitrogen and phosphorus species investigated in this study were total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Simulation runs were conducted for the Reedy River Model holding all original parameters constant to those used in the TMDL analysis. The second simulation consisted of eliminating wastewater treatment plants from the model to simulate 100% removal of their wastewater effluent. To reflect dry, wet, and average years of rainfall, seven years of actual weather data for Greenville County were used within these simulation runs. Flow was modeled from the headwaters to the Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. River sections analyzed included the river section immediately upstream and downstream of the wastewater treatment plant locations and Boyd Millpond and Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. Removal of effluent resulted in a reduced average flow at Boyd Millpond from 8.52 m(3)/s (301.23 cfs) to 7.34 m(3)/s (259.21 cfs), a reduction in flow of 14%; and reduced average flow at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood from 9.15 m3/s (323.13 cfs) to 7.97 m3/s (281.46 cfs), a reduction in flow of 12.9%. The removal of wastewater effluent had the greatest impact during periods of minimum flow when effluent makes up the largest percentage of total flow. During periods of drought, effluent removal resulted in a reduction in flow of almost 70% at the upper wastewater treatment plant, 66% at the lower wastewater treatment plant, 59% at Boyd Millpond, and 55% at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. Based on daily flow values averaged over seven years, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentration and mass loads at Boyd Millpond and Reedy Arm will both decrease by approximately 50% with the elimination of effluent. This report only considers the impacts of effluent removal to flow, total phosphorus and total nitrogen as modeled by LSPC and WASP. Other variables that may be influenced from effluent removal include, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, fecal matter, heavy metals, water temperature, habitat quality, species diversity, macroinvertabrates, recreational uses, and economic impacts but are not included in this study.

J	Cao, QQ; Wang, H; Chen, XC; Wang, RQ; Liu, J				Cao, Qingqing; Wang, Hui; Chen, Xiaocui; Wang, Renqing; Liu, Jian			Composition and distribution of microbial communities in natural river wetlands and corresponding constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Microbial community plays an important role in wetland ecosystem. To explore the composition and distribution of microbial communities in different wetland types, sediments from different sites of Xinxue River (XR) and Zhaoniu River (ZR), and the corresponding Xinxue River Constructed Wetland (XRCW) and Zhaoniu River Constructed Wetland (ZRCW) were sampled and analyzed using high throughput sequencing. The constructed wetlands were found to have more taxa of microbes in sediments than their corresponding river wetlands. The community richness index suggests that microbial richness in XR and XRCW is higher than that in ZR and ZRCW. High potential of sulfur cycle in XRCW is suggested by the superior distribution of Desulfobacterales, Syntrophobacterales orders, and Thiobacillus genus of Proteobacteria. Moreover, ZRCW has relatively lower nitrification ability than other three wetlands according to the distribution of Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Acidobacteria phyla. XR and XRCW show high potential of methanogenesis as the distribution of Methanomicrobia order in Archaea. ZRCW is suggested in a state that organic carbon mineralization exceeds aggregation, denitrification exceeds nitrification based on different distributions of the functional bacteria (such as Nitrospirae, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes). Furthermore, it indicates that ammonia removal process in ZRCW sediments is mostly limited to nitrification. This study demonstrated that wetland functions can be detected by the composition and distribution of microbial communities and influenced by the pollution status and surroundings probably. Our results are essential for understanding the interrelationship between microbial distribution and the pollution status of wetlands for the evaluation of constructed wetland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kimura, A; Baptista, MB; Scotti, MR				Kimura, Andrei; Baptista, Marcio B.; Scotti, Maria Rita			Soil humic acid and aggregation as restoration indicators of a seasonally flooded riparian forest under buffer zone system	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A degraded riparian forest that has lost vegetation and has suffered periodic flooding was rehabilitated using native species under buffer zone system which was stratified according to the distance from the river (Zones I, II, III). To restore the soil stabilisation and water flow we compared the soil aggregation, porosity and soil humic substances of the experimental site (ES) with those of a disturbed site (DS) and a preserved site (PS). Six years post-transplantation, soil aggregation and micro-porosity were improved in the ES relative to the DS, but only micro-porosity achieved a pattern similar to that of the PS in Zone III. Differences in soil aggregation between ES and PS were correlated with the negative effect promoted by a high aliphatic-humic acid composition in Zone I and by an undifferentiated distribution of fulvic acid among sites which were attributed to the flooding effect. Similarities among ES and PS were related to aromatic:vinylhumic acid ratio, allowing for the clustering of samples from Zones II and III of both the PS and the ES, via a principal component analysis. Samples from Zones I of ES and PS were separated driven by aliphatic and fulvic acid contributions, while all of the DS samples formed an isolated group under the influence of aliphatic species and macro-porosity. Based on these attributes, the ES is evolving towards the PS, and the rehabilitation process has attained an intermediate phase of restoration. The zones system adopted for riparian forest restoration allowed the use of soil humic substances, aggregates and micro-porosity as indicators of restoration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal variation in nutrient removal efficiency of a boreal wetland detected by high-frequency on-line monitoring	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	York, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc				Wetlands play an important role in reducing nutrient loads to receiving waters. The efficiency of a wetland in nutrient removal is commonly evaluated from discrete water samples taken at the inflow and at the outflow of the target wetland. In order to reveal variation in removal efficiency we carried out one year of high-frequency monitoring (HFM) of water quality and quantity at a wetland established at the mouth of an urban/agricultural watershed in boreal southern Finland. Data collected at the inflow and outflow of the 0,5 ha wetland was used to determine the range of total phosphorus (TP) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations. The incoming and outgoing TP and NO3-N loads were calculated and the relative and absolute reduction rates were determined. The wetland received 24 g P m(-2) year(-1) and 130 g NO3-N m(-2) year(-1) and it retained 3.1 g m(-2) year(-1) of P and 18 g m(-2) year(-1) of NO3-N. Annual TP reduction was 13% and NO3-N reduction 14%. The relative removal efficiency of TP was found to be dependent on retention time and NO3-N removal efficiency was dependent on temperature, oxygen concentration, NO3-N concentration and discharge.

Sedimentation and resuspension modelling in free water surface constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	York, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc				Eutrophication is a widespread problem that is being tackled from many perspectives and the recently applied technology of constructed wetlands is being used in the treatment of eutrophic water. However, process-based models to simulate their performance are scarce, so in this work a mechanistic model was developed to simulate the removal of total suspended solids, phytoplankton and total phosphorus in free water surface constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water. The model represents the influence of the main factors of the biotope and biota on these water quality variables, and particular attention is paid to resuspension produced by wind and by avifauna. Likewise, the effect of emergent vegetation cover in sedimentation, resuspension and phytoplankton growth is included. Phytoplankton is considered to store phosphorus internally in order to use it when growing, and the contribution of phytoplankton concentration to the suspended solids budget is included. The software AQUASIM was used to calibrate and validate the model in two full-scale constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water from Lake l'Albufera de Valencia (Spain) for three years. The simulated data and field measurements showed satisfactory adjustments for the three studied variables. The budgets obtained for each variable reveal that sedimentation and resuspension are the main processes in total suspended solids performance. Sedimentation of organic particulate phosphorus is the most important process in total phosphorus removal. The sum of the effect of resuspension by avifauna and by wind increases by more than 50% the quantity of solids that enters the water column. The model reveals that simulating the effects of the emergent vegetation cover and resuspension is crucial for representing the performance of the studied variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The adoption of an on-site treatment by Constructed Wetlands for the Combined Sewer Overflows is an example of decentralized approach for the optimization of the existing sewer networks and the needed reduction of their impacts on the water quality of the receiving water bodies. The CW system, that is treating the first flush of the overflows, is joined with an extended retention basin that is acting as a tertiary treatment for the CW effluents and is also storing and treating the whole second flush, slowing down by a throttle the discharge in the river and therefore playing a role in the flooding risk control. During the monitored time interval 69 events of overflow discharges have been observed and quantified; this quantification of the total volumes discharged by the specific CSO have been useful for evaluating the approach performances also in terms of mass loads in a single year, that is in the author's opinion a more conservative evaluation than comparing only the average concentrations removal rates. The obtained results have shown that on-site treatment for the first flush by CWs can obtain appropriate performances, as demonstrated by the about 87% and 93% of removal for COD and NH4+ respectively in terms of concentrations and the 68% and 94% in terms of mass loads in a year. A relevant analysis of the sampling program and the secondary services provided by this specific artificial ecosystems are discussed in the paper, together with a unique characterization of the role of the specific sources (washout, urban wastewater) to the loads that are reaching the on-site treatment unit.

Fluoride contamination in groundwater resources of Alleppey, southern India	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												Alleppey is one of the thickly populated coastal towns of the Kerala state in southern India. Groundwater is the main source of drinking water for the 240,991 people living in this region. The groundwater is being extracted from a multi-layer aquifer system of unconsolidated to semi-consolidated sedimentary formations, which range in age from Recent to Tertiary. The public water distribution system uses dug and tube wells. Though there were reports on fluoride contamination, this study reports for the first time excess fluoride and excess salinity in the drinking water of the region. The quality parameters, like Electrical Conductivity ( EC) ranges from 266 to 3900 ms/cm, the fluoride content ranges from 0.68 to 2.88 mg/L, and the chloride ranges between the 5.7 to 1253 mg/L. The mainwater types are Na-HCO3, NaCO3 and Na-Cl. The aqueous concentrations of F- and CO32- show positive correlation whereas F- and Ca2+ show negative correlation. The source of fluoride in the groundwater could be from dissolution of fluorapatite, which is a common mineral in the Tertiary sediments of the area. Long residence time, sedimente-groundwater interaction and facies changes (Ca-HCO3 to Na-HCO3) during groundwater flow regime are the major factors responsible for the high fluoride content in the groundwater of the area. High strontium content and high EC in some of the wells indicate saline water intrusion that could be due to the excess pumping from the deeper aquifers of the area. The water quality index computation has revealed that 62% of groundwater belongs to poor quality and is not suitable for domestic purposes as per BIS and WHO standards. Since the groundwater is the only source of drinking water in the area, proper treatment strategies and regulating the groundwater extraction are required as the quality deterioration poses serious threat to human health.

Dry conditions disrupt terrestrial-aquatic linkages in northern catchments	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Aquatic ecosystems depend on terrestrial organic matter (tOM) to regulate many functions, such as food web production and water quality, but an increasing frequency and intensity of drought across northern ecosystems is threatening to disrupt this important connection. Dry conditions reduce tOM export and can also oxidize wetland soils and release stored contaminants into stream flow after rainfall. Here, we test whether these disruptions to terrestrial-aquatic linkages occur during mild summer drought and whether this affects biota across 43 littoral zone sites in 11 lakes. We use copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) as representative contaminants, and measure abundances of Hyalella azteca, a widespread indicator of ecosystem condition and food web production. We found that tOM concentrations were reduced but correlations with organic soils (wetlands and riparian forests) persisted during mild drought and were sufficient to suppress labile Cu concentrations. Wetlands, however, also became a source of labile Ni to littoral zones, which was linked to reduced abundances of the amphipod H. azteca, on average by up to 70 times across the range of observed Ni concentrations. This reveals a duality in the functional linkage of organic soils to aquatic ecosystems whereby they can help buffer the effects of hydrologic disconnection between catchments and lakes but at the cost of biogeochemical changes that release stored contaminants. As evidence of the toxicity of trace contaminant concentrations and their global dispersion grows, sustaining links among forests, organic soils and aquatic ecosystems in a changing climate will become increasingly important.

In a sandy loam soil with shallow groundwater, bioenergy buffers of miscanthus and willow (5 and 10 m wide) were planted along a ditch of an agricultural field (AF) located in the Po valley (Italy). Mineral N forms and dissolved organic C (DOC) were monitored monthly over an 18-month period in groundwater before and after the bioenergy buffers. Soil samples were measured for inorganic N, DOC, microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), and potential nitrate reductase activity (NRA). The results indicated that bioenergy buffers are able to efficiently remove from groundwater the incoming NO3-N (62% - 5 m and 80% - 10 m). NO3-N removal rate was higher when nitrate input from AF increased due to N fertilization. Willow performed better than miscanthus in terms of biomass production (17 Mg DM ha(-1) yr(-1)), fine root biomass (5.3 Mg ha(-1)) and N removal via harvesting (73 kg N ha(-1)). The negative nonlinear relationship found between NO3-N and DOC along the soil-groundwater continuum from AF to bioenergy buffers indicates that DOC: NO3-N ratio is an important controlling factor for promoting denitrification in bioenergy buffers. Bioenergy buffers promoted soil microbial functioning as they stimulated plant-microbial linkages by increasing the easily available C sources for microorganisms (as DOC). First, willow and miscanthus promoted high rates of biological removal of nitrate (NRA) along the soil profile. Second, rhizosphere processes activated the soil microbial community leading to significant increases in MBC and microbial N immobilization. Herbaceous and woody bioenergy crops have been confirmed as providing good environmental performances when cultivated as bioenergy buffers by mitigating the disservices of agricultural activities such as groundwater N pollution.

In order to realistically meet the expectations of AEP, this research utilises analytical hierarchy process based web survey to assess the importance that various societal stakeholders in the European countries of Slovenia and Croatia give to specific environmental services and to also identify the agricultural practices that have the greatest potential to realise the expectations that society values the most. All stakeholders (overall group) from Slovenia and Croatia ranked water quality and availability as the first most important environmental service, and reduction of pesticides as the most important agricultural practice to deliver societal expectations. The results indicate that there is similar demand for environmental services in these two countries that differ in their agricultural settings.																	0964-0568	1360-0559					2017	60	1					67	91		10.1080/09640568.2016.1140633								WOS:000390112400004

Environmental externalities of urban river pollution and restoration: A hedonic analysis in Guangzhou (China)	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The degradation of urban river ecosystems presents a serious threat to sustainable urban development. Consequently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the ecological restoration of urban rivers worldwide. This study evaluates the environmental externalities associated with water pollution and river restoration in Guangzhou in southern China. A basic hedonic pricing model is applied to test hypotheses using a sample of 968 apartment transaction records during July-December 2013. Results show that river restoration could reverse negative externalities of polluted watercourses to positive externalities, especially for those apartments located on the 10th floor or lower. Water quality improvement from polluted non-recreational water (Grade V or worse) to non-body contact recreational water (Grade IV) could increase apartment values by 0.9%. River restoration (including river bank greening and water quality improvement) could increase property values by 4.61%, demonstrating a preference of Guangzhou residents for greening riverscapes. This study could hopefully provide a scientific basis for urban river governance for communities and decision-makers, and serve as a reference case to elucidate human preferences about river restoration in rapidly developing countries.

Data was investigated for two different periods, with the aim of evaluating the influence of the use and occupation of space on the temporal dynamics of the quality of surface and groundwater in the perennialised valley of the Trussu River in the State of Ceara, Brazil. The first period was from September 2002 to February 2004 and the second from April 2013 to April 2014. Twenty-two water samples were taken from nine sampling stations, five on the surface and four underground. The same stations were considered, monitoring 12 attributes of water quality for a total of 2,376 analyses. Temporal dynamics were characterised employing a technique of multivariate statistics: hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). The three groups formed by the surface water were independent of collection time, indicating that there was no significant change at a level of 1%. The main differences between the periods of monitoring were seen in the groundwater, with a reduction in the values of EC, Na+, Cl- and HCO3-, and an increase in the concentrations of the PO43- and NO3- ions during the second period, forming two distinct groups: group 1 comprising the water collected during the first period, and group 2 the water collected from April 2013 to April 2014. These results reflect changes in the quality of the groundwater due to an increase in agricultural area, and show that the change in land use had a greater impact on the groundwater.

J	Coats, ER; Brinkman, CK; Lee, S				Coats, Erik R.; Brinkman, Cynthia K.; Lee, Stephen			Characterizing and contrasting the microbial ecology of laboratory and full-scale EBPR systems cultured on synthetic and real wastewaters	WATER RESEARCH												The anthropogenic discharge of phosphorus (P) into surface waters can induce the proliferation of cyanobacteria and algae, which can negatively impact water quality. Enhanced biological P removal (EBPR) is an engineered process that can be employed to efficiently remove significant quantities of P from wastewater. Within this engineered system, the mixed microbial consortium (MMC) becomes enriched with polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). To date much knowledge has been developed on PAOs, and the EBPR process is generally well understood; nonetheless, the engineered process remains underutilized. In this study, investigations were conducted using qPCR and Illumina MiSeq to assess the impacts of wastewater (synthetic vs. real) on EBPR microbial ecology. While a strong relationship was demonstrated between EBPR metrics (P:C; influent VFA:P) and excellent P removal across diverse EBPR systems and MMCs, no such correlations existed with the specific MMCs. Moreover, MMCs exhibited distinct clusters based on substrate, and qPCR results based on the putative PAO Accumulibacter did not correlate with BLASTN eubacterial results for either Accumulibacter or Rhodocyclaceae. More critically, PAO-based sequences aligned poorly with Accumulibacter for both eubacterial and PAO primer sets, which strongly suggests that the conventional PAO primers applied in FISH and qPCR analysis do not sufficiently target the putative PAO Accumulibacter. In particular, negligible alignment was observed for PAO amplicons obtained from a MMC performing excellent EBPR on crude glycerol (an atypical substrate). A synthetic wastewater-based MMC exhibited the best observed BLASTN match of the PAO amplicons, raising concerns about the potential relevance in using synthetic substrates in the study of EBPR.

J	Chaudhary, A; Hantush, MM				Chaudhary, Abhishek; Hantush, Mohamed M.			Bayesian Monte Carlo and maximum likelihood approach for uncertainty estimation and risk management: Application to lake oxygen recovery model	WATER RESEARCH												Model uncertainty estimation and risk assessment is essential to environmental management and informed decision making on pollution mitigation strategies. In this study, we apply a probabilistic methodology, which combines Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation and Maximum Likelihood estimation (BMCML) to calibrate a lake oxygen recovery model. We first derive an analytical solution of the differential equation governing lake-averaged oxygen dynamics as a function of time-variable wind speed. Statistical inferences on model parameters and predictive uncertainty are then drawn by Bayesian conditioning of the analytical solution on observed daily wind speed and oxygen concentration data obtained from an earlier study during two recovery periods on a eutrophic lake in upper state New York. The model is calibrated using oxygen recovery data for one year and statistical inferences were validated using recovery data for another year. Compared with essentially two-step, regression and optimization approach, the BMCML results are more comprehensive and performed relatively better in predicting the observed temporal dissolved oxygen levels (DO) in the lake. BMCML also produced comparable calibration and validation results with those obtained using popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique (MCMC) and is computationally simpler and easier to implement than the MCMC. Next, using the calibrated model, we derive an optimal relationship between liquid film-transfer coefficient for oxygen and wind speed and associated 95% confidence band, which are shown to be consistent with reported measured values at five different lakes. Finally, we illustrate the robustness of the BMCML to solve risk-based water quality management problems, showing that neglecting cross-correlations between parameters could lead to improper required BOD load reduction to achieve the compliance criteria of 5 mg/L.

In this study multiple approaches including targeted sampling and monitoring of host-specific Bacteroidales markers were used to identify the impact of septic systems on microbial water quality. Twenty four watersheds with septic density ranging from 8 to 373 septic units/km(2) were monitored for water quality under baseflow conditions over a 3-year period. The levels of the human-associated HF183 marker, as well as total and ruminant Bacteroidales, were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Human-associated Bacteroidales yield was significantly higher in high density watersheds compared to low density areas and was negatively correlated (r = -0.64) with the average distance of septic systems to streams in the spring season. The human marker was also positively correlated with the total Bacteroidales marker, suggesting that the human source input was a significant contributor to total fecal pollution in the study area. Multivariable regression analysis indicates that septic systems, along with forest cover, impervious area and specific conductance could explain up to 74% of the variation in human fecal pollution in the spring season. The results suggest septic system impact through contributions to groundwater recharge during baseflow or failing septic system input, especially in areas with >87 septic units/km(2). This study supports the use of microbial source tracking approaches along with traditional fecal indicator bacteria monitoring and land use characterization in a tiered approach to isolate the influence of septic systems on water quality in mixed-use watersheds.

J	Reichwaldt, ES; Ho, WY; Zhou, WX; Ghadouani, A				Reichwaldt, Elke S.; Ho, Wei Y.; Zhou, Wenxu; Ghadouani, Anas			Sterols indicate water quality and wastewater treatment efficiency	WATER RESEARCH												As the world's population continues to grow, water pollution is presenting one of the biggest challenges worldwide. More wastewater is being generated and the demand for clean water is increasing. To ensure the safety and health of humans and the environment, highly efficient wastewater treatment systems, and a reliable assessment of water quality and pollutants are required. The advance of holistic approaches to water quality management and the increasing use of ecological water treatment technologies, such as constructed wetlands and waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs), challenge the appropriateness of commonly used water quality indicators. Instead, additional indicators, which are direct measures of the processes involved in the stabilisation of human waste, have to be established to provide an in-depth understanding of system performance. In this study we identified the sterol composition of wastewater treated in WSPs and assessed the suitability of human sterol levels as a bioindicator of treatment efficiency of wastewater in WSPs. As treatment progressed in WSPs, the relative abundance of human faecal sterols, such as coprostanol, epicoprostanol, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and sitostanol decreased significantly and the sterol composition in wastewater changed significantly. Furthermore, sterol levels were found to be correlated with commonly used wastewater quality indicators, such as BOD, TSS and E. coli. Three of the seven sterol ratios that have previously been used to track sewage pollution in the environment, detected a faecal signal in the effluent of WSPs, however, the others were influenced by high prevalence of sterols originating from algal and fungal activities. This finding poses a concern for environmental assessment studies, because environmental pollution from waste stabilisation ponds can go unnoticed. In conclusion, faecal sterols and their ratios can be used as reliable indicators of treatment efficiency and water quality during wastewater treatment in WSPs. They can complement the use of commonly used indicators of water quality, to provide essential information on the overall performance of ponds and whether a pond is underperforming in terms of stabilising human waste. Such a holistic understanding is essential when the aim is to improve the performance of a treatment plant, build new plants or expand existing infrastructure. Future work should aim at further establishing the use of sterols as reliable water quality indicators on a broader scale across natural and engineered systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bonhomme, C; Petrucci, G				Bonhomme, Celine; Petrucci, Guido			Should we trust build-up/wash-off water quality models at the scale of urban catchments?	WATER RESEARCH												Models of runoff water quality at the scale of an urban catchment usually rely on build-up/wash-off formulations obtained through small-scale experiments. Often, the physical interpretation of the model parameters, valid at the small-scale, is transposed to large-scale applications. Testing different levels of spatial variability, the, parameter distributions of a water quality model are obtained in this paper through a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm and analyzed. The simulated variable is the total suspended solid concentration at the outlet of a periurban catchment in the Paris region (2.3 km(2)), for which high-frequency turbidity measurements are available. This application suggests that build-up/wash-off models applied at the catchment-scale do not maintain their physical meaning, but should be considered as "black-box" models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Asia- Pacific region, particularly in China, artificial reefs are commonly used in the commercial farming of sea cucumbers. However, few studies have examined the epilithic biofilms on the artificial reefs. To gain a better understanding of the succession of epilithic biofilms and their ecological processes in sea cucumber culture waters, two experiments were conducted in culture waters of the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus in Rongcheng, China, using artificial test panels. On the test panels of succession experiment, more than 67 species were identified in the biofilms. On the test panels of seasonal variation experiment, more than 46 species were recorded in the biofilms. In both experiments, communities of epilithic biofilms were dominated by diatoms, green algae and the annelid Spirorbis sp. In the initial colonization, the dominant diatoms were Cocconeis sp., Amphora spp. and Nitzschia closterium in June, which were succeeded by species of Navicula, Cocconeis and Nitzschia (July to September), and then by Licmophora abbreviata, Nitzschia closterium and Synedra spp. in the following months. A diatom bloom in the autumn and filamentous green algae burst in the summer were also observed. Ecological indices well annotated the succession and seasonal changes in epilithic communities. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis found significant differences in diatom community composition among months and seasons. Fast growth of biofilms was observed in the summer and autumn, whereas the biomass of summer biofilms was largely made up of filamentous green algae. Present results show that the components of epilithic biofilms are mostly optimal foods of A. japonicus, suggesting that biofilms on artificial reefs may contribute important nutritional sources for sea cucumbers during their growth seasons. Future works should include quantitative determination of the contribution of epilithic biofilms to the diet of A. japonicus, potential roles of epilithic biofilms in regulating the water quality of sea cucumber ponds, and the regulation of epilithic biofilms in sea cucumber culture ponds.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				JAN	2017	35	1					132	152		10.1007/s00343-016-5205-z								WOS:000390003700012

Several studies about Water Quality Criteria (WQC) for PCP had been performed to protect the aquatic ecosystem, but in most of these studies the toxicity data were not properly analyzed (e.g. screening and processing methods). Moreover, little study was carried out on the ecological risk assessment (ERA) based on environmental factors. In this study, through collecting published native toxicity data of PCP along with relationships between toxicity and pH, pH-dependent WQC was established using a standardized scientific statistical method in China. The Criterion Maximum Concentration (CMC) and Criterion Continuous Concentration (CCC) were expressed as a function of pH. These were (1) CMC = exp(1.361 x pH-8.034) and (2) CCC = exp(1.361 x pH-10.434). At pH 7.8, the derived CMC and CCC were 13.21 and 1.20 nil., respectively. In addition, four tiers of the ERA were conducted based on pH for different waterbodies at different seasons. In tiered 1, 2, 3 and 4 ERA, PCP exposure concentrations were standardized to that at pH 7.8. Results showed that all levels of ERA method in the tiered framework were consistent with each other, and the risks of PCP in Liaohe river of wet season, Taihu lake and Liaohe river of dry season increased successively. The Hazard quotient (HQ) method indicated that small fluctuations in pH would lead to misleading hazard results. PCP concentrations of 8.66 mu g/L. at pH 7.37 in one site posed more risk than PCP of 9.57 mu g/L, at pH 7.93 in another site. The joint probability suggested that ecological risks may exist 11.84% in the dry season and 1.51% in the wet season in Liaohe River, and 4.98% in Taihu Lake, respectively while 5% thresholds (HC5) were set up to protect aquatic organisms. We hope this work could provide more information to manage and control PCP pollution in Taihe Lake and Liaohe River. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In 2008, the French government adopted an environmental policy plan, "Ecophyto 2018", to halve pesticide use within 10 years. Trends in synthetic pesticide sales and use in France were described, through three different indicators: the number of unit doses (NUD), the quantity of active ingredient (QAI), and the treatment frequency index (TFI). Changes in pesticide use on seven of the principal arable crops in France since the implementation of this policy plan were analyzed, together with the impact of changes in pesticide use on water quality. No evidence was found for a decrease in pesticide sales at national level between 2008 and 2013. In terms of the TFI values for individual crops, the only decrease in pesticide use observed since 2001 was for soft wheat. This decrease was very slight, and pesticide use did not decline more rapidly after 2006 than before. Changes in pesticide use differed between French regions and crops. Water pollution did not decrease during the period studied. Possible explanations for the lack of effectiveness of the French environmental plan are considered in the context of European legislation.

Freshwater mussel shells (Unionidae) chronicle changes in a North American river over the past 1000 years	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Illinois River was substantially altered during the 20th century with the installation of navigational locks and dams, construction of extensive levee networks, and degradation of water quality. Freshwater mussels were affected by these changes. We used sclerochronology and stable isotopes to evaluate changes over time in age-and-growth and food sources for two mussel species: Amblema plicata and Quadrula quadrula. Specimens were collected in years 1894, 1897, 1909, 1912, 1966, and 2013, and archeological specimens were collected circa 850. The von Bertalanffy growth parameter (K) was similar between 850 and 1897, but it increased by 1912 and remained elevated through 2013. Predicted maximum size (L-inf) increased over the past millennium, and 2013 individuals were over 50% larger than in 850. Growth indices showed similar patterns of continual increases in growth. Shells were enriched in C-13 and N-15 during the 20th century, but exhibited a partial return to historical conditions by 2013. These patterns are likely attributable to impoundment, nutrient pollution and eutrophication beginning in the early 20th century followed by recent water quality improvement.

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Cyanobacteria blooms are a major environmental issue worldwide. Our understanding of the biophysical processes driving cyanobacterial proliferation and the ability to develop predictive models that inform resource managers and policy makers rely upon the accurate characterization of bloom dynamics. Models quantifying relationships between bloom severity and environmental drivers are often calibrated to an individual set of bloom observations, and few studies have assessed whether differences among observing platforms could lead to contrasting results in terms of relevant bloom predictors and their estimated influence on bloom severity. The aim of this study was to assess the degree of coherence of different monitoring methods in (1) capturing short-and long-term cyanobacteria bloom dynamics and (2) identifying environmental drivers associated with bloom variability. Using western Lake Erie as a case study, we applied boosted regression tree (BRT) models to long-term time series of cyanobacteria bloom estimates from multiple in-situ and remote sensing approaches to quantify the relative influence of physico-chemical and meteorological drivers on bloom variability. Results of BRT models showed remarkable consistency with known ecological requirements of cyanobacteria (e.g., nutrient loading, water temperature, and tributary discharge). However, discrepancies in inter-annual and intra-seasonal bloom dynamics across monitoring approaches led to some inconsistencies in the relative importance, shape, and sign of the modeled relationships between select environmental drivers and bloom severity. This was especially true for variables characterized by high short-term variability, such as wind forcing. These discrepancies might have implications for our understanding of the role of different environmental drivers in regulating bloom dynamics, and subsequently for the development of models capable of informing management and decision making.

Results showed that the total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads from upstream discharge were the major external loads in the lake, accounting for 70% and 63% of the total loads, respectively. Scenario simulation results indicated that 93.2% of the lake area in summer (August) and 89.5% in autumn (November) could reach the protective targets (TN < 1.0 mg/L) under 50% reduction of inflow TN loads. Meanwhile, 58.7% of the lake area in summer and 63.1% in autumn could reach the protective targets (TP < 0.05 mg/L) under 50% reduction of aquaculture areas. The mass budget results of TN and TP showed that TP immobilisation was larger than TN immobilisation. The immobilisations for TN and TP from July to September were higher than those of other months under the combined impacts of increasing runoff during the wet period, phytoplankton bloom and water residence time. The 2D water quality model provided a relevant example for assessing the effects of runoff and aquaculture activities and served as scientific support for lake management to improve water quality in large shallow macrophytic lakes.

Impact of legacy soil phosphorus on losses in drainage and overland flow from grazed grassland soils	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Rates and quantities of legacy soil phosphorus (P) lost from agricultural soils, and the timescales for positive change to water quality, remain unclear. From 2000 to 2004 five 0.2 ha grazed grassland plots located on a drumlin hillslope in Northern Ireland, received chemical fertiliser applications of 0, 10, 20, 40, 80 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) resulting in soil Olsen P concentrations of 19, 24, 28, 38 and 67 mg P L-1, respectively, after which applications ceased. Soil Olsen P and losses to overland flow and drainage were monitored from 2005 to 2011 on an event and weekly flow proportional basis, respectively. Soluble reactive P and total P time series were synchronised with daily rainfall and modelled soil moisture deficits. From 2005 to 2011 soil Olsen P decline was proportional to soil P status with a 43% reduction in the plot at 67 mg P L-1 in 2004 and a corresponding 12% reduction in the plot with lowest soil P. However, there was no significant difference in the flow-weighted mean concentration for overland flow among plots, all of which exceeded 0.035 mg L-1 in >98% of events. Strong interannual and event variations in losses were observed with up to 65% of P being lost during a single rainfall event. P concentrations in drainage flow were independent of Olsen P and drain efficiency was potentially the primary control on concentrations, with the highest concentrations recorded in the plot at 38 mg L-1 Olsen P in 2004 (up to 2.72 mg L-1). Hydrological drivers, particularly antecedent soil moisture, had a strong influence on P loss in both overland and drainage flow, with higher concentrations recorded above a soil moisture deficit threshold of 7 mm. This study demonstrates that on some soil types, legacy P poses a significant long term threat to water quality, even at agronomically optimum soil P levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jarvie, HP; King, SM; Neal, C				Jarvie, Helen P.; King, Stephen M.; Neal, Colin			Inorganic carbon dominates total dissolved carbon concentrations and fluxes in British rivers: Application of the THINCARB model - Thermodynamic modelling of inorganic carbon in freshwaters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												River water-quality studies rarely measure dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) routinely, and there is a gap in our knowledge of the contributions of DIC to aquatic carbon fluxes and cycling processes. Here, we present the THINCARB model (THermodynamic modelling of INorganic CARBon), which uses widely-measured determinands (pH, alkalinity and temperature) to calculate DIC concentrations, speciation (bicarbonate, HCO3-; carbonate, CO32-; and dissolved carbon dioxide, H2CO3*) and excess partial pressures of carbon dioxide (EpCO(2)) in freshwaters. If calcium concentration measurements are available, THINCARB also calculates calcite saturation. THINCARB was applied to the 39-year Harmonised Monitoring Scheme (HMS) dataset, encompassing all the major British rivers discharging to the coastal zone. Model outputs were combined with the HMS dissolved organic carbon (DOC) datasets, and with spatial land use, geology, digital elevation and hydrological datasets. We provide a first national-scale evaluation of: the spatial and temporal variability in DIC concentrations and fluxes in British rivers; the contributions of DIC and DOC to total dissolved carbon (TDC); and the contributions to DIC from HCO3- and CO32- from weathering sources and H2CO3* from microbial respiration. DIC accounted for >50% of TDC concentrations in 87% of the HMS samples. In the seven largest British rivers, DIC accounted for an average of 80% of the TDC flux (ranging from 57% in the upland River Tay, to 91% in the lowland River Thames). DIC fluxes exceeded DOC fluxes, even under high-flowconditions, including in the Rivers Tay and Tweed, draining upland peaty catchments. Given that particulate organic carbon fluxes from UK rivers are consistently lower than DOC fluxes, DIC fluxes are therefore also the major source of total carbon fluxes to the coastal zone. These results demonstrate the importance of accounting for DIC concentrations and fluxes for quantifying carbon transfers from land, via rivers, to the coastal zone. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, there were scarcely reports on whether existing agrochemicals such as herbicides have potential effects on Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) which may form large surface blooms. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the effects of glufosinate, a widely use herbicide in the world, on the growth of M. aeruginosa. The change of the content of intracellular (intra-) and extracellular (extra-) levels of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) were also determined by HPLC. The mRNA level of mcyA, mcyD, mcyH related to the production of MC-LR was detected after 48 h exposure to glufosinate. Our results revealed that low concentrations of glufosinate exposure (0.5 mg/L, 1 mg/L) would promote the growth of M. aeruginosa. It was worth noting intra-MC-LR contents of algal cells were also significantly increased at low concentrations of glufosinate exposure (1 mg/L). While at high concentrations (5 mg/L, 10 mg/L), glufosinate could induce the MDA level and inhibit the growth of M. aeruginosa that would limit the production of MC-LR to the water body. At last, the transcription levels of algae toxin synthesis related genes mcyA and mcyD were increased significantly at environmentally relevant concentrations of glufosinate, which may affect the MC production. This study not only illuminated effects of glufosinate on growth of and MC-LR synthesis of M. aeruginosa at environmentally relevant concentrations, but also reminding us the potential risk caused by herbicide use should arouse concerns.

Using in-situ optical sensors to study dissolved organic carbon dynamics of streams and watersheds: A review	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												It is important to understand how dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is processed and transported through stream networks because DOC is a master water quality variable in aquatic ecosystems. High-frequency sampling is necessary to capture important, rapid shifts in DOC source, concentration, and composition (i.e. quality) in streams. Until recently, this high-frequency sampling was logistically difficult or impossible. However, this type of sampling can now be conducted using in-situ optical measurements through long-term, field-deployable fluorometers and spectrophotometers. The optical data collected from these instruments can quantify both DOC concentration and composition properties (e.g., specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio, and fluorescence index). Previously, the use of these sensors was limited to a small number of specialized users, mainly in Europe and North America, where they were used predominantly in marine DOC studies as well as water treatment and management infrastructure. However, recent field demonstrations across a wide range of river systems reveals a large potential for the use of these instruments in freshwater environments, heightening interest and demand across multiple environmental research and management disciplines. Hence, this review provides an up-to-date synthesis on 1) the use of spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool in stream DOC studies, 2) the instrumentation, its applications, potential limitations and future considerations, and 3) the new watershed DOC research directions made possible via these in-situ optical sensors.

J	Arauzo, M				Arauzo, Mercedes			Vulnerability of groundwater resources to nitrate pollution: A simple and effective procedure for delimiting Nitrate Vulnerable Zones	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This research was undertaken to further our understanding of the factors involved in nonpoint-source nitrate pollution of groundwater. The shortcomings of some of the most commonly used methods for assessing groundwater vulnerability have been analysed and a new procedure that incorporates key improvements has been proposed. The new approach (LU-IV procedure) allows us to assess and map groundwater vulnerability to nitrate pollution and to accurately delimit the Nitrate Vulnerable Zones. The LU-IV procedure proved more accurate than the most widely used methods to assess groundwater vulnerability (DRASTIC, GOD), when compared with nitrate distribution in the groundwater of 46 aquifers included in the study (using the drainage basin as the unit of analysis). The proposed procedure stands out by meeting the following requirements: (1) it uses readily available parameters that provide enough data to feed the model, (2) it excludes redundant parameters, (3) it avoids the need to assign insufficiently contrasted weights to parameters, (4) it assess the whole catchment area that potentially drains N-polluted waters into the receptor aquifer, (5) it can be implemented within a GIS, and (6) it provides a multi-scale representation. As the LU-IV procedure has been demonstrated to be a reliable tool for delimiting NVZ, it could be particularly interesting to use it in countries where certain types of environmental data are either not available or have only limited availability. Based on this study (and according to the LU-IV procedure), it was concluded that an area of at least 1728 km(2) should be considered as NVZ. This sharply contrasts with the current 328 km2 officially designated in the study area by the Spain's regional administrations. These results highlight the need to redefine the current NVZ designation, which is essential for an appropriate implementation of action programmes designed to restore water quality in line with Directive 91/676/EEC.

Addition of calcium nitrate to sediment has been applied to control the release of phosphorus from sediments. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of water quality improvement on the remediation of river sediment with the addition of calcium nitrate. The results demonstrated that the redox-potential of sediments increased from -282 mV to -130 mV after 28 days of calcium nitrate treatment. The acid volatile sulphide in the sediments significantly decreased (by 54.9% to 57.1%), whereas the total organic carbon decreased by 9.7% to 10.2%. However, the difference between these and water quality improvement was not significant. Due to the addition of calcium nitrate, low phosphate concentration in the water column and interstitial phosphate in the sediment were observed, indicating that the calcium nitrate was beneficial to controlling the release of phosphorus from river sediment. The decrease in phosphorus release could be attributed to the fixation of iron-phosphorus and calcium-phosphorus due to the addition of calcium nitrate. The addition of calcium nitrate to sediment caused the oxidation of sulphide to sulphate, hence resulting in high nitrate and sulphate concentrations in the water column, and high interstitial nitrate and sulphate concentrations in the sediment. The results also showed that only the water quality improvement had a significant effect on the interstitial nitrate and sulphate concentrations in the sediment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we investigated the effects of drought-induced drawdown on the water quality of the Zhoucun Reservoir, Shandong Province, East China, during the fall overturn. Field surveys were conducted during stratification (April-November) over three standard years 2012, 2013, and 2014, and over the El Nino event of 2015. Temporal and vertical variations of the physical and chemical indexes were investigated during monitoring. Results show that after the formation of stratification, the hypolimnion rapidly shifted to anaerobic conditions, with the accumulation of pollutants such as manganese (Mn) and total phosphorous (TP). Due to the extreme El Nino event in 2015, both the upper and lower metalimnion limits moved down along with the water level in summer, which resulted in the transfer of hypolimnion water to the metalimnion. In summer 2015, large amounts of pollutants were measured in the metalimnion: a phenomenon that did not occur at the same period of the standard years. At the beginning of the overturn in 2015, the water quality of the whole reservoir deteriorated when the metalimnion water shifted to the epilimnion. Mn and TP concentrations in the epilimnion reached 0.202 mg/L and 0.086 mg/L, respectively, which are significantly higher than those in the standard years. Although the tributary rivers entered the epilimnion of the reservoir during the overturn, Mn and TP concentrations of the inflow were only of 0.049-0.072 mg/L and 0.033-0.047 mg/L, respectively, indicating that these rivers were not the source of the high TP and high Mn concentrations in the epilimnion. Hence, we conclude that more attention should be paid to the metalimnion position and the vertical distribution of pollutants when studying lakes and reservoirs experiencing droughts.

Based on a case study of the Louros watershed in Greece, this work identifies database and modelling sources of false positives and negatives and proposes a decision making process aimed at minimizing the possibility of committing such errors. The baseline is well simulated and shows that the Louro's watershed falls behind a Good Environmental Status, at least marginally. Simulated mitigation measures show that the river's status can be upgraded to "Good", at least as concerns nitrates and ammonium. Simulated climate change does not seem to exert an important positive or negative effect. Land use changes forecasting considerably less cultivated area have a significant effect on Total Phosphorous but not on nitrates or ammonium concentrations. The non-linearity between nutrient disposition (inputs) and nutrient concentration in downstream water bodies (output) and the many factors that affect the nutrient disposition-transportation-concentration chain, highlights the importance of simulating the effects of mitigation actions and of future climate and land use changes before adopting and establishing agri-environmental measures.

Their monitoring, management, and protection requirements differ from reservoirs situated in non-urbanized areas. The objectives of this study were: (a) to determine the concentrations of select pesticides and emerging pollutants (EPs) present in an urban reservoir; (b) to describe their possible spatial distributions; and (c) to quantify the risks for aquatic life and safeguard drinking water supplies. For this purpose, the Guarapiranga reservoir was studied as an example of a multi-stressed urban reservoir in a tropical region. A total of 31 organic compounds (including pesticides, illicit drugs, pharmaceuticals, and endocrine disruptors) were analyzed twice over a period of one year, together with classical indicators of water quality. The physical and chemical data were treated using principal component analysis (PCA) to identify possible temporal or spatial patterns. Risk assessment was performed for biota and drinking water use, comparing maximum environmental concentrations (MECs) with the predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) or drinking water quality criteria (DWC), respectively. The results demonstrated the presence of pesticides and EPs, as well as pollution by high levels of nutrients and Chlorophyll a (Chl. a), during the study period. The nutrients and Trophic State Index (TSI) showed gradients in the reservoir and regional distributions, while the pesticides and EPs only clearly showed this pattern in the dry season. The concentrations and distributions of the pesticides and EPs therefore showed seasonality. These findings suggested that the two groups of pollutants (EPs+ pesticides and nutrients) possessed different sources and behavior and were not always correlated in the reservoir studied. In the studied period, no risk was observed in raw water for drinking water use, but carbendazim, imidacloprid, and BPA showed risks for the biota in the reservoir. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A full-preference ranking analysis for the value of sustainable river basin management	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												In this paper we develop a full-preference ranking Choice Experiment (CE) designed to investigate how respondents evaluate a set of proposed improvements towards sustainable river basin management, as per the prescriptions of the European Union-Water Framework Directive (2000). The CE is applied in the Asopos River Basin (ARB) in Greece. Our interest is to test whether residency in the river basin, or otherwise, affects the preferences of the relevant agents. We first estimate a rank-ordered logistic regression based on a full set of choices in order to calculate the willingness to pay (WTP) of respondents for each one of the three attributes considered in the CE (i.e., environmental conditions, impact on the local economy and changes in the potential uses of water). The model is initially estimated for the full sample and then re-estimated twice for two sub-samples: the first one only includes the residents of Athens and the second only includes the residents of Asopos. Afterwards, we examine the effect of various demographic and socio-economic factors (such as income, gender, age, employment and education) on the estimates of our model in order to reveal any differences among respondents with different characteristics, mainly focusing on whether they reside or have personal experience of the RB under valuation. Thus, our analysis simultaneously provides a robustness check on previous findings in the literature and additional information about how various demographic and socio-economic characteristics affect the evaluation of the selected attributes.

Combined effects of reduced irrigation and water quality on the soil microbial community of a citrus orchard under semi-arid conditions	SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY												Sustainable agriculture in Mediterranean areas is compromised by the structural deficit of water resources. Under this situation, the impacts of alternative water managements on the microbial community, as a critical component of the soil quality, need to be properly understood. We evaluated the long-term impacts of irrigation systems differing on the quantity and quality of water, and their interactions, on the biomass (phospholipid fatty acid analysis), diversity and composition (16S rRNA gene profiling), and enzyme activities of the soil microbial community of an orchard cultivated with grapefruit trees in South-East Spain. The impact of water quantity was evaluated by irrigation with optimal amount of water or by irrigation with a reduced volume of water in the temporal frame when the crop is less sensitive, so-called regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). The impact of water quality was evaluated attending to the source of the irrigation water: water from a river channel-transfer (TW) or reclaimed water from a wastewater treatment plant (RW). Electrical conductivity was higher in soils irrigated with RW than in soils irrigated with TW. The content of total organic C in the soil was affected by water quality but not by water quantity. Soils irrigated with TW showed higher total organic C than soils irrigated with RW. As in the case of plant productivity, RDI had a negative impact on plant productivity, soil microbial biomass and enzyme activities in summer. This finding indicates a slow-down of organic matter decomposition under restricted irrigation. Bacterial biomass was more sensitive to RDI when RW was used, whereas the fungal biomass was more sensitive to RDI when TW was used. Bacterial diversity and plant productivity were more sensitive to water quantity than to water quality. The increase of the abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in soils irrigated with RW in summer suggested a higher resilience of this treatment mediated by copiotrophic organisms. A recovery of the enzyme activity and microbial biomass of soils irrigated with RW and RDI was observed in January and June. The resilience of biogeochemical and the microbial biomass processes after RDI coursed through changes in the structure of the microbial community as revealed by the multivariate analyses of fatty acids. The utilisation of reclaimed water during RDI promoted a more-resilient community that translated into a recovery of microbial biomass and enzyme activities after the water restriction ended. These results imply potential ecological benefits of the irrigation with reclaimed water that should be considered under the water limitation predicted in climate change models in Mediterranean areas.

A general lack of clear guidance and regulation to manage stormwater quality and potential public health risks was identified, which could be hindering the uptake of stormwaters chemes generally. Particular data gaps and weaknesses identified include nominal and event performance of treatment barriers for the main acute hazards, enteric viruses and protozoa, which impacts on the ability to quantify risks and appropriately manage stormwater uses. Building on an interest toutilize stormwater for water-sensitive urban design and the Australian risk-management approach forwater reuse, further guidance for the development of a risk-based regulatory approach to stormwater schemes is proposed. Using the principles of Water Safety Plans we propose a performance-based validation approach, involving the development of site-specific stormwater use management plans (SUMPs) that integrate monitoring and auditing protocols.

This study is aimed to determine the effect of increasing free chlorine (Cl) concentration in a hospital water network in regard to water quality monitoring and microbial growth control, between 2010 and 2013 in Porto. The average of free Cl concentration in the period under analysis showed some heterogeneity per floor, varying between 0.84 and 1.25 mg/L. In addition, there was a rise in proportion of samples that exceeded WHO guidelines (free Cl >= 0.5 mg/L), particularly in the last two years of the same period. With respect to microbial analysis, 22.4% of the samples were positive for Legionella spp., 6.4% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15% and 30.4% for aerobic plate counts at 36 and 22 degrees C, respectively. The proportion of positive samples decreased throughout the period under analysis, in particular for Legionella spp. (41.7% in 2010 vs. non-detectable in 2013) and P. aeruginosa (10.8% in 2010 vs. 3.3% in 2013). These results are in accordance with the gradual rise in free Cl concentration (0.78 +/- 0.94 mg/L in 2010 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.51 mg/L in 2013). In conclusion, a suitable plan for drinking water quality was instituted which resulted in reducing microbiological growth in the waterwork network, improving public health protection. However, the detection of critical points associated with lower levels of free Cl were found on certain floors/points-of-use, requiring the need to improve the monitoring water treatment system and/or implementation of additional technologies.

J	Zhang, DQ; Gersberg, RM; Ng, WJ; Tan, SK				Zhang, Dongqing; Gersberg, Richard M.; Ng, Wun Jern; Tan, Soon Keat			Conventional and decentralized urban stormwater management: A comparison through case studies of Singapore and Berlin, Germany	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Urban stormwater runoff is both a significant pollution source and a potentially valuable resource. This study compares stormwater management in two cities: Singapore and Berlin, Germany. In comparing the strategies for stormwater management, we illustrate how differences in geography (e.g., land and water availability), urban infrastructure, regulatory regimes, legislation and intensives between the two cities have led to different solutions for stormwater management. Singapore, faced with a serious issue of water scarcity, has placed an increasing emphasis on stormwater management through developing a comprehensive network of drains and canals, mainly with the aim of controlling flooding and potable water supply. In contrast, in Berlin, concerns for the protection of surface water quality and non-potable water supply in the urban areas have resulted in a shift in management goals towards a low impact solution based on source control. The cost analysis indicated that the decentralized rainwater harvesting as practiced in Berlin leads to a higher economic efficiency where potable water can be substituted by stormwater, compared to the centralized drainage system in Singapore. Additionally, green roofs result in energy savings by serving as mitigation strategies against the effect of urban heat islands and global warming. In the near future, it is envisioned that a combination of both conventional and decentralized urban stormwater management will prove to be the most practical solution for most cities.

Simulations of homogeneous soil blocks with hydraulic properties ranging from sand to clay showed that infiltration capacities vary greatly for the different soil types observed in glacial till. The inclusion of heterogeneities dramatically increased infiltration volume by a factor of 22 for a soil with structural changes above and below the CaCO3 boundary. Infiltration increased further by 8% if tectonic fractures were included and by another 61% if earthworm burrows were added. Comparison of HydroGeoSphere infiltration hydrographs with a simple soakaway model (Roldin et al., 2012) showed similar results for homogeneous soils but indicated that exclusion of small scale soil physical features may greatly underestimate hydraulic performance of infiltration based SUDS.

Mesocosm study of enhanced bioretention media in treating nutrient rich stormwater for mixed development area	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												A well-designed engineered soil for bioretention is important as it ensures that pollutant removal requirements are met. This laboratory study investigated the nutrient removal efficiency of bioretention media enhanced with 10% (by volume) additives from various waste materials (cockle shell, newspaper, printed paper, coconut husk and tyre crumb) and planted with Red Hot Chinese Hibiscus (Hibiscus rosasinensis), a common landscape shrub in tropical countries. The results showed that media enhanced with shredded newspaper demonstrated a significant improvement in total nitrogen (TN) removal (80.4%), compared to standard bioretention media (57.5%) without compromising total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) removal, when dosed with actual runoff. The thick root system and rapid growth rate of the plant was proven to contribute to TN removal. This study concluded that shredded newspaper can be a potential addition to enhance bioretention media performance in treating stormwater, especially nutrient rich runoff from mixed development areas.

Niche-breadth of freshwater macrophytes occurring in tropical southern African rivers predicts species global latitudinal range	AQUATIC BOTANY												The study tested the hypothesis that measurement, using multivariate Principal Components Analysis (PCA), of the niche-breadth of river macrophyte species in southern tropical Africa, may predict their larger-scale biogeographical range. Two measures of niche-breadth were calculated for 44 riverine macrophyte species, from 20 families commonly occurring in Zambia, using an approach based on PCA ordination with 16 bio-physico-chemical input variables. These included altitude, stream order, stream flow, pH, conductivity and soluble reactive phosphate concentration (SRP). In the absence of additional chemical water quality data for Zambian rivers, invertebrate-based measures of general water quality were also used. These were benthic macroinvertebrate Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), and individual abundance of nine macroinvertebrate families with differing water quality tolerance, indicated by their Sensitivity Weightings within the Zambian Invertebrate Scoring System (ZISS). Macrophyte large-scale latitudinal range was derived from world geopositional records held by online databases, and additional records held by the authors. The two niche-breadth metrics divided the species into narrow-niche and intermediate/broad-niche categories, showing significant variation (from one or both of correlation and ANOVA test outcomes) in altitude, stream flow, conductivity, SRP, pH and ASPT, but not stream order. Macrophyte alpha-diversity (as a measure of number of individual niches co-existing per habitat) showed no significant relationship with individual species niche-breadth. Narrow-niche species included a higher proportion of Afrotropical endemics than did species with broader niche size. There were significant predictive relationships between macrophyte niche-breadth and latitudinal range of the target species at global and Afrotropical scales, but not for the Neotropics.

J	Chan, R; Baffaut, C; Thompson, A; Sadler, J				Chan, Robert; Baffaut, Claire; Thompson, Allen; Sadler, John			Validating the Soil Vulnerability Index for a claypan watershed	CATENA					Conference of the International-Soil-Conservation-Organization (ISCO)	MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015	El Paso, TX	Int Soil Conservat Org				Assessment studies of conservation efforts have shown that best management practices were not always implemented in the most vulnerable areas where they are most needed. While complex computer simulation models can be used to identify these areas, resources needed for using such models are beyond reach for most water resources managers. Soil and water conservationists need simple, spatially explicit tools such as the USDA-NRCS's Soil Vulnerability Index (WI) to evaluate the inherent vulnerability of soils and the risk they pose to water quality when used for row crop agriculture. In this study, the SVI was evaluated in the Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW), a claypan watershed in Missouri, using three methods: professional judgment, comparison to the Conductivity Claypan Index (CCI) developed specifically for claypan soils, and comparison to model results. Factors affecting the critical areas identified by each method were assessed and classified areas were compared. Slope and depth to claypan had the most variability in GCEW and were found to be influential in determining area classification by each index. While the original definition of SVI included the soil type representative slope from the USDA SSURGO database, slope values provided by a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) improved the index usefulness by classifying visibly degraded and non-degraded areas in different categories. High and moderately high vulnerability areas identified with SVI, CCI and model results with DEM slopes were consistent and matched professional judgment. Additional testing of SVI is recommended in areas characterized by soils of different permeability and under different climates.

Eutrophic state plays an important role in reflecting the health status of reservoir ecosystem and it is a key field of water environment study. In this paper the method of grading the eutrophic state of reservoir based on the results of Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) model was proposed in order to obtain the spatial and temporal evaluation of eutrophic state in reservoir. Taking Tianjin Erwangzhuang reservoir as an example, the temporal and spatial trends of hydrodynamic and water quality of the reservoir were studied. The eutrophic state and the limited factor of eutrophication were predicted for Tianjin Erwangzhuang reservoir. This study provides a useful tool for understanding of the eutrophic state grade in a reservoir and surface water environment.																	1994-2060	1997-003X					2017	11	1					111	126		10.1080/19942060.2016.1249411								WOS:000388586200004

However, landscape services can also be used as a boundary concept in collaborative landscape governance. We demonstrate this by analysing the case of Gouwe Wiericke in the rural west of the Netherlands. Here, a collaborative landscape governance process started off with low levels of trust between farmers and regional governments, as a result of previous processes. The introduction of the landscape services concept helped to bridge social boundaries, which eventually resulted in collective action: farmers and governments reached an agreement on adapted management of ditches and shores to improve water quality and biodiversity. However, we propose that bridging the social boundaries was achieved not merely due to the landscape services concept, but also due to the fact that multiple boundaries were managed simultaneously, and additional arrangements were used in boundary management.

J	Andreopoulos, D; Damigos, D				Andreopoulos, Dimitrios; Damigos, Dimitrios			To transfer or not to transfer? Evidence from validity and reliability tests for international transfers of non-market adaptation benefits in river basins	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The attempt to design cost-effective adaptation policies incorporating non-market values to inhibit climate change impacts on water resources may increase the interest in applying the Benefit Transfer method. Benefit Transfer is a practical way to consider non-market values using functions and estimates acquired through primary valuation methods from other sites. Among the primary methods, Choice Experiments appear to particularly accommodate Benefit Transfer. Nevertheless, validity and reliability of international value transfers obtained from Choice Experiments have not been adequately examined. To this end, two identical Choice Experiments were conducted in Greece and Italy in the context of river services adaptation, testing validity and reliability of Benefit Transfer. The application of validity and reliability tests for different types of transfers is supportive for the use of Benefit Transfer, at least for the value transfer types. In particular the reliability of value transfer was higher when income adjustments were taken into account. Overall, Benefit Transfer can be attentively considered to evaluate cost-effective adaptation policies across countries experiencing similar climate change trends. The latter gains more importance given that an international Benefit Transfer setting as regards the non-market benefits of adaptation to climate change for river services is absent in the relevant literature.

Metal concentrations (except Cu, Mn, Ni, and Zn) in Bangshi River water were above the drinking water quality guidelines, while in groundwater were less than the recommended limits. Concentration of metals in surface water decreased as a function of distance. Estimations of non-carcinogenic health risk for surface water revealed that mean hazard index (HI) values of As, Cr, Cu, and Pb for combined pathways (i.e., ingestion and dermal contact) were >1.0 for both age groups. The estimated risk mainly came from the ingestion pathway. However, the HI values for all the examined metals in groundwater were <1.0, indicating no possible human health hazard. Deterministically estimated total cancer risk (TCR) via Bangshi River water exceeded the acceptable limit of 1 x 10(-4) for adult and children. Although, probabilistically estimated 95th percentile values of TCR exceeded the benchmark, mean TCR values were less than 1 x 10(-4). Simulated results showed that 20.13% and 5.43% values of TCR for surface water were >1 x 10(-4) for adult and children, respectively. Deterministic and probabilistic estimations of cancer risk through exposure to groundwater were well below the safety limit. Overall, the population exposed to Bangshi River water remained at carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health threat and the risk was higher for adults. Sensitivity analysis identified exposure duration (ED) and ingestion rate (IR) of water as the most relevant variables affecting the probabilistic risk estimation model outcome.

Effects of multiple stresses hydropower, acid deposition and climate change on water chemistry and salmon populations in the River Otra, Norway	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Many surface waters in Europe suffer from the adverse effects of multiple stresses. The Otra River, southernmost Norway, is impacted by acid deposition, hydropower development and increasingly by climate change. The river holds a unique population of land-locked salmon and anadromous salmon in the lower reaches. Both populations have been severely affected by acidification. The decrease in acid deposition since the 1980s has led to partial recovery of both populations. Climate change with higher temperatures and altered precipitation can potentially further impact fish populations. We used a linked set of process-oriented models to simulate future climate, discharge, and water chemistry at five sub-catchments in the Otra river basin. Projections to year 2100 indicate that future climate change will give a small but measureable improvement in water quality, but that additional reductions in acid deposition are needed to promote full restoration of the fish communities. These results can help guide management decisions to sustain key salmon habitats and carry out effective long-term mitigation strategies such as liming. The Otra River is typical of many rivers in Europe in that it fails to achieve the good ecological status target of the EU Water Framework Directive. The programme of measures needed in the river basin management plan necessarily must consider the multiple stressors of acid deposition, hydropower, and climate change. This is difficult, however, as the synergistic and antagonistic effects are complex and challenging to address with modelling tools currently available. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the increasing international interest in the contamination of water resources by genotoxic compounds, the present study aimed to evaluate the genotoxic potential of surface water samples collected from the five (5) lakes (Amvrakia, Lysimachia, Ozeros, Trichonida, Kastraki) located in Aitoloakarnania regional unit (Western Greece). The genotoxic potential of surface water samples was evaluated by employing the Cytokinesis Block MicroNucleus (CBMN) assay in cultured human lymphocytes. In the former assay, lymphocytes were treated with 1,2 and 5% (v/v) of surface water from each lake. Statistically significant differences (1.7 to 33 fold increase in MN frequencies vs. the control) were seen at the dose of 5% (v/v) in all studied lakes. At the dose of 2% (v/v) statistically significant differences (1.7 to 2.6 fold increase in MN frequencies vs. the control) were observed in all studied lakes except Trichonida lake. Finally, at the dose of 1% (v/v) statistically significant differences (2.3 and 2.5 fold increase in MN frequencies vs. the control) were observed in the Ozeros and Lysimachia lakes. The evaluation of the potential genotoxic effects and the analysis of the physicochemical parameters of lakes' surface water samples is a first step in our effort to evaluate the water quality, in terms of the presence and environmental/human risk of genotoxicants in the studied lake ecosystems. The present study showed for the first time the presence of genotoxic substances in surface waters of the studied lakes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kondash, AJ; Albright, E; Vengosh, A				Kondash, Andrew J.; Albright, Elizabeth; Vengosh, Avner			Quantity of flowback and produced waters from unconventional oil and gas exploration	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The management and disposal of flowback and produced waters (FP water) is one of the greatest challenges associated with unconventional oil and gas development. The development and production of unconventional natural gas and oil is projected to increase in the coming years, and a better understanding of the volume and quality of FP water is crucial for the safe management of the associated wastewater. We analyzed production data using multiple statistical methods to estimate the total FP water generated per well from six of the major unconventional oil and gas formations in the United States. The estimated median volume ranges from 1.7 to 143 million L (0.5 to 3.8 million gal) of FP per well over the first 5-10 years of production. Using temporal volume production and water quality data, we show a rapid increase of the salinity associated with a decrease of FP production rates during the first months of unconventional oil and gas production. Based on mass-balance calculations, we estimate that only 4-8% of FP water is composed of returned hydraulic fracturing fluids, while the remaining 92-96% of FP water is derived from naturally occurring formation brines that is extracted together with oil and gas. The salinity and chemical composition of the formation brines are therefore the main limiting factors for beneficial reuse of unconventional oil and gas wastewater. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Combined in situ effects of metals and nutrients on marine biofilms: Shifts in the diatom assemblage structure and biological traits	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The effects of multiple stressors on marine diatom assemblages are still poorly understood. The interactive effects of metals and nutrients were assessed in two coastal biofilms grown at a reference site and a historically contaminated site. The biofilms were exposed in situ to pulse exposures of metals (Zn and Pb) and nutrients (N and P) individually and in combination to mimic patterns of discharge in the study area. The reference community's structure (composition and abundance of taxa) was modified after metals and/or nutrients exposure, but each stressor acted in different way. Irrespective of the stressors or scenario, the abundance of the dominant species Opephora krumbeinii declined, and it is proposed as sensitive species. Nutrient supply favoured the proliferation of certain species with high nutrient tolerances (Fragilaria famelica, Tabularia ktenoeides), whereas metals promoted the colonisation of metal-tolerant species, e.g., Berkeleya fennica, Opephora marina. Simultaneous exposure induced an amplification of levels of accumulated metals, chlorophyll a and EPS contents and triggered the succession of species towards tolerant species with specific growth. Metals seemed to act as a selective factor of metal-tolerant species, and nutrients favoured the proliferation of those species forming zig-zag colonies (Neosynedra provincial's), mucous tubes (Berkeleya spp.) and motile diatoms (Navicula salinicola, Nitzschia incognita), resulting in biofilms with a more complex architecture. The diatom communities from the historically contaminated site were more resistant to pulse exposure, but metals or nutrients loads induced overproduction of mucilage. We propose that growth forms may complement taxonomic approaches and provide a quick and easy way to detect community changes related to metal and nutrient pollution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Bradford; Kenney, Melanie; Warren, Barbara; Louisos, Jeremy			Multi-faceted monitoring of estuarine turbidity and particulate matter provenance: Case study from Salem Harbor, USA	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Turbidity is a water quality parameter that is known to adversely affect aquatic systems, however the causes of turbid water are often elusive. We present results of a study designed to constrain the source of particulate matter in a coastal embayment that has suffered from increased turbidity over past decades. Our approach utilized monitoring buoys to quantify turbidity at high temporal resolution complemented by geochemical isotope analysis of suspended sediment samples and meteorological data. Results reveal a complex system in which multiple sources are associated with particulate matter. Weight of evidence demonstrates that phytoplankton productivity in the water column, however, is the dominant source of particulate matter associated with elevated turbidity in Salem Harbor, Massachusetts. Allochthonous matter from the watershed was observed to mix into the pool of suspended particulate matter near river mouths, especially in spring and summer. Resuspension of harbor surface sediments likely provides additional particulates in the regions of boat moorings, especially during summer when recreational boats are attached to moorings. Our approach allows us to constrain the causes of turbidity events in this embayment, is helping with conservation efforts of environmental quality in the region, and can be used as a template for other locations.

Freshwater mussels in an urban watershed: Impacts of anthropogenic inputs and habitat alterations on populations	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The substantial increase in urbanization worldwide has resulted in higher emissions of wastewater to riverine systems near urban centers, which often impairs aquatic populations and communities. This study examined the effect of urbanization on freshwater mussel populations, including Species at Risk in two rivers receiving wastewater. The influence of anthropogenic activities was assessed in a watershed in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, one that historically supported one of the most diverse mussel faunas in Canada. In the Grand River (ON), four sites along a 60 km reach spanning from an upstream reference site to an urban-impacted downstream area were examined. In the Speed River, mussel populations at six sites along a 10 km reach, selected to bracket specific anthropogenic inputs and structures were assessed. A semi-quantitative visual search method revealed that catch per unit effort in the Grand River declined by >60% from the upstream reference site to the area downstream of an urban center. The size (length) frequency distribution of the most abundant species, Lasmigona costata, was significantly (p <= 0.008) different upstream of the majority of urban inputs (45130 mm) compared to downstream of the cities (85-115 mm). In the Speed River, impoundments and wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) reduced both the diversity and catch per effort. Most striking were 84 and 95% changes in the number of mussels found on either side of two impoundments, and a 98% drop in mussels immediately downstream of a VVWTP outfall. These population level effects of decreased abundance and underrepresentation of smaller mussels downstream of the urban area correspond to previously documented impacts at the biochemical and whole organism level of biological organization in wild mussels at this location. Our results demonstrate that poor water quality and physical barriers in urban environments continue to impair susceptible populations and communities of aquatic animals.

The intensive agricultural activity in Chtouka basin requires the mobilization of 94% of fresh water resources for irrigation. This overexploitation, along with the succession of drought years, sea water intrusion and various sources of pollution, affected the quality and availability of groundwater resources. Several sampling campaigns were carried out in different sites of the study area in order to investigate the spatial variation of groundwater quality. The temporal evolution of groundwater level shows that the water table was subjected to a gradual decline during the last decade, indicating an intensive exploitation mainly in irrigated areas. In the Southern part around Belfaa and the irrigated area along Massa River, nitrate concentrations exceed 50 mg/L, which is the threshold set by the World Health Organization, while in the northern part around Biougra and Ait Amira, the nitrate concentration is mostly below 50 mg/L indicating a relative good groundwater quality. This finding can be explained by the improvement of agricultural practices, particularly the conversion of flood and sprinkler irrigation to drip irrigation (80% of the total irrigated area) in most of the developed farms in this part of the study area. Moreover, the exploitation of groundwater from the deep aquifer, due to the increasing water demand in the region, can also explain the low chemical concentrations since the deep aquifer is not affected by anthropogenic pollutants or marine intrusion. Stable isotopes (O-18 and H-2) highlight the different origins of groundwater, indicating the complexity of the aquifer system path flows, which is attributable to the intensive exploitation and irrigation water return.

Monitoring, sources, receptors, and control measures for three European Union watch list substances of emerging concern in receiving waters - A 20 year systematic review	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pollution of European receiving waters with contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), such as with 17-beta-estradiol (a natural estrogenic hormone, E2), along with pharmaceutically -active compounds diclofenac (an anti-inflammatory drug, DCL) and 17-alpha-ethynylestradiol (a synthetic estrogenic hormone, EE2)) is a ubiquitous phenomenon. These three CECs were added to the EU watch list of emerging substances to be monitoring in 2013, which was updated in 2015 to comprise 10 substances/groups of substances in the field of water policy. A systematic literature review was conducted of 3952 potentially relevant articles over period 1995 to 2015 that produced a new EU-wide database consisting of 1268 publications on DCL, E2 and EE2. European surface water concentrations of DCL are typically reported below the proposed annual average environmental quality standard (AA EQS) of 100 ng/l, but that exceedances frequently occur. E2 and EE2 surface water concentrations are typically below 50 ng/l and 10 ng/1 respectively, but these values greatly exceed the proposed AA EQS values for these compounds (0.04 and 0.035 ng/l respectively). However, levels of these CECs are frequently reported to be disproportionately high in EU receiving waters, particularly in effluents at control points that require urgent attention. Overall it was found that DCL and EE2 enter European aquatic environment mainly following human consumption and excretion of therapeutic drugs, and by incomplete removal from influent at urban wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). E2 is a natural hormone excreted by humans which also experiences incomplete removal during WWTPs treatment. Current conventional analytical chemistry methods are sufficiently sensitive for the detection and quantification of DCL but not for E2 and EE2, thus alternative, ultra-trace, time-integrated monitoring techniques such as passive sampling are needed to inform water quality for these estrogens. DCL appears resistant to conventional wastewater treatment while E2 and EE2 have high removal efficiencies that occur through biodegradation or sorption to organic matter. There is a pressing need to determine fate and behaviour of these CECs in European receiving waters such as using GIS-modelling of river basins as this will identify pressure points for informing priority decision making and alleviation strategies for upgrade of WWTPs and for hospital effluents with advanced treatment technologies. More monitoring data for these CECs in receiving waters is urgently needed for EU legislation and effective risk management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Effect of past peat cultivation practices on present dynamics of dissolved organic carbon	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Peatlands are a major source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for aquatic ecosystems. Naturally high DOC concentrations in peatlands may be increased further by drainage. For agricultural purposes, peat has frequently been mixed with sand, but the effect of this measure on the release and cycling of DOC has rarely been investigated. This study examined the effects of (i) mixing peat with sand and (ii) water table depth (WTD) on DOC concentrations at three grassland sites on shallow organic soils. The soil solution was sampled bi-weekly for two years with suction plates at 15, 30 and 60 cm depth. Selected samples were analysed for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), delta C-13(Dom) and delta N-15(DOM.) Average DOC concentrations were surprisingly high, ranging from 161 to 192 mg 1(-1). There was no significant impact of soil organic carbon (SOC) content or WTD on mean DOC concentrations. At all sites, DOC concentrations were highest at the boundary between the SOC-rich horizon and the mineral subsoil. In contrast to the mean concentrations, the temporal patterns of DOC concentrations, their drivers and the properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) differed between peat-sand mixtures and peat. DOC concentrations responded to changes in environmental conditions, but only after a lag period of a few weeks. At the sites with a peat-sand mixture, temperature and therefore probably biological activity determined the DOC concentrations. At the peat site, the contribution of vegetation derived DOM was higher. The highest concentrations occurred during long, cool periods of waterlogging, suggesting a stronger physicochemical-based DOC mobilisation. Overall, these results indicate that mixing peat with sand does not improve water quality and.may result in DOC losses of around 200 kg DOC ha(-1) a(-1). (C) 2016 The Authors.

Estimating the contribution of nitrogen and phosphorus to waterbodies by colonial nesting waterbirds	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fecal deposition by colonial nesting waterbirds is a potential source of nutrient enrichment and pollution of nearby waterways. Excess concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can cause water quality concerns or impairment. We estimated concentrations of N and P deposited to waterbodies by birds nesting in four colonies in east-central Texas during 2011-2013, and developed an age-structured compartment model to estimate the amount of fecal N and P material deposited by birds during the entire breeding season. There was a seasonal variation in the accumulation of N and P in waterbodies where heronries were located with a significant increase from June to July at the peak of the breeding season. Also, there was a significant positive correlation in concentrations of N (P = 0.023) in fecal material and water samples from one of the colonies (Murphy Park), suggesting a significant contribution of N from feces to water. Concentrations of N in water near the colonies were also significantly correlated (P = 0.004, R-2 = 0.22) with the average amount of precipitation recorded for each region. The simulation model results indicated that total N and P deposition increased proportionally with heronry size, and daily deposition rates varied due to the shifting daily activity budgets of the birds as the breeding season progressed. The total estimated loads from the model reached a maximum of 2170 kg N and 240 kg P for a given colony, with daily deposition estimated at 22.8 kg N, and 2.5 kg P. Based on the model, one bird can release about 1 mg of N and 0.115 mg of P on a daily basis to the soil substrate or directly over water. Results from this study could be useful to estimate the contribution of N and P from wildlife to waterbodies, and for watershed management plans. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Bereskie, T; Haider, H; Rodriguez, MJ; Sadiq, R				Bereskie, Ty; Haider, Husnain; Rodriguez, Manuel J.; Sadiq, Rehan			Framework for continuous performance improvement in small drinking water systems	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Continuous performance improvement (CPI) can be a useful approach to overcome water quality problems impacting small communities. Small drinking water systems (SDWSs) struggle to meet regulatory requirements and often lack the economic and human resource flexibility for immediate improvement. A CPI framework is developed to provide SDWS managers and operators an approach to gauge their current performance against similar systems and to track performance improvement from the implementation of the new technologies or innovations into the future. The proposed CPI framework incorporates the use of a water quality index (WQI) and functional performance benchmarking to evaluate and compare drinking water quality performance of an individual water utility against that of a representative benchmark. The results are then used to identify and prioritize the most vulnerable water quality indicators and subsequently identify and prioritize performance improvement strategies. The proposed CPI framework has been demonstrated using data collected from SDWSs in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada and using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (COME) WQI.

In this study we proposed a strategy based on water level regulation for the control of odor-producing cyanobacteria in source water. Miyun Reservoir, the main surface water source for Beijing, has been suffering from 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) induced T&O problems caused by deep-living Planktothrix sp. since 2002. The biomass of deep-living Planktothrix in Miyun Reservoir was found to be mainly governed by the water depth above its sediment habitat. An algorithm for water level regulation aiming to minimize the risk for T&O in different types of reservoirs is proposed. The study demonstrates that risk for T&O can be minimized by increasing the water level in Miyun Reservoir. The high-risk area can be reduced by about 2.91% (0.61% to 5.76%) of surface area for each meter increase in the water level, when the water level is lower than 145 m. More specifically, the water level needs to be raised to higher than 147.7 m a.s.l. from 131.0 m in order to obtain an acceptable risk level (ARL) of 10%. This management strategy to abate T&O problems is simpler and cheaper to implement compared to traditional physical, chemical and biological techniques. Moreover, it has no apparent negative impact on water quality and aquatic organisms.

New Zealand is addressing this issue by regulating land-based nutrient losses, with debates over how to allocate limits across a heterogeneous landscape. We develop a spatially explicit economic land use model to investigate efficiency and equity issues from seven approaches to allocate nutrient discharges across two New Zealand watersheds. We find that the preferred allocation differs across land use, land characteristics, and regulation stringency; and that there is no universal 'best' allocation option. Therefore, decision-makers should focus on, at least, efficiency and equity, and on how to compensate those most affected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Acidity generation accompanying iron and sulfur transformations during drought simulation of freshwater re-flooded acid sulfate soils	GEODERMA												Remediation of acid sulfate soil (ASS) wetlands by re-flooding with freshwater generates alkalinity and leads to the reformation of reduced inorganic sulfur (RIS) and Fe(II) species in surface soil layers. These contemporary RIS/Fe(II) species are vulnerable to drought-induced oxidation. However, the rates and magnitude of acid-generating reactions and competing acid-neutralisation reactions during such oxidation events are unknown. In this study, ten surface soil samples (0-0.2 m depth) were collected from two freshwater re-flooded ASS wetlands and subjected to oxidative incubation for up to 130 days. The objective was to examine the rate and magnitude of acidity generation and compare this to changes in RIS/Fe speciation. During the incubation, soil pH decreased rapidly by similar to 2-3 units, while titratable actual acidity increased, largely as a result of H+ generation from oxidation of RIS species. RIS species (primarily small pyrite framboids and dispersed sub-micron sized, euhedral pyrite crystals), decreased over time in all soil samples while the reactive pool of Fe(III) minerals (e.g. schwertmannite) increased. Importantly, the highest rates of acidity generation occurred within the first 20 days, suggesting that surface soil layers in these remediated wetlands are prone to rapid acidification during future droughts. Variations in the magnitude of soil acidification largely reflect differences in both initial RIS content and acid neutralisation capacity (ANC). Spatial variations were evident, with sites located at lower elevations generally containing higher initial RIS and generating more acidity in a shorter time period. However, the magnitude of acidity generation was consistently less than that predicted by theoretical calculations. These results provide new information that is directly relevant to the future management and mitigation of risks to water quality associated with freshwater re-flooding of ASS wetlands.

Effects of land use on larval Odonata assemblages in cloud forest streams in central Veracruz, Mexico	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study analyzes the effect of stream water quality and its relationship with habitat characteristics on larval Odonata assemblages in streams found in tropical montane cloud forests, pastures, and coffee plantations in the upper La Antigua River watershed. The main factors that influenced larval Odonata assemblages in forest streams were low temperatures and high oxygen levels in water, coupled with a high diversity of the substrate and riparian vegetation; in pasture streams and coffee plantation streams, sedimentation strongly affected the composition of larval Odonata assemblages. In all the streams, species richness ((0) D) was higher during the dry season. The highest Shannon alpha diversity ((1) D) values were found in forest streams during the rainy season; however, in pasture and coffee plantation streams, (1) D values were higher during the dry season. The low species turnover in forest streams suggests that these streams provide highly stable conditions for Odonata assemblages; however, in pasture and coffee plantation streams, the higher turnover was related to the more variable water and habitat conditions. Thus, the persistence of Odonata assemblages in the upper La Antigua River watershed is closely related to the conservation status of the tropical montane cloud forests.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2017	785	1					19	33		10.1007/s10750-016-2900-x								WOS:000388173000002

Extracellular enzyme activity suggests phosphorus limitation of biofilm productivity in acid mine drainage remediated streams	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a global consequence of historical and present day mining activities. Remediation efforts have been successful in improving water quality with elevated pH and decreased dissolved metals. In many streams, there has been chemical and biological recovery, but success is not universal. The goal of restoration should be to improve not only biological diversity but also stream function. We compared biofilm community characteristics and function from three stream categories (AMD-unimpaired, AMD-impaired, and AMD-remediated) in southeastern Ohio. Biofilms of the AMD-impaired and AMD-remediated sites had the lowest concentrations of chlorophyll a and the lowest rates of productivity and respiration. AMD-impaired streams had reduced pH and increased dissolved metal (iron, aluminum, and manganese) concentrations. Specific conductance was elevated in both the AMD-impaired and AMD-remediated streams. Water at the AMD-impacted and AMD-remediated sites had significantly lower soluble reactive phosphorus concentration compared to AMD-unimpaired sites. Biofilm extracellular enzyme activities showed an increase in biomass-specific phosphorus-acquiring enzymes in AMD-impaired and AMD-remediated sites. These results suggest phosphorus limitation is occurring in AMD-impaired and AMD-remediated streams, potentially limiting or delaying biotic recovery even though water chemistry has improved.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2017	784	1					225	236		10.1007/s10750-016-2877-5								WOS:000387484100017						
J	Baumgartner, SD; Robinson, CT				Baumgartner, Simone D.; Robinson, Christopher T.			Short-term colonization dynamics of macroinvertebrates in restored channelized streams	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Macroinvertebrate colonization of restored rivers is a function of dispersal into the restored reach and its suitability for population establishment. To maximize potential for colonization success, spatial considerations such as distance to colonizer source pools and dispersal pathways must be included in restoration planning. Unfortunately, the dispersal abilities of macroinvertebrates and ecological importance of different dispersal modes for colonization are still poorly understood. We used a field experiment that controlled colonization by passive drift and allowed distinction between active upstream aquatic and active/passive aerial dispersal, thus testing their differential importance during colonization of experimentally restored stream reaches. Two agricultural streams emanating below culverts were longitudinally separated along the first 30 m and one stream side each was covered with a fine-mesh net to limit aerial dispersal. Colonization of manually disturbed background and experimentally introduced cobble substrate was investigated over 6 months. We found that upstream in-stream dispersal, especially in these agricultural streams, can be rapid (days) and play an important role in the short-term colonization of restored streams. We conclude that a landscape perspective, in addition to in-stream measures, must be considered when attempting to restore streams dominated by agricultural and urban land use that constrains available species pools and limits dispersal pathways.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2017	784	1					321	335		10.1007/s10750-016-2886-4								WOS:000387484100023

Innovative modeling framework for combined sewer overflows prediction	URBAN WATER JOURNAL												Combined sewer overflows ( CSOs) and street flooding are undesirable consequences of insufficient capacity of sewer networks and wastewater systems. These conditions degrade the water quality of the receiving waters, potentially damage infrastructure, and threaten public health. Significant efforts to prevent CSOs and alleviate flooding have been undertaken in Chicago, with the construction of the tunnel and reservoir plan ( TARP). This study analyses the hydraulic response of the first tunnel built in Chicago "The Lawrence Avenue Tunnel" through a framework of hydrological and hydraulic models. This framework proved effective in CSO's volume, frequency and duration predictions as it yields simulation results of existing conditions that match well with available records. The findings also provide insights into the importance of system operation on CSOs occurrence and magnitude.

Acid mine drainage (AMD) occurs when sulfides are in contact with oxygen and water, and several parameters and mechanisms influence final drainage quality. Galvanic interactions influence the reactivity of sulfide minerals, which act as semi-conductors. These galvanic interactions have been insufficiently studied in the context of AMD generation. In this study, the influence of pyrite on the reactivity of sphalerite and chalcopyrite was investigated. Five blends, comprised of free grains of quartz/pyrite, quartz/chalcopyrite, quartz/sphalerite, quartz/pyrite/chalcopyrite, and quartz/pyrite/sphalerite, were subjected to geochemical testing. Five weathering cells were monitored over a 200-day period during which they were leached twice weekly. Leachates were analyzed for pH, Eh, electrical conductivity, and sulfate and metal concentrations. The results of these analyses showed that galvanic interactions occurred between free sulfide grains. Pyrite was galvanically protected over the full testing period in the quartz/pyrite/chalcopyrite blend, and partially protected in the quartz/pyrite/sphalerite blend. Moreover, the release of Cu from chalcopyrite and Zn, Mn, and Cd from sphalerite was accelerated. in the presence of pyrite. This work provides a better understanding of the influence of pyrite on chalcopyrite and sphalerite reactivity by highlighting the galvanic effects. In the future, to improve the reliability of AMD prediction tests, galvanic interactions should be considered in both the prediction of the acid generation potential and the estimation of metal and metalloid release rates.

Results showed the biofiltration process could effectively remove turbidity.(<0.1 NTU in all effluents) and NOM (>24% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), >57% of UV254, and >44% of SUVA(254)), where the SA biofilters showed a strong capacity for turbidity removal, while the GAC contactors played the dominant role in NOM removal. The vertical profile of water quality in the GAC contactors indicated the middle-upper portion was the critical zone for the removal of NOM, where relatively higher adsorption and enhanced biological removal were afforded. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) analysis of NOM showed that the GAC contactors effectively decreased the content of humic-like component, while protein-like component was refractory for the biofiltration process. Nutrients (NH4-N and PO4-P) supplementation applied upstream of one of the two-stage biofiltration trains (called engineered biofiltration) stimulated the growth of microorganisms, and showed a modest effect on promoting the biological removal of small non-aromatic compositions in NOM. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated influent UV254 was the most explanatory water quality parameter for GAC contactors' treatment performance, and a high load of UV254 would result in significantly reduced removals of UV254 and SUVA(254).

Variability of disinfection by-products at a full-scale treatment plant following rainfall events	CHEMOSPHERE												The quality of drinking water sources can decrease when contaminants are transported by overland and subsurface flow and discharged into surface waters following rainfall events. Increases in organic contaminants such as road salts and organic matter may occur and potentially modify disinfection by-products (DBPs) concentration and speciation. This study investigated the effects of various spring rainfall events on the quality of treated waters at a large water treatment plant through the implementation of intensive water quality monitoring of raw, filtered and treated waters during different rainfall events. DBPs (four trihalomethanes and six haloacetic acids) and their explanatory variables (pH, turbidity, water temperature, specific ultraviolet absorbance, total and dissolved organic carbon, bromide and chlorine dose) were measured during four rainfall events. The results showed that water quality degrades during and following rainfall, leading to small increases in trihalomethans (THM4) and haloacetic acids (HAA6) in treated waters. While THM4 and HAA6 levels remained low during the pre-rainfall period (<9 mu g/L) for the four sampling campaigns, small increases in THM4 and HAA6 during and after spring rainfall events were observed. During the rainfall and post-rainfall periods, concentration peaks corresponding to 3-fold and 2-fold increases (respectively 27.5 mu g/L for THM4 and 12.6 mu g/L. for HAA6) compared to pre-rainfall levels were also measured. A slight decrease in harmful brominated THM and HAA proportion was also observed following rainfall events. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Behavioural response of bivalve molluscs to calcium hydroxide	AQUACULTURE												Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) that are cultivated in the marine area around Prince Edward Island, Eastern Canada, are susceptible to the heavy biofouling of their shells by an invasive solitary tunicate, Styela clava, which rapidly proliferates. To mitigate this issue, mussel farmers periodically lift the longlines on which the mussels are suspended out of the water to spray a highly alkaline (similar to 12.7 pH units) calcium hydroxide solution onto fouled individuals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that calcium hydroxide exerts behavioural stress on mussels and other bivalves. Field surveys revealed that the alkalinity of the seawater in the vicinity of longlines increased (9.3-11.7 pH units) immediately after treated mussel sleeves were returned into the water column. Thereafter, pH values declined rapidly, and met federal water quality guidelines (7.0-8.7 pH units) within 3.1 +/- 0.5 min (range 0.3-10.5 min, n = 31 sleeves). Cultivated mussels challenged to both emersion and calcium hydroxide closed their valves for 14.0 +/- 3.3 min (n = 18) compared to 6.5 +/- 1.6min (n = 17) by control mussels (emersion only). We subsequently assessed how three benthic bivalve species (M. edulis, Crassostrea virginica (eastern oyster) and Argopecten irradians (bay scallop)) respond to weak (pH <= 9.2) but sustained (3-h daily for 3 days) alkalinity conditions. All three species consistently responded by completely or partially closing their valves. However, all behavioural responses were short-lived (0.2-4.7 h), and were generally confined to the treatment period. In conclusion, spraying calcium hydroxide onto cultivated mussels has limited impact on seawater alkalinity and the behaviour of nearby bivalves. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

A hybrid wavelet kernel SVM-based method using artificial bee colony algorithm for predicting, the cyanotoxin content from experimental cyanobacteria concentrations in the Trasona reservoir (Northern Spain)	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS					International Conference on Mathematical Modeling in Engineering and Human Behavior	SEP 09-11, 2015	Inst Univ Matematica Multidisciplinar, Valencia, SPAIN		Inst Univ Matematica Multidisciplinar			Cyanotoxins, a kind of poisonous substances produced by cyanobacteria, are responsible for health risks in surface waters used for drinking or for recreation. Additionally, cyanobacteria blooms are often called blue green algae. A harmful algal bloom (HAB) is an algal bloom that causes negative impacts to other organisms via production of natural toxins such as cyanotoxins. Consequently, anticipating its presence is a matter of importance to prevent risks. This study presents a novel hybrid algorithm, support vector machines with Mexican hat wavelet kernel function (wavelet SVMs) in combination with the artificial bee colony (ABC) technique, for predicting the cyanotoxin content from cyanobacterial concentrations determined experimentally in the Trasona reservoir (recreational reservoir used as a high performance training center of canoeing in the Northern Spain). This optimization technique involves kernel parameter setting in the SVM training procedure, which significantly influences the regression accuracy. Bearing this in mind, cyanotoxin contents have been predicted here by using the hybrid wavelet ABC SVM-based model from the remaining measured water quality parameters (input variables) in the Trasona reservoir (Northern Spain) with success. In other words, the results of the present study are two-fold. In the first place, the significance of each biological and physical chemical variable on the cyanotoxin content in the reservoir is presented through the model. Secondly, a predictive model able to predict the possible presence of cyanotoxins is obtained. The agreement of the wavelet ABC SVM-based model with experimental data confirmed its good performance. Indeed, a coefficient of determination equal to 0.91 was obtained. Finally, conclusions of this innovative research work are exposed.

This study examined the feasibility of a PB+anion exchange (AE) process for decontamination of Cs-polluted drinking water. Two scenarios were tested: AE granules over PB granules in a stimulated sand filter and PB column followed by AE column in a full-scale waterworks. Both scenarios revealed complete removal of Cs and PB fragments from the treated drinking waters, suggesting that the PB+AE unit can be the core of emergency response plan for typical drinking waterworks at nuclear accident threat.

Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a versatile material to remove the organic pollutants from water. However, such materials capable of both efficiently separating insoluble oil and organic solvent from water and photodegrading soluble organic pollutions are rare on the market. Here, we report a facile method to fabricate a dual-layer copper mesh (DCM) by overlaying a graphene oxide (GO)/AgBr-coated mesh onto an Ag-coated mesh. The key point in this study is to integrate the superhydrophobic Agcoated mesh and photocatalytic GO/AgBr-coated mesh, resulting in the bifunctional DCM with both excellent oil/water separation performance and efficient photodegradation of soluble organic pollutants under visible light illumination. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the fabrication process is simple and cost-effective without using any sophisticated equipment, which permits a scale-up of DCM for water purification. Hence, the bifunctional and easily prepared properties make it an ideal candidate for encouraging application in oil/water separation and water pollutants photodegradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Gomez-Lopez, VM; Gil, MI; Allende, A				Gomez-Lopez, Vicente M.; Gil, Maria I.; Allende, Ana			A novel electrochemical device as a disinfection system to maintain water quality during washing of ready to eat fresh produce	FOOD CONTROL												Electrolyzed water (EW) is known by its bactericidal efficacy and capability to oxidize organic matter. The present research evaluated the efficacy of recently developed electrolytic cells able to generate higher concentration of reactive oxygen species using lower power and salt concentration than conventional cells. This study tested the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7, the organic matter depletion and trihalomethane (THM) generation by EW in process wash water under dynamic conditions. To achieve this, clean tap water was continuously added up to 60 min with artificial process water with high chemical oxygen demand (COD) inoculated with E. coli O157:H7, in experiments performed in a pilot plant that recirculated water through one-electrolytic cell. Plate counts of E. coli O157:H7, COD, THMs, free, combined and total chlorine, pH, temperature and oxidation-reduction potential were determined. Results indicate that the novel electrolysis system combined with minimal addition of NaCl (0.05%) was able to suppress E. coli 0157:H7 population build-up and decreased the COD accumulation in the process wash water. THM levels in the water were relatively high but its-concentration in the washed product was marginal. Highly effective electrolysis has been proven to reduce the occurrence of foodborne diseases associated to cross-contamination in produce washers without having an accumulation of THMs in the washed product.
