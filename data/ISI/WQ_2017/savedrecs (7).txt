J	Singh, G; Kamal, RK				Singh, Gurdeep; Kamal, Rakesh Kant			Heavy metal contamination and its indexing approach for groundwater of Goa mining region, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The objective of the study is to reveal the seasonal variations in the groundwater quality with respect to heavy metal contamination. To get the extent of the heavy metals contamination, groundwater samples were collected from 45 different locations in and around Goa mining area during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The concentration of heavy metals, such as lead, copper, manganese, zinc, cadmium, iron, and chromium, were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Most of the samples were found within limit except for Fe content during the monsoon season at two sampling locations which is above desirable limit, i.e., 300 mu g/L as per Indian drinking water standard. The data generated were used to calculate the heavy metal pollution index (HPI) for groundwater. The mean values of HPI were 1.5 in the monsoon season and 2.1 in the post-monsoon season, and these values are well below the critical index limit of 100.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1479	1485		10.1007/s13201-016-0430-3								WOS:000411085600038

Rama			Comparative study on the water quality status of Andra reservoir and Denkada anicut constructed on Champavati River, Vizianagaram, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The author's present study was carried out for a period of 3 years from 2010 to 2013 to itemize the various physico-chemical parameters, irrigation water quality parameters and heavy metals in Champavathi River waters at Andra reservoir and Denkada anicut. Water samples were collected from the chosen sampling stations of the two reservoirs for every 4 months and analyzed as per APHA standard methods. The results obtained were compared with IS 10500 standards and found to be well within the prescribed values. Though the obtained values were well within the prescribed standard values, it was found that the water quality index, concentration of certain parameters such as calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium of the waters of Andra reservoir are higher than that of the Denkada anicut, and the concentration of nitrite was found to be higher in the water sample analyzed from Denkada anicut. Except silicon, all the other metals were found to be below the detection limits in the two reservoir waters. The reasons for the same were probed by the authors in the presented study. From the analysis reports, it was found that the water analyzed from the two reservoirs was fit for irrigation, agriculture, industrial and domestic purposes.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1497	1504		10.1007/s13201-015-0331-x								WOS:000411085600040

A combination of collection of monitored data, mathematical modeling, sensitivity, and uncertainty analysis has been done using the QUAL2Kw, a river quality model. The model was applied to simulate DO, BOD, total coliform, and total nitrogen at four monitoring stations, namely Palla, Old Delhi Railway Bridge, Nizamuddin, and Okhla for 10 years (October 1999-June 2009) excluding the monsoon seasons (July-September). The study period was divided into two parts: monthly average data from October 1999-June 2004 (45 months) were used to calibrate the model and monthly average data from October 2005-June 2009 (45 months) were used to validate the model. The R 2 for CBODf and TN lies within the range of 0.53-0.75 and 0.68-0.83, respectively. This shows that the model has given satisfactory results in terms of R 2 for CBODf, TN, and TC. Sensitivity analysis showed that DO, CBODf, TN, and TC predictions are highly sensitive toward headwater flow and point source flow and quality. Uncertainty analysis using Monte Carlo showed that the input data have been simulated in accordance with the prevalent river conditions.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2017	7	3					1535	1559		10.1007/s13201-015-0311-1								WOS:000411085600043

Due to significant research, the NSZD conceptual model has evolved dramatically in recent years, and methanogenesis is now accepted as a dominant attenuation process (e.g., Lundegard and Johnson ; Ng et al. ). Most of the methane is generated within the pore space adjacent to LNAPL (Ng et al. ) from where it migrates through the unsaturated zone (e.g., Amos and Mayer ), where it is oxidized. While great progress has been made, there are still some important gaps in our understanding of NSZD. NSZD measurements provide little insight on which constituents are actually degrading; it is unclear which rate-limiting factors that can be manipulated to increase NSZD rates; and how longevity of the bulk LNAPL and its key constituents can be predicted. Various threads of literature were pursued to shed light on some of the questions listed above. Several processes that may influence NSZD or its measurement were identified: temperature, inhibition from acetate buildup, protozoa predation, presence of electron acceptors, inhibition from volatile hydrocarbons, alkalinity/pH, and the availability of nutrients can all affect methanogenesis rates, while factors such as moisture content and soil type can influence its measurement. The methanogenic process appears to have a sequenced utilization of the constituents or chemical classes present in the LNAPL due to varying thermodynamic feasibility, biodegradability, and effects of inhibition, but the bulk NSZD rate appears to remain quasi-zero order. A simplified version of the reactive transport model presented by Ng et al. has the potential to be a useful tool for predicting the longevity of key LNAPL constituents or chemical fractions, and of bulk LNAPL, but more work is needed to obtain key input parameters such as chemical classes and their biodegradation rates and any potential inhibitions.																	1069-3629	1745-6592				SUM	2017	37	3					62	81		10.1111/gwmr.12219								WOS:000411766700014

The aims of this study is to prove contamination presumption, by analyzing and determine correlation Cd and Pb concentration in the sediment, in the water and on milkfish Chanos chanos cultured in this area. On this study, we collected water quality data (pH, temperature, dissolve oxygen and salinity) and heavy metals contamination (Cd and Pb) in the sediment, in the water and on milkfish. We compare collected data with quality standar and correlate heavy metal concentration between in the water and in the sediment; in the water and on milkfish organ; and, in the sediment and on milkfish organ. In general, water quality is sufficient enough to support the life of farmed milkfish. Cd and Pb contamination level in the water lied below the quality standard of Ministry of Environment decree No. 51/2004 in the last April and July. However, the contamination exceeds the standard in the last October. The contamination in sediment lied below RNO (1981), EPA (1999) and IACD/CEDA (1997). Gills, viscera and the meat of the milkfish are contaminated with Cd and Pb, yet, still lied below the quality standard of Ministry of Environment Decree No. 51/2004. The results showed that farmed milkfish in Thousand Islands are safe to eat. We also found that the correlation of Cd and Pb contamination between water and sediment is positive. The correlation of Cd is much higher than Pb. The correlation of Cd between water and viscera as well as between sediment and viscera are the most closely related than any other organ.																	2087-9423	2085-6695				JUN	2017	9	1					235	246		10.28930/jitkt.v9i1.17938								WOS:000411129200020

This is particularly important in areas that have suffered from a significant impact of human pressure on the ecological status of water. Field studies were conducted in the Ruda River in an area that had undergone anthropogenic disturbances. The objectives of our survey were to test the biological metrics based on benthic macroinvertebrates at four study sites. Spring and autumn surveys of benthic invertebrates indicated that based on the BMWP and BMWP(PL) indices, water quality was higher in comparison with the value of Multimetric index at all of the sites that were studied. Our results revealed that the water quality was higher at the study sites that are located above the dam reservoir based on both the chemical and biological parameters. This study also indicated that both spring and autumn constitute appropriate periods for carrying out monitoring studies. The values of multimeric index indicated the same water quality ( except for site 1) in both sampling periods.

Decanter system as mechanical treatment for enhancing seawater feed quality at Sabiya power generation and water desalination plant	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Long-term performance of power generation and water desalination equipment depends on proper seawater quality. At Sabiya power generation and water desalination plant (SPDP), the seawater quality is very high in turbidity because of high content of silt and sand. Currently, the quality of seawater at SPDP is causing some inconvenience to the operation and maintenance of the station's equipment. This paper is aimed at assessing the viability of enhancing seawater quality for thermal and membrane desalination processes at SPDP using the pilot-scale decanter centrifuge unit as mechanical treatment. This unit has the potential to substantially lower the silt and sand concentration to an acceptable level, allowing the use of seawater safely as feed for membrane and thermal desalination units, as well as for power generation equipment. The experimental results indicated that the decanter centrifuge system is a viable mechanical process for improving the quality of the SPDP seawater feed. The system was able to treat 100% of seawater feed, with a 99.6% availability. The separated silt and sand by the decanter centrifuge unit is coming out as a fine dry powder from the solid side compartment, which can be collected and transferred out of the SPDP station. In addition, the results showed that as flow increases, the power consumption decreases, which give an indication that the power consumption for treating seawater utilizing decanter centrifuge with a bigger capacity will be in an acceptable range.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	80						53	60		10.5004/dwt.2017.20928								WOS:000410672300006

Impact of decreasing COD/N ratio on nitrogen removal and fouling in a membrane bioreactor for urban wastewater treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												This research focused on the identification of the minimum COD/N ratio needed for the complete two-step denitrification process. Thus, to quantify the role of low COD/N ratios on nitrification and denitrification rates and on biological suspension filterability, experiments were carried out on a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) with a nitrogen loading rate of 0.16 kg N m(-3) d(-1). The investigation was comprised of two COD/N ratios, 3.5 and 5, and two sludge retention times (SRTs), 40 and 60 d. The best nitrogen removal performances were obtained when working with a COD/N ratio of 5 and a SRT of 60 d; nitrification and denitrification were achieved with total nitrogen removal reaching 82%. Experimental results appeared in good agreement with activated sludge model no. 1 (ASM1) predictions. Nevertheless, the minimum COD/N according to ASM1 was found close to 6.3, underlining that the hydrolysis phenomenon was underestimated when working at high sludge retention. The MBR performances confirm that operation at low organic loading rates is a promising strategy for decreasing energy requirements, without hampering water quality (nitrogen removal). More specifically, it allowed a significant reduction of oxygen requirements for carbon biodegradation and lower suspended solids in the bioreactor even at high SRT, allowing easier control of membrane fouling.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	80						121	132		10.5004/dwt.2017.21009								WOS:000410672300014

The current work focused mainly on the enhancement of disinfection efficiency of turbid wastewaters by the application of solar-based advanced oxidation processes. Inactivation of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis spores were evaluated in domestic wastewater at different turbidity levels. In total, 50 and 30 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide concentrations were used for solar/H2O2 and solar photo-Fenton processes, respectively. Results showed that E. coli removal by solar light process decreased significantly from a maximum of 4.24-log to a minimum of 1.38-log with increasing turbidity levels of 0.2, 30 and 150 nephelometric turbidity unit. However, with the application of solar/H2O2 and solar photo-Fenton processes, disinfection efficiencies increased and substantially higher E. coli removals were obtained. The synergistic effect of solar light and hydroxyl radicals overcame the adverse effect of turbidity. Inactivation levels of B. subtilis spores did not change significantly by the application of solar-based advanced oxidation processes. The best E. coli inactivation level in turbid wastewaters was achieved with solar photo-Fenton process.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	80						149	155		10.5004/dwt.2017.21003								WOS:000410672300017

Recent developments in aqueous phase bromate (BrO3-) species treatment using adsorption, reduction, and ion-exchange processes	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Recently, bromate (BrO3-) presence in the drinking water sources and its health-related concerns (e.g., carcinogenic) has initiated a lot of attention both within the regulatory bodies across the globe (such as WHO, US EPA, EU, etc.) and also within the scholarly community that look for efficient bromate removal techniques to meet the desired bromate water quality standards. Bromate species is typically formed during disinfection-ozonation of bromide containing water. Considering its carcinogenic and mutagenic threat toward human health, several recent research studies have investigated different processes for efficient bromate removal from the aqueous phase under a varying set of conditions and also report the optimum process variables. In this review paper, we have presented and summarized findings from the respective recent work on bromate removal techniques and have also discussed the effect of various process variables on bromate removal efficiency. The adsorption process is noted to be the most common and widely studied technique. Some of the adsorbent materials used included activated carbon, both unmodified and modified. The respective adsorbent samples are noted to have varying specific surface area, pore size, and surface morphology. In most studies, the effect of pH, initial bromate concentration, contact time, temperature, adsorbent dose, mixing speed, and coexisting ions was investigated to get optimum bromate removal. The adsorption equilibria and kinetics were mainly predicted by Langmuir/Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-second-order models, respectively. Also, the Donnan dialysis and electrodialysis ion-exchange processes removed bromate ions to acceptable concentrations. Bromate reduction can also be achieved using advanced reduction processes where ultraviolet light has been used as an activating agent and mainly sulfite as the reducing agent. Furthermore, chemical reduction, electrochemical reduction, and bio-reduction-based bromate removal processes are also discussed. The reduction-based processes indicated the formation of different reduced species including bromine. The ferrous-based reduction processes are noted to be very effective and several variations of ferrous-based technologies including adsorption and reduction processes are presented and discussed. In summary, this review work indicates a very positive development in the respective area of study, that is, bromate removal from the concerned aqueous streams, and hopefully will also serve as a focal point for further scientific innovations and endeavour for a better human health.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	80						255	267		10.5004/dwt.2017.20893								WOS:000410672300028

All the data related to this investigation were collected by field observations, interviews, surveys of farming households and focus groups. The surveys were conducted with 387 farmers belongs to three districts of southern Benin (Bonou, Ouinhi, and Zagnanado). Results of study revealed that 97.48%, 57.78%, 76% of farmers respectively of the Bonou, Ouinhi, and Zagnanado districts grow food crops. Among these, 2.53%, 42.22% and 24% cultivate cash crops such as cotton and oil palm. According to survey results, soil conservation and tillage practices are widely pract iced. Further, crops rotation and fallow are widely pract iced in all studied districts and 84.84% of the surveyed farmers use chemical pesticides to maximize crop yields. Among these, only 2.32% farmers used aqueous extracts of Azaradichta indica leaves for protecting crops against pests. The sources of the environmental risk are the type of chemical product on pesticide used, its toxicity, the parallel circuits of provisioning of pesticides, and the lack of use of protect ion clothes for spraying these products. This pract ice allowed ground and water pollution and leads to public health matter. A promotion of good pract ices is essential for a durable exploitation of the natural resources of the Upper Delta of Oueme area.

Fish were stocked @ 1500 individuals per pond (2 treated and 2 control) of approximate dimensions, 13.72 m x 10.97 m x 1.52 m (229 m(3)). In treated ponds, fish were fed with artificial diet (protein 42%, lipid 20% and energy 25.2 kJ g(-1)) for 120 days in three equal meals. On the other hand, control ponds remained without additives. During the whole study period, water quality parameters of the experimental ponds remained as salinity (15 parts per thousand-20 parts per thousand), dissolved oxygen (5.6 to 7.5ml/1), temperature (25 degrees C to 28 degrees C). p(H) (7.6-7.8), ammonia (NH4-N) and 'nitrites (NO2-N) less than (0.001mg/1), Secchi's disc visibility (8 cm to 46 cm). Higher percent weight gain (2665 g), specific growth rate (2.76 +/- 0.5 % day(-1)), best feed conversion ratio (0.14), condition factor (4.1), viscerosomatic index (7.1), hepatosomatic index (1.4) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher of fish treated with the artificial diet as compared to those in control ponds. Length-weight relationships of the juveniles showed significant (P < 0.0 I) growth and condition factor associated to feed application in treated ponds. Body composition of the fish was not significantly (P > 0.05) different in both the treatments, though protein and lipid contents of fish in treated ponds were greater than that of control ponds. The moister content of liver, muscle, viscera and whole body were not significantly different in control and treated ponds.

They were fed with commercial floating pellets having 35% crude protein at 2% body weight twice a day for 60 days and eggs were collected weekly. Results showed that fertilized eggs were found to be greater in number at low salinity level as compared to higher salinity level. Survival of fry ranged from 1058 to 1100 at salinity level of 0%0 20% with 5% increment, after which fry number decreased significantly (P<0.05). The fertilized eggs did not differ for the fish at salinity of 0%0 20%, but decreased significantly when salinity levels were increased above 25%(0). Water quality parameters remained as temperature (28.1 +/- 0.2 degrees C), dissolved oxygen (6.10 +/- 0.1 ml/1), pH (6.6 +/- 0.1 ml/1) and ammonia (0.02 +/- 0.004 ml/1) throughout the study period. Taking into consideration the number of fertilized eggs and survival of fry data attained in the present study, a salinity level of 20% is suggested for red tilapia breeding in concrete tanks.																	0030-9923					JUN	2017	49	3					1049	1056		10.17582/journal.pjz/2017.49.3.1049.1056								WOS:000409565700038

The objective of this study was to optimize irrigation between the vegetative (V) and reproductive (R) phases of maize under different available water levels in Colorado. Longterm (1992-2013) scenarios simulated with the calibrated Root Zone Water Quality Model were designed to meet 40%-100% of crop evapotranspiration (ET) requirements at V and R phases, subject to seasonal water availabilities (300, 400, 500 mm, and no water limit), with and without monthly limits (total of 112 scenarios). The most suitable irrigation between Vand R phases of maize was identified as 60/100, 80/100, and 100/100 of crop ET requirement for the 300, 400, 500 mm water available, respectively, based on the simulations from 1992 to 2013. When a monthly water limit was imposed, the corresponding suitable irrigation targets between V and R stages were 60/100, 100/100, and 100/100 of crop ET requirement for the above three seasonal water availabilities, respectively. Irrigation targets for producing higher crop yield with reduced risk of poor yield were discussed for projected five-year water availabilities.																	2095-7505	2095-977X				JUN	2017	4	2					172	184		10.15302/J-FASE-2017139								WOS:000410755300007

ALGAE	ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING												Water quality and its fast and reliable monitoring is the challenge of the future. Design of appropriate biosensors that would be capable of non-invasive identification of water pollution is an important prerequisite for such challenge. Chlorophylls are pigments, naturally presented in all plants that absorb light. The main forms of chlorophyll in algae are chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, other pigments include xantophylls and beta-carotenes. Our aim was to characterize endogenous fluorescence of the Chlorella sp. algae, present naturally in drinking water. We recorded spatial, spectral and lifetime fluorescence distribution in the native algae. We noted that the fluorescence was evenly distributed in the algae cytosol, but lacked in the nucleus and reached maximum at 680-690 nm. Fluorescence decay of chlorella sp. was double-exponential, and clearly shorter than that of its isolated pigments. For the first time, fluorescence lifetime image of the algae is presented. Study of the fluorescence properties of algae is aimed at the improvement of water supply contamination detection and cleaning.																	1336-1376	1804-3119				JUN	2017	15	2					352	357		10.15598/aeee.v15i2.2015								WOS:000409044400028

Riparian vegetation of both sites was differentially modified or replaced. Physical and chemical parameters and Odonata larvae were gathered from January to November 2001. A Hotelling-T test was used to compare the physico-chemical parameters while rank/abundance graphs and Renyi diversity profiles were constructed using Odonata larvae data. A total of 2,212 larvae of 13 species in 7 genera were collected. The sites were very similar in number of species and Odonata larval assemblage structure, however, some of the most abundant species at both sites showed significant differences in abundance. The observed differences between the 2 sites are mainly explained by differences in the structure of riparian vegetation and the availability of substrates for odonates and, secondarily, by physical and chemical changes in the water. An abundance ratio was established based on the most abundant species for monitoring future impairment or recovery changes.

J	de Souza, FH; Mondardo, RI; Sens, ML				de Souza, Fernando Hymno; Mondardo, Renata Iza; Sens, Mauricio Luiz			Drinking water treatment using upflow slow sand filtration systems in high density Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii cyanobacteria water	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii may cause problems in drinking water treatment plants if specific attention is not focused on removing the cyanobacteria. Slow sand filtration possesses a good capacity for cyanobacteria removal and is a simple alternative to more expensive treatments. However, high cyanobacteria concentrations can correspond to an operational problem for slow sand filters by reducing the filter running time, and therefore rough filtration is necessary. In this study, two similar upflow slow sand filters were used to evaluate C. raciborskii removal. Water with 9.1 x 10(5) cells/mL was used and an average of 99% of cells were removed. Nevertheless, average concentrations of 1.4 x 10(4) and 2.1 x 10(4) cells/mL were observed after filtration, and this could continue to act as a problem for water treatment. The system also indicated good results in terms of removing total coliforms, colour and turbidity. The average turbidity was below 1.0 NTU, which is the maximum value permitted by Brazilian regulations and WHO recommendations. The major advantage of the upflow slow sand filter involved the high removal of C. raciborskii without compromising the running time of the filter with the filters operating for almost 80 days without the use of rough filters. However, it is necessary to use a complementary treatment process to achieve better water quality results.				de Souza, Fernando/C-9840-2016	de Souza, Fernando/0000-0002-4542-7695												1944-3994	1944-3986				JUN	2017	79						1	8		10.5004/dwt.2017.20817								WOS:000408477000001

Here, the two-dimensional (2D) finite volume hydrodynamic models for the prediction of nutrients are developed. The model is based on the mass balance equation including advection and diffusion transport and chemical and biological transformation considering the impact of inflowing river and climate change. The model is formulated to simulate nutrients such as Amonia-Nitrogen (NH3-N), Nitrate (NO3-N) or overall Total Nitrogen (TN), Phosphorus (PO43-) or TP, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and prediction of spatial and temporal distributions of concentration of each parameter in the Peer-bazar estuaries leading to the Anzali International Wetland. Ten points of the Peer-bazar River were studied during an 18-month period from June 2014 to December 2015. The simulation and numerical analysis of water quality parameters were conducted in a 2-dimensional approach using the geometric and topographic data and imposing boundary conditions. This research used the software developed by the author, FLOW-3D mathematical model, and HEC-RAS for simulation and qualitative evaluation of the river. Results revealed that the mean concentration of phosphorous, nitrogen and TDS exceeded the permissible limits reported by the European Directive 80/778/EEC and OECD and USEPA standards. Therefore, water of the region is subject to the advanced eutrophic conditions. Simulation predictions showed that the variation in TDS and nutrients contents will increase in the next coming years and the region will reach to the stable conditions. Using regression, a relationship between EC and TDS was obtained in the next step.

The water samples were collected from three different stations of the river namely Belta (St-1), Kendua (St-2) and Charabari (St-3) under the Porabari union at Tangail Sadar Upazilla. Water temperature varied from 29.5 degrees C in June to 31.7 degrees C in May with a highest mean 31.17 +/- 0.47 in May. The pH of water was slightly alkaline in nature and ranged between 7.25 in June and 8.45 in April. Mean concentrations of BOD 0.87 +/- 0.19, 1.12 +/- 0.6 and 0.97 +/- 0.67 were recorded in April, May and June respectively. Highest PO42- value 4.4 mg/l was found in May and lowest value of PO42- 1.74 mg/l was found in June. Mean sulfate values at different months of Dhaleshwaririver were 6.61 +/- 1.78 mg/l, 7.61 +/- 2.16 mg/l and 3.68 +/- 0.23 mg/l respectively. Nitrate concentration in water samples varied from 0.51 mg/l in June to 3.66 mg/l in April. Total coliforms bacteria were found high in all water samples and values ranged from 11.05 x 10(8) -19 x 10(23) cfu/ml. The highest load of total coliforms bacteria was recorded at St-2 in May and the lowest was at St-1 in April. The highest concentration of Escherichia coli counted in water sample was 6 x 10(13) cfu/ml at St-2 during June, while lowest concentration was 5 x 10(5) cfu/ml at St-1 during May. The highest concentration of Vibrio cholerae was 9.66 x 10(14) cfu/ml at St-1 during June, while lowest concentration was 4.2 x 10(8) cfu/ml at St-3 during April. The high number of total coliform, Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae indicated significant level of microbial pollution in Dhaleshwari ri-ver. The presence of pathogenic organisms may pose not only health hazards to the users of the river water but also poses risks for the aquatic organisms especially fish of the water bodies. So the occurrence of high bacterial load concluded that the water of Dhaleshwari river is polluted and unhygienic for drinking and even unsuitable for domestic purposes without proper treatment.																	2327-0810	2327-0829				JUN	2017	7	6					523	533		10.4236/aim.2017.76041								WOS:000407173300009

Three waters systems in these areas experienced widespread and significant transient ground deformation in response to seismic shaking, with localised permanent ground deformation via liquefaction and lateral spreading. In Wellington, potable water quality was impacted temporarily by increased turbidity, and significant water losses occurred due to damaged pipes at the port. The Seaview and Porirua wastewater treatment plants sustained damage to clarifier tanks from water seiching, and increased water infiltration to the wastewater system occurred. Most failure modes in urban Marlborough were similar to the 2010-2011 Canterbury Earthquake Sequence; however some rural water tanks experienced rotational and translational movements, highlighting importance of flexible pipe connections. In Kaikoura, damage to reservoirs and pipes led to loss of water supply and compromised firefighting capability. Wastewater damage led to environmental contamination, and necessitated restrictions on greywater entry into the system to minimise flows. Damage to these systems necessitated the importation of tankered and bottled water, boil water notices and chlorination of the system, and importation of portaloos and chemical toilets. Stormwater infrastructure such as road drainage channels was also damaged, which could compromise condition of underlying road materials. Good operational asset management practices (current and accurate information, renewals, appreciation of criticality, good system knowledge and practical contingency plans) helped improve system resilience, and having robust emergency management centres and accurate Geographic Information System data allowed effective response coordination. Minimal damage to the wider built environment facilitated system inspections. Note Future research will include detailed geospatial assessments of seismic demand on these systems and attendant modes of failure, levels of service restoration, and collaborative development of resilience measures.																	1174-9857	2324-1543				JUN	2017	50	2					306	317										WOS:000407278300018

In this study, we evaluated the chemical diversity within 30 S. officinalis samples collected over three years at two sites differentially impacted by anthropogenic pollutants located near Marseille (South of France). Untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic profiling (C18 LC, ESI-Q-TOF MS) combined with XCMS Online data processing and multivariate statistical analysis revealed 297 peaks assigned to at least 86 compounds. The spatio-temporal metabolite variability was mainly attributed to variations in relative content of furanoterpene derivatives. This family was further characterized through LC-MS/MS analyses in positive and negative ion modes combined with molecular networking, together with a comprehensive NMR study of isolated representatives such as demethylfurospongin-4 and furospongin-1. The MS/MS and NMR spectroscopic data led to the identification of a new furanosesterterpene, furofficin (2), as well as two derivatives with a glycinyl lactam moiety, spongialactam A (12a) and B (12b). This study illustrates the potential of untargeted LC-MS metabolomics and molecular networking to discover new natural compounds even in an extensively studied organism such as S. officinalis. It also highlights the effect of anthropogenic pollution on the chemical profiles within the sponge.

Domestic and non-domestic activities are generating pollution to its rivers. The water body actually has itself a self natural purification capability. The characteristic of the river water quality will affect this pollution degradation process. This research is conducted to examine the biodegradation capacity of Jakarta's rivers. Water quality data of 23 rivers were collected for the time period of 2011 to 2015. Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) concentrations are then being used to calculate the BOD/COD ratio. The calculation results show that during the period time of 2011-2013 the ratio ranges between 0.36 and 0.63, which indicates that the rivers have average biodegradation capability. However, the 2014 year's data show that almost all of the rivers have ratio less than 0.2, indicating the nobiodegradation capability. Existence of metals can also inhibit the biodegradation process. The water quality data shows significant increase of metals in the year of 2014, especially Copper and Zinc in several rivers. Surfactant was also observed in extremely high concentration. Thus, most of the Jakarta's rivers have relatively low capability in biodegradation capacity and self purification capability. Although the latest year data shows an improvement, yet the BOD/COD ratio is still in the range of slow of biodegradation capacity.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				JUN	2017	12	34					45	50		10.21660/2017.34.2665								WOS:000406909300008

It was shown that microelements-rich sapropels are formed in the Lake Ilmenskoe. The Lake Ilmenskoe is free of anthropogenic impact and may be regarded as models while assessing the lakes under anthropogenic impact. The average element composition of macrophytes, gastropod shells and muscles, sapropel and sandy sediment were compared with the clarkes of elements in the continental crust with a preliminary aluminium rating, aluminium being the least fluent and abiogenic element of the system 'sediment - hydrobiont'. Sapropel was particular rich in microelements in comparison with sandy sediments. Study is shown that most elements are accumulated in aquatic organisms. Contectiana listeri and Potamogeton lucens L. may be considered as geochemical barriers. They can be used as biomonitors. We found out that low-iron, low-calcium, low-ash sapropel was forming in Lake Ilmenskoe.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				JUN	2017	12	34					82	88		10.21660/2017.34.2707								WOS:000406909300014

ECOLOGICAL STATE AND NEW APPROACHES TO THE RESTORATION OF LAKE UVILDY, RUSSIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE												Lake Uvildy is situated in the North of Chelyabinsk region. Lake Uvildy is one of the largest and the most unique of South Ural's lakes. In 1975-1977 the drought occurred and water supplies dried up in South Ural. 234 million cubic meters were moved from the Uvildy lake in Argazi reservoir, which was a source of water supply of the Chelyabinsk city. The lake's water level fell by more than 4 meters. Only in 2008 the water level returned to the previous position, but riparian vegetation was flooded. In July 2014 we carried out an ecological survey of the lake in five sites. We discovered submerged tree and shrub vegetation at 50-70 meters from the bank. Chemical analysis of water revealed the accumulation of organic substances and the transition of nitrogen from nitrate to nitrite and ammonia, of sulfur from sulfate to sulfite and hydrogen sulphide, of carbon to methane. We found blue-green algae (Microcystis, Anabaena, Oscillatoria) in all the sites. It indicates the beginning of water eutrophication. We proposed a new method of ecological restoration of the lake. In August 2014 we cleaned the bottom of the lake in two research points with a special innovative bottom-cleaning machine working both as a pump and a crusher. The research in summer 2015 showed that the water quality had significantly improved and the process of eutrophication had stopped in the points where the bottom was cleaned. Works on the lake trophicity will be continued.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				JUN	2017	12	34					89	95		10.21660/2017.34.2710								WOS:000406909300015

The hydrological water cycle unfolds via fundamental hydrological processes such as evapotranspiration, precipitation, infiltration and outflow. Certain infrastructure works and recent climate changes within lowland forest areas have resulted in changes in flood water and ground water trends, and in quantities of precipitation and evapotranspiration. One of the chemical water quality indicators is the presence of metals in water. Higher metal concentrations in natural waters are undesirable since they are polluters of aquatic systems and detrimental to living organisms. Particularly dangerous are cadmium and lead. The objective of this paper was to analyse watercourse levels, ground water depths, and relations between precipitation waters, flood waters, ground waters, relative air humidity and evapotranspiration. An additional objective was to analyse the pollution of precipitation and flood waters in lowland forest ecosystems. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted in the Posavina region in Croatia. Precipitation data from Nova Gradiska meteorological station, watercourse levels of the Sava River and ground water depth data from piezometer stations were used in the analysis of the hydrological relations. For water quality analysis, precipitation was collected at six sample sites during the spring of 2015 and 2016. Flood water and precipitation were collected in three repetitions during the spring of 2015 and 2016. Results: Trends of the Sava River water levels and ground water levels dropped significantly. The precipitation volume trend in the study area was positive, but not statistically significant, while evapotranspiration amounts increased significantly. Conclusions: A significant correlation has been found between particular water forms in the hydrological cycle, i.e. between precipitation waters, flood waters and ground waters, and between relative air humidity and evapotranspiration. No pollution of precipitation waters and flood waters with metals was found.																	1847-6481	1849-0891				JUN	2017	8	1					51	58		10.15177/seefor.17-07								WOS:000406981300006

The bivalve was collected for the first time in October 2016. The species occurred at low densities along a 25-km stretch of coastline. The size distribution suggests R. cuneata is established in the study area. This species represents the first obligatory suspension-feeding soft bottom bivalve in this low salinity area. Consequently, R. cuneata has a potential to intensify benthic-pelagic coupling as well as to improve the overall water quality of the bay. As Parnu Bay is the northernmost location of the species' geographic range, winter temperature likely controls the species survival and further spread in the region.

Spatio-temporal co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs: a modelling approach using physical-chemical predictors	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The invasion of alien species can have serious economic and ecological impacts. Ecologically, invasions often lead to an increased rate of native species replacement and decreased biodiversity. A critical step in the dominance of alien species is their successful co-occurrence with native species. In this study, we assessed the occurrence of alien molluscs and their co-occurrence with native molluscs and identified the determining physical-chemical variables. We expected that a combination of some key variables of water quality could provide suitable conditions promoting alien molluscs to occur and to co-occur with native molluscs. The analyses were based on 20-year data, collected from river systems across Flanders (Belgium). Classification Trees (CTs) were used to perform the analyses and to develop the predictive models. Based on CT models, the co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs could be reliably predicted based on physical-chemical variables. However, there was insufficient data to determine the environmental conditions in which alien taxa dominate. From the past to the present, spatial co-occurrence significantly increased. Sinuosity, ammonium and nitrate concentrations, chemical oxygen demand, pH and conductivity were the key determining variables. Our findings suggest that the co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs mainly occurs in straight rivers with good chemical water quality. These results provide insights into the ecology and behaviour of alien species which could support management practices and priority setting for conservation planning in surface waters of Flanders and Europe.																	1798-6540	1818-5487				JUN	2017	12	2					147	158		10.3391/ai.2017.12.2.03								WOS:000406481300003						
J	Xu, GJ; Xu, HL				Xu, Guangjian; Xu, Henglong			An approach to analysis of functional redundancy in protozoan communities for bioassessment in marine ecosystems	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												It is necessary to detect how much ecological redundancy or response units (RUs) exist in communities for reducing the "signal-to-noise" ratios of the observed full species data in community-based ecological research and monitoring programs. To reveal the functional redundancy in ciliated protozoan communities in marine ecosystems for both ecological research and monitoring programs, a multivariate approach (peeling procedure) was used to identify the response units to the environmental changes using a dataset of biofilm-dwelling ciliates from coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. From the full 141-species dataset, three subsets with sufficient information of the whole community (correlation coefficient >0.75) were identified as response units (RUs 1-3) at three levels of functional redundancy, which comprised 20, 26 and 27 species, respectively. These response units appeared to be interchangeable between functional equivalents on both spatial and temporal scales. In terms of relative abundance, RU1, which predominated the ciliate communities over 1-year period, and RU2, which occurred only in warm seasons (except winter) with a peak in summer, presented a decreasing trend, while RU3, which distributed all four seasons with two peaks in summer and autumn, increased with the increase of pollution level. Furthermore, high proportions of bacterivores were found in RU1 during warm seasons and represented an increase trend, while high relative abundances of algivores occurred in RUs 2 and 3 appeared to be decreasing along the pollution gradient. These results demonstrated that the ciliated protozoan assemblages have high functional redundancy in response to environmental changes in marine ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Alikas, K; Kratzer, S				Alikas, Krista; Kratzer, Susanne			Improved retrieval of Secchi depth for optically-complex waters using remote sensing data	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Water transparency is one of the ecological indicators for describing water quality and the underwater light field which determines its productivity. In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (Z(SD)) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution).The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (a(CNOM)(442) ranging 1.7-4.0 m(-1)), Chl a concentration (0.5-73 mg m(-3)) and total suspended matter (0.7-37.5 g m(-3)) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m < Z(SD) < 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the RMSE and increases the coefficient of determination (R-2). The accuracy increased (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.33 m, n = 134) when Z(SD) was retrieved via an empirical relationship between Z(SD) and K-d (490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when Z(SD) was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage. The satellite derived Z(SD) product could be therefore used as an additional source of information for WFD and MSFD reporting purposes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study was conducted to analyze the physicochemical and biological characteristics, namely temperature, pH, turbidity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, chlorides, sulfates, hardness, alkalinity, acidity, nitrate nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and fecal coliform of canal water at five different locations along the city. World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Public Health Association (APHA) standards were followed for the characterization of canal water samples. The results revealed that the canal water was slightly alkaline with electrical conductivity of 1200 mu S/cm. The concentrations of dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand near Kotri barrage were within WHO standards. The dissolved oxygen level in the samples was found decreasing, and biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand level was found increasing from first sampling station to the last along the entire course of the canal. The microbial study of the samples indicated the presence of fecal coliforms in the ranges from 207 to 867 MPN/100ml, which were exceeding the allowable surface water limits. It is discovered from the study that the Phuleli canal water became contaminated due to application of municipal solid waste and untreated wastewater from the city. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J	Ngoc, NM; Inoue, T; Yokota, K				Nguyen Minh Ngoc; Inoue, Takanobu; Yokota, Kuriko			Ultrasonic extraction method for quantifying bioavailable phosphorus in particulate form	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING												Eutrophication is a common problem in closed bodies of water areas during the summer. Recent reports have alleged that bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) in particulate forms contributes to eutrophication. However, current methods for quantifying particulate BAP are time-consuming and tedious. Here, we investigated the use of extraction with 0.1 M NaOH solution in combination with ultrasonication to quantify potential BAP in particulate forms in soils and suspended sediments from an agricultural area. The ultrasonic extraction process was considerably less time-consuming than conventional methods and would thus permit analysis of a greater number of samples. The bioavailability of extractable P was verified in algal growth potential assays involving P-starved Microcystis aeruginosa. The high correlation between the concentration of extracted BAP and M. aeruginosa growth at day 25 of incubation proved that the entire BAP fraction could be obtained in a single-step extraction. However, algal growth was also observed in cultures in which solid residues were the sole P source, confirming that the P left behind after extraction could be taken up by algal cells. This result suggests that in P-depleted media, algae could utilize cellular nutrients for growth. Therefore, M. aeruginosa is inappropriate for use in bioassays in P-depleted environments. Cellular mechanism of P uptake by algae should be investigated further to elucidate the factors that might limit or interfere with algal growth in nutrient-depleted environments.																	2213-3437					JUN	2017	5	3					2498	2507		10.1016/j.jece.2017.04.047								WOS:000405370200043

Although Karenia brevis blooms have appeared in all Mexican states (except Quintana Roo) and blooms of Cladophora spp., Chattonella marina, Chattonella subsalsa, Glenodinium pseudostigmosum and Chaetoceros holsaticus are fairly new to the MC-GoM-LME, their spatial and temporal variations are largely unknown. It appears that anthropogenic nutrient over-enrichment is the main driver of eutrophication along the MC-GoM-LME. Trophic conditions based on physicochemical parameters, phytoplankton and submerged aquatic vegetation along the northern coast of Yucatan show the influence of Gulf of Mexico LME and Caribbean Sea LME waters, seasonal upwelling and polluted inputs from submarine groundwater discharges. Meso-eutrophic and oligo-mesotrophic conditions on the coast are associated with human activities such as domestic sewage discharges from septic tanks, harbor effluents and brackish waters from artificial inlets. Coastal lagoons in Veracruz have been impacted by urbanization expansion leading to waste-water discharges, fertilizer runoff and changes in land use. Overall, trophic conditions in Veracruz have improved relative to historic trophic index values. At least for the Yucatan State and the Quintana Roo State, there are sites that appear to link the occurrence of HABs and anthropogenic eutrophication. Additional research over inshore, estuarine, coastal and offshore environments requires future monitoring efforts and collaboration with the international community (especially the U.S.).																	2211-4645	2211-4653				JUN	2017	22						120	128		10.1016/j.envdev.2016.10.007								WOS:000405729600013

The threat to the water quality is becoming more and more serious. However, how to detect the pesticides quickly in the water becomes an important problem. Ground on acetylcholinesterase' (AChE) inhibition, the paper states the construction of an amperometric biosensor for carbamate insecticide carbofuran's highly sensitive detection. Using an enzyme biosensor ground on poly diallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE), then immobilizing the Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) for modifying GCE with layer-by-layer (LBL) technique directly. Detect the inhibition of Aches with the amperometric i-t response. The pesticide concentration is correlated to the percentage inhibition of enzyme activity. Comparing with the enzyme biosensor {PDDA/MWNTs}(5)/ED/AChE/GCE we built previously with detection limit to be 10(-11) g/L and recovery to be 99.8 +/- 5.7% to 10(-8) g/L, nowadays, the new enzyme electrode shows a good linearity ranging from 10(-12) g/L to 10(-6) g/L between the lg[carbofuran] and inhibition rates, and the detection limit is 10(-12) g/L. The improvement of the electrode structure contributes significantly to the sensibility of detection for pesticide in seawater.

J	Luo, Y; Zhang, JY				Luo, Yang; Zhang, Jianying			Application of a Load Duration Curve for Establishing TMDL Programs Upstream of the Tiaoxi River within the Taihu Watershed, China	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH					International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE)	JUL 23-26, 2016	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA					The impairment of water quality is a major concern for streams and rivers in China. Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) can be used to establish a framework and propose a series of techniques and tools to assess water quality at the watershed scale. While TMDLs have been developed for water quality management by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, scientists and stakeholders, the development of TMDLs in China is hindered due to the lack of comprehensive data collection system and by the difficulties in incorporating seasonal variations efficiently and accurately. In this study, load duration curves (LDCs) were used to calculate TMDLs for ammonia and to quantify the corresponding monthly and seasonal variations in the TMDL. The analysis indicated that the ammonia TMDL was affected by flow patterns, ranging from a maximum of 9418 kg.d(-1) in high flow zones to a minimum of 48 kg.d(-1) in low flow zones. Seasonally, the TMDL varied from 232 kg.d(-1) in spring to 390 kg.d(-1) in summer, 110 kg.d(-1) in autumn, and 25 kg.d(-1) in winter. The monthly load allocation for ammonia was in the range of 3.0 to 18 kg.d(-1). The results provide policymakers with quantitative limits of nutrients loadings with seasonal variations which can be used to implement various water quality targets. This approach also provides a convenient way for water quality assessment when current pollution data is available and proposes seasonal targets of total amount control for local EPA implementing refined water quality management strategy under current economic development level and management ability as well as.																	0749-0208	1551-5036				SUM	2017					80		80	85		10.2112/SI80-011.1								WOS:000405827600011

A theoretically consistent stochastic cascade for temporal disaggregation of intermittent rainfall	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Generating fine-scale time series of intermittent rainfall that are fully consistent with any given coarse-scale totals is a key and open issue in many hydrological problems. We propose a stationary disaggregation method that simulates rainfall time series with given dependence structure, wet/dry probability, and marginal distribution at a target finer (lower-level) time scale, preserving full consistency with variables at a parent coarser (higher-level) time scale. We account for the intermittent character of rainfall at fine time scales by merging a discrete stochastic representation of intermittency and a continuous one of rainfall depths. This approach yields a unique and parsimonious mathematical framework providing general analytical formulations of mean, variance, and autocorrelation function (ACF) for a mixed-type stochastic process in terms of mean, variance, and ACFs of both continuous and discrete components, respectively. To achieve the full consistency between variables at finer and coarser time scales in terms of marginal distribution and coarse-scale totals, the generated lower-level series are adjusted according to a procedure that does not affect the stochastic structure implied by the original model. To assess model performance, we study rainfall process as intermittent with both independent and dependent occurrences, where dependence is quantified by the probability that two consecutive time intervals are dry. In either case, we provide analytical formulations of main statistics of our mixed-type disaggregation model and show their clear accordance with Monte Carlo simulations. An application to rainfall time series from real world is shown as a proof of concept. Plain Language Summary Rainfall is the main input to most hydrological systems. A wide range of studies concerning floods, water resources and water quality require characterization of rainfall inputs at fine time scales. This may be possible using empirical observations, but there is often a need to extend available data in terms of temporal resolution satisfying some additive property (i.e. that the sum of the values of consecutive variables within a period be equal to the corresponding coarse-scale amount). Hence, rainfall disaggregation models are required. Although there is substantial experience in stochastic disaggregation of rainfall to fine time scales, most modeling schemes existing in the literature are ad hoc techniques rather than consistent generalized methods. This is mainly due to the skewed distributions and the intermittent nature of the rainfall process at fine time scales, which are severe obstacles for the application of a theoretically consistent scheme to rainfall disaggregation. We propose a consistent disaggregation model that first generates lognormal time series of rainfall depths based on a random cascade structure. Then, such time series are multiplied by binary sequences (i.e., rainfall occurrences) to obtain intermittent rainfall time series with known summary statistics.

Usually, they cope with instability problems by adopting computationally expensive small time steps. However, some simulators use fixed computation time steps and hence do not have the flexibility to do so. This paper presents a novel quasi-analytical solution for CSTR-based water quality simulators of an unsteady system. The robustness of the new method is compared with the commonly used fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods, the Euler method and three versions of the SWAT model (SWAT2012, SWAT-TCEQ, and ESWAT). The performance of each method is tested for different hypothetical experiments. Besides the hypothetical data, a real case study is used for comparison. The growth factors we derived as stability measures for the different methods and the R-factor-considered as a consistency measure-turned out to be very useful for determining the most robust method. The new method outperformed all the numerical methods used in the hypothetical comparisons. The application for the Zenne River (Belgium) shows that the new method provides stable and consistent BOD simulations whereas the SWAT2012 model is shown to be unstable for the standard daily computation time step. The new method unconditionally simulates robust solutions. Therefore, it is a reliable scheme for CSTR-based water quality simulators that use first-order reaction formulations.

J	Ahn, KH; Yellen, B; Steinschneider, S				Ahn, Kuk-Hyun; Yellen, Brian; Steinschneider, Scott			Dynamic linear models to explore time-varying suspended sediment-discharge rating curves	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study presents a new method to examine long-term dynamics in sediment yield using time-varying sediment-discharge rating curves. Dynamic linear models (DLMs) are introduced as a time series filter that can assess how the relationship between streamflow and sediment concentration or load changes over time in response to a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic watershed disturbances or long-term changes. The filter operates by updating parameter values using a recursive Bayesian design that responds to 1 day-ahead forecast errors while also accounting for observational noise. The estimated time series of rating curve parameters can then be used to diagnose multiscale (daily-decadal) variability in sediment yield after accounting for fluctuations in streamflow. The technique is applied in a case study examining changes in turbidity load, a proxy for sediment load, in the Esopus Creek watershed, part of the New York City drinking water supply system. The results show that turbidity load exhibits a complex array of variability across time scales. The DLM highlights flood event-driven positive hysteresis, where turbidity load remained elevated for months after large flood events, as a major component of dynamic behavior in the rating curve relationship. The DLM also produces more accurate 1 day-ahead loading forecasts compared to other static and time-varying rating curve methods. The results suggest that DLMs provide a useful tool for diagnosing changes in sediment-discharge relationships over time and may help identify variability in sediment concentrations and loads that can be used to inform dynamic water quality management.

Increased sediment oxygen flux in lakes and reservoirs: The impact of hypolimnetic oxygenation	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Hypolimnetic oxygenation is an increasingly common lake management strategy for mitigating hypoxia/anoxia and associated deleterious effects on water quality. A common effect of oxygenation is increased oxygen consumption in the hypolimnion and predicting the magnitude of this increase is the crux of effective oxygenation system design. Simultaneous measurements of sediment oxygen flux (J(O2)) and turbulence in the bottom boundary layer of two oxygenated lakes were used to investigate the impact of oxygenation on J(O2). Oxygenation increased J(O2) in both lakes by increasing the bulk oxygen concentration, which in turn steepens the diffusive gradient across the diffusive boundary layer. At high flow rates, the diffusive boundary layer thickness decreased as well. A transect along one of the lakes showed J(O2) to be spatially quite variable, with near-field and far-field J(O2) differing by a factor of 4. Using these in situ measurements, physical models of interfacial flux were compared to microprofile-derived J(O2) to determine which models adequately predict J(O2) in oxygenated lakes. Models based on friction velocity, turbulence dissipation rate, and the integral scale of turbulence agreed with microprofile-derived J(O2) in both lakes. These models could potentially be used to predict oxygenation-induced oxygen flux and improve oxygenation system design methods for a broad range of reservoir systems.

Determination of hyporheic travel time distributions and other parameters from concurrent conservative and reactive tracer tests by local-in-global optimization	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The complexity of hyporheic flow paths requires reach-scale models of solute transport in streams that are flexible in their representation of the hyporheic passage. We use a model that couples advective-dispersive in-stream transport to hyporheic exchange with a shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times. The model also accounts for two-site sorption and transformation of reactive solutes. The coefficients of the model are determined by fitting concurrent stream-tracer tests of conservative (fluorescein) and reactive (resazurin/resorufin) compounds. The flexibility of the shape-free models give rise to multiple local minima of the objective function in parameter estimation, thus requiring global-search algorithms, which is hindered by the large number of parameter values to be estimated. We present a local-in-global optimization approach, in which we use a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo method as global-search method to estimate a set of in-stream and hyporheic parameters. Nested therein, we infer the shape-free distribution of hyporheic travel times by a local Gauss-Newton method. The overall approach is independent of the initial guess and provides the joint posterior distribution of all parameters. We apply the described local-in-global optimization method to recorded tracer breakthrough curves of three consecutive stream sections, and infer section-wise hydraulic parameter distributions to analyze how hyporheic exchange processes differ between the stream sections. Plain Language Summary Compounds, dissolved in river water, are transported along the river, but also to some extent into the sediments and back into the river. While being in the sediments, they may react. In reactive stream-tracer tests, we add easy-to-detect reactive compounds into a stream and measure time-series of concentration in the river further downstream. We present an approach of analyzing such tracer tests in a flexible, yet reliable manner, which also provides the uncertainty of our interpretation. This can be useful in the assessment of river-water quality				Cirpka, Olaf/C-7178-2008	Cirpka, Olaf/0000-0003-3509-4118; Knapp, Julia L.A./0000-0003-0885-7829												0043-1397	1944-7973				JUN	2017	53	6					4984	5001		10.1002/2017WR020734								WOS:000405997000029

Biogeochemical hotspots: Role of small water bodies in landscape nutrient processing	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Increased loading of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from agricultural and urban intensification has led to severe degradation of inland and coastal waters. Lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands (lentic systems) retain these nutrients, thus regulating their delivery to downstream waters. While the processes controlling N and P retention are relatively well-known, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how these processes manifest across spatial scales. We synthesized data from 600 lentic systems around the world to gain insight into the relationship between hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on nutrient retention. Our results indicate that the first-order reaction rate constant, k [T-1], is inversely proportional to the hydraulic residence time, tau [T], across 6 orders of magnitude in residence time for total N, total P, nitrate, and phosphate. We hypothesized that the consistency of the relationship points to a strong hydrologic control on biogeochemical processing, and validated our hypothesis using a sediment-water model that links major nutrient removal processes with system size. Finally, the k-tau relationships were upscaled to the landscape scale using a wetland size-frequency distribution. Results suggest that small wetlands play a disproportionately large role in landscape-scale nutrient processing-50% of nitrogen removal occurs in wetlands smaller than 10(2.5) m(2) in our example. Thus, given the same loss in wetland area, the nutrient retention potential lost is greater when smaller wetlands are preferentially lost from the landscape. Our study highlights the need for a stronger focus on small lentic systems as major nutrient sinks in the landscape. Plain Language Summary Excess nutrient pollution from intensive fertilizer use and farming operations poses an increasing threat to water quality worldwide. Lakes, streams, and wetlands restrict the movement of nutrients, and thus protect downstream waters. We have a limited understanding, however, of how removal processes are affected by the size and type of the water body. Based on a synthesis of data from lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands worldwide, we found that smaller water bodies tend to have higher nutrient removal rates. We applied our findings to the landscape scale and found that for the same wetland area lost, the loss of small wetlands corresponds to a greater loss in wetland nutrient removal potential. Such findings are significant to wetland protection and restoration efforts, which have historically focused on maximizing total wetland area rather than on preserving a distribution of different wetlands sizes within a landscape.

The key factor for the lake is the salt production mechanism (salterns were created in 1906 and divided into two complexes of water bodies known as North Salterns and South Salterns, each being relatively autonomous as a salt production entity) and sea-freshwater exchange. The phytoplanktonbased assessment in the North Salterns in 2015 showed progressive improvement. The same positive development was recorded in the South Salterns and Azmaka River. During this year, Knipowitschia caucasica was represented with small population only in the North Saltern as well as limited assemblages of Ruppia maritima were recorded and Artemia salina was registered. Thus, the freshwater supply in the northern part of the lake was recognized as a key mechanism for diminishing blooms and establishing of a more balanced environment. Nevertheless, the structure of benthic communities at North and South Salterns were disrupted, probably as a result of unstable bottom substrates, anthropogenic activities and predatory press by birds and fish. Baseline information contained in this study will be incorporated into future data analyses of the lake.																	0324-0770					JUN	2017				8			145	151										WOS:000405542500022

Hydrogeochemical characteristics and groundwater contamination in the rapid urban development areas of Coimbatore, India	WATER RESOURCES AND INDUSTRY												The Singanallur Sub-basin is one of the major waterways and it supplies water to the Coimbatore city. Currently, it is vulnerable to pollution due to an increase of unplanned urban developments, industrial, and agricultural activities that compromise both the quality and quantity. In the present study three major hydrochemical facies were identified (mixed Ca-Mg-Cl, Ca-Cl, and Ca-HCO3). Irrigation suitability indexes are specifies that the groundwater in the areas has very high salinity hazard and low to medium alkali hazard. The mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry originally regulated by the evaporation process is dominated by reason of arid condition and anthropogenic activities existing throughout the region. The multivariate statistical analysis (Correlation analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)) indicates, most of the variations are elucidated by the anthropogenic pollutant predominantly due to population growth, industrial effluents, and irrigation water return flow. This study demonstrates enhanced information of evolution of groundwater quality by integrating hydrochemical data and multivariate statistical methods are used to understand the factors influencing contamination due to natural and anthropogenic impacts.																	2212-3717					JUN	2017	17						26	33		10.1016/j.wri.2017.02.002								WOS:000405583700005

The physicochemical analysis of the groundwater wells shows the major ions in the order of Na+> Mg2+> Ca2+> B3+ > K+ and Cl- > HCO3- > SO42- > NO32- > F- > PO43-. Groundwater quality is classified as very hard-brackish water type. Ninety-five percent of the wells are classified as saline water type with high NO32- concentrations. Based on water quality index (WQI), the groundwater falls into one of three categories: fair water (10%), poor water (15%), very poor (45%), and worst (30%). The high WQI values are because of high Na+, Cl-, SO42-, and NO32- concentrations, while synthetic pollution index (SPI) values indicate that most about 80% of the wells are seriously polluted. Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) indicates that most of data are either slightly scale forming or corrosive water or slightly corrosive but non-scale forming, and 75% of the wells are suitable for construction purposes (have SO42- concentrations < 300 mg/L). The groundwater reaches alarming situation, where almost chemically unsuitable for drinking purposes and the water to be used after proper treatment such as desalination.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JUN	2017	10	12							257	10.1007/s12517-017-3036-7								WOS:000404550300002

One hundred twenty-two samples were collected from the Aosta Valley region in the years 2007 and 2008 (61 per year), and analysed for pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness, major cations and anions. The pH of the samples in both years indicated a near-neutral to alkaline nature of the groundwater. The cation and anion chemistry showed the general ionic abundance as: Ca2+ > Mg2+ > Na+ > K+ and HCO3- > SO42- > Cl- > NO3- > F in both years. Ca2+-Mg2+-HCO3- and Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl--SO42- were the dominant hydrogeochemical facies. The computed saturation indices demonstrated that the groundwater was supersaturated with respect to dolomite and calcite in both years. The groundwater chemistry of the study area was mainly controlled by the dissolution of carbonate, sulphate and silicate minerals, as well as ion exchange processes. A comparison of the groundwater quality in relation to drinking water standards showed that most of the water samples were suitable for drinking and domestic uses. The computed water quality index (WQI) values of the study area groundwater ranged from 24 to 84 in the year 2007 and from 22 to 82 in the year 2008, and all the location fell under the Excellent to Good category. Quality assessment for irrigation uses revealed that the groundwater was good to permissible quality for irrigation; however, locally higher salinity, residual sodium carbonate (RSC) and magnesium hazard (MH) restricted its suitability for irrigation at a few sites. These results will be useful in implementing future measures in groundwater resource management at regional and national level.

This dual function of residential stormwater systems can create conditions at odds for the optimal performance of either function. This investigation sought to discover connections between aesthetics, plants, design, maintenance, and municipal codes as a means to improve water quality and stormwater pond appearance. To establish the connections between visual quality and environmental function, we conducted five focus groups, four interviews with landscape professionals, and reviewed regulatory codes for 46 municipalities. We concluded that homeowner preferences and the social influence of neighbors were closely linked to design, codes, and management issues. Insights gained include the shared social value of wildlife viewing and aesthetic preferences for diverse, but maintained shoreline planting.																	1063-0198	1943-7714				JUN	2017	27	3					310	318		10.21273/HORTTECH03580-16								WOS:000405463800001						
J	Warner, LA; Ali, AD; Chaudhary, AK				Warner, Laura A.; Ali, Amanda D.; Chaudhary, Anil Kumar			Perceived Landscape Benefits Influence Engagement in Urban Landscape Irrigation and Fertilizer Best Practices	HORTTECHNOLOGY												There are substantial opportunities for residents to conserve and protect water through irrigation and fertilizer best practices without sacrificing landscape quality. Promoting the adoption of practices and technologies to address water quality and quantity issues is one of the most important contributions extension can make to solving complex water problems. Extension needs to use innovative approaches to encourage adoption of landscape water conservation practices and technologies, and one underused behavior change strategy is social marketing. Social marketing can help extension encourage behavior change by positioning desired behaviors in terms of value to clientele. This study examined the relationship between the benefits people believe their home landscape provides and their engagement in good irrigation and fertilization practices. Aesthetics is the most valued landscape benefit but it is not strongly influential on good irrigation or fertilization practices. Individuals who perceive their landscape offers habitat benefits are most likely to engage in good irrigation practices, whereas individuals who believe their landscape provides environmental benefits are most likely to engage in good fertilization practices. Peoplewho believe their landscape offersmonetary benefits are least likely to engage in good irrigation and good fertilizer practices. Extension professionals should develop programs that relate fertilization best practices to environmental benefits and irrigation best management practices to habitat benefits while emphasizing that landscape management best practices are compatible with landscape aesthetics.																	1063-0198	1943-7714				JUN	2017	27	3					424	430		10.21273/HORTTECH03614-16								WOS:000405463800016

Channels are mostly in direct connection with the surrounding arable agricultural land and are exposed to different run-off, leaching and/or wind erosion processes. Close to urban areas, some channel sections serve as recipients of unrefined sewage and industrial waste waters. Water flows and velocities, as well as the transportable capacity of fluvial materials (sediments) are relatively low. This, in combination with other natural and anthropogenic impacts, contributes to sediment generation in the drainage channel network. Based on around 100 sediment samples from 46 channels, concentrations of primary nutrients (N, P and K) were elaborated in this study. Detected concentrations of macronutrients in the channel sediments (e.g. N 1-1.2%, P 100-265 and K 100-380 mg 100 g(-1)) exceeded their content in surrounding arable land by a few fold. Also, significantly higher nutrient concentrations (in average by 50%) were detected in downstream (vs. upstream) channel sections. An excessive presence of observed elements in channel sediments, due to interactive processes between water and sediment material, can adversely influence the water quality and life conditions for channel biota and caused other negative environmental impacts such as eutrophication. These results clearly confirm that the processes of nutrient accumulation in channel sediments are greater than those in the surrounding, mostly intensively arable land areas. The erosion of unprotected agricultural areas and sediment transport as the most important pollution pathways from the drainage basin to channel network may be essential factors responsible for detected condition of nutrient accumulation.

AN INTERVAL ESTIMATOR FOR CHLORINE MONITORING IN DRINKING WATER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS UNDER UNCERTAIN SYSTEM DYNAMICS, INPUTS AND CHLORINE CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENT ERRORS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE												The design of an interval observer for estimation of unmeasured state variables with application to drinking water distribution systems is described. In particular, the design process of such an observer is considered for estimation of the water quality described by the concentration of free chlorine. The interval observer is derived to produce the robust interval bounds on the estimated water quality state variables. The stability and robustness of the interval observer are investigated under uncertainty in system dynamics, inputs, initial conditions and measurement errors. The bounds on the estimated variables are generated by solving two systems of first-order ordinary differential equations. For that reason, despite a large scale of the systems, the numerical efficiency is sufficient for the on-line monitoring of the water quality. Finally, in order to validate the performance of the observer, it is applied to the model of a real water distribution network.

The model was based on hydraulic retention time, temperature, and monochloramine residual. The genetic algorithm and quasi-Newton optimization with a Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Hessian updating method were combined into a hybrid parameter optimization scheme for robust calibration of NDMA model parameters. In order to test the applicability and the accuracy of the proposed model, NDMA concentration and water quality characteristics for 220 post-disinfection water samples collected between 2006 and 2016 were used. Good agreement between measured and estimated NDMA concentrations was observed by performing statistical analysis on an independent set of water sample data (R-2 = 0.93). This modeling approach has the potential to be used as a decision support tool in order to manage and improve the chloramine disinfection process.

Since the late 1980s, water scarcity research has attracted much political and public attention. We here review a variety of indicators that have been developed to capture different characteristics of water scarcity. Population, water availability, and water use are the key elements of these indicators. Most of the progress made in the last few decades has been on the quantification of water availability and use by applying spatially explicit models. However, challenges remain on appropriate incorporation of green water (soil moisture), water quality, environmental flow requirements, globalization, and virtual water trade in water scarcity assessment. Meanwhile, inter-and intra-annual variability of water availability and use also calls for assessing the temporal dimension of water scarcity. It requires concerted efforts of hydrologists, economists, social scientists, and environmental scientists to develop integrated approaches to capture the multi-faceted nature of water scarcity.

J	Richardson, M; Kumar, P				Richardson, Meredith; Kumar, Praveen			Critical Zone services as environmental assessment criteria in intensively managed landscapes	EARTHS FUTURE												The Critical Zone (CZ) includes the biophysical processes occurring from the top of the vegetation canopy to the weathering zone below the groundwater table. CZ services provide a measure for the goods and benefits derived from CZ processes. In intensively managed landscapes, cropland is altered through anthropogenic energy inputs to derive more productivity, as agricultural products, than would be possible under natural conditions. However, the actual costs of alterations to CZ functions within landscape profiles are unknown. Through comparisons of corn feed and corn-based ethanol, we show that valuation of these CZ services in monetary terms provides a more concrete tool for characterizing seemingly abstract environmental damages from agricultural production systems. Multiple models are combined to simulate the movement of nutrients throughout the soil system, enabling the measurement of agricultural anthropogenic impacts to the CZ's regulating services. Results indicate water quality and atmospheric stabilizing services, measured by soil carbon storage, carbon respiration, and nitrate leaching, among others, can cost more than double that of emissions estimated in previous studies. Energy efficiency in addition to environmental impact is assessed to demonstrate how the inclusion of CZ services is necessary in accounting for the entire life cycle of agricultural production systems. These results conclude that feed production systems are more energy efficient and less environmentally costly than corn-based ethanol.

Intensive, long-term studies on hydrological and hydrochemical parameters were monitored at 4 permanent dripping sites (VP1-VP4) in the Velika Pasica Cave (Slovenian) over a period from 2006 to 2013 concurrently with aquatic fauna sampling. Multivariate methods were applied to elucidate the relationship between the environmental conditions and the resident aquatic ecosystem. Seven major aquatic taxa were collected from the drips, with Copepoda being the dominant taxa; however, the spatial distribution and composition of these species varied distinctively at the 4 study sites; the drip water from different sites had distinct hydrological and hydrochemical characteristics. The most significant parameters influencing community composition were drip water discharge volume and NO3-ion content. The results indicate that hydrology and hydrochemistry significantly influence the microdistribution of aquatic fauna within the epikarstic aquifer.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				JUN	2017	10	4							UNSP e1835	10.1002/eco.1835								WOS:000403068700013

The effects of catchment and riparian forest quality on stream environmental conditions across a tropical rainforest and oil palm landscape in Malaysian Borneo	ECOHYDROLOGY												Freshwaters provide valuable habitat and important ecosystem services but are threatened worldwide by habitat loss and degradation. In Southeast Asia, rainforest streams are particularly threatened by logging and conversion to oil palm, but we lack information on the impacts of this on freshwater environmental conditions, and the relative importance of catchment versus riparian-scale disturbance. We studied 16 streams in Sabah, Borneo, including old-growth forest, logged forest, and oil palm sites. We assessed forest quality in riparian zones and across the whole catchment and compared it with stream environmental conditions including water quality, structural complexity, and organic inputs. We found that streams with the highest riparian forest quality were nearly 4 degrees C cooler, over 20 cm deeper, had over 40% less sand, greater canopy cover, more stored leaf litter, and wider channels than oil palm streams with the lowest riparian forest quality. Other variables were significantly related to catchment-scale forest quality, with streams in the highest quality forest catchments having 40% more bedrock and 20 times more dead wood, along with higher phosphorus, and lower nitrate-N levels compared to streams with the lowest catchment-scale forest quality. Although riparian buffer strips went some way to protecting waterways, they did not maintain fully forest-like stream conditions. In addition, logged forest streams still showed signs of disturbance 10-15 years after selective logging. Our results suggest that maintenance and restoration of buffer strips can help to protect healthy freshwater ecosystems but logging practices and catchment-scale forest management also need to be considered.

Global aquifers dominated by fossil groundwaters but wells vulnerable to modern contamination	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												The vulnerability of groundwater to contamination is closely related to its age. Groundwaters that infiltrated prior to the Holocene have been documented in many aquifers and are widely assumed to be unaffected by modern contamination. However, the global prevalence of these 'fossil' groundwaters and their vulnerability to modern-era pollutants remain unclear. Here we analyse groundwater carbon isotope data (C-12, C-13, C-14) from 6,455 wells around the globe. We show that fossil groundwaters comprise a large share (42-85%) of total aquifer storage in the upper 1 km of the crust, and the majority of waters pumped from wells deeper than 250 m. However, half of the wells in our study that are dominated by fossil groundwater also contain detectable levels of tritium, indicating the presence of much younger, decadal-age waters and suggesting that contemporary contaminants may be able to reach deep wells that tap fossil aquifers. We conclude that water quality risk should be considered along with sustainable use when managing fossil groundwater resources.

Towards automation of measurement processes of surface water parameters by a remote-controlled catamaran	BULLETIN OF THE POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES-TECHNICAL SCIENCES												This paper describes a way of determining selected water parameters using a prototype of a remote-controlled catamaran. The remote controlling allows to steer the boat and to manage the measurement process from the shore. It is possible to monitor the water parameters online as well as to store them and analyze them afterwards. The measured parameters are determined mainly using potentiometric methods and include several ion concentrations. The system is orientated towards monitoring breeding ponds or other similar surface waters. The mechanical construction of the catamaran, its electronic circuits and implemented software are described in detail in the paper. Conclusions obtained from preliminary tests are also included. The described construction allows analysts to perform simple and inexpensive remote measurements or assessments of water quality and reduces the time of such analysis in comparison to traditional sampling.																	0239-7528	2300-1917				JUN	2017	65	3					351	359		10.1515/bpasts-2017-0039								WOS:000404972400008

Reducing water consumption and increasing water use efficiency in agriculture are two of the main challenges that need to be faced in the coming decades. Radicchio Rosso di Treviso Tardivo (RTT) is a vegetable that requires a water forcing process prior to final commercialization which presents a significant environmental impact due to the high water volumes used and then dispersed into the environment. The experiment was aimed at reducing the water use in the forcing process of RTT, by developing a pilot system with recycled water in a closed loop through ozone treatment. Concerning water quality, the redox potential value was higher in the ozonized system, whereas turbidity, pH and electrical conductivity of the ozonized system did not change significantly from the control. Yield and quality of plants obtained in the ozonized system did not significantly differ from the control plants except for the antioxidant activity that was higher in plants forced using the water treated with ozone. Our initial results suggest that the ozone treatment could be applied in the forcing process and is suitable for growers, saving up to 95% of water volumes normally used for this cultivation practice.

J	Goncalves, AL; Pires, JCM; Simoes, M				Goncalves, Ana L.; Pires, Jose C. M.; Simoes, Manuel			A review on the use of microalgal consortia for wastewater treatment	ALGAL RESEARCH-BIOMASS BIOFUELS AND BIOPRODUCTS												The development of anthropogenic activities has led to an excessive disposal of wastes into water bodies, thus reducing water quality and damaging aquatic ecosystems. To avoid the negative impacts associated to the discharge of wastes into water courses, effective remediation processes are required to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in discharged effluents. Current methodologies applied for nutrients removal tend to be complex, expensive and energy demanding. Therefore, cultivation of microalgae has appeared as an emerging alternative for nutrients removal from wastewaters. These photosynthetic microorganisms require large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus for their growth. However, since it is very difficult to maintain pure cultures of these microorganisms in wastewater treatment processes, several studies have reported the use of natural and artificial microalgal consortia composed exclusively by microalgae or by microalgae and bacteria. The use of these consortia in the remediation of wastewaters can be very advantageous because: (i) cooperative interactions between the co-cultivated microorganisms can occur, enhancing the overall uptake of nutrients; and (ii) these systems tend to be more resistant to environmental conditions oscillations. This study provides an updated review of the literature regarding the application of microalgal consortia in the remediation of wastewaters from different sources, focusing on the mechanisms involved in nutrients removal by microalgae and the main interactions established between the microorganisms integrating the consortia and how they can influence nutrients removal efficiencies.

J	Wang, YJ; Lu, DS				Wang, Yajie; Lu, Dengsheng			Mapping Torreya grandis Spatial Distribution Using High Spatial Resolution Satellite Imagery with the Expert Rules-Based Approach	REMOTE SENSING												Rapid expansion of Torreya forests in the mountainous region in Zhejiang Province in the past three decades has produced many environmental problems such as soil erosion and poor water quality, requiring an update of its spatial distribution in a timely way. However, to date there are no suitable approaches available for mapping Torreya forest distribution, especially the new Torreya plantations, due to the complex landscapes. This research used high spatial resolution Chinese Gaofen (GF-1) and Ziyuan (ZY-3) satellite images and digital elevation model (DEM) data to extract old Torreya forests and new Torreya plantations using a newly proposed expert rules-based approach. Different variables such as spectral bands, vegetation indices, textural images, and DEM-derived variables were examined, and separability analyses of different land covers were explored. An expert rules-based approach was developed for the extraction of old Torreya forests and new Torreya plantations. The accuracy assessment using field survey data and Google Earth images indicates that this newly-proposed approach can effectively distinguish both old Torreya forests and new Torreya plantations from other land covers with producer's accuracies of 84% and 92%, and user's accuracies of 77% and 85%, respectively, much better classification accuracies than the maximum likelihood classifier. This new approach may be used for other study area for extracting Torreya forest distribution. This research provides valuable data sources for better managing existing Torreya forests and planning potential Torreya expansions in this region in the near future.																	2072-4292					JUN	2017	9	6							564	10.3390/rs9060564								WOS:000404623900055

At present, miniaturized water quality monitoring sensors developed in the laboratories are usually tested under ambient pressure and steady-state flow conditions; however, in Water Distribution Systems (WDS), both the pressure and the flowrate fluctuate. In this paper, an interface is designed and fabricated using additive manufacturing or 3D printing technology-material extrusion (Trade Name: fused deposition modeling, FDM) and material jetting-to provide a conduit for miniaturized sensors for continuous online water quality monitoring. The interface is designed to meet two main criteria: low pressure at the inlet of the sensors and a low flowrate to minimize the water bled (i.e., leakage), despite varying pressure from WDS. To meet the above criteria, a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model was used to optimize the geometry of the channel. The 3D printed interface, with the embedded miniaturized pH and conductivity sensors, was then tested at different temperatures and flowrates. The results show that the response of the pH sensor is independent of the flowrate and temperature. As for the conductivity sensor, the flowrate and temperature affect only the readings at a very low conductivity (4 mu S/cm) and high flowrates (30 mL/min), and a very high conductivity (460 mu S/cm), respectively.																	1424-8220					JUN	2017	17	6							1336	10.3390/s17061336								WOS:000404553900152

A Novel Protocol to Monitor Trace Levels of Selected Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Environmental Water Using Fabric Phase Sorptive Extraction Followed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Fluorescence Detection	SEPARATIONS												Fabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE) combines the advanced material properties of sol-gel derived microextraction sorbents and the flexibility and permeability of fabric to create a robust, simple and green sample preparation device. It simultaneously improves the extraction sensitivity and the speed of the extraction by incorporating high volumes of sponge-like, porous sol-gel hybrid inorganic-organic sorbents into permeable fabric substrates that are capable of extracting target analytes directly from both simple and complex aqueous sample matrices. For the first time, this technique was applied to the trace-level determination of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in environmental water samples using a non-polar sol-gel C18 coated FPSE media. Several extraction parameters were optimized to improve the extraction efficiency and to achieve a high detection sensitivity. Validation tests of spiked samples showed good linearity for four selected PAHs (R-2 = 0.9983-0.9997) over a wide range of concentrations (0.010-10 ng/mL). Limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were measured at pg/mL levels; 0.1-1 pg/mL and 0.3-3 pg/mL, respectively. Inter-and intra-day precision tests showed variations of 1.1%-4.1% for four selected PAHs. Average absolute recovery values were in the range of 88.1%-90.5% with relative standard deviations below 5%, surpassing the values predicted by the recovery prediction model. Finally, the developed FPSE-HPLC-FLD protocol was applied to analyze 8 environmental water samples. Out of four selected PAHs, fluoranthene (Flu) and phenanthrene (Phen) were the most frequently detected in four samples, at concentrations of 5.6-7.7 ng/mL and 4.1-11 ng/mL, respectively, followed by anthracene (Anth) and pyrene (Pyr) in two samples. The newly developed FPSE-HPLC-FLD protocol is simple, green, fast and economical, with adequate sensitivity for trace levels of four selected PAHs and seems to be promising for routine monitoring of water quality and safety.

Ultrasound technology can be suitable as an alternative thermal treatment for several food matrices, due to its efficiency in microbiological and enzymatic inactivation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of the thermosonication to reduce the enzymatic activity in coconut water and optimize the optimal operating parameters (amplitude and time) and corresponding specific acoustic energy required for the complete enzymatic inactivation. Ultrasound presented an additive effect to the heat treatment on the inactivation of the polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD). It was verified that from 500 to 550 mW/mL a great inactivation of the PPO and POD is achieved, already for a complete inactivation of these enzymes the specific acoustic energy necessary is 655.80 mW/mL. It was also verified that the both enzymes should be taken into account for a US process since PPO and POD presented very similar resistance. Industrial relevance: This work demonstrates the great potential of the use of thermosonication for the processing of heat-sensitive products, such as coconut water. Thought this innovative processing the food industry will be able to reduce the damages caused by the heat and consequently to obtain higher quality products.																	1466-8564	1878-5522				JUN	2017	41						404	410		10.1016/j.ifset.2017.04.013								WOS:000404492100047

Foulant Analysis of Three RO Membranes Used in Treating Simulated Brackish Water of the Iraqi Marshes	MEMBRANES												In this work, three different types of Reverse Osmosis (RO) (Thin-Film Composite (SE), Cellulose Acetate (CE), and Polyamide (AD)) were used to perform foulant analysis (autopsy) study on the deposited materials from three different simulated brackish surface feed waters. The brackish surface water qualities represented the water quality in Iraqi marshes. The main foulants from the simulated feed waters were characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) spectra. The effect of feed water temperatures (37 degrees C and 11 degrees C) on the formation of the fouled material deposited on the membrane surface was examined in this study. Also, pretreatment by a 0.1 micron microfiltration (MF) membrane of the simulated feed water in advance of the RO membrane on the precipitated material on the membrane surface was investigated. Finally, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis was used to identify the functional groups of the organic matter deposited on the RO membrane surfaces. The SEM images and EDSX spectra suggested that the fouled material was mainly organic matter, and the major crystal deposited on the RO membrane was calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The FTIR spectra of the fouled RO membranes suggested that the constituents of the fouled material included aliphatic and aromatic compounds.

The model is capable of simulating hydrology under different agricultural management and climate scenarios. As an application of the SWATDRAIN model, the impact of climate change on surface/subsurface flow was evaluated in the Canagagigue Creek watershed in southern Ontario, Canada. Using the assumption that there has been no change in land cover and land management, the model was applied to simulate annual, seasonal, and monthly changes in surface and subsurface flows at the outlet of the watershed under current and future climate conditions. The climate scenario under consideration in this study for 2015-2044 was derived from CGCM2 (Canadian Global Circulation Model 2), with A2 scenario for future climatic simulation. The SWATDRAIN model's ability to predict the impacts of future climate change scenarios in agricultural watersheds due to monthly NSE (Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency), PBIAS (Percent Bias), and RSR (Root Mean Square Error) values of 0.74, 3.67, and 0.37, respectively, for the validation phase. The results showed that general climate change effects more spring and winter hydrology than summer hydrology. The results show that the annual flow is expected to increase in future, which will lead to an increase in the sediment loads in the stream.

Thermal regime and salinity are factors that affect the quality of water reservoirs. These two parameters were studied in Mamloo Dam in Tehran province. This dam has recently started to be uses as a source of drinking water for Tehran and thus its water quality is of increased importance. In this regard, the hydrodynamic model for 2014 to 2015 was built and calibrated by the CE-QUAL-W2 model and the model was used to simulate the thermal regime and salinity up to 2020. Two main scenarios were studied in this period, the continuation of the current situation or a 2.5% increase in water requirements and 5% decrease in discharge. The results show that the reservoir will experience thermal stratification in the summer and vertical mixing in the winter. Dased on these results Mamloo reservoir is in branch of warm Monomictic lake. Also results showed that thermal stratification and ssalinity stratification dominates simultaneity. Besides this issue with 2.5% increase in water requirements and 5% decrease in discharge, duration of summer thermal stratification will decrease although intensity of thermal stratification will increase.																	2241-4487	1792-8036				JUN	2017	7	3					1664	1669										WOS:000404454100015

The National Physical Plan 2005 identified Kuantan as one of the country's future growth centers, which has resulted in rapid development and environmental degradation in the past decade. Multiple water quality indexes used by the Department of Environment, Malaysia and concentrations of several ionic species were examined to assess the river's water quality. The following inferences were drawn in this study: (1) Cl- and Na+ concentrations indicated that the basin area near the eastern urbanized area was subject to lesser human influence and lower environmental burden; (2) the Western side of the Galing River was subject to higher anthropogenic influence and indicated lower class levels of ammoniacal nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand, and dissolved oxygen, compared to the eastern side; (3) Class V or near class V pH values were obtained upstream at the western side of the Galing River in the industrial area; (4) Two types of environmental burden were identified in the western side of the Galing River, namely, inflow of industrial wastewater upstream on the western side and the effect of household wastewater or untreated raw sewage wastewater.																	2076-3298					JUN	2017	4	2							35	10.3390/environments4020035								WOS:000404540600011						
J	Ahn, JM; Jung, KY; Shin, D				Ahn, Jung Min; Jung, Kang Young; Shin, Dongseok			Effects of Coordinated Operation of Weirs and Reservoirs on the Water Quality of the Geum River	WATER												Multifunctional weirs can be used to maintain water supply during dry seasons and to improve downstream water quality during drought conditions through discharge based on retained flux. Sixteen multifunctional weirs were recently constructed in four river systems as part of the Four Rivers Restoration Project. In this study, three multifunctional weirs in the Geum River Basin were investigated to analyze the environmental effects of multifunctional weir operation on downstream flow. To determine seasonal vulnerability to drought, the basin was evaluated using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Furthermore, the downstream flow regime and the effect on water quality improvement of a coordinated dam-multifunctional weir operation controlled by: (a) a rainfall-runoff model; (b) a reservoir optimization model; and (c) a water quality model, were examined. A runoff estimate at each major location in the Geum River Basin was performed using the water quality model, and examined variation in downstream water quality depending on the operational scenario of each irrigation facility such as dams and weirs. Although the water quality was improved by the coordinated operation of the dams and weirs, when the discharged water quality is poor, the downstream water quality is not improved. Therefore, it is necessary to first improve the discharged water quality on the lower Geum River. Improvement of the water quality of main stream in the Geum River is important, but water quality from tributaries should also be improved. By applying the estimated runoff data to the reservoir optimization model, these scenarios will be utilized as basic parameters for assessing the optimal operation of the river.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							423	10.3390/w9060423								WOS:000404559900061

In particular, significant hydropeaking operations by hydropower plants affect not only the downstream ecosystem but also the reservoir water temperature. This paper contributes to understanding that link. For this, we coupled a hydrodynamic model (Estuary, Lake and Coastal Ocean Model, ELCOM) to a grid-wide power system scheduling model. In a case study (Rapel, Chile), we observe the behavior of variables related to the flow regime and water quality (including sub-daily hydrologic alteration, seasonal and sub-daily thermal pollution of the downstream river, and vertical mixing in the reservoir). Additionally, we evaluate how environmental constraints (ECs) can improve the conditions for a wet, normal and dry water-type year. We found that the unconstrained operation produces a strong sub-daily hydrologic alteration as well as an intense thermal pollution of the outflow. We show that these effects can clearly be avoided when implementing ECs. The current (unconstrained) vertical mixing makes the reservoir susceptible to algae blooms. Implementing ECs may intensify the stratification in the reservoir near the dam in some scenarios. The grid-wide economic cost of Rapel's ECs is a modest 0.3%.

However, some industrial discharges contain a large amount of non-biodegradable organic matter, which cannot be treated properly in a conventional biological WWTP. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and biodegradability of the wastewater organic matter contained in the industrial discharges and to examine the fate of the industrial discharges in a biological WWTP. In contrast to most previous studies targeting a specific group of organic compounds or traditional water quality indices, such as biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), this study was purposed to quantify and characterize the biodegradable and nonbiodegradable fractions of the wastewater organic matter. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) fractionation tests and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the industrial discharge from dyeing or pulp mill factories contained more non-biodegradable soluble organic matter than did the domestic wastewater. Statistical analysis on the WWTPs' monitoring data indicated that the industrial discharge containing non-biodegradable soluble organic matter was not treated effectively in a biological WWTP, but was escaping from the system. Thus, industrial discharge that contained non-biodegradable soluble organic matter was a major factor in the decrease in biodegradability of the discharge, affecting the ultimate fate of wastewater organic matter in a biological WWTP. Further application of COD fractionation and fluorescence spectroscopy to wastewaters, with various industrial discharges, will help scientists and engineers to better design and operate a biological WWTP, by understanding the fate of wastewater organic matter.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							409	10.3390/w9060409								WOS:000404559900047

Christian			Successes of Restoration and Its Effect on the Fish Community in a Freshwater Tidal Embayment of the Potomac River, USA	WATER												After a local wastewater treatment plant significantly reduced phosphorus loading into a phytoplankton-dominated tributary of the Potomac River in the early 1980s, water quality and biological communities were monitored bi-weekly from April to September. After a 10-year time-lag, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), once abundant in this freshwater tidal embayment, returned to the area in 1993. After additional reductions in nitrogen load starting in 2000, the system switched to an SAV-dominated state in 2005. Fish abundance did not change during these distinct phase changes, but the fish community structure did. Increases in SAV provided refuge and additional spawning substrate for species with adhesive eggs such as Banded Killifish (Fundulus diaphanus), which is now the most abundant species in the embayment. Other changes observed were a decrease in the relative contribution of open water dwelling species such as White Perch (Morone americana), and an increase of visual predators such as Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides). The 30-year record of data from this Potomac River tributary has revealed important long-term trends that validate the effectiveness of initiatives to reduce excess nutrient inputs, and will aid in the continued management of the watershed and point-source inputs.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							421	10.3390/w9060421								WOS:000404559900059

Future climate scenarios imply widespread permafrost degradation caused by an increase in air temperature, and the expected effect on permafrost hydrology is immense. This study aims at analyzing, and quantifying the daily water transfer in the largest Arctic river system, the Yenisei River in central Siberia, Russia, partially underlain by permafrost. The semi-distributed SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrological model has been calibrated and validated at a daily time step in historical discharge simulations for the 2003-2014 period. The model parameters have been adjusted to embrace the hydrological features of permafrost. SWAT is shown capable to estimate water fluxes at a daily time step, especially during unfrozen periods, once are considered specific climatic and soils conditions adapted to a permafrost watershed. The model simulates average annual contribution to runoff of 263 millimeters per year (mm yr(-1)) distributed as 152 mm yr(-1) (58%) of surface runoff, 103 mm yr(-1) (39%) of lateral flow and 8 mm yr(-1) (3%) of return flow from the aquifer. These results are integrated on a reduced basin area downstream from large dams and are closer to observations than previous modeling exercises.				sauvage, sabine/P-1742-2015	sauvage, sabine/0000-0002-6360-1036; Tananaev, Nikita/0000-0003-2997-0169; Teisserenc, Roman/0000-0002-2440-040X												2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							418	10.3390/w9060418								WOS:000404559900056

Advancing Water Footprint Assessment Research: Challenges in Monitoring Progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 6	WATER												This special issue is a collection of recent papers in the field of Water Footprint Assessment (WFA), an emerging area of research focused on the analysis of freshwater use, scarcity, and pollution in relation to consumption, production, and trade. As increasing freshwater scarcity forms a major risk to the global economy, sustainable management of water resources is a prerequisite to development. We introduce the papers in this special issue by relating them to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) number 6 of the United Nations, the goal on water. We will particularly articulate how each paper drives the understanding needed to achieve target 6.3 on water quality and pollution and target 6.4 on water-use efficiency and water scarcity. Regarding SDG 6, we conclude that it lacks any target on using green water more efficiently, and while addressing efficiency and sustainability of water use, it lacks a target on equitable sharing of water. The latter issue is receiving limited attention in research as well. By primarily focusing on water-use efficiency in farming and industries at the local level, to a lesser extent to using water sustainably at the level of total water systems (like drainage basins, aquifers), and largely ignoring issues around equitable water use, understanding of our water problems and proposed solutions will likely remain unbalanced.

Owing to the highly complex and uncertain physical system, a data-driven and fuzzy number based approach is preferred over traditional approaches. The inputs to the model are abiotic factors, namely water temperature and flow rate. An approach to select the optimum architecture of the neural network is proposed. The total uncertainty of the system is captured in the fuzzy numbers weights and biases of the neural network. Model predictions are compared to the traditional, non-fuzzy approach, which shows that the proposed method captures more low DO events. Model output is then used to quantify the risk of low DO for different conditions.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							381	10.3390/w9060381								WOS:000404559900019

This case study strives to assess the water quality and quantity status for both the present and the near future in the Ciliwung River basin inside the Jakarta Province under different scenarios using population growth with planned additional wastewater management infrastructure by 2030 as mentioned in the local master plan, and comparing the above conditions with the addition of the effects of climate change. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate (NO3), the three important indicators of aquatic ecosystem health, were simulated to assess river pollution. Simulation results suggest that water quality in year 2030 will further deteriorate compared to the base year 2000 due to population growth and climate change, even considering the planned wastewater management infrastructure. The magnitude of impact from population growth is far greater than that from climate change. Simulated values of NO3, BOD and COD ranged from 6.07 to 13.34 mg/L, 7.65 to 11.41 mg/L, and 20.16 to 51.01 mg/L, respectively. Almost all of the water quality parameters exceeded the safe limit suitable for a healthy aquatic system, especially for the year 2030. The situation of water quality is worse for the downstream sampling location because of the cumulative effect of transport of untreated pollutants coming from upstream, as well as local dumping. This result will be useful for local policy makers and stakeholders involved in the water sector to formulate strategic and adaptive policies and plan for the future. One of the potential policy interventions is to implement a national integrated sewerage and septage management program on a priority basis, considering various factors like population density and growth, and global changes for both short- and long-term measures.

In total, 25 water quality variables were monitored. Multivariate analysis revealed that the combination LMB-treated and dredged enclosures deviated most from the pond (reference) and the controls, and showed the strongest eutrophication reduction. Overall, dredging significantly increased transparency, lowered turbidity, and improved the oxygen conditions in the enclosures compared to non-dredged ones. Nonetheless, one dredged enclosure deviated dramatically from the others, which might reflect methodological issues with dredging. The LMB treatment appeared to be less effective at mitigating eutrophication than dredging, and phosphate concentrations even increased during the experiment in the LMB-treated enclosures. Chemical equilibrium modeling suggested that humic substances could have formed complexes with lanthanum (La) from the LMB, rendering it unavailable for intercepting P over the course of the enclosure experiment. Residual lanthanum concentrations in combination dredging and LMB treatments exceeded the Dutch standard 10-fold. Total zooplankton abundance, and particularly Cladocera, increased in all enclosures over the course of the experiment. The limited effect of LMB in the enclosure experiment and the violation of the Dutch La standard when combined with dredging disqualify LMB as an intervention agent in the restoration of the pond.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							380	10.3390/w9060380								WOS:000404559900018

All improved water sources in the area were checked for operability, accessibility, and water quality, while wireless coverage was tested by means of smartphones, phone calls, and instant messaging applications. Theoretical water coverage exceeded 82% of the total village surface area, thus beating the national and sub-Saharan African averages, but dropped to just 39% when considering only serviceable and contamination-free sources. In contrast, wireless coverage exceeded 90%. These outcomes highlight a triple paradox: (1) water from theoretically safe (i.e., improved) water sources is often unsafe to drink; (2) wireless access is better than water access even though water is essential for human survival and telecommunications are not; and (3) excellent Internet coverage does not help a large number of people, who lack the skills, devices, or need to access it. While telecommunications seem to be making inroads towards universal access faster than the water sector, a survey of water committees uncovered a hidden nexus between both resources, revealing that increased wireless access is actually contributing to underpin water coverage in a variety of ways.					martinez-santos, pedro/0000-0003-2014-4063												2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							375	10.3390/w9060375								WOS:000404559900013

Nutrients and Phytoplankton in a Shallow, Hypereutrophic Urban Lake: Prospects for Restoration	WATER												University Lake, a shallow, artificial, urban lake adjacent to the campus of Louisiana State University, has a long history of water quality problems, including algal blooms, fish kills, and high concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria. Periodic dredging of the lake is necessary to prevent its return to swampland. This study was undertaken to elucidate the roles of allochthonous versus autochthonous nutrients as causes of water quality problems in the lake, with the expectation that this information would help identify strategies for lake restoration. Photosynthetic rates and concentrations of inorganic nutrients and phytoplankton pigments were measured over a period of one year. More than 90% of the chlorophyll a (chl a) in the lake was accounted for by Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, and Bacillariophyceae. Concentrations of chl a, which averaged 75 g L-1, fluctuated weekly during dry weather by as much as a factor of four. Phytoplankton growth rates were about 30% higher 1-2 days after rain events than after periods of dry weather, the implication being that allochthonous nutrient loading has a significant effect on the dynamics of the phytoplankton community in the lake. Therefore, dredging of sediments will likely produce no long-term improvement in water quality. More than 100 storm drains currently discharge into the lake, and diversion of those drains may be the most cost-effective strategy for effecting a long-term improvement in water quality.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							431	10.3390/w9060431								WOS:000404559900069						
J	Sambito, M; Freni, G				Sambito, Mariacrocetta; Freni, Gabriele			LCA Methodology for the Quantification of the Carbon Footprint of the Integrated Urban Water System	WATER												In integrated urban water systems, energy consumption, and consequently the amount of produced CO2, depends on many environmental, infrastructural, and management factors such as supply water quality, on which treatment complexity depends, urban area orography, water systems efficiency, and maintenance levels. An important factor is related to the presence of significant water losses, which result in an increase in the supply volume and therefore a higher energy consumption for treatment and pumping, without effectively supplying users. The current European environmental strategy is committed to sustainable development by generating action plans to improve the environmental performance of products and services. The analysis of carbon footprints is considered one such improvement, allowing for the evaluation of the environmental impact of single production phases. Using this framework, the aim of the study is to apply a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology to quantify the carbon footprint of an overall integrated urban water system referring to ISO/TS 14067 (2013). This methodology uses an approach known as cradle to grave and presumes to conduct an objective assessment of product units, balancing energy, and matter flows along the production process. The methodology was applied to a real case study, i.e., the integrated urban water system of the Palermo metropolitan area in Sicily (Italy). Each process in the system was characterized and globally evaluated from the point of view of water loss, energy consumption, and CO2 production, and some mitigation strategies are proposed and evaluated to reduce the energy consumption and, consequently, the environmental impact of the system.

These models require large amounts of spatial and tabular data to simulate the natural world. Accurate and seamless daily climatic data are critical for accurate depiction of the hydrologic cycle, yet these data are among the most difficult to obtain and process. In this paper we describe the development of a national (US) database of preprocessed climate data derived from monitoring stations applicable to USGS 12-digit watersheds. Various sources and processing methods are explored and discussed. A relatively simple method was employed to choose representative stations for each of the 83,000 12-digit watersheds in the continental US. Fully processed climate data resulting from this research were published online to facilitate other SWAT and APEX modeling efforts in the US.																	2073-4441					JUN	2017	9	6							437	10.3390/w9060437								WOS:000404559900075

Will nutrient and light limitation prevent eutrophication in an anthropogenically-impacted coastal lagoon?	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												The Ria Formosa coastal lagoon (southern Portugal) is a highly productive and valuable temperate ecosystem, subjected to strong anthropogenic impacts and highly vulnerable to climate change. The main goal of this work is to understand ecosystem susceptibility to eutrophication, by evaluating the isolated and combined effects of nutrient (N, P and Si) and light enrichments on phytoplankton growth and community composition during autumn, winter and spring. Microcosms of natural phytoplankton collected in the lagoon were subjected to different nutrient and light treatments and incubated in situ for 48 h. Nutrient consumption, and phytoplankton growth and community structure were evaluated using spectrophotometric methods, and inverted and epifluorescence microscopy. Diatoms were the only group potentially limited by nitrogen, and only during spring. Increased nutrient consumptions were observed for all nutrient additions in all seasons, not associated with phytoplankton growth, suggesting that luxury consumption was used to build up intracellular nutrient pools. Responses to light enrichment were inconsistent among phytoplankton groups, probably due to a high taxonomic seasonal variability. Positive responses to light enrichment were mostly observed during winter. Negative synergistic interactions between nutrients and light were also observed. We conclude that eutrophication is currently not a problem in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, but future nutrient enrichments may lead to accelerated growth of specific functional groups and species, if light is not limiting.

Household's Perception of Water Quality and Willingness to Pay for Clean Water in Mexico City	ECONOMIES												A 2011 survey of Mexico City's households revealed that families prefer alternative sources of drinking water instead of relying in the city's quality supply services. These include the purchase of bottled water, installation of filtration devices, and other means of water purification. The demand for better water quality was tested by estimating the household's willingness to pay (WTP), using a contingency valuation (CV) experiment through an open-format questionnaire and by estimating a censored econometric (Tobit) model. The econometric study revealed that the WTP for better water quality is influenced by variables related with distrust of the water quality provided by the City and the organoleptic characteristics of the water supply, as well as spending on bottled water or water purification technologies. The average WTP surcharge for better potable water quality is US$3.1 or 4.7% of the bimonthly water bill, which is about 0.22% of the average family income in Mexico City. The percentage of WTP to income is bigger in poor families. This suggests that improving water quality is of greater importance for lower income families. Findings are consistent with previous studies that estimated the WTP for improvements in the services that supply water to households in the city. These include reduction of inefficiency and intermittency of the supply along with water quality, improve measuring water meters, reducing the obsolescence of the infrastructure and increasing adequate maintenance. Our research is the first to estimate the WTP for better water quality in Mexico City and constitutes a reference point for those that address the problem of water quality and its impact on the welfare and income of families.

In this study, a new framework was proposed for event-based non-point source (NPS) prediction and evaluation. The artificial neural network (ANN) was used to extend the runoff-pollutant relationship from complete data events to other data-scarce events. The interpolation method was then used to solve the problem of tail deviation in the simulated pollutographs. In addition, the entropy method was utilized to train the ANN for comprehensive evaluations. A case study was performed in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, China. Results showed that the ANN performed well in the NPS simulation, especially for light rainfall events, and the phosphorus predictions were always more accurate than the nitrogen predictions under scarce data conditions. In addition, peak pollutant data scarcity had a significant impact on the model performance. Furthermore, these traditional indicators would lead to certain information loss during the model evaluation, but the entropy weighting method could provide a more accurate model evaluation. These results would be valuable for monitoring schemes and the quantitation of event-based NPS pollution, especially in data-poor catchments.																	1099-4300					JUN	2017	19	6							265	10.3390/e19060265								WOS:000404454500028						
J	Zhang, YB; Zhang, YL; Shi, K; Yao, XL				Zhang, Yibo; Zhang, Yunlin; Shi, Kun; Yao, Xiaolong			Research development, current hotspots, and future directions of water research based on MODIS images: a critical review with a bibliometric analysis	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Water is essential for life as it provides drinking water and food for humans and animals. Additionally, the water environment provides habitats for numerous species and plays an important role in hydrological, nutrient, and carbon cycles. Among the existing natural resources on Earth's surface, water is the most extensive as it covers more than 70% of the Earth. To gather a comprehensive understanding of the focus of past, present, and future directions of remote sensing water research, we provide an alternative perspective on water research using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery by conducting a comparative quantitative and qualitative analysis of research development, current hotspots, and future directions using a bibliometric analysis. Our study suggests that there has been a rapid growth in the scientific outputs of water research using MODIS imagery over the past 15 years compared to other popular satellites around the world. The analysis indicated that Remote Sensing of Environment was the most active journal, and "remote sensing," "imaging science photographic technology," "environmental sciences ecology," "meteorology atmospheric sciences," and "geology" are the top 5 most popular subject categories. The Chinese Academy of Sciences was the most productive institution with a total of 477 papers, and Hu CM (Chinese) was the most productive author with 76 papers. A keyword analysis indicated that "vegetation index," "evapotranspiration," and "phytoplankton" were the most active research topics throughout the study period. In addition, it is predicted that more attention will be paid to research on climate change and phenology in the future. Based on the keyword analysis and in consideration of current environmental problems, more studies should focus on the following three aspects: (1) develop methods suitable for data assimilation to fully explain climate or phenological phenomena at continental or global scales rather than at local scales; (2) accurately predict the effect of global change and human activities on evapotranspiration and the water cycle; and (3) determine the evolutionary process of the water environment (i.e., water quality, macrophytes, cyanobacteria, etc.), ascertaining its dominant factors and driving mechanisms. By focusing on these three aspects, researchers will be able to provide timely monitoring and evaluation of water quality and its response to global change and human activities.

However, water quality deteriorates day by day which makes it urgent to improve the standards of the treatment procedure. Coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation performance of ferric chloride and alum was comparatively investigated for carbofuran treatment in simulated wastewater. Coagulation trails were performed in a jar test at several pH levels and coagulant doses to determine reduction efficiencies of carbofuran degradation and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Effect of carbofuran on proliferation, viability, and direct cytotoxicity was performed using human neuroblastoma cells U-87. Direct toxicity of carbofuran on human mononuclear cells and red blood cells (RBC) was also analyzed. Carbofuran and its derivatives were found to be relatively safe at low concentration (2-5 mu M). However, at slightly higher concentration (8 mu M), a moderate loss in viability and proliferative potential was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that carbofuran appears to be safe at moderate or low concentration with respect to viability of normal human lymphocytes and RBC.

Therefore, information about the transformation and transport of bacteria is crucial for determining their source. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to simulate fecal coliform bacteria load in the Miyun Reservoir watershed, China. The data for the fecal coliform were obtained at three sampling sites, Chenying (CY), Gubeikou (GBK), and Xiahui (XH). The calibration processes of the fecal coliform were conducted using the CY and GBK sites, and validation was conducted at the XH site. An interval-to-interval approach was designed and incorporated into the processes of fecal coliform calibration and validation. The 95% confidence interval of the predicted values and the 95% confidence interval of measured values were considered during calibration and validation in the interval-to-interval approach. Compared with the traditional point-to-point comparison, this method can improve simulation accuracy. The results indicated that the simulation of fecal coliform using the interval-to-interval approach was reasonable for the watershed. This method could provide a new research direction for future model calibration and validation studies.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	18					15462	15470		10.1007/s11356-017-9101-7								WOS:000404358200025	28512705

In this study, the ammonium-N (NH4+-N), nitrate-N (NO3--N), and total N (TN) concentrations were observed in the stream water and groundwater of two contrasting catchments (named Tuojia and Jianshan) in subtropical central China from 2010 to 2014, to determine the rice agriculture impacts on the hydrographic patterns, and N export characteristics of the catchments. The results suggested that greater amounts of stream flow (523.0 vs. 434.7 mm year(-1)) and base flow (237.6 vs. 142.8 mm year(-1)) were produced in Tuojia than in Jianshan, and a greater base flow contribution to stream flow and higher frequencies of high-base flow days were observed during the fallow season than during the rice-growing season, indicating that intensive rice agriculture strongly influences the catchment hydrographic pattern. Rice agriculture resulted in moderate N pollution in the stream water and groundwater, particularly in Tuojia. Primarily, rice agriculture increased the NH4+-N concentration in the stream water; however, it increased the NO3--N concentrations in the groundwater, suggesting that the different N species in the paddy fields migrated out of the catchments through distinct hydrological pathways. The average TN loading via stream flow and base flow was greater in Tuojia than in Jianshan (1.72 and 0.58 vs. 0.72 and 0.15 kg N ha(-1) month(-1), respectively). Greater TN loading via stream flow was observed during the fallow season in Tuojia and during the rice-growing season in Jianshan, and these different results were most likely a result of the higher base flow contribution to TN loading (33.5 vs. 21.3%) and greater base flow enrichment ratio (1.062 vs. 0.876) in Tuojia than in Jianshan. Therefore, the impact of rice agriculture on catchment eco-hydrological processes should be considered when performing water quality protection and treatment in subtropical central China.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	18					15700	15711		10.1007/s11356-017-9044-z								WOS:000404358200046	28527141

This paper developed a new approach to assess trends and change-points of water quality parameters by integrating locally weighted polynomial regression (LWPR) and segmented regression (SegReg). Firstly, LWPR was used to pretreat the original water quality data into a smoothed time series to represent the long-term trend of water quality. Then, SegReg was used to identify the long-term trends and change-points of the smoothed time series. Finally, statistical tests were applied to determine the significance of the long-term trends and change-points. The efficacy of this approach was validated using a 10-year record of total nitrogen (TN) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) from Shanxi Reservoir watershed in eastern China. Results showed that this approach was straightforward and reliable for assessment of long-term trends and change-points on irregular water quality datasets. The reliability was verified by statistical tests and practical considerations for Shanxi Reservoir watershed. The newly developed integrated LWPR-SegReg approach is not only limited to the assessment of trends and change-points of water quality parameters but also has a broad application to other fields with long-term time series records.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	18					15827	15837		10.1007/s11356-017-9188-x								WOS:000404358200057	28534269

The formation of carbonaceous disinfection by-products (C-DBPs), including trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, chloral hydrate (CH), and haloketones, as well as nitrogenous DBPs, including trichloronitromethane (TCNM), and haloacetonitriles, was investigated with respect to co-existing Microcystis aeruginosa and Cyclops metabolites under different conditions. The reaction conditions (monochloramine dosage and reaction time) and water quality conditions (pH, temperature, Cl/N, and Microcystis aeruginosa density) were evaluated. The formation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2-propanone (1,1,1-TCP) and TCNM followed an increasing and then decreasing pattern with increased monochloramine dosage and prolonged reaction time. The formation of C-DBPs (e.g., TCM, CH, DCAA, and TCAA) increased with increasing monochloramine dosage and reaction time. The formation of CH, dichloroacetonitrile, 1,1-DCP, and 1,1,1-TCP increased first and then decreased. The formation of TCM increased with increasing pH value and temperature. Additionally, the Cl/N mass ratio affected the formation of DBPs, and as a whole, a lower Cl/N ratio led to a decrease in the concentrations of the five most common DBPs. When the density of Microcystis aeruginosa was 109 count/L, the formation of the tested DBPs reached a minimum.																	0003-7214	1365-2087				JUN	2017	66	4					229	238		10.2166/aqua.2017.097								WOS:000404474300002

In this study, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to predict the bio-indicators of an aquatic ecosystem (i.e., macroinvertebrates, fish, algae communities) in the Taizi River, northeast China. Environmental factors, including physico-chemical (i.e., dissolved oxygen (DO), electricity conductivity (EC), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand in five days (BOD5), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN)) and hydromorphology parameters (i.e., water quantity, channel change, morphology diversity) were used as the input variables to train and validate the SVM model. The sensitivity of the input variables for the prediction was examined by removing a variable from the SVM model. Results revealed that the SVM model reproduced the variation in bio-indicators of fish and algae communities well, based on the input variables. The sensitivity for the input variables applied in SVM showed that in the Taizi River the most sensitive variables for predicting macroinvertebrate and algae communities were channel change, DO, TN, and TP, while the most sensitive variables for predicting fish communities were DO and BOD5. This study proposed an effective method for predicting biological communities, which will improve freshwater quality and hydromorphology management schemes. The outputs can guide the decision-making process in river basin management, support the prioritization of actions and resource allocation, and help to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.																	2071-1050					JUN	2017	9	6							892	10.3390/su9060892								WOS:000404133200023

The turbidity of the Imha reservoir is much higher than that of the Andong reservoir. Thus, it is necessary to examine the movement of turbidity between the two reservoirs via the water transfer tunnel. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the water transfer tunnel on the turbidity behavior of the two connecting reservoirs and to further understand the effect of reservoir turbidity distribution as a function of the selective withdrawal depth. This study applied the CE-QUAL-W2, a water quality and 2-dimensional hydrodynamic model, for simulating the hydrodynamic processes of the two reservoirs. Results indicate that, in the Andong reservoir, the turbidity of the released water with the water transfer tunnel was similar to that without the tunnel. However, in the Imha reservoir, the turbidity of the released water with the water transfer tunnel was lower than that without the tunnel. This can be attributed to the higher capacity of the Andong reservoir, which has double the storage of the Imha reservoir. Withdrawal turbidity in the Imha reservoir was investigated using the water transfer tunnel. This study applied three withdrawal selections as elevation (EL.) 141.0 m, 146.5 m, and 152.0 m. The highest withdrawal turbidity resulted in EL. 141.0 m, which indicates that the high turbidity current is located at a vertical depth of about 20-30 m because of the density difference. These results will be helpful for understanding the release and selective withdrawal turbidity behaviors for a water transfer tunnel between two reservoirs.

In accordance with the water environment features of the plain river network area, a cumulative risk assessment system of water environment in the plain river network area was established in this paper, the design process for which could be divided into three step: (1) Control unit divided reasonably was chosen as the basic unit for water quality management. (2) On that basis, according to the characteristics of the plain river network area, the cumulative risk indexes were selected. The index weight is calculated using entropy method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which could determine the risk grade of each control unit. (3) The cumulative risk assessment method is coupled to the existing water environment management platform. The platform with a dynamic database can realize the dynamic calculation and visualization of the cumulative risk grade. In this paper, the Zhejiang area of Taihu Basin was selected to be the research target as the typical plain river network area. Thirty-five control units were divided with regional water environment and control section. Taking the data in the year 2011 as example, the proposed cumulative risk assessment method was used to identify the control units in different grades and the results demonstrated that the numbers of high-, medium-, low-and extremely low-risk control units are 13, 12, 5 and 5, respectively. It is necessary to give priority to the high-risk control unit. Therefore, the cumulative risk assessment method based on the control unit provides an essential theoretical basis for reducing the probability of water pollution and reducing the degree of water pollution damage.																	2071-1050					JUN	2017	9	6							975	10.3390/su9060975								WOS:000404133200106						
J	Wheaton, E; Kulshreshtha, S				Wheaton, Elaine; Kulshreshtha, Suren			Environmental Sustainability of Agriculture Stressed by Changing Extremes of Drought and Excess Moisture: A Conceptual Review	SUSTAINABILITY												As the climate changes, the effects of agriculture on the environment may change. In the future, an increasing frequency of climate extremes, such as droughts, heat waves, and excess moisture, is expected. Past research on the interaction between environment and resources has focused on climate change effects on various sectors, including agricultural production (especially crop production), but research on the effects of climate change using agri-environmental indicators (AEI) of environmental sustainability of agriculture is limited. The aim of this paper was to begin to address this knowledge gap by exploring the effects of future drought and excess moisture on environmental sustainability of agriculture. Methods included the use of a conceptual framework, literature reviews, and an examination of the climate sensitivities of the AEI models. The AEIs assessed were those for the themes of soil and water quality, and farmland management as developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Additional indicators included one for desertification and another for water supply and demand. The study area was the agricultural region of the Canadian Prairie Provinces. We found that the performance of several indicators would likely decrease in a warming climate with more extremes. These indicators with declining performances included risks for soil erosion, soil salinization, desertification, water quality and quantity, and soil contamination. Preliminary trends of other indicators such as farmland management were not clear. AEIs are important tools for measuring climate impacts on the environmental sustainability of agriculture.

But factors influencing their growth are still poorly understood. In the present study the effect of micronutrients, N:P ratio and silica concentration on benthic diatom Synedra sp. grown in fish pond waste water was studied along with nutrient removal efficiency. We have studied nine different treatments, of which addition of micronutrient mixture Nualgi along with adjusted N: P to 6:1 resulted in highest cell density, followed by silicate enrichment, whereas only N:P adjustment and Nualgi addition had no significant effect on diatom growth. At the end of the growth experiment, the N removal efficiencies of treatment groups (50.23%-65.44%) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of the control group (43.56%), whereas phosphate removal efficiency was significantly higher (P < 0.05) with Nualgi and N:P adjustment (53.37%-68.98%). The silicate consumption was significantly higher in the control group, at 63.87%, than in other experimental groups. These results will give us a new insight into important factors influencing beneficial algae growth and simultaneous nutrient removal from aquaculture waste water.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	12					2777	2783		10.2166/wst.2017.156								WOS:000404557300006	28659517

Advanced phosphorus removal via coagulation, flocculation and microsieve filtration in tertiary treatment	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The applicability of microsieve technology together with coagulation and flocculation for advanced phosphorus removal was investigated. A pilot unit including a microsieve with 10 mu m mesh size was operated continuously with secondary effluent from Ruhleben wastewater treatment plant in Berlin. By applying a pretreatment of 0.07-0.09 mmol/L (as metal) coagulant and 1.5-2 mg/L cationic polymer, total phosphorus values below 80 mu g/L were achieved. Coagulation with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) produced a better effluent quality compared to FeCl3, as less suspended solids and less residual coagulant were found in the microsieve effluent. In addition, the transmittance of UV radiation through the water was improved by using PACl. The produced amount of backwash water was always below 3% (on average 1.6%). Under optimized mixing conditions, polymer doses of 0.6 mg/L were possible without losses in water quality and filtration performance. Microsieving with chemical pretreatment is a viable option for high quality effluent polishing.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	12					2875	2882		10.2166/wst.2017.166								WOS:000404557300016	28659527

It was established that the quality of the surface water corresponded to the standards for irrigation according to pH, conductivity (ECw), dissolved solids (TDS), ion balance: Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, chlorides (Cl-), sulfates (SO42-), Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR). The content of the following trace elements and heavy metals was determined: Cr, Ni, Pb, Cu, Zn, Cd, B, As, Fe, Hg. The obtained results imposed that the contents of trace elements and heavy metals in the studied water samples were in the recommended limits. The obtained results also implies on very strong linear correlation for ECw-B in the studied water samples, and moderate linear dependence TDS-Ni; Cr-Fe; Cr-Ni; Cd-Ni; Cr-Pb; Fe-Ni; Fe-Pb; Ni-Pb. Data analysis revealed that the anthropogenic impact on River Velika Morava water in the investigated area does not affect water quality with a view to its applicability for irrigation purposes. Based on results of analysis of water quality of River Velika Morava it can be concluded that it is usable for irrigation of crops and soil with restrictions and frequent quality checking during the summer months.																	2285-5718	2286-0126				JUN	2017	6	1					188	194										WOS:000404437800026

PASSAGE OF FIPROLES AND IMIDACLOPRID FROM URBAN PEST CONTROL USES THROUGH WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Urban pest control insecticides-specifically fipronil and its 4 major degradates (fipronil sulfone, sulfide, desulfinyl, and amide), as well as imidacloprid-were monitored during drought conditions in 8 San Francisco Bay (San Francisco, CA, USA) wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In influent and effluent, ubiquitous detections were obtained in units of ng/L for fipronil (1388 ng/L), fipronil sulfone (1-28 ng/L), fipronil sulfide (1-5 ng/L), and imidacloprid (58-306 ng/L). Partitioning was also investigated; in influent, 100% of imidacloprid and 62 +/- 9% of total fiproles (fipronil and degradates) were present in the dissolved state, with the balance being bound to filter-removable particulates. Targeted insecticides persisted during wastewater treatment, regardless of treatment technology utilized (imidacloprid: 93 +/- 17%; total fiproles: 65 +/- 11% remaining), with partitioning into sludge (3.7-151.1 mg/kg dry wt as fipronil) accounting for minor losses of total fiproles entering WWTPs. The load of total fiproles was fairly consistent across the facilities but fiprole speciation varied. This first regional study on fiprole and imidacloprid occurrences in raw and treated California sewage revealed ubiquity and marked persistence to conventional treatment of both phenylpyrazole and neonicotinoid compounds. Flea and tick control agents for pets are identified as potential sources of pesticides in sewage meriting further investigation and inclusion in chemical-specific risk assessments.

EXPOSURE TO CHLORANTRANILIPROLE AFFECTS THE ENERGY METABOLISM OF THE CADDISFLY SERICOSTOMA VITTATUM	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Caddisflies have been included in ecotoxicological studies because of their sensitivity and ecological relevance. The present study aimed to assess the sublethal effects of an anthranilic diamide insecticide, chlorantraniliprole (CAP), to Sericostoma vittatum. Used worldwide, CAP is a persistent compound that has been found in surface waters at concentrations from 0.1 mu g/L to 9.7 mu g/L. It targets the ryanodine receptors, and the present ecotoxicological assessment focused on biomarkers related to neurotransmission, biotransformation, oxidative stress damage, and endpoints related to energy processing (feeding, energy reserves, and cellular metabolism). Six days of exposure trials revealed that feeding activity was significantly decreased in S. vittatum larvae exposed to 0.9 mu g/L CAP. Concomitantly, a reduction in cellular metabolism and a significant decrease in protein content were also observed in caddisfly larvae exposed to CAP, suggesting metabolic depression. The results show that sublethal concentrations of CAP can cause detrimental sublethal effects on S. vittatum total glutathione content at concentrations as low as 0.2 mg/L. Bioenergetics can be used to assess physiological effects of contaminants, and the present results show that exposure to low, environmentally relevant, concentrations of CAP alter energy acquisition and metabolism in nontarget aquatic insects with potential population level effects.

Cell culture-based biosensing techniques utilise the overall cytotoxic response to external stimuli, mediated by a transduced signal, to specify the toxicity of aqueous samples. These biosensing techniques can effectively indicate water toxicity for human safety and aquatic organism health. In this review we account for the recent developments of the mainstream cell culture-based biosensing techniques for water quality evaluation, discuss their key features, potentials and limitations, and outline the future prospects of their development.																	0958-1669	1879-0429				JUN	2017	45						59	68		10.1016/j.copbio.2016.11.026								WOS:000403138500010	28135622					
J	Wei, YN; Fan, W; Wang, W; Deng, LS				Wei, Ya-ni; Fan, Wen; Wang, Wei; Deng, Longsheng			Identification of nitrate pollution sources of groundwater and analysis of potential pollution paths in loess regions: a case study in Tongchuan region, China	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater is the essential and predominant source of drinking and irrigation water supplies in most arid and semiarid regions, particularly in Loess Plateau of China. The threat to groundwater quality by nitrate pollution has always been of considerable concern in loess regions. In this paper, correspondence analysis, stoichiometric analysis, ratios of major ions and some qualitative analysis are employed to discuss the spatial variability of nitrate (NO3-), identification of NO3- pollution sources and its potential pollution paths based on 112 water samples in Tongchuan region on the middle edge of Loess Plateau of China. Results indicate that the NO3- concentrations ranged from 0.25 to 173 mg/L, 20.54% of water samples exceeded the Standards for Drinking Water Quality from China (<= 44 mg/L), and 15.18% of samples exceeded the Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality from World Health Organization (<= 50 mg/L); the water samples with high NO3- concentrations primarily concentrated in river valleys, and the types were mainly pore waters and individual surface waters. Sewage or manure from livestock effluent was the primary sources of NO3- in some surface waters, pore water samples with high NO3- were closely related to agricultural input or a mixing process. Groundwater recharges from surface water and vertical infiltration in river valleys with shallow groundwater depth were considered as the potential pollution paths for NO3- ions in the study area based on nitrate nitrogen distribution in soil profile. Driven by concentration difference and local seepage system, these NO3- ions diffused around and groundwater buried in great depth was consequently polluted. Therefore, river valleys should be listed as the prior protection areas in loess regions; in addition, the time lag between land use changes and groundwater quality response should also be paid attention to in nitrate pollution prevention, particularly in the thick unsaturated zones.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2017	76	12							423	10.1007/s12665-017-6756-9								WOS:000404390900016

This study evaluates the effect of sediment redox potential in conjunction with stocking density on shrimp production performance, immune response and resistance against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. A completely randomized two factors experimental design was applied with three different sediment redox potential, i.e. -65, -108 and -06 mV, and two shrimp densities, i.e. low (60 shrimp m(-2)) and high (120 shrimp m(-2)). Shrimp juveniles with an initial mean body weight of 5.32 +/- 0.22 g were maintained in semi-outdoor fibre tanks (270 L in capacity) for 35 days of experimental periods. At the bottom of each tank, 5-cm deep soil substrate with different redox potential was added according to the treatments. The survival and biomass production were significantly reduced at -206 mV sediment redox potential, regardless of stocking density. Highly negative sediment redox potential (-206 mV) and higher stocking density significantly reduced total haemocyte counts and phenoloxydase activity, and shrimp resistance to WSSV infection. We recommend to maintain the redox potential of pond sediment at a level of more than -206 mV.

The aim of this study was to evaluate different stocking densities (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 per m(2)) in terms of shrimp yield to see if the co-culture method results in shrimp yields suitable for commercial production. The presence of Ulva results in good water quality and allows culture of brown shrimp with low water exchange (10% weekly) and with low nitrogen and phosphorus content in discharged water. The final weight and specific growth rate (SGR) in shrimp between 10 and 30 per m(2) were significantly higher (12.5-12.0 g and 4.56-4.53% day(-1) respectively) than 40 and 50 per m(2) (9.1 and 8.6 g, and 4.31% and 4.26% day(-1) respectively). Total shrimp biomass generated in 30 or more shrimp per m(2) was significantly higher (2.7-3.1 t ha(-1)) compared with 10 and 20 shrimp per m(2) (1.0 and 2.0 t ha(-1) respectively). The lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) (0.97) was shown in the 10 shrimp per m(2) case, and the highest FCR was seen with 50 shrimp per m(2) (1.37). Shrimp survival ranged between 71% and 81%, where the highest mortality was shown in 50 shrimp per m(2). The results show that the co-culture method can result in commercially interesting yields, suggesting that 30 shrimp per m(2) is the best stocking density for co-culturing F. californiensis with U. clathrata, based on the shrimp performance.

We report here an integrated eco-aquaculture system in which the yellow seahorse and its natural prey were co-cultured with fertilized water and seaweed in cement ponds. In the first stage, urea (10 g m(-3)) and chicken manure (50 g m(-3)) were used to fertilize the cultured water, 5-7 days later, rotifer and micro-crustaceans were flourishing. Then, seahorse juveniles were stocked at 200 ind m(-3). After 2 weeks, seaweed Gracilaria lichevoides was transplanted into the ponds to regulate water quality, light and to provide holdfast attachment for seahorses. The optimal density of G. lichevoides was controlled between 0.5 and 2 kg m(-3). The introduction of seaweed provides the habitat for natural food of seahorse. Within the cluster of the seaweed, small crustacean density was over 450 individuals per 100 g of fresh weight. Initial size of seahorse juvenile was 1.03 +/- 0.091 cm, After the 146-day rearing period, seahorse survival rates were 70.8%, 57.7% and 42.5%, and body standard lengths were 11.33 cm, 10.84 cm and 10.04 cm in the integrated eco-aquaculture system (GFA) and in monoculture systems of FA (fertilized + feeding) and BA (only feeding) respectively. This system incorporated traditional Chinese aquaculture technique in which feedings nature food organisms were cultivated by fertilization and ecological regulation. Results from these preliminary experiments suggest that the integrated system could be technically feasible, suitable and exemplary.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				JUN	2017	48	6					2868	2875		10.1111/are.13120								WOS:000404300300022

During 1994 - 1995, a total of 10 dominant species of phytoplankton were quantified from the River Buriganga in different seasons. Melosira granulata (Ehrenberg) Ralfs (5-10400 x 10(3) ind/l), Oscillatoria chalybea (Mertens) Gomont (8 - 2660 x 10(3) ind/l) and Spirulina platensis (Nordst) Gomont (2 - 7480 x 10(3) ind/l) were present throughout the year. The other seven species which occurred sporadically were Cryptomoncts obovata Czosnowski (423 - 3520 x 10(3) ind/l), Actinastrum hantzschi Lagerheim (123 - 119000 x 10(3) ind/l), Closterium limneticum Lemmermann (202 - 2300 x 10(3) ind/l), Ankistrodesmus falcatus (Corda) Ralfs (226 - 7140 x 10(3) ind/l), Scenedesmus dimorphus (Turp.) Kuetz. (7-2780 x 10(3) ind/l) and Euglena aces (Mueller) Ehr. (38 - 700 x 10(3) ind/l). The summer population was supported by high densities of M. granulata, O. chalybea, S. platensis and C. meneghiniana having larger bio-volumes compared to its winter counterparts (C. obovata, A. hantzschi and Ank. falcatus). Seasonal mean values of the planktonic potential primary productivity of the river ranged from 15-120 mu gC/l/h with a chlorophyll a concentration of 2-142 mu g/l. The maximum phytoplankton primary productivity in the river Buriganga was 4.92 times lesser than the River Padma at Mawa Ghat. Maximum assimilation rate (P/B) was found nearly double the greater than River Turag. The population density of zooplankton was almost same as that reported for Turag. Comparative analysis reveals no change in the water temperature and pH of the river water during 1972-2013. However, for the recorded maximum of each parameter, a reduction in the Secchi depth, NO3-N, DO, phytoplankton species number and density was observed by factors of 3.5, 36.33, 3.5, 1.67 and 675.89, respectively. Alkalinity, TDS, SRS, SRP were increased by factors of 1.34, 3.49, 2.06, 2 and 12.57, respectively. During the period concerned, data on phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll a was available only on two occasions i.e., during 1994 - 1995 and 2003 - 2005, which showed 1.13 times higher in the latter study. Enhanced eutrophication with reduced light climate as well as a shift in phytoplankton diversity has been found prevalent in the reference station of the river.																	0253-5416	2079-9926				JUN	2017	46	2					589	598										WOS:000404200500007

A Tale of Ecology, Exposure, Purification and Clinical Relevance	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Microbiological drinking water safety is traditionally monitored mainly by bacterial parameters that indicate faecal contamination. These parameters correlate with gastro-intestinal illness, despite the fact that viral agents, resulting from faecal contamination, are usually the cause. This leaves behind microbes that can cause illness other than gastro-intestinal and several emerging pathogens, disregarding non-endemic microbial contaminants and those with recent pathogenic activity reported. This white paper focuses on one group of contaminants known to cause allergies, opportunistic infections and intoxications: Fungi. It presents a review on their occurrence, ecology and physiology. Additionally, factors contributing to their presence in water distribution systems, as well as their effect on water quality are discussed. Presence of opportunistic and pathogenic fungi in drinking water can pose a health risk to consumers due to daily contact with water, via several exposure points, such as drinking and showering. The clinical relevance and influence on human health of the most common fungal contaminants in drinking water is discussed. Our goal with this paper is to place fungal contaminants on the roadmap of evidence based and emerging threats for drinking water quality safety regulations.

The Fate of Pollutants in Porous Asphalt Pavements, Laboratory Experiments to Investigate Their Potential to Impact Environmental Health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Pervious Paving Systems (PPS) are part of a sustainable approach to drainage in which excess surface water is encouraged to infiltrate through their structure, during which potentially toxic elements, such as metals and hydrocarbons are treated by biodegradation and physical entrapment and storage. However, it is not known where in the PPS structure these contaminants accumulate, which has implications for environmental health, particularly during maintenance, as well as consequences for the recycling of material from the PPS at the end-of-life. A 1 m3 porous asphalt (PA) PPS test rig was monitored for 38 months after monthly additions of road sediment (RS) (367.5 g in total) and unused oil (430 mL in total), characteristic of urban loadings, were applied. Using a rainfall simulator, a typical UK rainfall rate of 15 mm/h was used to investigate its efficiency in dealing with contamination. Water quality of the effluent discharged from the rig was found to be suitable for discharge to most environments. On completion of the monitoring, a core was taken down through its surface, and samples of sediment and aggregate were taken. Analysis showed that most of the sediment remained in the surface course, with metal levels lower than the original RS, but higher than clean, unused aggregate or PA. However, even extrapolating these concentrations to 20 years' worth of in-service use (the projected life of PPS) did not suggest their accumulation would present an environmental pollution risk when carrying out maintenance of the pavement and also indicates that the material could be recycled at end-of-life.

Drivers of Microbial Risk for Direct Potable Reuse and de Facto Reuse Treatment Schemes: The Impacts of Source Water Quality and Blending	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Although reclaimed water for potable applications has many potential benefits, it poses concerns for chemical and microbial risks to consumers. We present a quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) Monte Carlo framework to compare a de facto water reuse scenario (treated wastewater-impacted surface water) with four hypothetical Direct Potable Reuse (DPR) scenarios for Norovirus, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonella. Consumer microbial risks of surface source water quality (impacted by 0-100% treated wastewater effluent) were assessed. Additionally, we assessed risks for different blending ratios (0-100% surface water blended into advanced-treated DPR water) when source surface water consisted of 50% wastewater effluent. De facto reuse risks exceeded the yearly 10 4 infections risk benchmark while all modeled DPR risks were significantly lower. Contamination with 1% or more wastewater effluent in the source water, and blending 1% or more wastewater-impacted surface water into the advanced-treated DPR water drove the risk closer to the 10(-4) benchmark. We demonstrate that de facto reuse by itself, or as an input into DPR, drives microbial risks more so than the advanced-treated DPR water. When applied using location-specific inputs, this framework can contribute to project design and public awareness campaigns to build legitimacy for DPR.																	1660-4601					JUN	2017	14	6							635	10.3390/ijerph14060635								WOS:000404107600083

The detection of other microorganisms is not required. The aim of this study is to determine the bacteriological quality of groundwater used for irrigation and the occurrence of enteric viruses (Norovirus, Enterovirus, Rotavirus, Hepatovirus A), and to compare the presence of viruses with the fecal bacteria indicators. A total of 182 wells was analyzed. Widespread fecal contamination of Apulian aquifers was detected (141 wells; 77.5%) by the presence of fecal bacteria (i.e., E. coli, Salmonella, total coliforms, and enterococci). Considering bacteria included in Ministerial Decree No. 185, the water from 35 (19.2%) wells was unsuitable for irrigation purposes. Among 147 wells with water considered suitable, Norovirus, Rotavirus, and Enterovirus were detected in 23 (15.6%) wells. No Hepatovirus A was isolated. Consequently, 58 wells (31.9%) posed a potential infectious risk for irrigation use. This study revealed the inadequacy of fecal bacteria indicators to predict the occurrence of viruses in groundwater and it is the first in Italy to describe the presence of human rotaviruses in well water used for irrigation.

A Three-Year Follow-Up Study of Antibiotic and Metal Residues, Antibiotic Resistance and Resistance Genes, Focusing on Kshipra-A River Associated with Holy Religious Mass-Bathing in India: Protocol Paper	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Background: Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is one of the major health emergencies for global society. Little is known about the ABR of environmental bacteria and therefore it is important to understand ABR reservoirs in the environment and their potential impact on health. Method/ Design: Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected during a 3-year follow-up study of a river associated with religious mass-bathing in Central India. Surface-water and sediment samples will be collected from seven locations at regular intervals for 3 years during religious mass-bathing and in absence of it to monitor water-quality, antibiotic residues, resistant bacteria, antibiotic resistance genes and metals. Approval has been obtained from the Ethics Committee of R.D. Gardi Medical College, Ujjain, India (No. 2013/07/17-311). Results: The results will address the issue of antibiotic residues and antibiotic resistance with a focus on a river environment in India within a typical socio-behavioural context of religious mass-bathing. It will enhance our understanding about the relationship between antibiotic residue levels, water-quality, heavy metals and antibiotic resistance patterns in Escherichia coli isolated from river-water and sediment, and seasonal differences that are associated with religious mass-bathing. We will also document, identify and clarify the genetic differences/similarities relating to phenotypic antibiotic resistance in bacteria in rivers during religious mass-bathing or during periods when there is no mass-bathing.																	1660-4601					JUN	2017	14	6							574	10.3390/ijerph14060574								WOS:000404107600022						
J	Maynou, X; Martin, R; Aranda, D				Maynou, Xavier; Martin, Ricard; Aranda, Daniel			The role of small secondary biotopes in a highly fragmented landscape as habitat and connectivity providers for dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata)	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION												Habitat loss and degradation are considered major threats to freshwater biodiversity and to invertebrates in particular. These often irreversible processes may lead to local and regional extinctions of species, most notably of stenotopic taxa. In spite of this, a number of studies have shown that small habitat patches can sustain rich and abundant communities. The present work assesses the relevance of a group of four small man-made (secondary) wildlife ponds to Odonata species diversity and abundance. Results obtained on pond recruiting capacity, species richness, abundance and habitat use by means of exuviae collection and monitoring of adults using a capture-mark-recapture (CMR) method indicate the potential suitability of these small aquatic biotopes and the surrounding landscape as habitat providers and stepping stone connectors in the VallSs lowlands (Catalonia, Spain). This region, close to the metropolitan area of Barcelona, has severely degraded natural habitats and high landscape fragmentation due to infrastructure, urban and industrial expansion. A comparison among a greater number of sites (ponds and sections of streams and rivers) distributed across the region showed that adequately managed small waterbodies harbour richer Odonata communities than others that are unmanaged or managed specifically for other types of fauna or uses. Appropriate care of these small biotopes avoids disturbance and keeps them free from vertebrates like fish and waterfowl which, under certain conditions, may have a strong influence on the invertebrate communities because, apart from feeding on larvae, they may have a negative impact on macrophyte development and water quality. While rivers and streams, the only natural aquatic habitats in the area, may be both expensive and technically challenging to restore and manage successfully, the creation and/or restoration of small ponds and short river sections in suitable locations can be a cost-effective method for enhancing freshwater vegetation and invertebrate diversity in this impacted landscape.																	1366-638X	1572-9753				JUN	2017	21	3			SI		517	530		10.1007/s10841-017-9992-0								WOS:000404178700015

Polyaluminum chloride (PACl) was used as coagulant, and a hydrophilic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) submerged hollow fiber microfiltration membrane was employed. The influences of trans-membrane pressure (TMP), zeta potential (ZP) of the suspended particles in raw water, and KMnO4 dosing on water flux and the removal of turbidity and organic matter were systematically investigated. Continuous bench-scale experiments showed that the permeate quality of the MCR satisfied the requirement for a centralized water supply, according to the Standards for Drinking Water Quality of China (GB 5749-2006), as evaluated by turbidity (<1 NTU) and total organic carbon (TOC) (<5 mg/L) measurements. Besides water flux, the removal of turbidity, TOC and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the raw water also increased with increasing TMP in the range of 0.01-0.05 MPa. High ZP induced by PACl, such as 5-9 mV, led to an increase in the number of fine and total particles in the MCR, and consequently caused serious membrane fouling and high permeate turbidity. However, the removal of TOC and DOC increased with increasing ZP. A slightly positive ZP, such as 1-2 mV, corresponding to charge neutralization coagulation, was favorable for membrane fouling control. Moreover, dosing with KMnO4 could further improve the removal of turbidity and DOC, thereby mitigating membrane fouling. The results are helpful for the application of the MCR in producing drinking water and also beneficial to the research and application of other coagulation and membrane separation hybrid processes.

Spatiotemporal variations of water quality and their inherent constraints make it very complex. This study explored a data-based method for short-term water quality forecasting. Prediction of water quality indicators including dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand by KMnO4 and ammonia nitrogen using support vector machine was taken as inputs of the particle swarm algorithm based optimal wavelet neural network to forecast the whole status index of water quality. Gubeikou monitoring section of Miyun reservoir in Beijing, China was taken as the study case to examine effectiveness of this approach. The experiment results also revealed that the proposed model has advantages of stability and time reduction in comparison with other data-driven models including traditional BP neural network model, wavelet neural network model and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model.

Assessing the suitability of groundwater for irrigation is carried out for the first time in the High Mekerra watershed. Groundwater samples were collected during the wet season (March 2013) and the dry season (July 2013) and analyzed for determining the physicochemical properties. The indices used in the quality assessment were the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), sodium percentage (%Na+), permeability index (PI), magnesium hazard (MH), Kelly's ratio (KR), and irrigation water quality index (IWQI), incorporating the spatial variation using the GIS-based multi-criteria system. Result showed that most of groundwater samples have low sodium hazard and high to very high salinity hazard and could be used for irrigation on almost all types of soil with little risk of exchangeable sodium. The GIS-based multi-criteria system highlighted the spatial variation of groundwater quality for irrigation in the study area. This spatial distribution indicated that groundwater is generally of moderate quality and that the Ras el Ma aquifer quality is better than for Mouley Slissen aquifer.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				JUN	2017	10	11							233	10.1007/s12517-017-3019-8								WOS:000403720000002

These interactions can be indirectly mediated by shared resources or consumers, or through interference by the production of allelochemicals. Allelopathic interactions and resource competition have been shown to occur among algae and associated microbes. However, little work has considered seasonal influences on ecosystem structure and function. Here, we report results of our investigations on seasonal changes in the interactions between benthic microbial assemblies and the bloom forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa. We show that phosphorus (P) competition and allelopathy by the microbial assembly vary seasonally and inhibit growth of M. aeruginosa. The interactions per unit biomass of the microbial assembly are stronger under winter than summer conditions and inhibit the recruitment of the cyanobacteria, thereby preventing the reoccurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in the following summer. The seasonality of these interactions correlates with changes in composition, metabolic activity and functional diversity of the microbial assembly. Our findings highlight the importance of competitive and allelopathic interactions in regulating the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. Our results also imply that seasonal variation of competition and allelopathy of the microbial assembly might be beneficial to adjust aquatic ecosystem structure and function.				xiao, xi/K-1027-2014	xiao, xi/0000-0002-9753-6586; Wu, Yonghong/0000-0002-2985-219X												1462-2912	1462-2920				JUN	2017	19	6			SI		2483	2494		10.1111/1462-2920.13781								WOS:000404007700030	28464383

Classification of aquifer vulnerability using K-means cluster analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Groundwater is one of the main sources of drinking and agricultural water in arid and semi-arid regions but is becoming increasingly threatened by contamination. Vulnerability mapping has been used for many years as an effective tool for assessing the potential for aquifer pollution and the most common method of intrinsic vulnerability assessment is DRASTIC (Depth to water table, net Recharge, Aquifer media, Soil media, Topography, Impact of vadose zone and hydraulic Conductivity). An underlying problem with the DRASTIC approach relates to the subjectivity involved in selecting relative weightings for each of the DRASTIC factors and assigning rating values to ranges or media types within each factor. In this study, a clustering technique is introduced that removes some of the subjectivity associated with the indexing method. It creates a vulnerability map that does not rely on fixed weights and ratings and, thereby provides a more objective representation of the system's physical characteristics. This methodology was applied to an aquifer in Iran and compared with the standard DRASTIC approach using the water quality parameters nitrate, chloride and total dissolved solids (TDS) as surrogate indicators of aquifer vulnerability. The proposed method required only four of DRASTIC's seven factors - depth to groundwater, hydraulic conductivity, recharge value and the nature of the vadose zone, to produce a superior result. For nitrate, chloride, and TDS, respectively, the clustering approach delivered Pearson correlation coefficients that were 15, 22 and 5 percentage points higher than those obtained for the DRASTIC method.

Sediment carbon fate in phreatic karst (Part 1): Conceptual model development	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Recent research has paid increased attention to quantifying the fate of carbon pools within fluvial networks, but few, if any, studies consider the fate of sediment organic carbon in fluviokarst systems despite that karst landscapes cover 12% of the earth's land surface. The authors develop a conceptual model of sediment carbon fate in karst terrain with specific emphasis upon phreatic karst conduits, i.e., those located below the groundwater table that have the potential to trap surface-derived sediment and turnover carbon. To assist with their conceptual model development, the authors study a phreatic system and apply a mixture of methods traditional and novel to karst studies, including electrical resistivity imaging, well drilling, instantaneous velocimetry, dye tracing, stage recording, discrete and continuous sediment and water quality sampling, and elemental and stable carbon isotope fingerprinting. Results show that the sediment transport carrying capacity of the phreatic karst water is orders of magnitude less than surface streams during storm-activated periods promoting deposition of fine sediments in the phreatic karst. However, the sediment transport carrying capacity is sustained long after the hydrologic event has ended leading to sediment resuspension and prolonged transport. The surficial fine grained laminae occurs in the subsurface karst system; but unlike surface streams, the light-limited conditions of the subsurface karst promotes constant heterotrophy leading to carbon turnover. The coupling of the hydrological processes leads to a conceptual model that frames phreatic karst as a biologically active conveyor of sediment carbon that recharges degraded organic carbon back to surface streams. For example, fluvial sediment is estimated to lose 30% of its organic carbon by mass during a one year temporary residence within the phreatic karst. It is recommended that scientists consider karst pathways when attempting to estimate organic matter stocks and carbon transformation in fluvial networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sediment carbon fate in phreatic karst (Part 2): Numerical model development and application	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The authors develop a numerical model to elucidate time-distributed processes controlling sediment carbon fate in phreatic karst. Sediment carbon processes simulated in the new numerical model include in conduit erosion and deposition, sediment carbon transport, surficial fine grained laminae evolution, carbon pool mixing, microbial oxidation, and the understudied process of sediment carbon exchange during equilibrium transport. The authors perform a model evaluation procedure that includes generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation to quantify uncertainty of the model results. Modeling results suggest that phreatic karst conduits sustain sediment transport activity long after surface storm events cease. The sustained sediment transport has the potential to shift the baseflow sediment yield of the phreatic karst to be on par with stormflow sediment yield. The sustained activity is suggested to promote the exchange of sediment carbon between the water column and subsurface karst deposits during equilibrium sediment transport conditions. In turn, the sediment carbon exchange impacts the mixing of new and old carbon pools and the flux of carbon from phreatic karst. Integrated numerical model results from this study support the concept that phreatic karst act as a biologically active conveyor of sediment carbon that temporarily stores sediment, turns over carbon at higher rates than surface streams, and recharges degraded carbon back to the fluvial system. The numerical modeling method adopted in this paper shows the efficacy of coupling carbon isotope fingerprinting with water quality modeling to study sediment carbon in phreatic karst.

Scaling effects of riparian peatlands on stable isotopes in runoff and DOC mobilisation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We combined 13 months of daily isotope measurements in stream water with daily DOC and 15 min FDOM (fluorescent component of dissolved organic matter) data at three nested scales to identify how riparian peatlands generate runoff and influence DOC dynamics in streams. We investigated how runoff generation processes in a small, riparian peatland-dominated headwater catchment (0.65 km(2)) propagate to larger scales (3.2 km(2) and 31 km(2)) with decreasing percentage of riparian peatland coverage. Isotope damping was most pronounced in the 0.65 km(2) headwater catchment due to high water storage in the organic soils encouraging tracer mixing. At the largest scale, stream flow and water isotope dynamics showed a more flashy response. The isotopic difference between the sites was most pronounced in the summer months when stream water signatures were enriched. During the winter months, the inter site difference reduced. The isotopes also revealed evaporative fractionation in the peatland dominated catchment, in particular during summer low flows, which implied high hydrological connectivity in the form of constant seepage from the peatlands sustaining high baseflows at the headwater scale. This connectivity resulted in high DOC concentrations at the peatland site during baseflow (similar to 5 mg l(-1)). In contrast, at the larger scales, DOC was minimal during low flows (similar to 2 mgl(-1)) due to increased ground-water influence and the disconnection between DOC sources and the stream. High frequency data also revealed diel variability during low flows. Insights into event dynamics through the analysis of hysteresis loops showed slight dilution on the rising limb, the strong influence of dry antecedent conditions and a quick recovery between events at the riparian peatland site. Again, these dynamics are driven by the tight coupling and high connectivity of the landscape to the stream. At larger scales, the disconnection between the landscape units increases and the variable connectivity controls runoff generation and DOC dynamics. The results presented here suggest that the processes occurring in riparian peatlands in headwater catchments are less evident at larger scales which may have implications for the larger scale impact of peatland restoration projects.

This model unifies VEMALA-ICECREAM, VEMALA-N and VEMALA 1.1 as it uses their independent terrestrial loading and implements a simplification of the biogeochemical model RIVE and phytoplankton model AQUAPHY in the river network. VEMALA v.3 simulates the transport and transformations of nitrate, ammonium, organic nitrogen, phosphate, particulate inorganic phosphorus, organic phosphorus, phytoplankton, suspended sediments and total organic carbon during their travel to the sea. The model's results were satisfactory in the Aurajoki river basin (South-Western Finland) in simulating nutrients daily loads, with all Nash and Sutcliffe coefficients (NSE) ranging from 0.51 to 0.89 against observations, and monthly loads (NSE = 0.4-0.97 against estimations). Simulations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads were comparable to estimated annual loads with the exception of a few exceptional years. The quantification of the nutrient cycling river processes were consistent with the Aurajoki river ecosystem with maximum summer rates for mineralisation 0.1 mgC L-1 d(-1) and denitrification 55 mgN m(-2) d(-1) resulting in a loss of 4% of the annual nitrogen load entering the river. VEMALA v3 unites the previous versions of VEMALA to better predict the co-impact of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphate on algal growth and therefore eutrophication. Simulation of bioavailable nutrients rather than total nutrients will allow the distinction in the quality of the various loading sources, farming actions and loading reduction actions. In the Aurajoki simulation, nitrate and ammonium represented on average 74% and 3% respectively of the total nitrogen load to the Baltic Sea, while phosphate constituted 38% of the total phosphorus load to the sea. Thus, the biological impact in the river and the sea will be better assessed to help water managers implement the Water Framework Directive in Finland. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Jones, CS; Wang, B; Schilling, KE; Chan, KS				Jones, Christopher S.; Wang, Bo; Schilling, Keith E.; Chan, Kung-sik			Nitrate transport and supply limitations quantified using high-frequency stream monitoring and turning point analysis	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Agricultural landscapes often leak inorganic nitrogen to the stream network, usually in the form of nitrate-nitrite (NOx-N), degrading downstream water quality on both the local and regional scales. While the spatial distribution of nitrate sources has been delineated in many watersheds, less is known about the complicated temporal dynamics that drive stream NOx-N because traditional methods of stream grab sampling are often conducted at a low frequency. Deployment of accurate real-time, continuous measurement devices that have been developed in recent years enables high-frequency sampling that provides detailed information on the concentration-discharge relation and the timing of NOx-N delivery to streams. We aggregated 15-min interval NOx-N and discharge data over a nine-year period into daily averages and then used robust statistical methods to identify how the discharge regime within an artificially-drained agricultural watershed reflected catchment hydrology and NOx-N delivery pathways. We then quantified how transport and supply limitations varied from year-to-year and how dependence of these limitations varied with climate, especially drought. Our results show NOx-N concentrations increased linearly with discharge up to an average "turning point" of 1.42 mm of area-normalized discharge, after which concentrations decline with increasing discharge. We estimate transport and supply limitations to govern 57 and 43 percent, respectively, of the NOx-N flux over the nine-year period. Drought effects on the NOx-N flux linger for multiple years and this is reflected in a greater tendency toward supply limitations in the.three years following drought. How the turning point varies with climate may aid in prediction of NOx-N loading in future climate regimes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Following the historical inundation by paleo-seawater during coastal progradation, the aquifer has been undergone progressive freshening and land reclamation to enable settlements and farming. The hydrochemical data of water samples showed a broad hydrochemical change, from Na-Cl through Na-HCO3 to Ca-HCO3 types, suggesting that groundwater was overall evolved through the freshening process accompanying cation exchange. The principal component analysis (PCA) of the hydrochemical data indicates the occurrence of three major hydrogeochemical processes occurring in an aquifer, namely: 1) progressive freshening of remaining paleo-seawater, 2) water-rock interaction (i.e., dissolution of silicates), and 3) redox process including sulfate reduction, as indicated by heavy sulfur and oxygen isotope compositions of sulfate. To quantitatively assess the hydrogeochemical processes, the end-member mixing analysis (EMMA) and the forward mixing modeling using PHREEQC code were conducted. The EMMA results show that the hydrochemical model with the two-dimensional mixing space composed of PC 1 and PC 2 best explains the mixing in the study area; therefore, we consider that the groundwater chemistry mainly evolved by mixing among three end-members (i.e., paleo-seawater, infiltrating rain, and the K-rich groundwater). The distinct depletion of sulfate in groundwater, likely due to bacterial sulfate reduction, can also be explained by EMMA. The evaluation of mass balances using geochemical modeling supports the explanation that the freshening process accompanying direct cation exchange occurs through mixing among three end-members involving the K-rich groundwater. This study shows that the multiple end-members mixing model is useful to more successfully assess complex hydrogeochemical processes occurring in a salinized aquifer under freshening, as compared to the conventional interpretation using the theoretical mixing line based on only two end-members (i.e., seawater and rainwater).

J	Plagnes, V; Schmid, B; Mitchell, B; Judd-Henrey, I				Plagnes, Valerie; Schmid, Brad; Mitchell, Brett; Judd-Henrey, Ian			Water balance modelling of a uranium mill effluent management system	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A water balance model was developed to forecast the management strategy of a uranium mill effluent system, located in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Mining and milling operations, such as pit dewatering or treated effluent release, can potentially influence the hydrology and the water quality downstream of the operations. This study presents the methodology used to predict water volumes and water quality discharging downstream in surface water bodies. A compartment model representing the three subsequent lakes included in the management system was set up using the software GoldSim. The water balance allows predicting lake volumes at the daily time step. A mass balance model developed for conservative elements was also developed and allows validating the proportions of inputs and outputs issued from the water balance model. This model was then used as predictive tool to evaluate the impact of different scenarios of effluents management on volumes and chemistry of surface water for short and longer time periods. An additional significant benefit of this model is that it can be used as an input for geochemical modelling to predict the concentrations of all constituents of concern in the receiving surface water.

J	Bassi, N; Kumar, MD				Bassi, Nitin; Kumar, M. Dinesh			Water quality index as a tool for wetland restoration	WATER POLICY												Worldwide, wetlands are subjected to increasing anthropogenic pressures resulting in loss of their hydrological and ecological functions. Such impacts are more pronounced in the case of wetlands in urban areas which are exposed to land use changes and increased economic activities. In many Indian cities, natural water bodies such as lakes are heavily polluted due to runoff from farmlands in urban and peri-urban areas and discharge of untreated domestic and industrial wastewater. The major constraint for restoring such water bodies is difficulty in devising a concrete action plan for analysing different sets of water quality parameters. Hence, a water quality index (WQI), which is a tool to analyse large amounts of data on different water quality parameters, is computed for one of the biggest natural lakes in the metropolitan city of Delhi. The mean WQI of the lake was estimated to be 46.27, which indicates a high level of water pollution. The paper discusses how these findings can be used for informing policies on management of wetlands. The paper also suggests establishment of a community based water quality monitoring and surveillance system, backed by infrastructural support from the State, in order to restore the wetlands in urban areas.																	1366-7017					JUN	2017	19	3					390	403		10.2166/wp.2017.099								WOS:000404045000002

How to introduce new technologies to reduce nutrient losses: a case of Danish agricultural constructed wetlands	WATER POLICY												The Water Framework Directive (WFD) focuses on reduction of nutrients in individual water bodies. Innovative drainage filter technologies currently being tested in Denmark could facilitate nutrient reductions at the sub-river basins and catchment levels. The implementation strategy for these technologies, however, remains a challenge. Using both primary and secondary data, this paper presents an in-depth analysis of the role of these technologies in implementation of the WFD in Denmark. Concepts of impact assessment are used to identify the most suitable approach for incorporating these technologies into environmental measures based on a three-faceted policy instrument typology. A voluntary approach supported by investment subsidies, or incentives that could replace existing requirements, is deemed more appropriate.

J	Wicaksono, A; Jeong, G; Kang, D				Wicaksono, Albert; Jeong, Gimoon; Kang, Doosun			Water, energy, and food nexus: review of global implementation and simulation model development	WATER POLICY												Water, energy, and food (WEF) have complex interconnections. Water is required to produce energy, while energy is needed for water extraction, treatment, and distribution. The food sector requires water and energy to produce food products, while fertilizer and pesticide from farmland have a negative impact on water quality; however, biomass is a potential alternative energy source. Understanding these interconnections will help determine the developmental framework that connects all of the elements. Some global regions have implemented a variety of sustainable management concepts to manage the natural resources, however, mainly for an individual resource. Furthermore, various computer models have been developed to estimate the interdependency of each resource and to quantify future requirements of WEF; the limitations of current models have opened opportunities for development through the addition of components and features such as feedback analysis, optimization, and visualization. We reviewed the literature to determine the present state of the WEF nexus, especially its global implementation and simulation model. We concluded that the involvement of stakeholders, integration of policies, and development of a nexus simulation model are required for successful implementation of the WEF nexus, which is an emerging issue for a sustainable resources' management.																	1366-7017					JUN	2017	19	3					440	462		10.2166/wp.2017.214								WOS:000404045000005

Influence of Local, Landscape, and Regional Variables on Sedge and Marsh Wren Occurrence in Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands	WETLANDS												We determined the influence of habitat, landscape, geographic, and climate variables on Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis) and Marsh Wren (C. palustris) occurrence in 840 coastal wetland survey points throughout the Great Lakes. Variables included surrounding land use and configuration out to 2000 m; latitude; longitude; temperature; precipitation; and vegetation characteristics within 100 m. Classification trees predicted Sedge Wren occurrence at points in the western Great Lakes with < 11 km of roads within 1000 m. Emergent herbaceous wetland within 500 m, woody wetland within various distances, and sedge within 100 m were also positively associated with Sedge Wren occurrence. Marsh Wren occurrence was predicted at points in the southern Great Lakes with < 42% developed land within 500 m. Emergent herbaceous wetland within 500 m, cropland within various distances, and cattail within 100 m were also positively associated with Marsh Wren occurrence. Our results suggest limiting development around wetlands is important for conserving these bird species throughout Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Landscape-scale land cover variables are easily obtainable and significantly increase our ability to predict occurrence of these species across a broad geographic scale.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2017	37	3					447	459		10.1007/s13157-017-0881-9								WOS:000403573000005

SEASONAL AND ANNUAL VARIATION IN TREMATODE INFECTION OF STREAM SNAIL ELIMIA PROXIMA IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS OF VIRGINIA	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Understanding temporal variation of host-pathogen dynamics can be important for predicting disease risks and anticipating how disease systems may change in response to natural or human disturbances. Seasonal changes in weather, especially those associated with changes in temperature or precipitation, are often a key component of temporal changes in infection risk and can have important impacts on disease systems. However, these patterns can be difficult to track due to interannual variation and the need for longer term, multi-year surveillance efforts. We assessed seasonal and annual changes in the trematode component community of first-intermediate host stream snail Elimia (= Oxytrema = Goniobasis) proxima across 5 streams in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Over 3 yr, we found no evidence of consistent seasonal peaks of trematode infection in E. proxima. There was some across-site consistency in infection prevalence over 4 yr, because high prevalence sites tended to maintain higher prevalence from year to year, relative to lower prevalence sites. In addition, we examined the relationship between prevalence of first-intermediate host infection, weather variables, and site-level factors, including snail density and water quality metrics. Trematode prevalence was negatively related to total precipitation, which may have been due to the movement of infectious parasite stages and hosts downstream during high flows. We found no strong relationships between trematode prevalence and snail density or any of the water quality metrics examined in this study, indicating that snail infection may be driven primarily by definitive host activity.																	0022-3395	1937-2345				JUN	2017	103	3					213	220		10.1645/16-82								WOS:000403809700003	28350527

The symbiotic sea anemone Exaiptasia pallida is a suitable test species, representing the phylum Cnidaria and allowing for assessments of toxicological responses of both the animal host and in-hospite Symbiodinium spp. Pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) chlorophyll-a fluorometry is recognised as a valuable ecotoxicological tool, and here newly-developed test methods are presented using PAM fluorometry to measure herbicide effects on photosynthetic efficiency of in-hospite Symbiodinium spp. Additionally, measurements on healthy laboratory reared E. pallida provide baseline data demonstrating the normal effective quantum yield (EQY) and the maximum electron transport rate (ETRm) for Symbiodinium spp. in the absence of herbicide stress. Concentration dependant reductions in the EQY and ETRm occurred during diuron and atrazine exposures; a mean 48-h EC50 (effective concentration; 50%) of 8 pg/L of diuron was estimated, however atrazine elicited a much lower toxicity. Twelve-day exposures to 10-200 pg/L diuron showed that the greatest EQY effect occurred during the first 48 h, with little subsequent change. However, longer exposures to the lowest diuron treatment (1 pg/L) showed the lowest EQYs after 96 h followed by recovery to control levels within 12 d. Furthermore, asexual reproduction was inhibited during 12-d exposures to diuron, and 12-d EC50 values of 100 and 132 pg/L were estimated to inhibit successful reproduction of pedal lacerates and juveniles by 50% respectively. This study provides much needed data contributions to species sensitivity curves for development of diuron and atrazine water quality guidelines in tropical marine environments.

The Bahr El-Baqar drain in Sharqia, Egypt, is one of the main drains in the Nile Delta that receives various types of wastewater. Monitoring and assessing the drain's water quality were achieved by collecting georeferenced water samples along the drain during the 2015 summer and winter cropping seasons. Chemical, microbial, and parasitic analyses were performed. Additionally, surface soil samples irrigated with the drain water were gathered from the adjacent area to quantify the main physicochemical properties. Water analysis results revealed that the concentrations of most trace elements were within international standards and the Egyptian allowable levels forTWWreuse in agriculture. Oxygen depletion was observed for all samples collected. The microbial analysis indicated that there was fecal coliform contamination (> 1000 per 100 mL) in the summer and winter samples. Concentrations of PO4 and SO4 were within the permissible level for irrigation use, whereas NH4, NO3, and MoO4 concentrations were higher than the recommended values for reusing Bahr El-Baqar water in irrigation. Based on the soil analysis results, Cd contamination was observed, whereas the Pb concentration in soils was slightly higher than its normal range. Mixing Bahr El-Baqar water with freshwater and implementing appropriate on-farm treatment before the reuse are recommended as a prerequisite for reusing Bahr El-Baqar water for irrigation. Bio-diesel fuel and energy oil crops are recommended for the studied region.

Upstream the mine, groundwaters were more acid and some elements and compounds, such as iron, aluminum, and sulfate, were in higher concentration, possibly because of acid mine drainage (AMD) generation in tailing pit. U-238 and U-234 activity concentrations exceeded the standards proposed by the World Health Organization in two sampling periods in effluent samples and in some groundwater samples, indicating that waters from this aquifer system were unhealthy for human consumption. Uranium isotopes were more elevated in groundwaters in the rainy month probably because of a higher leaching and transport rate of this element from rocks/tailings pit to waters. The average radon activity concentration in groundwater was higher than in surface waters and effluents in both periods studied, possibly due to the enhanced presence of uranium and radium in the aquifer rocks that would favor the radon accumulation and entrapment. The effects of the mining activities on the groundwater quality were displayed in terms of activity ratios (U-234/U-238, Ra-226/U-238), which showed different behaviors upstream the mine area relatively to areas downstream the mine.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				JUN	2017	228	6							207	10.1007/s11270-017-3381-x								WOS:000403574100011

In recent years, drinking water contamination happens occasionally, which seriously harms social stabilization and safety. Placing sensors in water supply pipes can monitor water quality in real time, which may prevent contamination accidents. However, how to reversely locate pollution sources through the detecting information from water quality sensors is a challengeable issue. Its difficulties lie in that limited sensors, massive pipe network nodes and dynamic water demand of users lead to the uncertainty, large-scale and dynamism of this optimization problem. This paper mainly studies the uncertainty problem in contaminant sources identification (CSI). The previous study of CSI supposes that hydraulic output (e.g., water demand) is known. Whereas, the inherent variability of urban water consumption brings an uncertain problem that water demand presents volatility. In this paper, the water demand of water supply network nodes simulated by Gaussian model is stochastic, and then being used to solve the problem of CSI, simulation-optimization method finds the minimum target of CSI and concentration which meet the simulation value and detected value of sensors. This paper proposes an improved genetic algorithm to solve the CSI problem under uncertainty water demand and comparative experiments are placed on two water distribution networks of different sizes.																	1386-7857	1573-7543				JUN	2017	20	2			SI		1007	1016		10.1007/s10586-017-0787-6								WOS:000403457100007

A viable solution is to install water quality monitoring sensors in water supply networks (WSNs) for real-time pollution detection, thereby mitigating the risk of catastrophic contamination incidents. Given the significant cost of placing sensors at all locations in a network, a critical issue is where to deploy sensors within WSNs, while achieving rapid detection of contaminant events. Existing studies have mainly focused on sensor placement in water distribution systems (WDSs). However, the problem is still not adequately addressed, especially for large scale WSNs. In this paper, we investigate the sensor placement problem in large scale WDSs with the objective of minimizing the impact of contamination events. Specifically, we propose a two-phase Spark-based genetic algorithm (SGA). Experimental results show that SGA outperforms other traditional algorithms in both accuracy and efficiency, which validates the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach.																	1386-7857	1573-7543				JUN	2017	20	2			SI		1089	1099		10.1007/s10586-017-0838-z								WOS:000403457100014

Alternatively, algae could play an important role in agriculture where they can be used as biofertilizers and soil stabilizers. To examine the possible reuse of the detritus generated by dead algae as fertilizer for crops, we develop three mathematical models building upon each other. A system is proposed in which algae recover waste nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) for reuse in agricultural production. The results of our study show that in so doing, the crop yield may be increased and simultaneously the density of algae in the lake may be reduced. This could be a way to mitigate and possibly solve the environmental and economic issues nowadays facing agriculture.																	0092-0606	1573-0689				JUN	2017	43	2					297	314		10.1007/s10867-017-9453-8								WOS:000403474900010	28550636

All of these sources emit pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria into the surface water, which the EU Bathing Water Directive addresses by giving threshold values for the indicators Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci. This study presents a comparison between 21 scenarios of costs for processes that reduce the load of Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci into the Ruhr River during and shortly after rain events. The methods examined include UV irradiation for WWTPs, integrated sewer management and treatment of CSOs with vertical flow constructed wetlands or performic acid. For pollution by diffuse overland flow, we evaluated organizational measures. The treatment of only diffuse pollution shows merely a slight effect on intestinal enterococci, but none on Escherichia coli and hence, was not considered further. Combining all three CSO reduction methods with the irradiation of WWTP effluent provides the best simulation results in terms of reducing both indicator bacteria.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2659	2668		10.2166/wst.2017.141								WOS:000403486600019	28617286

Compared with the control pond, the experiment pond had better water quality as indicated by 64.2% reduction in chlorophyll a, and 81.1% reduction in algal cells. The chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentration were reduced by 55.1%, 57.5%, and 50.8%, respectively. The treatment efficiency is mainly due to the growth control of Microcystis (i.e. cell reduction of 96.4%). The gas vesicles collapsing because of the water pressure was suggested to be the mechanism for Microcystis suppression by the deep well circulation treatment. The Microcystis lost its buoyancy after gas vesicles collapsed and it settled to the bottom of the aquaculture pond. As a result, the algae reproduction was suppressed because algae could only grow in the area with enough sunlight (i.e. water depth less than 1 m).																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2692	2701		10.2166/wst.2017.159								WOS:000403486600022	28617289

Micro-zooplankton grazing as a means of fecal bacteria removal in stormwater BMPs	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A priority for environmental managers is control of stormwater runoff pollution, especially fecal microbial pollution. This research was designed to determine if fecal bacterial grazing by micro-zooplankton is a significant control on fecal bacteria in aquatic best management practices (BMPs); if grazing differs between a wet detention pond and a constructed wetland; and if environmental factors enhance grazing. Both 3-day grazing tests and 24-h dilution assays were used to determine grazing differences between the two types of BMP. Micro-zooplankton grazing was a stronger bacteria removal mechanism in stormwater wetlands rich in aquatic vegetation compared to a standard wet detention pond, although grazing was important in detention ponds as well. Our experiments indicated that the majority of grazers that fed on fecal bacteria were <20 mu m in size. Grazing rates were positively correlated with fecal coliform abundance and increased water temperatures. Enumeration of grazers demonstrated that protozoans were significantly more abundant among wetland vegetation than in open water, and open wetland waters contained more flagellates and dinoflagellates than open wet detention pond waters. Grazing on fecal bacteria in BMPs is enhanced by aquatic vegetation, and grazing in aquatic BMPs in warmer climates should be greater than in cooler climates.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JUN	2017	75	11					2702	2715		10.2166/wst.2017.170								WOS:000403486600023	28617290

A study in a lowland stream of South America with different water qualities	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												Sinotaia quadrata is a snail native from Asia recorded for the first time in South America in 2009 in central Argentina. In 2015, this species was also found in a lowland stream with different water qualities. Our aims were to contribute to the knowledge of its population ecology and to compare the individuals from the two locations anatomically. Snails were searched at 6 sites, where physicochemical and hydraulic parameters were measured. Biological samples were also taken at two sites (S3 and S4) to study the population traits of S. cf quadrata (density, size structure, fecundity and sex ratio) and to assess the water quality through macroinvertebrates' biological indices (richness, diversity and IBPamp). Physicochemical and biological parameters allowed us classifying sites as "moderately polluted" (S3) and "heavily polluted" (S4). At S4, the population showed a lower density, larger individuals, higher fecundity and a scarce representation of young snails. The differences observed in the radula and mantle border of snails from the two geographical regions might be attributed to environmental differences. We conclude that this species is tolerant to a wide range of environmental variables which, along with its high fecundity and morphological plasticity, could allow this species to colonize neighbor streams.																	0001-3765	1678-2690				JUN	2017	89	2					1059	1072		10.1590/0001-3765201720160624								WOS:000403246500025	28640353

INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY												OBJECTIVE. Heater-cooler units (HCUs) have been shown to be a source of Mycobacterium chimaera infections. For the past year, weekly water samples have been taken from HCUs used at University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Foundation Trust. We report the microbial contamination of the HCUs over a year detailing the decontamination regimes applied at UHB to reduce the microbial load. DESIGN. Observational study SETTING. UHB is a tertiary referral teaching hospital in Birmingham, United Kingdom, that provides clinical services to nearly 1 million patients every year. The UHB Cardiac department is one of the largest in the United Kingdom and provides treatment for adult patients with a wide range of cardiac diseases. METHODS. Water samples taken from HCUs used at UHB for cardiopulmonary bypass surgery were sampled over a year to determine the number of microorganisms by membrane filtration. Various decontamination processes were employed throughout the year. RESULTS. Varying total viable counts containing a wide variety of microorganisms were obtained from water inside the HCUs. No M. chimaera were isolated after replacement of the HCU internal tubing. Stringent decontamination regimes resulted in degradation of the HCUs and increased TVCs after several months. CONCLUSION. More work is required to ensure effective decontamination processes to reduce the microbial load within the HCUs. Our studies indicate that weekly water sampling for TVC will be required indefinitely to monitor the water quality in these units as well as regular replacement of the tubing to control the build-up of biofilm.																	0899-823X	1559-6834				JUN	2017	38	6					705	711		10.1017/ice.2017.64								WOS:000403302700010	28473009

Such adverse effects are of particular concern in permanently stratified meromictic lakes. Yet little is known about when and how meromixis and hypoxia became established (or vanished) prior to anthropogenic impacts, or how human activities such as deforestation, erosion and nutrient cycling affected the mixing regimes of lakes. We used calibrated hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data in the visible and near infrared range from a fresh, varved sediment core taken in Lake Jaczno, NE Poland, to map sedimentary pigments at very high resolution (sub-varve scale) over the past 1700 years. HSI-inferred bacteriopheophytin a (bphe a, produced by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria) serves as a proxy for meromixis, whereas HSI-inferred green pigments (chlorophyll a and diagenetic products) can be used as estimators of aquatic productivity. Meromixis was established and vanished long before significant human disturbance in the catchment was observed in the late eleventh century AD. Under pre-anthropogenic conditions, however, meromixis was interrupted frequently, and the lake mixing regime flickered between dimixis and meromixis. During two periods with intense deforestation and soil erosion in the catchment, characterised by sedimentary facies rich in clay and charcoal (AD 1070-1255 and AD 1670-1710), the lake was mostly dimictic and better oxygenated than in periods with relative stability and a presumably closed forest around the lake, i.e. without human disturbances. After ca. AD 1960, meromixis became established quasi-permanently as a result of eutrophication. The persistent meromixis of the last similar to 60 years is unusual with respect to the record of the last 1700 years.

Systematic risk management approach of household drinking water from the source to point of use	JOURNAL OF WATER SANITATION AND HYGIENE FOR DEVELOPMENT												The water safety plan (WSP) approach is being widely adopted as a systematic approach to improving the safety of drinking water. However, to date, the approach has not been widely used for improving the safety of drinking water in those settings where people have to collect water away from their home. Most rural areas in South Africa still consume unsafe water despite WSP implementation and improved water sources provided by municipalities. This study used hazard analysis critical control point to assess drinking water used in households to determine systematic procedures, which could be used to control risks. The process includes assessment of risks associated with household water service level (availability, accessibility and potability) and risks of water contamination from the collection to point of consumption. Observations and questionnaires were used to collect data in households to systematically determine and identify risks of drinking water consumption. The results show intermittent water supply, access to unsafe water, while poor hygiene practices contribute to household water contamination. This approach could assist in identifying hazards as well as critical control points to reduce risks and improve management of drinking water safety in households.

Planning and establishment principles for constructed wetlands and riparian buffer zones in agricultural catchments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In a great number of scientific articles on water quality improvement using constructed wetlands (CW) and riparian buffers zones (RBZ) at catchment scale, contradictory results are found. In most cases this is due to underestimating or even ignoring the role of the hydrological factor for water quality improvement. It has often resulted in biased estimates of buffering systems' efficiency at catchment scale and, consequently, has caused planning and establishment failures, mistakes and inconsistencies in legislative acts and finally, it has influenced stakeholder's willingness to support these eco-technological measures. In this paper we present a short but critical overview of the potential of CWs and RBZs in water quality improvement at catchment scale and highlight the most important aspects to be considered when planning, establishing and managing these systems.

Recovering hydromorphological functionality to improve natural purification capacity of a highly human-modified wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					9th International Meeting of the European-Chapter of the Society-of-Wetland-Scientists (SWS) on Wetlands Biodiversity and Services - Tools for Socio-Ecological Development held Jointly with the 6th Conference of the European-Pond-Conservation-Network	SEP 14-18, 2014	Huesca, SPAIN	Soc Wetland Scientists, European Chapter, European Pond Conservat Network				Modification of the hydrological regime by human actions can reduce the capacity of wetlands to improve water quality. For the first time, a study was conducted of the inherent pollution attenuation capacity of wetlands associated with the highly regulated Spanish Tagus River. We determined the natural purification capacity of a floodplain where irrigated agriculture predominates and hydraulic connection with the river is virtually nonexistent. To this end, continuous hydrophysical measurements and sediment and water samples were taken during the period extending from April 2013 to March 2014. A multi-parametric dataset including hydraulic, physico-chemical, bacterial and macroinvertebrate indicators was collected from ten piezometers located within a meander, together with two additional sampling points in the river. Sampling was performed monthly to measure hydraulic and physico-chemical parameters and quarterly for bacteria and macroinvertebrates. The data enabled us to implement different but complementary methodological approaches to characterize denitrification. Specifically, we performed: (i) end-member mixing analysis (EMMA); (ii) macroinvertebrate characterization; (iii) denitrification potential analysis; (iv) bacterial assemblage structure analysis; and (v) hydrological modeling of the current and different future management scenarios. All the approaches except EMMA indicated the same conclusion: denitrification is almost nonexistent due to the fact that the study site does not present the hydric soil and oxygen-limited conditions required to enable denitrification. The EMMA analysis showed that theoretical nitrate concentrations were lower than expected in some areas during the summer months (e.g. Delta NO3 = -41 in August 2013), which may have been because irrigation intensity was spatiotemporal variable at the study site. Our results show that floodplain denitrification has been drastically reduced due to the suppression of flood pulses. In this context, restoration of the hydrological regime in riverine wetlands would lead to the decay of nitrates whose dynamic evolution increases with flooding, as scenarios tested by the MOHID hydro-biogeochemical model have demonstrated.

Assessment of the denitrification process in alluvial wetlands at floodplain scale using the SWAT model	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					9th International Meeting of the European-Chapter of the Society-of-Wetland-Scientists (SWS) on Wetlands Biodiversity and Services - Tools for Socio-Ecological Development held Jointly with the 6th Conference of the European-Pond-Conservation-Network	SEP 14-18, 2014	Huesca, SPAIN	Soc Wetland Scientists, European Chapter, European Pond Conservat Network				As alluvial plains support intensive agricultural activities, they often suffer from groundwater nitrate pollution. Denitrification is recognised as an important process in nitrate pollution control in riparian zones. In shallow aquifer zones influenced by recharged surface water, denitrification efficiently attenuates nitrate in groundwater as well, and the exchange between surface water and groundwater has a significant impact on the occurrence of denitrification. Denitrification is simulated in numerous models, however most models do not take into account the denitrification occurring in shallow aquifers or the influence of recharge surface water in the alluvial aquifer with organic carbon and bacteria to activate denitrification. In this study, a new module was developed that represents the occurrence of denitrification in the shallow aquifer of alluvial floodplains. Nitrate inputs in the shallow aquifer caused by the recharged river water through both lateral (river bank) and vertical (surface) infiltration and the influence of flooding on nitrate leaching were added to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool - Landscape Unit Darcy (SWAT-LUD) model. The influences of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) on denitrification were evaluated. The modified model was applied on an experimental site located in the floodplain of the Garonne River (southwest France). Results showed that the modified SWAT-LUD model was able to simulate the aquifer nitrate concentration in the near-bank zone (riparian zone) satisfactorily. The near-bank zone in the floodplain played the most important role in attenuating nitrate through denitrification with an annual denitrification rate of around 130 kg N-NO(3)(-)ha(-1)y(-1), representing about 40% of the nitrate input in this area. POC was more important than DOC in the denitrification process, especially in the near-bank zone where 98% of the nitrate was attenuated through POC consumption. Relationships between denitrification rates, groundwater levels and total input nitrate masses in the near-bank zone were determined. The results illustrated that groundwater levels were positively related to the denitrification rates in the near-bank zone. The absolute denitrification rate increased as the nitrate content increased, but the relative consumption rate by denitrification decreased. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Samples were taken during different periods of the year during 2011-2014 to evaluate the influence of agricultural activities during the two years following their completion. Nitrate concentration was significantly higher in the in-stream wetlands, showing a clear dilution effect caused by the inputs of the irrigation return flows. The patterns followed by the first-order nitrate removal rate constant were different for in-stream and off-stream wetlands and during irrigation and non-irrigation seasons. During non-irrigation seasons, the nitrate outflowing concentration was found to be negatively correlated (p < 0.01) to the first-order nitrate removal rate constant for in-stream wetlands, indicating that high nitrate inputs may restrict the effectiveness of the wetlands. Temperature and dissolved oxygen were also found to significantly influence the performance of off-stream wetlands during non-irrigation seasons, but only dissolved oxygen promoted the nitrate removal during the irrigation period, indicating the influence of the seasonal factor on nitrate and wetlands dynamics. The results of this study showed that although a longer time is required to achieve optimal wetland development, wetlands can be used as buffer zones that effectively remove nitrates. This study emphasizes the influence of the agricultural seasonality of the factors affecting nitrate removal in wetlands, expanding the information provided by similar studies and validating a model that is applicable to a wide range of agricultural, hydrological and seasonal conditions.

Riparian forest is thus a green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation. However, a long history of landscape alteration now calls for maintenance and restoration by ecological engineering. This study evaluates management guidelines advocating constant vs. variable width of riparian forest protected zones in managed landscapes. In naturally dynamic forests, stands with gap-phase dynamic along streams often provide a network of habitats with a high degree of continuity in tree canopy cover and dead wood for biodiversity conservation and delivery of ecosystem services including water purification. Based on the observation that tall herb sites indicate a potential for temporally continuous forest cover, we tested three null hypotheses. Tall herb sites ( 1) are equally common in the riparian zone and in the surrounding forest landscape; ( 2) have the same width on both sides of a stream; and ( 3) their widths are independent of the width of the adjacent stream. We described the ground vegetation in transects along and perpendicular to streams, and in the surrounding landscape, in six 3rd stream order catchment located in Sweden, Lithuania and the Komi Republic of Russia. The results showed that tall herb sites were 21-27 times more common along streams compared to in the rest of the landscape, the width of tall herb sites varied considerably along streams, and it was independent of the width of the adjacent stream. This study suggests that rather than fixed-width guidelines for riparian set-asides, to support cost-efficient maintenance of riparian forest, local site conditions should be used as guide for planning, maintenance and engineering of riparian ecotones. Because tall herb forest sites were historically cleared for agricultural purposes, the potential natural amount of riparian forest is severely underestimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, the water quality of this reservoir has been seriously threatened by eutrophication resulting from increased nonpoint source pollution loads. In this study, we used a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to calculate pollution loads (total nitrogen [TN] and total phosphorus [TP]) in the area surrounding the Yuqiao Reservoir. We then established a coupled two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model that was used to simulate temporal and spatial distributions of TN and TP from June to September 2008. SWAT model results provided water quality boundary conditions for the coupled two-dimensional model. Results indicated that Liu Xiangying and Wu Baihu were the main TN inlets, and the average TN concentration in the reservoir was highest in September (3.74 mg/L). Meanwhile, the TP concentration in the eastern portion of the Yuqiao Reservoir was higher than that in the west, and the average TP concentration peaked in August (1.56 mg/L). The combination of the SWAT model and two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model provides an effective method to simulate water pollution with consideration of various factors.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				JUN	2017	34	6					418	432		10.1089/ees.2016.0124								WOS:000403206700005

For this purpose, Sb determination was carried out in water at different experimental conditions: storage for one to three weeks at 25 to 80 degrees C; long-term (six months) storage at room temperature between 16 and 24 degrees C and storage in car during summer which is a common consumer's habit. In addition, water quality analysis was developed after different time-temperature storage conditions. All the samples at the end of their storage conditions were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The limit of detection and quantification were 0.50 and 0.80 mu g/L, respectively. The results for the bottled water stored during six months indicated that the average Sb concentration was 0.332 +/- 0.015 mu g/L. This value is below the European maximum permissible migration level of 5 mu g/L. With regard to the newly bottled water, no Sb was detected at the initial time for all temperatures studied. However, the Sb concentration in water increased with both time and temperature. The levels of Sb started exceeding the European limits when the samples were stored at 60 degrees C for two weeks.																	1082-0132	1532-1738				JUN	2017	23	4					318	327		10.1177/1082013217690300								WOS:000403219100003	28166643

A literature search was conducted in order to review: (1) methods used for investigating the effects of public drinking water on GI; (2) evidence of possible dose-response relationship between sporadic GI and drinking water consumption; and (3) association between sporadic GI and factors affecting drinking water quality. Seventy-four articles were selected, key findings and information gaps were identified. In-home intervention studies have only been conducted in areas using surface water sources and intervention studies in communities supplied by ground water are therefore needed. Community-wide intervention studies may constitute a cost-effective alternative to in-home intervention studies. Proxy data that correlate with GI in the community can be used for detecting changes in the incidence of GI. Proxy data can, however, not be used for measuring the prevalence of illness. Local conditions affecting water safety may vary greatly, making direct comparisons between studies difficult unless sufficient knowledge about these conditions is acquired. Drinking water in high-income countries contributes to endemic levels of GI and there are public health benefits for further improvements of drinking water safety.

Comparison of MI, Chromocult (R) coliform, and Compass CC chromogenic culture-based methods to detect Escherichia coli and total coliforms in water using 16S rRNA sequencing for colony identification	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The MI, Chromocult (R) coliform, and Compass CC chromogenic culture-based methods used to assess water quality by the detection of Escherichia coli and total coliforms were compared in terms of their specificity and sensitivity, using 16S rRNA sequencing for colony identification. A sewage water sample was divided in 2-mu L subsamples for testing by all three culture-based methods. All growing colonies were harvested and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. Test results showed that all E. coli colonies were correctly identified by all three methods, for a specificity and a sensitivity of 100%. However, for the total coliform detection, the MI agar, Chromocult (R) coliform agar, and Compass CC agar were specific for only 69.2% (9/13), 47.2% (25/53), and 40.5% (17/42), whereas sensitive for 97.8% (45/46), 97.5% (39/40), and 85.7% (24/28), respectively. Thus, given the low level of specificity of these methods for the detection of total coliforms, confirming the identity of total coliform colonies could help to take public health decisions, in particular for cities connected to a public drinking water distribution system since the growth of few putative total coliform colonies on chromogenic agar is problematic and can lead to unnecessary and costly boiling notices from public health authorities.																	1477-8920					JUN	2017	15	3					353	359		10.2166/wh.2017.174								WOS:000403110200003	28598339

In order to assess the potential risk for legionellosis, we analyzed Legionella contamination of water distribution systems in 36 recreational facilities equipped with swimming pools. One hundred and sixty water samples were analyzed from shower heads or taps located in locker rooms or in bathrooms. By culture method and polymerase chain reaction, 41/160 samples were positive for Legionella from 12/36 recreational centers. Hotels (57.1%) and sports centers (41.2%) were the most contaminated. L. pneumophila serotypes 2-14 (25/41) were more frequently found than serotype 1 (10/41). Samples at temperature >= 30 degrees C were more frequently positive than samples at temperature <30 degrees C (n = 39 vs n = 2, p < 0.00001). The presence of L. pneumophila was investigated by comparison with heterotrophic plate count (HPC), an indicator of water quality. The presence of L. pneumophila was associated more frequently with high and intermediate HPC load at 37 degrees C, therefore should be considered a potential source when HPC at 37 degrees C is >10 CFU/mL. Maintenance, good hygiene practices, interventions on the hydraulic system and regular controls must be implemented to minimize exposure to L. pneumophila infection risk.																	1477-8920					JUN	2017	15	3					402	409		10.2166/wh.2017.296								WOS:000403110200008	28598344

Predicting water filter and bottled water use in Appalachia: a community-scale case study	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												A questionnaire survey was conducted in order to assess residents' perceptions of water quality for drinking and recreational purposes in a mid-sized city in northcentral West Virginia. Two logistic regression analyses were conducted in order to investigate the factors that influence bottle use and filter use. Results show that 37% of respondents primarily use bottled water and that 58% use a household filter when drinking from the tap. Respondents with lower levels of environmental concern, education levels, and lower organoleptic perceptions were most likely to perceive health risks from tap water consumption, and were most likely to use bottled water. Income, age, and organoleptic perceptions were predictors of water filter use among respondents. Clean water for recreational purposes was not found to be significant with either of these models. Our results demonstrate that bottle use and filter use are explained differently. We argue that more education and better communication about local tap water quality would decrease the use of bottled water. We demonstrate that household filters could be used as an alternative to bottled water.																	1477-8920					JUN	2017	15	3					451	461		10.2166/wh.2017.219								WOS:000403110200013	28598349

Assessment of water quality using multivariate techniques in River Sosiani, Kenya	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Multivariate techniques can infer intrinsic characteristics of complex data by generating correlation, similarity, dissimilarity, and covariance vector matrix to ascertain their relationships. The study evaluated the effect of anthropogenic activities by analyzing selected physicochemical water quality parameters (WQP) as indicators of pollution in River Sosiani, located in western Kenya, at six stations from August 2012 to February 2013 (Aug-Oct = wet season, Nov-Feb = Dry season). Temperature, pH, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), conductivity, and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) were measured in situ while Total Phosphorus (TP), Total Organic Nitrogen (TON), and Biologial Oxygen Demand (BOD) were measured in vitro using standard methods. Except for DO and pH, the other variables were increasing in concentration downstream. Cluster analysis grouped stations with municipal discharge, to be the most distant linked to other stations in both seasons. Multidimensional scaling had four categories of stations with similar WQP: before, after, and wet and dry seasons. Principal component analysis with (60.5 and 26.1% for components 1 and 2) evaluated TON and TP as key pollutants in both seasons. Factor analysis with varifactor two at 35.3 and 27.1% variance in wet and dry seasons, respectively, had strong absolute factor loading of BOD (wet 0.878, dry 0.915) and TP (wet 0.839, dry 0.709) inferring sites with organic pollution also had nutrient pollution. Assessment of pollution with the selected WQP identified two major effects: nutrient and organic. Additional variables may identify other pollutants along the river. Multiple pollution effects, changing environment, and intrinsic characteristics of aquatic ecosystems generate complex data which are better assessed with multivariate techniques.

From an environmental engineering perspective, it is already well known that certain situations (e.g., cross contamination) reduce drinking water quality and ultimately cause diseases in a population. In this study, we investigated the social practices and situations that may lead to lower disease occurrence. Towards this goal, we surveyed 382 residents in Yatta to collect data on the water-related diseases that they experienced and the specific situations that might affect the disease occurrences such as the residents' practices (i) for maintaining a high quality of cistern water, (ii) for maintaining the environment around the cistern, and (iii) for managing the wastewater. In addition, we measured the physicochemical and microbiological parameters in cisterns to support the qualitative survey data. The measured parameters, including turbidity, salinity, free available chlorine, total Coliforms, and fecal Coliforms, were above Palestinian Standard Institution (PSI) and World Health Organization (WHO) guideline levels, suggesting a potential infectious hazard. The poor quality of the water was also observed by residents based on change in taste and by visually noting floating impurities, turbidity, and green coloration. Survey results showed that observations of the poor quality in cisterns and surrounding environment had statistically significant correlation with most of the water-related diseases. Additionally, frequently emptying the septic tank contributes to improving the observed water qualities. Therefore, residents should be encouraged to continue to observe the water quality in the cistern, improve the surrounding environment of cistern, and empty their septic tank frequently, to keep the water diseases away from their households.

Hydrological connectivity and Burkholderia pseudomallei prevalence in wetland environments: investigating rice-farming community's risk of exposure to melioidosis in North-East Thailand	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												In our analysis of 136 water samples from wetland environments (rice paddies, natural wetland sites, man-made water bodies) in rural areas of North-East Thailand, Burkholderia pseudomallei was most prevalent in rice paddies (15 of the 30 positive sites). The high prevalence in the water of rice fields is indicative of the inherent vulnerability of farmers in rural agricultural areas in this area of Thailand and likely other locations in the tropics. Nearly all B. pseudomallei-positive sites were found within the vicinity of a large wetland associated with the Chi River, in the month of July 2014. Positive samples were found in water ranging in pH from 5.9 to 8.7, salinity ranging from 0.04 to 1.58 ppt, nitrate ranging from 0 to 10.8 ppm, and iron ranging from 0.003 to 1.519 ppm. Of these variables, only iron content was statistically higher in B. pseudomallei-positive versus B. pseudomallei-negative sites, suggesting that increasing concentrations of iron may encourage the growth of this bacterium, which is responsible for melioidosis. Our results, when combined with data from other published studies, support the notion that B. pseudomallei can exist in a wide range of environmental conditions. Thus, we argue that health safety education is a more appropriate means of addressing farmer vulnerability than chemical or physical alterations to fields at large scales. Further, it may be important to investigate melioidosis through transdisciplinary approaches that consider the complex social and ecological contexts in which the disease occurs.

Surface water samples were collected from 11 different stations from 0 to 10 km offshore with the help of a mechanized trawler. Parameters like tintinnid species enumeration, zooplankton biomass, phytoplankton concentration (total chlorophyll) and abundance, sea surface temperature (SST), pH, transparency, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphate, silicate and nitrate were analysed. A total of 20 different tintinnid species (16 agglomerated +4 non-agglomerated) belonging to 6 genera were recorded from the study area with seasonal variation in tintinnid diversity, i.e. higher in summer (total 2745 individual/l) compared to winter (total 1191 individual/l). Tintinnopsis was the most dominant genus during both the seasons, i.e. 2100 individual/l in summer and 727 individual/l in winter, contributing about 76 and 61% population for the respective seasons. The correlation between species and water quality parameters showed that Tintinnopsis sp. abundance was significantly regulated by nitrate concentration, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water transparency and pH. However, the mentioned hydrological parameters were not the only factors regulating the tintinnid abundance. Tintinnid abundance was also found to be positively related with transparency (r = 0.732) and salinity (r = 0.524) and moderately related with dissolved oxygen (r = 0.488) whereas strong negative relation (at p = 0.05) was established between tintinnid abundance with nitrate (r = -0.681) and pH (r = -0.561). Bray-Curtis cluster analysis of tintinnid species showed more than 60% similarity. Shannon's diversity index (H'), Simpson's evenness index (D) and Margalef's species richness index were found to be higher in summer, i.e. 1.61, 0.729 and 1.612, compared to the winter season, i.e. 1.139, 0.597 and 1.268. k-dominance curve showed maximum abundance of Tintinnopsis baltica in winter and Tintinnopsis gracilis in summer. Principal component analysis (PCA) was analysed to find out the environmental variables affecting different tintinnid species diversity. A significant spatiotemporal variation in Tintinnid population distribution was observed from two-way ANOVA. The results reflect significant seasonal (F = 840.0), spatial (F = 47.3) and interactive variation (F = 71.2) among the ciliate microzooplankton at n = 66, p = 0.001. High chlorophyll content and phytoplankton population in summer indicated that tintinnid diversity in the season was positively influenced by producer community in coastal waters of Digha.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2017	189	6							258	10.1007/s10661-017-5961-z								WOS:000403083300015	28478543

Bioaccumulation of toxins is a worldwide problem nowadays and has been, historically, overlooked by the supervisory authorities. This study evaluated cytogenotoxic effects of Guaribas river (a Brazilian river) water during dry and rainy seasons of 2014 by using the Allium cepa test system. The toxicogenetic variables, including root growth, mitotic index, and chromosomal aberrations, were analyzed in meristematic cells of A. cepa exposed to water samples taken from the up-, within, and downstream of the city Picos (state: Piaui). The physical-chemical parameters were also analyzed to explain water quality and possible anthropogenic action. Additionally, the presence of heavy metals was also analyzed to explain water quality and possible damaging effects on eukaryotic cells. The results suggest that the river water exerted cytotoxic, mutagenic, and genotoxic effects, regardless of the seasons. In addition, Guaribas river presented physicochemical values outside the Brazilian laws, which can be a characteristic of human pollution (domestic sewage, industrial, and local agriculture). The genetic damage was positively correlated with higher levels of heavy metals. The pollution of the Guaribas river water may link to the chemical contamination, including the action of heavy metals and their impacts on genetic instability in the aquatic ecosystem. In conclusion, necessary steps should be taken into account for further toxicogenetic studies of the Guaribas river water, as it has an influence in human health of the same region of Brazil.

An urban observatory for quantifying phosphorus and suspended solid loads in combined natural and stormwater conveyances	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Water quality in urban streams and stormwater systems is highly dynamic, both spatially and temporally, and can change drastically during storm events. Infrequent grab samples commonly collected for estimating pollutant loadings are insufficient to characterize water quality in many urban water systems. In situ water quality measurements are being used as surrogates for continuous pollutant load estimates; however, relatively few studies have tested the validity of surrogate indicators in urban stormwater conveyances. In this paper, we describe an observatory aimed at demonstrating the infrastructure required for surrogate monitoring in urban water systems and for capturing the dynamic behavior of stormwater-driven pollutant loads. We describe the instrumentation of multiple, autonomous water quality and quantity monitoring sites within an urban observatory. We also describe smart and adaptive sampling procedures implemented to improve data collection for developing surrogate relationships and for capturing the temporal and spatial variability of pollutant loading events in urban watersheds. Results show that the observatory is able to capture short-duration storm events within multiple catchments and, through intersite communication, sampling efforts can be synchronized across multiple monitoring sites.

Similar to its effect across various sectors and areas, climate change has potential to affect surface water quality directly and indirectly. On the one hand, the rise in temperature enhances the microbial activity and decomposition of organic matter in the river system and changes in rainfall alter discharge and water flow in the river ultimately affecting pollution dilution level. On the other hand, the disposal of organic waste and channelizing municipal sewage into the rivers seriously worsen water quality. This study attempts to relate hydro-climatology, water quality, and impact of climatic and non-climatic stresses in affecting river water quality in the upper Bagmati basin in Central Nepal. The results showed that the key water quality indicators such as dissolved oxygen and chemical oxygen demand are getting worse in recent years. No significant relationships were found between the key water quality indicators and changes in key climatic variables. However, the water quality indicators correlated with the increase in urban population and per capita waste production in the city. The findings of this study indicate that dealing with non-climatic stressors such as reducing direct disposal of sewerage and other wastes in the river rather than emphasizing on working with the effects from climate change would largely help to improve water quality in the river flowing from highly populated urban areas.

Evaluating the performance of a retrofitted stormwater wet pond for treatment of urban runoff	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This paper describes the performance of a retrofitted stormwater retention pond (Ashby Pond) in Northern Virginia, USA. Retrofitting is a common practice which involves modifying existing structures and/or urban landscapes to improve water quality treatment, often compromising standards to meet budgetary and site constraints. Ashby Pond is located in a highly developed headwater watershed of the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay. A total maximum daily load (TMDL) was imposed on the Bay watershed by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2010 due to excessive sediment and nutrient loadings leading to eutrophication of the estuary. As a result of the TMDL, reducing nutrient and sediment discharged loads has become the key objective of many stormwater programs in the Bay watershed. The Ashby Pond retrofit project included dredging of accumulated sediment to increase storage, construction of an outlet structure to control flows, and repairs to the dam. Due to space limitations, pond volume was less than ideal. Despite this shortcoming, Ashby Pond provided statistically significant reductions of phosphorus, nitrogen, and suspended sediments. Compared to the treatment credited to retention ponds built to current state standards, the retrofitted pond provided less phosphorus but more nitrogen reduction. Retrofitting the existing stock of ponds in a watershed to at least partially meet current design standards could be a straightforward way for communities to attain downstream water quality goals, as these improvements represent reductions in baseline loads, whereas new ponds in new urban developments simply limit future load increases or maintain the status quo.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				JUN	2017	189	6							256	10.1007/s10661-017-5930-6								WOS:000403083300013	28478541

Ecosystem services in the Taihu Lake Basin have been overexploited and jeopardized. Based on land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) data from 1979, 1984, 2000, and 2010, in conjunction with the adjusted ecosystem service values (ESV), changes in ESV were analyzed in detail. Results revealed that LUCC resulted in a substantial decrease in total ESV from $3.92 billion in 1979 to $2.98 billion in 2010. The ESV of cropland decreased from $1.64 billion in 1979 to $1.34 billion in 2010, which represented a 20.28% reduction. The ESV of water areas decreased from $1.08 billion in 1979 to $0.36 billion in 2010, which represented a 65.62% reduction mainly because of a decline in water quality. In terms of annual change rate, cropland and water areas showed a sustained downward trend. Spatially, ESV declines were mainly observed in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Shanghai, probably due to a combination of economic progress, population growth, and rapid urbanization. The research results can be a useful reference for policymakers in mitigating ESV decline.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				JUN	2017	11	2					310	320		10.1007/s11707-016-0612-1								WOS:000402454100009						
J	Tian, Q; Wang, Q; Liu, YL				Tian, Qing; Wang, Qing; Liu, Yalong			Geomorphic change in Dingzi Bay, East China since the 1950s: impacts of human activity and fluvial input	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE												This study examines the geomorphic evolution of Dingzi Bay, East China in response to human activity and variations in fluvial input since the 1950s. The analysis is based on data from multiple mathematical methods, along with information obtained from Remote Sensing, Geographic Information System and Global Position System technology. The results show that the annual runoff and sediment load discharged into Dingzi Bay display significant decreasing trends overall, and marked downward steps were observed in 1966 and 1980. Around 60%-80% of the decline is attributed to decreasing precipitation in the Wulong River Basin. The landform types in Dingzi Bay have changed significantly since the 1950s, especially over the period between 1981 and 1995. Large areas of tidal flats, swamp, salt fields, and paddy fields have been reclaimed, and aquaculture ponds have been constructed. Consequently, the patterns of erosion and deposition in the bay have changed substantially. Despite a reduction in sediment input of 65.68% after 1966, low rates of sediment deposition continued in the bay. However, deposition rates changed significantly after 1981 owing to large-scale development in the bay, with a net depositional area approximately 10 times larger than that during 1961-1981. This geomorphic evolution stabilized following the termination of large-scale human activity in the bay after 1995. Overall, Dingzi Bay has shown a tendency towards silting-up during 1952-2010, with the bay head migrating seaward, the number of channels in the tidal creek system decreasing, and the tidal inlet becoming narrower and shorter. In conclusion, large-scale development and human activity in Dingzi Bay have controlled the geomorphic evolution of the bay since the 1950s.																	2095-0195	2095-0209				JUN	2017	11	2					385	396		10.1007/s11707-016-0586-z								WOS:000402454100015

The lake has hosted numerous different management efforts. Diversion of sewage waters away from the lake in 1979 resulted in a considerable reduction of external P loading. Due to diffuse loading from agricultural areas, external loading however still exceeds the critical loading of the lake, thus having an effect on the water quality. The total P concentration of surface layers has decreased but is still on a hypertrophic level (90 g1-1). The high productivity of the lake is maintained also by intensive internal P loading, and the sediment has a potential to release P to the water for decades even if external loading would be reduced to a tolerable level. Internal P loading has not decreased over the studied decades despite numerous within-lake management efforts (aeration with different methods, food web management). In opposite, our results demonstrated that destratification applied since 1998 resulted in a persisting internal P loading. Destratification has increased the concentration of oxygen and decreased the concentration of soluble P in deep water, but at the same time it has accelerated P release from aerobic bottoms. This can be due to elevated near-bottom temperatures, enhanced liberation of organic P through accelerated mineralization, and increased sediment resuspension by aeration-induced turbulence. Additionally, increasing wind velocities may have a role in the increasing aerobic internal loading. Food web management has compensated for the amplified P-cycling, revealed by the decreasing chlorophyll:total P ratio. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, XZ; Tan, X				Wang, Xingzhong; Tan, Xiang			Macroinvertebrate community in relation to water quality and riparian land use in a substropical mountain stream, China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Exploring how water quality and land use shape the benthic macroinvertebrate community composition is of widespread interest in biodiversity conservation and environmental management. In this study, we investigated the structures of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages and their environmental controls in terms of water quality and riparian land use in the Jinshui River, China. We carried out three campaigns including wet season (August 2009), dry season (November 2009), and normal season (April 2010) based on the hydrological regime in Jinshui basin. The result showed that macroinvertebrate assemblage variations were better explained by water quality factors than land use based on variance partitioning procedure. The land use of 2 km upstream from the sampling sites had explained more variation than that of the whole riparian zone in upstream catchment on macroinvertebrate community, and land use of 2 km upstream also had more interactions with water quality. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated that the elements or nutrient of magnesium (Mn), selenium (Se), strontium (Sr), silicon (Si), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DN), sulfur (S), total organic carbon (TOC), and total nitrogen (TN) in water exhibited a strong relationship with macroinvertebrate assemblages. However, the variance in water quality explained by land use was lower than that explained by water quality in rivers using redundancy analysis. Our study suggested that proximate factors (i.e., water quality) were more important to interpret the macroinvertebrate community compared to ultimate factors (i.e., land use) for macroinvertebrate assemblages in river system.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	17					14682	14689		10.1007/s11356-017-9042-1								WOS:000402997700012	28456917

The MRPP method can handle uncertainties expressed as fuzzy-random-boundary intervals, probability distributions, and interval numbers, and analyze the effects of uncertainties as well as their interactions on modeling outputs. It is applied to plan water quality management in the Xiangxihe watershed. Results reveal that a lower probability of satisfying the objective function (theta) as well as a higher probability of violating environmental constraints (q (i) ) would correspond to a higher system benefit with an increased risk of violating system feasibility. Chemical plants are the major contributors to biological oxygen demand (BOD) and total phosphorus (TP) discharges; total nitrogen (TN) would be mainly discharged by crop farming. It is also discovered that optimistic decision makers should pay more attention to the interactions between chemical plant and water supply, while decision makers who possess a risk-averse attitude would focus on the interactive effect of q (i) and benefit of water supply. The findings can help enhance the model's applicability and identify a suitable water quality management policy for environmental sustainability according to the practical situations.

J	Limero, TF; Wallace, WT				Limero, Thomas F.; Wallace, William T.			What Air and Water Quality Monitoring Is Needed to Protect Crew Health on Spacecraft?	NEW SPACE												Spacecraft are partially- or fully-closed environments that demand environmental monitoring to protect the health of the crew and the vehicle. This article will detail the history of air and water monitoring on U.S. spacecraft from early in the human spaceflight era and will use the lessons learned to project the needs for commercial crew vehicles and exploration missions. Many sources of air and water pollutants exist on spacecraft (e.g., humans, material off-gas products, system chemicals, and experiments), which are scrubbed by various Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS). Environmental monitoring is important because the rate of removal seldom, if ever, equals or exceeds the rate of generation. As an example, carbon dioxide levels are controlled in spacecraft, but the levels are never close to zero. Much of the recycled water comes from spacecraft air condensate; therefore, contaminants in the air can also have a dramatic effect on potable water reclamation/purification and resulting water quality. In addition, potential system leaks and spills can contaminate the air and/or water. The experiences of humans working in closed environments (spacecraft and submarines) show that engineering controls are not sufficient to completely protect the crew from environmental hazards. This article will highlight the fact that characteristics of environmental monitors go beyond being lower power and small instruments. How much monitoring is required and the characteristics of the monitors all depend on the mission scenario, particularly mission durations and the ability of the crews to return to Earth or seek safe haven in the event of environmental contamination of their primary vehicle.

Balancing water-quality threats from nutrients and production in Australian and New Zealand dairy farms under low profit margins	ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE												The loss of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from dairy-farmed land can impair water quality. Efforts to curtail these losses in Australia and New Zealand (Australasia) have involved a mixture of voluntary and regulatory approaches. In the present paper, we summarise the losses of N and P from Australasian dairy farms, examine the policy drivers used for mitigating losses and evaluate the effectiveness of contrasting approaches to implementing mitigations. Median losses for N and P were 27 and 1.6 kg/ha.year respectively, with a wide range of variation (3-153 kg N/ha.year and 0.3-69 kg P/ha.year) caused by a complex array of climate, soil types, flow paths, nutrient surpluses and land management factors. This complexity, coupled with the variable implementation of measures to mitigate losses, means that many voluntary programs to decrease losses have had uncertain or limited success. Although there is little or no formal regulation in Australia, regulation exists in New Zealand that requires regional authorities to implement the best strategy to improve water quality according to regional-specific characteristics. In testing a generalised approach to mitigation (priority given to those that are easy to implement) in four regions in New Zealand, we found that P could be mitigated quite cheaply, but N reductions required more measures, some of which are costly. Conversely, prioritising on the basis of mitigation cost-effectiveness for a specific nutrient will lead to more rapid reductions in losses of the target nutrient, but with fewer co-benefits for the non-target nutrient or other water pollutants, such as faecal microorganisms and sediment. This information will assist farmers in deciding how to meet a catchment target at least cost.																	1836-0939	1836-5787				JUN	2017	57	7					1419	1430		10.1071/AN16646								WOS:000402662500027

D.			The effect of oxygen saturation on the growth and feed conversion of juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.)	AQUACULTURE												In land-based fish farms, water quality can be controlled to support maximum growth and good feed conversion. Oxygen is an important water quality parameter in aquaculture and the objective of this study was to detect the range of oxygen saturations that maximizes growth of juvenile Atlantic cod. The fish ( initial body mass 21.9 g) were reared at five different levels of oxygen saturation: 65%, 81%, 103%, 121% and 150% of air saturation, for 98 days. At oxygen saturation under 100%, the growth of the fish decreased linearly with progressively lower oxygen saturation with the final body mass of fish reared at 65% saturation being 24% lower than that of fish reared at 103% saturation. The final body mass of fish reared at 150% saturation was significantly higher ( 7%) than that of fish reared at 103% saturation. Feed intake was also affected by oxygen saturation and was proportional to growth while the feed conversion ratio was not significantly affected by oxygen levels. The results suggest that oxygen saturation of at least 100% is required to obtain maximum growth of juvenile Atlantic cod.

The effectiveness of incomplete and overlapping pollution regulation: Evidence from bans on phosphate in automatic dishwasher detergent	JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS												This paper examines the effectiveness of command-and-control policies in the presence of incomplete and overlapping regulations. We study how recent bans on phosphate in household dishwasher detergent affect pollution loads to waterways, costs at wastewater treatment facilities, and consumer behavior. We show that the effectiveness of the bans in reducing effluent depends critically on regulations at receiving treatment facilities. As cost minimizers, facilities with an emissions standard on phosphorus face no incentive to deviate from the standard. We show that bans have weak effects on effluent, especially in the most polluted waterways. We also use an early, isolated ban in Spokane, Washington to study the effect of the bans on consumers. We find that this ban shifted approximately 40% of dishwasher detergent sales from Spokane to bordering counties until a state-wide ban was implemented. Using these estimates, we find that the welfare loss to consumers from recent bans is likely greater than the cost-savings to treatment plants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Likely Effects of the Increasing Alkalinity of Inland Waters on Aquaculture	JOURNAL OF THE WORLD AQUACULTURE SOCIETY												The rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is increasing the solubility of limestone, calcium silicate, and feldspars, resulting in greater total alkalinity concentration in inland waters. This phenomenon will result in inland waters having slightly greater alkalinity concentration (and buffering capacity), higher pH when at equilibrium with atmospheric CO2, and more available carbon for photosynthesis. However, the changes in water quality will be small. Fluctuations in CO2 concentration resulting from CO2 use in photosynthesis by aquatic plants and release of CO2 by respiration, acidity resulting from nitrification of ammonia nitrogen from feeding waste and fertilizer, and application of liming materials to ponds will continue to be the dominant factors affecting pH and alkalinity in waters of inland aquaculture systems.																	0893-8849	1749-7345				JUN	2017	48	3					496	502		10.1111/jwas.12405								WOS:000402640300013

BIOACCUMULATION OF INORGANIC ELEMENTS IN DREISSENA POLYMORPHA FROM THE EBRO RIVER, SPAIN: COULD ZEBRA MUSSELS BE USED AS A BIOINDICATOR OF THE IMPACT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES?	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Dreissena polymorpha is among the top 100 most harmful invasive species in aquatic habitats. European Directive 2013/39/UE establishes Environmental Quality Standards for biota because it has been demonstrated that pollutants bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms. This study evaluated bioaccumulation of inorganic elements in the soft tissues of D. polymorpha in order to assess the usefulness of zebra mussels as a bioindicator of contaminant presence in superficial waters. Concentrations of 66 elements were measured in order to evaluate their relationship with nearby anthropogenic activity and to the values recommended by Environmental Quality Standards for biota. Bivalves were collected from four sample points along the Ebro River Basin (Spain), where diverse human activities are carried out. Zebra mussels accumulate toxins in soft tissue during their life cycle, including Al, Cr, Fe, Hg, Pb, Th, Cd and U. The highest levels of accumulation corresponded to elements associated with human activity in the area, showing the impact of anthropogenic actions on biota. D. polymorpha not only supplies information about current water quality but also acts as a witness of past water quality by bioconcentrating toxic elements present in the environment and providing relevant results about historical water contamination. In conclusion, D. polymorpha is a harmful and dangerous invasive species, but its pervasiveness means that it can be used as a bioindicator to assess current and past presence of elements in water.

Quantification of Transformation Products of Unsymmetrical Dimethylhydrazine in Water Using SPME and GC-MS	CHROMATOGRAPHIA												Quantification of trace concentrations of transformation products of rocket fuel unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) in water requires complex analytical instrumentation and tedious sample preparation. The goal of this research was to develop a simple and automated method for sensitive quantification of UDMH transformation products in water using headspace (HS) solid-phase microextraction (SPME) in combination with GC-MS and GC-MS/MS. HS SPME is based on extraction of analytes from a gas phase above samples by a micro polymer coating followed by a thermal desorption of analytes in a GC inlet. Extraction by 85 A mu m Carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fiber at 50 A degrees C during 60 min provides the best combination of sensitivity and precision. Tandem mass spectrometric detection with positive chemical ionization improves method accuracy and selectivity. Detection limits of twelve analytes by GC-MS/MS with chemical ionization are about 10 ng L-1. GC-MS provides similar detection limits for five studied analytes; however, the list of analytes detected by this method can be further expanded. Accuracies determined by GC-MS were in the range of 75-125% for six analytes. Compared to other available methods based on non-SPME sample preparation approaches (e.g., liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction), the developed method is simpler, automated and provides lower detection limits. It covers more UDMH transformation products than available SPME-based methods. The list of analytes could be further expanded if new standards become available. The developed method is recommended for assessing water quality in the territories affected by space activities and other related studies.

Long-term dynamics of a high-latitude coral reef community at Sodwana Bay, South Africa	CORAL REEFS												Dynamics in reef cover, mortality and recruitment success of a high-latitude coral community in South Africa were studied over 20 yr with the aim to detect the effects of climate change. Coral communities at this locality are the southernmost on the African continent, non-accretive, attain high biodiversity and are dominated by soft corals. Long-term monitoring within fixed transects on representative reef was initiated in 1993 and has entailed annual photo-quadrat surveys and hourly temperature logging. Although sea temperatures rose by 0.15 A degrees C p.a. at the site up to 2000, they have subsequently been decreasing, and the overall trend based on monthly means has been a significant decrease of 0.03 A degrees C p.a. Despite this, minor bleaching was encountered in the region during the 1998 El Nio-Southern Oscillation event, again in the summer of 2000/2001 and in 2005. A significant decreasing trend of 0.95% p.a. in soft coral cover has been evident throughout the monitoring period, attributable to significant decreases in Sinularia and Lobophytum spp. cover. In contrast, hard coral cover gradually and significantly increased up to 2005, this being largely attributable to increases in cover by Acropora spp. Recruitment success and mortality of both soft and hard corals has displayed high inter-annual variability with increasing but non-significant trends in the last 5 yr. The reduction in soft coral cover has been more consistent and greater than that of hard corals, but it is difficult at this stage to attribute this to changes in water quality, acidification-linked accretion or temperature.																	0722-4028	1432-0975				JUN	2017	36	2					369	382		10.1007/s00338-016-1531-z								WOS:000401627400002

This paper presents a methodology to characterise and classify the regime of a temporary river in Southern Italy based on hydrological indicators (HIs) computed with long- term daily flow records. By using a principal component analysis (PCA), a set of non-redundant indices were identified describing the main characteristics of the hydrological regime in the study area. The indicators identified were the annual maximum 30- and 90-day mean (DH4 and DH5), the number of zero flow days (DL6), flow permanence (MF) and the 6-month seasonal predictability of dry periods (SD6). A methodology was also tested to estimate selected HIs in ungauged river reaches. Watershed characteristics such as catchment area, gauging station elevation, mean watershed slope, mean annual rainfall, land use, soil hydraulic conductivity and available water content were derived for each site. Selected indicators were then linked to the catchment characteristics using a regression analysis. Finally, MF and SD6 were used to classify the river reaches on the basis of their degree of intermittency. The methodology presented in this paper constitutes a useful tool for ecologists and water resource managers in the Water Framework Directive implementation process, which requires a characterisation of the hydrological regime and a 'river type' classification for all water bodies.

Influence of land use and land cover on the spatial variability of dissolved organic matter in multiple aquatic environments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Water quality of lakes, estuaries, and coastal areas serves as an indicator of the overall health of aquatic ecosystems as well as the health of the terrestrial ecosystem that drains to the water body. Land use and land cover plays not only a significant role in controlling the quantity of the exported dissolved organic matter (DOM) but also influences the quality of DOM via various biogeochemical and biodegradation processes. We examined the characteristics and spatial distribution of DOM in five major lakes, in an estuary, and in the coastal waters of the Mississippi, USA, and investigated the influence of the land use and land cover of their watersheds on the DOM composition. We employed absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy including excitation-emission matrix (EEM) combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis modeling techniques to determine optical properties of DOM and its characteristics in this study. We developed a site-specific PARAFAC model to evaluate DOM characteristics resulting in five diverse DOM compositions that included two terrestrial humic-like (C1 and C3), two microbial humic-like (C2 and C5), and one protein-like (C4) DOM. Our results showed elevated fluorescence levels of microbial humic-like or protein-like DOM in the lakes and coastal waters, while the estuarine waters showed relatively high fluorescence levels of terrestrial humic-like DOM. The results also showed that percent forest and wetland coverage explained 68 and 82% variability, respectively, in terrestrial humic-like DOM exports, while 87% variability in microbially derived humiclike DOM was explained by percent agricultural lands. Strong correlations between microbial humic-like DOM and fluorescence-derived DOM indices such as biological index (BIX) and fluorescence index (FI) indicated autochthonous characteristics in the lakes, while the estuary showed largely allochthonous DOM of terrestrial origin. We also observed higher concentrations of total dissolved phosphorous (TDP) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N) in coastal waters potentially due to photodegradation of refractory DOM derived from the sediment-bound organic matter in the coastal wetlands. This study highlights the relationships between the DOM compositions in the water and the land use and land cover in the watershed. The spatial variability of DOM in three different types of aquatic environments enhances the understanding of the role of land use and land cover in carbon cycling through export of organic matter to the aquatic ecosystems.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2017	24	16					14124	14141		10.1007/s11356-017-8917-5								WOS:000402748300021	28417327

Hydrochemical examination of wet-monsoon season primarily revealed Ca-MgHCO3 type (66%) and followed by Na-Cl type (17.70%) water. In the dry-monsoon season, the scenario reversed with primary water being Na-Cl type (52.27%) followed by Ca-Mg-HCO3 type (31.81%). Analysis of Cl/Br molar ratio vs. Cl (mg/L) depicted sampling area affected by seawater intrusion (SWI). Spatial analysis by ordinary kriging method confirmed approximately 77% sample in the dry-monsoon, and 34% of the wet-monsoon season had shown SWI. The most saline-intruded areas in the wet-monsoon seasons were extreme south-west coastal zone of Bangladesh, lower Meghna River floodplain and Meghna estuarine floodplain and southeastern part of Chittagong coastal plains containing the districts of Chittagong and Cox's Bazar adjacent to Bay of Bengal. In addition, mid-south zone is also affected slightly in the dry-monsoon season. From the analyses of data, this study could further help to comprehend seasonal trends in the hydrochemistry and water quality of the coastal and estuarine rivers. In addition, it can help policy makers to obligate some important implications for the future initiatives taken for the management of land, water, fishery, agriculture and environment of coastal rivers and estuaries of Bangladesh.

The concept has found some success with point source water pollution, but very few trades have occurred in over 50 programs in the United States (U.S.) that have focused on nonpoint sources (NPSs). To understand why success has been slow, we identified three environments needed for programs to succeed: physical, economic, and institutional. We estimate that only 5% of watersheds in the U.S. currently listed as nutrient impaired provide a viable physical environment for trading nitrogen; 13% are suitable for phosphorus. Economic and institutional challenges would shrink that domain even further. Therefore, we find places with the ideal physical, economic, and institutional environments necessary for feasible WQT programs are virtual policy utopias - rare places with ideal environments. Fortunately, a growing literature provides the tools necessary to identify where these policy utopias are and to expand that domain through a better understanding about how to manage WQT programs more effectively.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					514	520		10.1111/1752-1688.12532								WOS:000402846200002

USE OF SWAT TO ESTIMATE SPATIAL SCALING OF PHOSPHORUS EXPORT COEFFICIENTS AND LOAD REDUCTIONS DUE TO AGRICULTURAL BMPS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Phosphorus export coefficients (kg/ha/yr) from selected land covers, also called phosphorus yields, tend to get smaller as contributing areas get larger because some of the phosphorus mobilized on local fields gets trapped during transport to regional watershed outlets. Phosphorus traps include floodplains, wetlands, and lakes, which can then become impaired by eutrophication. The Sunrise River watershed in east central Minnesota, United States, has numerous lakes impaired by excess phosphorus. The Sunrise is tributary to the St. Croix River, whose much larger watershed is terminated by Lake St. Croix, also impaired by excess phosphorus. To support management of these impairments at both local and regional scales, a Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model of the Sunrise watershed was constructed to estimate load reductions due to selected best management practices (BMPs) and to determine how phosphorus export coefficients scaled with contributing area. In this study, agricultural BMPs, including vegetated filter strips, grassed waterways, and reduction of soil-phosphorus concentrations reduced phosphorus loads by 4-20%, with similar percentage reductions at field and watershed spatial scales. Phosphorus export coefficients from cropland in rotation with corn, soybeans, and alfalfa decreased as a negative power function of contributing area, from an average of 2.12 kg/ha/yr at the upland field scale (similar to 0.6 km(2)) to 0.63 kg/ha/yr at the major river basin scale (20,000 km(2)).																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					547	561		10.1111/1752-1688.12523								WOS:000402846200005

URBAN STREAMFLOW RESPONSE TO IMPORTED WATER AND WATER CONSERVATION POLICIES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Los Angeles has a long history of importing water; however, drought, climate change, and environmental mitigation have forced the City to focus on developing more local water sources (target of 50% local supply by 2035). This study aims to improve understanding of water cycling in Los Angeles, including the impacts of imported water and water conservation policies. We evaluate the influence of local water restrictions on discharge records for 12 years in the Ballona Creek (urban) and Topanga Creek (natural) watersheds. Results show imported water has significantly altered the timing and volume of streamflow in the urban Ballona watershed, resulting in runoff ratios above one (more streamflow than precipitation). Further analysis comparing pre- vs. during-mandatory water conservation periods shows there is a significant decrease in dry season streamflow during-conservation in Ballona, indicating that prior to conservation efforts, heavy irrigation and other outdoor water use practices were contributing to streamflow. The difference between summer streamflow pre- vs. during-conservation is enough to serve 160,000 customers in Los Angeles. If Los Angeles returns to more watering days, educating the public on proper irrigation rates is critical for ensuring efficient irrigation and conserving water; however, if water restrictions remain in place, the City must take the new flow volumes into account for complying with water quality standards in the region.																	1093-474X	1752-1688				JUN	2017	53	3					626	640		10.1111/1752-1688.12515								WOS:000402846200010

Results of the study indicate that implementing CNMPs on AFOs will help reduce sediment and organic nutrient losses from their current levels at moderate cost.

Green algae, diatoms, and charophytes dominated in the river, which reflects regional features of agricultural activity. Species richness and algal abundance increased down the river. The Water Quality Index characterizes the quality of water down the river as medium to bad. The index of saprobity S reflects Class III water quality. The Water Ecosystem Sustainability Index (WESI) shows contamination with nutrients. According to the River Pollution Index (RPI), waters in the river have low alkalinity and low salinity, and are contaminated with nutrients. Pearson coefficients showed that water temperature plays a major role in the total species richness distribution (0.93*) and in the green algae distribution (0.89*), while cyanobacteria were stimulated also by water salinity (0.91*). Stepwise regression analysis indicated water temperature as the major regional factor that determines riverine algal diversity. Surface plots and Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that salinity, nitrates, temperature, and Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) can be defined as major factors affecting algal diversity. Dendrites mark the upper site of the Warsak Dam as the source of the community species diversity. Bioindication methods can give relevant and stable results of water quality and self-purification assessment that can be employed to monitor the regional water quality.																	1730-413X	1897-3191				JUN	2017	46	2					140	153		10.1515/ohs-2017-0015								WOS:000402628100002

Gd, one of the rare earth elements (REE) group, can be considered as a tracer of wastewaster effluents contamination. It is commonly used as contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging and it can be detected in hospital and wastewater discharges. In this study, surface- and groundwater quality of the Romagna area was assessed, with a particular focus on REE content in water. The efficiency of two drinking water treatment plants in removing microcontamination was also evaluated comparing REE concentrations at the entrance and exit of the plants. Chemical analyses on a large set of trace elements, as well as major ion content, were performed to geochemically characterize surface- and groundwaters and to investigate possible relations with REEs. The study revealed water chemistry of both surface- and groundwaters mainly controlled by carbonates and clay minerals contribution. As regards REEs, Gd contamination was detected only in surface waters in the northern part of the study area; in the Lamone river, this contamination was accompanied by the detection of La anomalies, reflecting a contaminated environment. The two drinking water treatment plants showed that common water treatment techniques are often inefficient to remove microcontamination.				dinelli, enrico/G-6532-2012	dinelli, enrico/0000-0002-3870-544X												2037-4631	1720-0776				JUN	2017	28	2					265	279		10.1007/s12210-016-0561-3								WOS:000401766800003

Nutrient export from terrestrial ecosystem to the river is controlled by hydrological processes and nutrient input from point and non-point sources. In the present paper, anthropogenic nitrogen input and the riverine export of nitrate-N (N-NO3) were quantified through several survey campaigns, continuous measures of streamflow and discrete determinations of concentrations. A different frequency for water sampling was used, respectively, during floods and during normal- or low-flow state. Nitrate-N concentrations in surface waters were found to vary considerably across the seasons. The riverine N-NO3 export was estimated to be about 14 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Major N inputs derived from fertilizers and animal manure correspond to 68.2 and 24 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Nitrate-N fluxes in stream during flood events (21 days) accounted for about 63% of the annual loading. This study clearly demonstrates the importance of flood event contributions to the annual nutrient loading delivered to the reservoir and that more efficient fertilizers and management practices are needed to reduce N input.																	2037-4631	1720-0776				JUN	2017	28	2					291	301		10.1007/s12210-016-0593-8								WOS:000401766800005

Fungi-based treatment of brewery wastewater-biomass production and nutrient reduction	APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												The beer-brewing process produces high amounts of nutrient-rich wastewater, and the increasing number of microbreweries worldwide has created a need for innovative solutions to deal with this waste. In the present study, fungal biomass production and the removal of organic carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen from synthetic brewery wastewater were studied. Different filamentous fungi with a record of safe use were screened for growth, and Trametes versicolor, Pleurotus ostreatus and Trichoderma harzianum were selected for further work. The highest biomass production, 1.78 +/- 0.31 g L-1 of dry weight, was observed when P. ostreatus was used for the treatment, while T. harzianum demonstrated the best capability for removing nutrients. The maximum reduction of chemical oxygen demand, 89% of the initial value, was observed with this species. In the removal of total nitrogen and phosphorus, no significant difference was observed between the species, while removal of ammonium varied between the strains. The maximum reduction of ammonium, 66.1% of the initial value, was also found in the T. harzianum treatment. It can be concluded that all treatments provided significant reductions in all water-quality parameters after 3 days of growth and that the utilisation of filamentous fungi to treat brewery wastewater, linked to a deliberate strategy to use the biomass produced, has future potential in a bio-based society.

In the present study, metal contents and toxicity of soils, aqueous extracts from soils and mine drainage waters from an abandoned F-Ba-Pb-Zn mining area in Osor (Girona, NE Spain) were evaluated through chemical extractions and ecotoxicity bioassays. Toxicity assessment in the terrestrial compartment included lethal and sublethal endpoints on earthworms Eisenia fetida, arthropods Folsomia candida and several plant species, whereas aquatic tests involved bacteria Vibrio fischeri, microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata and crustaceans Daphnia magna. Total concentrations of Ba (250-5110 mg kg(-1)), Pb (940 to > 5000 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (2370-11,300 mg kg(-1)) in soils exceeded intervention values to protect human health. Risks for the aquatic compartment were identified in the release of drainage waters and in the potential leaching and runoff of metals from contaminated soils, with Cd (1.98-9.15 A mu g L-1), Pb (2.11-326 A mu g L-1) and Zn (280-2900 A mu g L-1) concentrations in filtered water samples surpassing US EPA Water Quality Criteria (2016a, b). Terrestrial ecotoxicity tests were in accordance with metal quantifications and identified the most polluted soil as the most toxic. Avoidance and reproduction tests with earthworms showed the highest sensitivity to metal contamination. Aquatic bioassays performed in aqueous extracts from soils confirmed the results from terrestrial tests and also detected toxic effects caused by the mine drainage waters. Algal growth inhibition was the most sensitive aquatic endpoint. In view of the results, the application of a containment or remediative procedure in the area is encouraged.																	0269-4042	1573-2983				JUN	2017	39	3					665	679		10.1007/s10653-016-9840-2								WOS:000402049700014	27260479

The water quality parameters, included in the Spanish regulations for reclaimed wastewater reuse as agricultural quality 2.1, were monitored for one year. Data for all studied parameters, except electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), met the Spanish standards for reclaimed wastewater reuse due to the high evapotranspiration (ET) during the summer. The introduced improvements were effective for turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and, specially, for total phosphorus (TP) with an average abatement of 96.9 +/- 1.7%. The improved HF-CW achieved similar or better percentage abatements than those reported using some hybrid systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological water quality of the Negro River basin during this extreme flood to investigate this apparent association between the illness cases and the population exposed to the contaminated waters. Forty water samples were collected and analysed for classic and emerging enteric viruses. Human adenoviruses, group A rotaviruses and genogroup II noroviruses were detected in 100, 77.5 and 27.5% of the samples, respectively, in concentrations of 10(3)-10(6) GC/L. All samples were compliant with local bacteriological standards. HAdV2 and 41 and RVA G2, P[6], and P[8] were characterised. Astroviruses, sapoviruses, genogroup IV noroviruses, klasseviruses, bocaviruses and aichiviruses were not detected. Statistical analyses showed correlations between river stage level and reported gastroenteritis cases and, also, significant differences between virus concentrations during this extreme event when compared with normal dry seasons and previous flood seasons of the Negro River. These findings suggest an association between the extreme flood experienced and gastrointestinal cases in the affected areas providing circumstantial evidence of causality between the elevations in enteric viruses in surface waters and reported illness.																	1867-0334	1867-0342				JUN	2017	9	2					195	207		10.1007/s12560-017-9280-x								WOS:000401519200008	28160215

Ferreira			The Fate of Base Metals in the Environment and Water Quality in the Mellegue Watershed, Northwest Tunisia	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												The 130 Mm(3)-capacity MellSgue reservoir has a broad catchment area. Contaminants include sewage from cities, farm fertilizers, and metals released from mine tailings, all of which threaten Tunisia's water supply. Forty surface water samples were collected from watercourses and 18 from the reservoir during the wet and dry seasons. To evaluate groundwater contamination, the Sarrat basin was considered as a case study, and well water was analysed. The total amounts of base metals and nutrients in the watercourses did not exceed international standards. Evaporites in broad Triassic outcrops and in tailings dissolve, and may fix lead as sulphates; however, sulphate and chloride can complex and increase the solubility of some metals. The nutrient and salt content were highest in the Rmel River, which receives sewage from el Kef. An opposing gradient of metals was observed in the reservoir water column: elements such as Zn, Pb, and Al were enriched upwards, while Mn, Fe, and Cr increased towards the sediment-water interface. The same behaviour was observed for NO3 (-) and O-2, due to metal release under reducing conditions in bottom waters, and dissolution of Fe and Mn colloids. Fertilizers and sewage may be responsible for the potentially hazardous level of nutrients in the groundwater.

Quantifying Iron Concentration in Local and Synthetic Acid Mine Drainage: A New Technique Using Handheld Field Spectrometers	MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT												Pit lakes present a concern for public safety and environmental quality. With continuing advancement of imaging satellites, remote sensing spectroscopy may provide a useful tool for monitoring pit water quality across vast mining districts. Visible to shortwave infrared remote sensing has been widely used to monitor acid mine drainage (AMD) mineralogy at mine sites. However, few studies have examined the spectral signatures of mine-affected waters and open pit water bodies from a remote platform. The motivation for this study was to identify the spectral characteristics of AMD in a controlled laboratory setting in order to better interpret mine water bodies in remote sensing imagery. The spectral response of synthetic and local AMD were measured using a field spectrometer. Solutions with increasing Fe3+ and Fe2+ concentrations were mixed to mimic the chemical properties of local AMD. Synthetic solutions with known Fe concentrations were compared with local AMD for quantitative assessment. The spectral signatures of Fe3+ dominated waters possessed distinct characteristics that may be used for diagnostic identification. Specifically, the region between 0.35 and 0.625 A mu m was used to approximately quantify Fe3+ concentrations. Subtle changes in Fe concentrations in local AMD were identified using a field spectrometer alone. These findings suggest that subtle changes in open pit water quality may also be qualitatively and quantitatively measured by remote sensing spectroscopy.																	1025-9112	1616-1068				JUN	2017	36	2					299	309		10.1007/s10230-016-0399-z								WOS:000402398400015

Rainwater harvesting for restoring degraded dry agro-pastoral ecosystems: a conceptual review of opportunities and constraints in a changing climate	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												Water resources in dry environments are becoming scarcer, especially under the changing climate. In response, rainwater harvesting (RWH) is being reemphasized with calls to revive the practice. Ancient knowledge on RWH - mainly the collection through runoff, storage, and use of rainwater for various purposes - is still relevant, especially for dry environments. However, many old practices and technologies may not be suitable or feasible for the present and future. Little has been done to modernize and (or) develop new practices and technologies based on ancient indigenous knowledge. Modernizing old practices or developing new ones and using them in integrated rangelands restoration packages with enabling policy environment can unlock their potential in many water-scarce regions of the world. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of micro-catchment rainwater harvesting (MIRWH) in dry environments and discusses the opportunities available and the major obstacles faced in using it to restore degraded agro-pastoral ecosystems and support their sustainability. The review highlights the knowledge behind it, the practices developed over the years, and their relevance to today and the future. The paper indicates areas of modernization that can make it more feasible for the future of the dry environments, especially their role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Conventional and passive approaches to restoring/rehabilitating degraded dry agro-pastoral ecosystems are either too slow to show an obvious impact or not progressing satisfactorily. One main reason is that, because of land degradation, the majority of rain falling on such ecosystems and needed for revegetation is lost with little benefit being gained. Adopting a more progressive intervention to alter the processes of degradation and move towards new system equilibrium is required. MIRWH can enable a large portion of this otherwise lost rainwater to be stored in the soil, and, if used in an integrated packages including suitable plant species and sound grazing management, it may support meaningful vegetation growth and help system restoration. The Badia Benchmark project, implemented by ICARDA in Jordan and Syria, has demonstrated the potential for adoption at large scale in similar environments. This case study illustrates the potential and the constraints of this practice.																	1208-6053	1181-8700				JUN	2017	25	2					135	162		10.1139/er-2016-0069								WOS:000402318000001

A nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) model is designed and tested. The method to design the model has two parts: 1) structure of the model: the model takes into account the influence of environmental conditions using the measurements of sunlight intensity, the moonlight, tide levels, precipitation, and water salinity levels. A possible influence of the internal circadian/circatidal clocks is also analyzed and 2) least square calculation of the model parameters. Through this paper, it is demonstrated that the developed dynamical model of the oyster valve movement can be used for estimating normal physiological rhythms of permanently immersed oysters and can be considered for detecting perturbations of these rhythms due to changes in the water quality, i.e., for ecological monitoring.

Stochastic multicomponent reactive transport analysis of low quality drainage release from waste rock piles: Controls of the spatial distribution of acid generating and neutralizing minerals	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												In mining environmental applications, it is important to assess water quality from waste rock piles (WRPs) and estimate the likelihood of acid rock drainage (ARD) over time. The mineralogical heterogeneity of WRPs is a source of uncertainty in this assessment, undermining the reliability of traditional bulk indicators used in the industry. We focused in this work on the bulk neutralizing potential ratio (NPR), which is defined as the ratio of the content of non-acid-generating minerals (typically reactive carbonates such as calcite) to the content of potentially acid-generating minerals (typically sulfides such as pyrite). We used a streamtube-based Monte-Carlo method to show why and to what extent bulk NPR can be a poor indicator of ARD occurrence. We simulated ensembles of WRPs identical in their geometry and bulk NPR, which only differed in their initial distribution of the acid generating and acid neutralizing minerals that control NPR. All models simulated the same principal acid-producing, acid-neutralizing and secondary mineral forming processes. We show that small differences in the distribution of local NPR values or the number of flow paths that generate acidity strongly influence drainage pH. The results indicate that the likelihood of ARD (epitomized by the probability of occurrence of pH < 4 in a mixing boundary) within the first 100 years can be as high as 75% for a NPR = 2 and 40% for NPR = 4. The latter is traditionally considered as a "universally safe" threshold to ensure non-acidic waters in practical applications. Our results suggest that new methods that explicitly account for mineralogical heterogeneity must be sought when computing effective (upscaled) NPR values at the scale of the piles.					Mayer, K.

J	Bonotto, DM; de Oliveira, AMMA				Bonotto, Daniel Marcos; Marinello Assis de Oliveira, Ana Maria			Mobility indices and doses from Po-210 and Pb-210 activity concentrations data in Brazilian spas groundwaters	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												Po-210 and (210)pb activity concentrations in spas groundwaters occurring at Sao Paulo (SP) and Minas Gerais (MG) states, Brazil, have been reported in this paper with a dual purpose: to compare different indices for evaluating the radionuclides mobility into waters and to evaluate the drinking water quality from dose calculations. The waters (75 sampling points) are extensively used for drinking in public places, bottling and bathing purposes, among other. The samples were taken from springs and wells drilled at different aquifer systems inserted in Parana and Southeastern Shield hydrogeological provinces. The WHO guideline reference value for Pb-210 and Po-210 of 0.1 Bq/L in drinking water was not reached for Pb-210 but the Po-210 levels were equal or above it in four spas groundwaters from MG State. The maximum WHO guidance dose level of 0.1 mSv/yr was also reached or surpassed in them. The Pb-210 "mobility index" taking into account the ratio of the weight of the dissolved Pb-210 per unit volume of solution to its weight per unit weight of the rock matrix yielded values in the range of 0.01-5.2 kg/m(3). Another "mobility index" (Preference Ratio) expressing the ratio of Pb-210 and U-238 in the waters divided by the ratio of Pb-210 and U-238 in the rock matrices provided values between 0.004 and 7994. The (210)pb-/U-238 activity ratios of some spas groundwaters suggested preferential U-238 transport relative to Pb-210 into the liquid phase, whereas the ratio of the Pb-210 to U-238 mobility indices indicated the opposite. Such finding showed a better usefulness of the mobility indices for evaluating processes affecting the radionuclides release into the liquid phase during the water/rock interactions.

A particle-tracking technique for spatial and temporal interpolation of satellite images applied to Lake Superior chlorophyll measurements	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Ocean color satellite-derived estimates of water properties are generally discontinuous in spatial and temporal coverage due to cloud cover. We describe a novel method for providing an estimate of continuous distribution of a satellite-derived water property, chlorophyll concentration in Lake Superior. The method uses calculated wind-driven lake circulation from a hydrodynamic model to estimate the evolution of the chlorophyll concentration field between available imagery. This new technique considers hydrodynamic effects by integrating a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) and an Eulerian concentration remapping approach. The PCPM interpolation method uses computational tracer particles that move with the calculated lake currents to represent the chlorophyll field. The concentration associated with each particle is dynamically adjusted toward the satellite-derived chlorophyll field at times and locations where imagery is available and produces a spatially and temporally continuous estimate of the chlorophyll concentration field. One of the important characteristics revealed from the analysis is the seasonally-dependent and region-specific chlorophyll concentration, which is significantly controlled by seasonal hydrodynamic conditions in Lake Superior. Analysis suggests that without adding extra sampling cost, moving a few sampling locations from offshore water to sample the embayments and southern coasts can provide more accurate characterization of the spatial pattern of chlorophyll concentration in Lake Superior. Furthermore, we found that Lake Superior chlorophyll concentrations do not appear to have changed significantly over the past 12 years and likely only slightly or not at all over the last 50 years, which differs from that in the other upper Great Lakes.

Assessing the status of sediment toxicity and macroinvertebrate communities in the Eighteenmile Creek Area of Concern, New York	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In 1972, the governments of Canada and the United States committed to restoring the physical, chemical, and biological integrity of the Laurentian Great Lakes under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Through this framework, the downstream-most section of Eighteenmile Creek, a tributary to the south shore of Lake Ontario in New York, was designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) because water quality and bed sediments were contaminated by past industrial and municipal discharges, waste disposal, and pesticide usage. Five beneficial use impairments (BUls) have been identified in the AOC including the degradation of the "benthos", or the benthic macroinvertebrate community. This investigation used sediment toxicity testing and macroinvertebrate community assessments to determine if the toxicity of bed sediments in the AOC differed from that of an unimpacted reference stream. Results from 10-day toxicity tests indicated that survival and growth of the dipteran Chironomus dilutus and the amphipod Hyalella azteca did not differ significantly between sediments from the AOC and reference area. Analyses of benthic macroinvertebrate community integrity and structure also indicated that macroinvertebrate communities, while impacted across most sites on both streams, were generally similar between the AOC and reference area. Despite these findings, the upstream-most AOC site consistently scored poorly in all analyses, which suggests that localized sediment toxicity may exist in the AOC, even if large scale differences between the AOC and a comparable reference stream are minimal.

To quantify microbial loads and to determine probable sources of elevated E. coli levels, water and sediment samples were collected from both beaches during swimming season 2011. Sources of fecal pollution were assessed using multiple molecular markers: human-associated Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron alpha 1-6 mannanase (B. theta), bovine-associated Bacteroides (BoBac), human adeno-viruses (HAdVs), and bovine adenoviruses (BAdVs). Fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli and enterococci) were also monitored. In Singing Bridge Beach, 50% of water samples (n = 78) exceeded the recreational water quality guidelines for E. coli, while in Whites Beach all water samples met the E. coli standard. B. theta, BoBac, HAdVs, and BAdVs were detected in both beaches indicating influence of multiple sources of contamination. Cell culture assays indicated six water samples from Singing Bridge Beach and seven water samples from Whites Beach contained infectious viruses. Both frequency and concentrations of B. theta and BoBac were higher in sediment samples than in water samples. Elevated BoBac as compared with B. theta in water and sediment samples in both beaches, which are located in a watershed characterized as intensely farmed, suggest that runoff from agricultural areas was one of the probable dominant pollution sources. This study demonstrates that Bacteroides markers used in combination with land use information may help to characterize impacted beaches in mixed watersheds and design management plans.

J	Brothers, S; Vadeboncoeur, Y; Sibley, P				Brothers, Soren; Vadeboncoeur, Yvonne; Sibley, Paul			A decline in benthic algal production may explain recent hypoxic events in Lake Erie's central basin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since the late 1990s, the central basin of Lake Erie has reputedly experienced an increase in the frequency and severity of hypoxic events. However, total phosphorus (TP) loading, in-lake TP concentrations, chlorophyll a (Chl a), and sediment oxygen demand (SOD) have all declined in the central basin since the 1970s. Water clarity in this basin has declined from the 1970s to 2000s despite the invasion of dreissenid mussels around 1990. In shallow lakes, declines in benthic primary production (PP) can generate positive feedback loops between the internal loading of nutrients/dissolved organic carbon and hypoxic/anoxic conditions in the water column. Such a hypoxia-inducing mechanism driven by declines in benthic PP has not been explored in Lake Erie. To test if a decline in benthic PP might explain hypoxic events in the central basin of Lake Erie, we calculated the inter-decadal changes in benthic and planktonic algal production in this basin from the 1970s to the 2000s. Primary production models using water column Chl a concentrations and light attenuation indicated that benthic PP represents roughly 10% of the basin's total areal PP. However, our calculations show that bentliic PP declined from approximately 540 to 200 g C/m(2) y since the 1970s. We propose that a decline in benthic PP may have played a key mechanistic role in the transition from externally-induced hypoxia (i.e. watershed nutrient loading fueling phytoplankton production) in the 1970s and 80s to internally-induced hypoxia (sediment resuspension and internal loading) since the late 1990s.

J	Francoeur, SN				Francoeur, Steven N.			Stimulation of Saginaw Bay charophyte photosynthesis by phosphorus	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Like many other benthic algae, charophytes can attain high abundance in shallow waters, thereby affecting benthic ecology and nutrient cycling, and their subsequent death, detachment, and shoreline deposition contribute to beach fouling within the Laurentian Great Lakes. In-situ nutrient enrichment experiments and stoichiometric analyses have shown that other types of Great Lakes benthic algae are frequently phosphorus (P)-limited, but comparable information is lacking for charophytes. This study coupled short-term P enrichment of charophytes collected from inner Saginaw Bay with fluorometric estimates of algal photosynthesis to assess potential nutrient limitation. Benthic irradiance at the experimental sites was frequently sufficient to saturate charophyte photosynthesis, and charophyte photosynthesis was stimulated by experimental P enrichment, suggesting that these algae were P -limited under natural conditions. Reduction of P loading may be an effective charophyte control measure, even in relatively light-poor and nutrient-rich areas of the Great Lakes.

Ontogenetic dietary shifts and bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine in Mugil cephalus from an urban estuary	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Though bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals has received attention in inland waters, studies of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation in estuarine and marine systems are limited. Further, an understanding of pharmaceutical bioaccumulation across size classes of organisms displaying ontogenetic feeding shifts is lacking. We selected the striped mullet, Mugil cephalus, a euryhaline and eurythermal species that experiences dietary shifts with age, to identify whether a model base, diphenhydramine, accumulated in a tidally influenced urban bayou. We further determined whether diphenhydramine accumulation differed among size classes of striped mullet over a two year study period. Stable isotope analysis identified that ontogenetic feeding shifts of M. cephalus occurred from juveniles to adults. However, bioaccumulation of diphenhydramine did not significantly increase across age classes of M. cephalus but corresponded to surface water levels of the pharmaceutical, which suggests inhalational uptake to diphenhydramine was more important for bioaccumulation than dietary exposure in this urban estuary.

Twelve polyethylene enclosures (each 4 x 4 x 1.5 m depth) were assigned to four groups with each one stocked with 120 juveniles (44.08 + 1.36 g). Fish was fed twice daily at a rate of 3% body weight in the experiment. After 70 days of feeding, growth and survive rate of crucian carp were not affected by diet of different P level. It was found that physiochemical factors in all the enclosures did not show obvious threat on fish. Diets of different P level did not affect dissolved oxygen (DO), secchi depth (SD), total ammonium nitrogen (TAN), and total nitrogen (TN) concentration in enclosures. However, increased diet P level seemed to increase averaged pH, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and total phosphorus (TP) concentration and decrease nitrite concentration and TN/TP. During later period of experiment, treatments with high diet P level (D3 and D4 treatments) had very high cyanobacterial biomass dominated by Microcystis spp., while phytoplankton in D1 and D2 treatments was mainly composed of edible algae. Composition and density of zooplankton in different treatments varied in similar pattern. Peak density of cladocerans (mainly Moina spp.) seemed to be related to diet P level. The present study indicated that changing P level in diets might bring complicated changes to the intensive crucian carp culture ecosystem.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				JUN	2017	25	3					1145	1158		10.1007/s10499-016-0103-0								WOS:000401852200009

On the basis of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) analysis, strain PB45 was identified as Bacillus cereus PB45. PB45 has the potential to remove NH4+-N,NO3--N, and NO2--N at the rates of 66.6, 79.4, and 50%, respectively. The optimum pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen for the highest nitrification process of the PB45 were 8.0, 30 degrees C, and 6.68 mg/l (200 rpm), respectively. PB45 could express periplasmic nitrate reductase (nap Lambda), hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (hao), and nitrite reductase (nirS) which are essential to complete heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification process. Removal of NH4+-N,NO3--N, and NO2--N in an aquarium base shrimp wastewater system was recorded to be 99.76, 99.37, and 99.72%, respectively, by PB45. This result indicated that PB45 has the prospect for future full-scale application in commercial shrimp culture.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				JUN	2017	25	3					1167	1183		10.1007/s10499-016-0105-y								WOS:000401852200011

K.; Maqsood, Mudasir			Biofloc technology: an emerging avenue in aquatic animal healthcare and nutrition	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL												Biofloc is a conglomeric aggregation of microbial communities such as phytoplankton, bacteria, and living and dead particulate organic matter. Biofloc technology involves manipulation of C/N ratio to convert toxic nitrogenous wastes into the useful microbial protein and helps in improving water quality under a zero water exchange system. It may act as a complete source of nutrition for aquatic organisms, along with some bioactive compounds that will enhance growth, survival, and defense mechanisms, and acts as a novel approach for health management in aquaculture by stimulating innate immune system of animals. Nutritionally, the floc biomass provides a complete source of nutrition as well as various bioactive compounds that are useful for improving the overall welfare indicators of aquatic organisms. Beneficial microbial bacterial floc and its derivative compounds such as organic acids, polyhydroxy acetate and polyhydroxy butyrate, could resist the growth of other pathogens, thus serves as a natural probiotic and immunostimulant. The technology is useful in maintaining optimum water quality parameters under a zero water exchange system, thus prevents eutrophication and effluent discharge into the surrounding environment. Moreover, the technology will be useful to ensure biosecurity, as there is no water exchange except sludge removal. The technology is economically viable, environmentally sustainable, and socially acceptable.

To investigate the potential regulatory roles of P. helgolandica in white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) culture, P. helgolandica was seeded in water for rearing white shrimp at three different doses of 1 x 10(4) (T1), 5 x 10(4) (T2) and 1 x 10(5) (T3) cell mL(-1) and control without any microalgae for 40 days, and water quality, innate non-specific immune responses (including total hemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase activity (PO), lysozyme (LSZ), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity), shrimp growth performance and shrimp survival rate under Vibrio parahaemolyticus exposure were examined. All the three treatments seeded with P. helgolandica showed a significant reduction of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. Water pH in each tanks seeded with P. helgolandica tended to increase during the experiment, whereas water pH in the control tanks tended to fluctuate over time. Compared with the control group, final weight, average weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were significantly greater in T1, T2 andT3. The THCs of the T3 group were significantly higher than that of the control. SOD activities of the shrimp in T2 and T3 groups were significant higher than those of the shrimp in the control. The PO activity of the T3 group was significantly higher than those of the control and the T1 group. On day 10, the survival rate (percent) of L. vannamei under V. parahaemlyticus exposure were 66.67, 81.11 and 91.11% in T1, T2 and T3 respectively, whereas, it was 43.33% in the positive control. These results suggest that seeded P. helgolandica in the rearing water of white shrimp confers positive effects for shrimp aquaculture, considering water quality, growth performance, innate non-specific immune responses and disease resistance. Among the three doses of P. helgolandica, 1 x 10(5) cell mL(-1) had the best effect on shrimp growth performance and resistance against V. parahaemolyticus infection.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				JUN	2017	25	3					1279	1290		10.1007/s10499-017-0113-6								WOS:000401852200019

Evaluation of different hydroponic media for mint (Mentha arvensis) with common carp (Cyprinus carpio) juveniles in an aquaponic system	AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL												Three hydroponic media crushed stones (T1), river stones (T2), and floating raft (T3) were compared in an aquaponic system with common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and mint (Mentha arvensis). Fish effluents were used as plant nutrients while plants filtered water by stripping off the nutrients before returning to the fish tank. Fish growth, plant growth, and water quality parameters were used to evaluate the suitability of three different media. Growth performance of common carp and mint followed the relationship of crushed stones > floating raft > river stones with significant difference observed among all treatments. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) removal varied significantly among different treatments. The maximum TAN removal was observed in T1 (77.13%) followed by T3 (69.65%), and the minimum removal was observed in T2 (48.82%). Nitrate removal varied significantly among different treatments. The highest removal was observed in T1 (82.95%) followed by T3 (68.04%) and T2 (59.51%). Removal of phosphate was significantly lower in T2 (50.12%) when compared to T1 (67.85%) and T3 (70.71%). Biofilter performance (g m(-3) day(-1)) of T2 (4.80) was significantly lower compared to T1 (7.13) and T3 (7.37). Crushed stone and floating raft were significantly efficient when compared to river stone medium in terms of nutrient removal and water quality maintenance for the fish culture. Considering all growth parameters, crushed stone media proved to be better when compared to other two media. Thus, medium selection could be a considerable factor when designing an aquaponic system.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				JUN	2017	25	3					1291	1301		10.1007/s10499-017-0114-5								WOS:000401852200020

Sustained Biogeochemical Impacts of Wildfire in a Mountain Lake Catchment	ECOSYSTEMS												Wild and prescribed fires can cause severe deterioration in water quality, including increases in sediment, nutrients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Due to the unpredictability of wildfires, few studies have been able to employ before-after, control-intervention experimental designs, or to evaluate fire-induced water-quality changes in the context of long-term datasets. Here, we present data from a lake draining a moorland catchment in the United Kingdom, part of a 22-site, 25 year monitoring network, which experienced a major wildfire in 2011. The main water-quality response was a large, sustained increase in nitrate concentrations, sufficient to raise acidity and aluminium concentrations, effectively reversing over a decade of recovery from the effects of acid deposition. Concurrently, we observed a clear reduction in DOC concentrations, contrasting with prescribed fire studies from similar ecosystems (none based on before-after studies) that have suggested that burning causes DOC to increase. However, data from a downstream water supply reservoir do suggest a fire-induced change in DOC quality towards more soil-derived aromatic organic compounds, and lake sediment data suggest a large increase in particulate organic carbon. We conclude that the biogeochemical responses to wildfire in our moorland catchment were broadly similar to those observed in forest ecosystems elsewhere, but that historically high nitrogen deposition has made the ecosystem particularly susceptible to nitrate leaching and (re-)acidification. The observed reduction in DOC concentrations casts some doubt on the widely held view that prescribed burning in moorland systems has contributed to long-term DOC increases.

Reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration for recovery and reuse of larval rearing water in Anopheles arabiensis mass production: Effect of water quality on larval development and fitness of emerging adults	ACTA TROPICA												Background: Countries around the world are showing increased interest in applying the sterile insect technique against mosquito disease vectors. Many countries in which mosquitoes are endemic, and so where vector control using the sterile insect technique may be considered, are located in arid zones where water provision can be costly or unreliable. Water reuse provides an alternate form of water supply. In order to reduce the cost of mass rearing of Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes, the possibility of recycling and reusing larval rearing water was explored. Methods: The used rearing water Nifty water') was collected after the tilting of rearing trays for collection of larvae/pupae, and larvae/pupae separation events and underwent treatment processes consisting of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis. First-instar An. arabiensis larvae were randomly assigned to different water-type treatments, 500 larvae per laboratory rearing tray: 'clean' dechlorinated water, routinely used in rearing; dirty water; and 'recycled' dirty water treated using reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration. Several parameters of insect quality were then compared: larval development, pupation rate, adult emergence, body size and longevity. Water quality of the samples was analyzed in terms of ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, sulphate, dissolved oxygen, chloride, and phosphate concentrations after the larvae had all pupated or died. Surface water temperatures were also recorded continuously during larval development. Results: Pupation rates and adult emergence were similar in all water treatments. Adult body sizes of larvae reared in recycled water were similar to those reared in clean water, but larger than those reared in the dirty larval water treatment, whereas the adult longevity of larvae reared in recycled water was significantly increased relative to both 'clean' and 'dirty' water. Dirty larval water contained significantly higher concentrations of ammonium, sulfate, phosphate and chloride and lower levels of dissolved oxygen than clean water. These parameters significantly varied during the period of larval development. After dirty water was recycled by ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis, all the parameters measured were the same as those in clean water. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the potential for using recycled larval rearing water to supplement clean dechlorinated water supplies. Recycling used water improved its quality and of the reared mosquitoes. As water demands and environmental pressures grow, recycling of larval rearing water will improve the sustainability and affordability of mosquito mass-rearing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Due to the restrictions on water use, production systems are becoming increasingly more intensive, raising concerns about the production water quality. Macrobrachium amazonicum is among the freshwater prawn species with favorable characteristics for production and possibility of intensification. Nitrogen compounds such as ammonia and nitrite affect the health of aquatic organisms since they quickly reach toxic concentrations. These compounds can also cause damage to the gill structure, leading to hypoxia in tissues, affecting acid-base balance, osmoregulation (salt absorption) and ammonia excretion, decreasing the immune capacity of the animal and, in extreme cases, cause death. The aim of this study was to assess histological changes in the gills of Macrobrachium amazonicum juveniles subjected to different concentrations of total ammonia and nitrite. The prawns were subjected to different concentrations of those compounds and their gills were removed and preserved for histological analysis. The gills were assessed for changes according to the Organ Index (I-org and, for each change, an importance factor (w) was attributed according to the degree of reversibility and applied according to the degree of extension or frequency of the damage. The damage to the gills in the treatments with 100% mortality, both for ammonia and nitrite, corresponded to the high occurrence of progressive, regressive, circulatory, and inflammation damages. The other treatments (which caused less mortality) had mainly inflammation and regressive damages, whose occurrence increased according to the increase in ammonia and nitrite concentration. The histological analysis confirmed that the higher the total ammonia and nitrite concentrations, the larger the damages caused to the gill structure and that lower nitrite concentrations caused similar damages to those caused by higher total ammonia concentrations, which reflects the lower capacity M. amazonicum has to tolerate nitrite.																	0166-445X	1879-1514				JUN	2017	187						115	123		10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.04.003								WOS:000401876700014	28410472

Municipal wastewater treatment plant effluent-induced effects on freshwater mussel populations and the role of mussel refugia in recolonizing an extirpated reach	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Global human population and urbanization continually increase the volume of wastewater entering aquatic environments. Despite efforts to treat these effluents, they contribute a diverse suite of substances that enter watersheds at concentrations that have the potential to elicit adverse effects on aquatic organisms. The relationship between wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent exposure and biological responses within aquatic ecosystems remains poorly understood, especially at the population level. To examine the effect of WWTP effluents on sentinel invertebrates, freshwater mussels were assessed in the Grand River, Ontario, in populations associated with the outfall of a major WWTP. This watershed, within the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, has a diverse community of twenty-five species of mussels, including nine Species at Risk, and is representative of many habitats that receive WWTP effluents regionally as well as globally. Surveys were conducted to assess the presence and species richness of freshwater mussels. In total, 55 sites downstream of the WWTP were examined using timed visual searches with one or 2 h of effort spent searching 100 m segments. Although seven species of mussels were found in moderate abundance (mean of 8 mussels per hour of searching across 2 sites) upstream of the WWTP outfall, no live mussels were observed for 7.0 km downstream of the WWTP. Long-term water quality monitoring data indicate that ammonia and nitrite concentrations along with large seasonal declines in diel dissolved oxygen were associated with the extirpation of mussels downstream of the WWTP. The first live mussels found downstream were below the confluence with a major tributary indicating that in addition to an improvement in water quality to a state that enables mussels (and/or their fish hosts) to survive, a nearby mussel refuge may have facilitated the recolonization of the depauperate WWTP-impacted zone.

However, no reliable, practical and low-cost method exists to measure the direct release of metals from antifouling paints. Therefore, the paint industry and regulatory authorities are obliged to use release rate measurements derived from either mathematical models or from laboratory studies. To bridge this gap, we have developed a novel method using a handheld X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) to determine the cumulative release of Cu and Zn from antifouling paints. The results showed a strong linear relationship between XRF K-alpha net intensities and metal concentrations, as determined by ICP-MS. The release of Cu and Zn were determined for coated panels exposed in harbors located in the Baltic Sea and in Kattegat. The field study showed salinity to have a strong impact on the release of Cu, i.e. the release increased with salinity. Contrary, the effect of salinity on Zn was not as evident. As exemplified in this work, the XRF method also makes it possible to identify the governing parameters to the release of Cu and Zn, e.g. salinity and type of paint formulation. Thus, the XRF method can be used to measure environmentally relevant releases of metallic compounds to design more efficient and optimized antifouling coatings. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J	Bal, N; Kumar, A; Du, J; Nugegoda, D				Bal, Navdeep; Kumar, Anupama; Du, Jun; Nugegoda, Dayanthi			Multigenerational effects of two glucocorticoids (prednisolone and dexamethasone) on life-history parameters of crustacean Ceriodaphnia dubia (Cladocera)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs) such as dexamethasone (DEX) and prednisolone (PDS) have been used since the 1940s to cure inflammatory and auto-immune disorders. Their use has been linked to a host of deleterious effects in aquatic ecosystems such as osteoporosis in vertebrates, developmental impairments in molluscs and reduced fecundity and growth in cladocerans. Apart from these handful of studies, the effects of GCs on aquatic biota are largely unknown. The present study is a first of its kind aiming to assess the multi-generational exposure effects of DEX and PDS on the life history parameters of Ceriodaphnia dubia (C. dubia). Multigenerational studies have proved to be an advantage in assessing the cumulative damage caused by aquatic toxicants at the population level of the exposed organisms over a period of successive generations using multiple biological endpoints. Test results demonstrated that C. dubia exhibited varied sensitivities towards both the studied chemicals however were more sensitive to DEX with 48-h EC50 (95% confidence interval) of 0.75 mg/L (CI: 0.59-0.92) in comparison to PDS [19 mg/L (CI: 15-23)]. EC10 values for F0 in a multigenerational chronic bioassays were 48 mu g/L (CI: 37.4 61) for DEX and 460 mu g/L (CI: 341-606) for PDS and in F3 were 2.21 mu g/L (CI: 1.6-3.1) for DEX and 31 mu g/L (CI: 19.4-46) for PDS. There was a positive trend of increased toxicity followed by reduced life history traits such as fecundity, brood size and time to first brood and intrinsic rate of population increase and body growth (length and area) of C dubia in the case of both studied chemicals. The results from the current work highlighted the importance of multigenerational studies in identifying the evolutionary responses of stressed non-target aquatic organisms, and data obtained can be further used in developing water quality guidelines.

J	Christianson, L; DeVallance, D; Faulkner, J; Basden, T				Christianson, Laura; DeVallance, David; Faulkner, Joshua; Basden, Thomas			Scientifically advanced woody media for improved water quality from livestock woodchip heavy-use areas	FRONTIERS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & ENGINEERING												Overwintering cattle on pastures in many areas can damage the pasture and lead to impaired water quality. During these times, use of a woodchip heavy-use area (HUA) presents advantages such as a soft, supportive, and dry foot surface for animals and protection of the pasture and pasture soils. However, woodchip HUAs can also be a centralized source of high nutrient loads due to their drainage outflows. A column study was conducted to assess the nutrient load reduction potential of: 1) six types of wood media (including torrefied wood media and biochar) that could be used in a woodchip HUA versus a gravel control, and 2) providing a 48 h retention time within the wood media to enhance nitrogen removal through denitrification. The woody media provided significant liquid waste volume reduction compared to the gravel in simulated events (53%-61% vs. 39% reductions, respectively), and there may be additional liquid storage capacity in the woodchips not utilized during these rapid events. Substantial total nitrogen removal by the wood treatments (mean removal efficiencies > 50%) was observed across the simulated events, although nitrate leaching also occurred. Nitrate removal was enhanced during the 48 h retention test which showed removal was governed by availability of labile carbon (i.e., fresh woodchips exhibited > 70% nitrate removal). The retention test also indicated biochar mixtures provided some of the best total phosphorus removal, but the greatest benefits across all parameters was provided by the Mixed Hardwood treatment.

In aquatic sciences, this effort is expanding the scope of questions and analyses that can be performed to further our knowledge of the global drivers of water quality. Cyanotoxin concentration is one variable that has received considerable attention, and although strong local-scale models have been described in the literature, modelling cyanotoxin concentrations across broader spatial scales has been more difficult. Commonly used statistical frameworks have not fully captured the complex response of toxic algal blooms to global change, limiting our ability to predict and mitigate the impairment of freshwaters by toxic algae. Here, we advance our understanding of emergent drivers of cyanotoxins across a structured landscape by applying a hierarchical "hurdle" model. Location: Lakes and reservoirs in the conterminous United States [n = 1127]. Methods: We studied cyanobacteria and their toxins [microcystins] during the 2007 summer period. We applied a hierarchical zero-altered model to test the importance of multi-scale interactions among environmental features in driving microcystin concentrations above the limit of detection. We then used boosted regression trees [BRTs] to identify environmental thresholds associated with severe impairment by microcystins. Results: Accounting for numerous non-detections, spatial heterogeneity and cross-scale interactions substantially improved continental-scale predictions of bloom toxicity. Our model accounted for 55% of the variance in the probability of detecting microcystins across the United States, and 26% of the variability in microcystin concentrations once detected. BRTs further showed that although both local and regional drivers were associated with microcystin concentrations at low to intermediate provisional guidelines, only local drivers came into play when predicting higher limits. Main conclusions: Identifying the interaction between local and regional processes is key to understanding the heterogeneous responses of microcystins to environmental change. Our framework could increase the effectiveness of continental-scale analyses for many different water variables.

J	Hunt, RJ; Johnson, WP				Hunt, Randall J.; Johnson, William P.			Pathogen transport in groundwater systems: contrasts with traditional solute transport	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Water quality affects many aspects of water availability, from precluding use to societal perceptions of fit-for-purpose. Pathogen source and transport processes are drivers of water quality because they have been responsible for numerous outbreaks resulting in large economic losses due to illness and, in some cases, loss of life. Outbreaks result from very small exposure (e.g., less than 20 viruses) from very strong sources (e.g., trillions of viruses shed by a single infected individual). Thus, unlike solute contaminants, an acute exposure to a very small amount of contaminated water can cause immediate adverse health effects. Similarly, pathogens are larger than solutes. Thus, interactions with surfaces and settling become important even as processes important for solutes such as diffusion become less important. These differences are articulated in "Colloid Filtration Theory", a separate branch of pore-scale transport. Consequently, understanding pathogen processes requires changes in how groundwater systems are typically characterized, where the focus is on the leading edges of plumes and preferential flow paths, even if such features move only a very small fraction of the aquifer flow. Moreover, the relatively short survival times of pathogens in the subsurface require greater attention to very fast (< 10 year) flow paths. By better understanding the differences between pathogen and solute transport mechanisms discussed here, a more encompassing view of water quality and source water protection is attained. With this more holistic view and theoretical understanding, better evaluations can be made regarding drinking water vulnerability and the relation between groundwater and human health.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				JUN	2017	25	4			SI		921	930		10.1007/s10040-016-1502-z								WOS:000401787800003						
J	Worthington, SRH; Smart, CC				Worthington, Stephen R. H.; Smart, C. Christopher			Transient bacterial contamination of the dual-porosity aquifer at Walkerton, Ontario, Canada	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Contamination of the Paleozoic carbonate aquifer at Walkerton (Ontario, Canada) by pathogenic bacteria following heavy rain in May 2000 resulted in 2,300 illnesses and seven deaths. Subsequent tracer testing showed that there was rapid groundwater flow in the aquifer, and also rapid exchange between the aquifer and the ground surface. Electrical conductivity (EC) profiling during a 3-day pumping test showed that most flow was through bedding-plane fractures spaced about 10 m apart, that there were substantial contrasts in EC in the major fracture flows, and that there were rapid changes over time. Total coliform sampling revealed transient groundwater contamination, particularly after heavy rain and lasting up to a few days. These characteristics can be understood in terms of the dual-porosity nature of the aquifer. Most of the storage is in the matrix, but this can be considered to be static in the short term. Almost all transport is through the fracture network, which has rapid groundwater flow (similar to 100 m/day) and rapid transmission of pressure pulses due to the high hydraulic diffusivity. Rapid recharge can occur through thin and/or fractured overburden and at spring sites where flow is reversed by pumping during episodes of surface flooding. These characteristics facilitated the ingress of surface-derived bacteria into the aquifer, and their rapid transport within the aquifer to pumping wells. Bacterial presence is common in carbonate aquifers, and this can be explained by the well-connected, large-aperture fracture networks in these dual-porosity aquifers, even though many, such as at Walkerton, lack karst landforms.																	1431-2174	1435-0157				JUN	2017	25	4			SI		1003	1016		10.1007/s10040-016-1514-8								WOS:000401787800010

Disparities among the Nordic countries in the approach to providing safe drinking water from groundwater are discussed, and recommendations are given for the future. Groundwater recharge is typically high in autumn or winter months or after snowmelt in the coldest regions. Most inland aquifers are unconfined and therefore vulnerable to pollution, but they are often without much anthropogenic influence and the water quality is good. In coastal zones, previously emplaced marine sediments may confine and protect aquifers to some extent. However, the water quality in these aquifers is highly variable, as the coastal regions are also most influenced by agriculture, sea-water intrusion and urban settlements resulting in challenging conditions for water abstraction and supply. Groundwater is typically extracted from Quaternary deposits for small and medium municipalities, from bedrock for single households, and from surface water for the largest cities, except for Iceland, which relies almost entirely on groundwater for public supply. Managed aquifer recharge, with or without prior water treatment, is widely used in Finland to extend present groundwater resources. Especially at small utilities, groundwater is often supplied without treatment. Despite generally good water quality, microbial contamination has occurred, principally by norovirus and Campylobacter, with larger outbreaks resulting from sewage contamination, cross-connections into drinking water supplies, heavy rainfall events, and ingress of polluted surface water to groundwater.

It focused on microbial water pollution in low-income regions. Risk factors for faecal contamination of groundwater-fed drinking-water sources were evaluated in a case study in Juba, South Sudan. The study was based on counts of thermotolerant coliforms in water samples from 129 sources, collected by the humanitarian aid organisation M,decins Sans FrontiSres in 2010. The factors included hydrogeological settings, land use and socio-economic characteristics. The results showed that the residuals of a conventional probit regression model had a significant positive spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 3.05, I-stat = 9.28); therefore, a spatial model was developed that had better goodness-of-fit to the observations. The most significant factor in this model (p-value 0.005) was the distance from a water source to the nearest Tukul area, an area with informal settlements that lack sanitation services. It is thus recommended that future remediation and monitoring efforts in the city be concentrated in such low-income regions. The spatial model differed from the conventional approach: in contrast with the latter case, lowland topography was not significant at the 5% level, as the p-value was 0.074 in the spatial model and 0.040 in the traditional model. This study showed that statistical risk-factor assessments of groundwater contamination need to consider spatial interactions when the water sources are located close to each other. Future studies might further investigate the cut-off distance that reflects spatial autocorrelation. Particularly, these results advise research on urban groundwater quality.

Urban groundwater quality in sub-Saharan Africa: current status and implications for water security and public health	HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL												Groundwater resources are important sources of drinking water in Africa, and they are hugely important in sustaining urban livelihoods and supporting a diverse range of commercial and agricultural activities. Groundwater has an important role in improving health in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). An estimated 250 million people (40% of the total) live in urban centres across SSA. SSA has experienced a rapid expansion in urban populations since the 1950s, with increased population densities as well as expanding geographical coverage. Estimates suggest that the urban population in SSA will double between 2000 and 2030. The quality status of shallow urban groundwater resources is often very poor due to inadequate waste management and source protection, and poses a significant health risk to users, while deeper borehole sources often provide an important source of good quality drinking water. Given the growth in future demand from this finite resource, as well as potential changes in future climate in this region, a detailed understanding of both water quantity and quality is required to use this resource sustainably. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the water quality status, both microbial and chemical, of urban groundwater in SSA across a range of hydrogeological terrains and different groundwater point types. Lower storage basement terrains, which underlie a significant proportion of urban centres in SSA, are particularly vulnerable to contamination. The relationship between mean nitrate concentration and intrinsic aquifer pollution risk is assessed for urban centres across SSA. Current knowledge gaps are identified and future research needs highlighted.

The sediment samples were collected from plots treated with different amounts of a single N fertilizer (urea supplied at 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 g/kg (nitrogen content in sediment) and different forms of N fertilizers (urea, (NH4)(2)SO4, and NH4NO3, each supplied at 0.2 g/kg (calculated by nitrogen). The fertilizers were applied 1-4 times during the plant-growing season in May, July, August, and September of 2013. Untreated plots were included as a control. The results showed that both the amount and form of N positively influenced microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass nitrogen, and bacterial abundance. The DGGE profiles revealed that the bacterial community composition was also affected by the amount and form of N. Thus, our findings indicate that short-term N amendment increases microbial biomass and bacterial abundance, and alters the structure of bacterial community.																	0253-505X	1869-1099				JUN	2017	36	6					80	88		10.1007/s13131-017-1048-5								WOS:000401505800009

Warming of Central European lakes and their response to the 1980s climate regime shift	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) are sensitive to atmospheric warming and have previously been shown to respond to regional changes in the climate. Using a combination of in situ and simulated surface temperatures from 20 Central European lakes, with data spanning between 50 and similar to 100 years, we investigate the long-term increase in annually averaged LSWT. We demonstrate that Central European lakes are warming most in spring and experience a seasonal variation in LSWT trends. We calculate significant LSWT warming during the past few decades and illustrate, using a sequential t test analysis of regime shifts, a substantial increase in annually averaged LSWT during the late 1980s, in response to an abrupt shift in the climate. Surface air temperature measurements from 122 meteorological stations situated throughout Central Europe demonstrate similar increases at this time. Climatic modification of LSWT has numerous consequences for water quality and lake ecosystems. Quantifying the response of LSWT increase to large-scale and abrupt climatic shifts is essential to understand how lakes will respond in the future.

Improved water quality and clarity promote growth of benthic algae, which with submerged plants may limit sediment phosphorus (P) release, thereby reinforce lake recovery. Our study sought to evaluate the effect of such a biomanipulation on water quality, benthic algal development and sediment P release in a shallow, tropical lake by (1) comparing porewater and lake water quality, light intensity and benthic algal development in restored and unrestored sections; (2) conducting a P-32 radiotracer experiment to track P release from sediment cores sampled from both sections. The biomanipulation led to lower total P, total dissolved P, and soluble reactive P concentrations in lake water, lower phytoplankton biomass, and increased light intensity at sediment surface, stimulating benthic algal development. Moreover, sediment P-32 release was lower in the restored than unrestored section. Concurrently, dissolved oxygen levels in upper layers of the sediment cores were higher in the restored section. Our study indicates that the biomanipulation improved water quality and enhanced growth of benthic algae, thereby reducing sediment P release, which may be one of the main mechanisms to create successful restoration.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					49	57		10.1007/s10750-016-3079-x								WOS:000401474400004						
J	Tonetta, D; Staehr, PA; Petrucio, MM				Tonetta, Denise; Staehr, Peter Anton; Petrucio, Mauricio Mello			Changes in CO2 dynamics related to rainfall and water level variations in a subtropical lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We investigated the implications of low rainfall and reduced water level for changes in nutrients and chlorophyll-a in a subtropical lake, and how these changes affected levels and atmospheric fluxes of CO2. Based on nine consecutive years of monthly monitoring of pH, alkalinity, oxygen, and temperature, we calculated the pCO(2) and CO2 flux and related these to environmental drivers. Variations in annual rainfall, with extreme low levels along 2012-2014 caused the water level to decrease up to 1 m. Low water levels were associated with higher concentrations of chlorophyll-a and organic carbon as well as reduced water transparency. Under these conditions, pCO(2) increased and the lake was predominantly a source of CO2 to the atmosphere. Applying a generalized linear model, we found that water temperature, water column stability, and water level were linked to pCO(2). The influences of predicted regional changes in rainfall associated with low water levels will according to our model further deteriorate the water quality and enhance CO2 emissions from the lake to the atmosphere.

Knowledge of patterns of macrophyte space occupation and time to recovery is poor and mostly restricted to free floating species or riparian vegetation. Here we use pre- and post-impact monitoring data over 20 years showing the evolution of submersed aquatic vegetation of lake Baciver (Pyrenees), and develop models to infer space occupation and time to recovery. We use pre-impact macrophyte distribution in relation to bathymetry-derived data to fit logistic models to further simulate lake equilibrium scenarios. Depth and slope were found to be the best predictors, and models suggested that an assemblage dominated by Sparganium angustifolium was, at time of this study, over 95% of its potential distribution area. A dense, newly grown monospecific Isoetes lacustris population occupied < 10% of its potential area and model projections suggest that it will take decades to recover. An I. lacustris residual population remains below the estimated depth threshold for survival and is bound to disappear. The lake appears to evolve towards a new steady-state where the current lake hypsography promotes the expansion of algae (Nitella sp.) over angiosperms.

The effect of channelization on the biological quality of lowland streams using macroinvertebrates as proxies	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We studied whether and how channelization affects macroinvertebrate communities and biological quality in lowland streams of Estonia (Northern Europe). Two datasets of semi-quantitative samples (collected during 2001-2010) were used: (1) pairwise data (natural sites located upstream of the channelized sites; 22 streams, 24 pairs), and (2) background data (73 natural sites from 62 streams, 73 channelized sites from 62 streams). The mean stream order in both datasets was 3. Channelization had no significant effects on physicochemical parameters or on macroinvertebrates in the pairwise dataset where channelization was done decades earlier. However, it had several negative effects on macroinvertebrates in the background dataset where several areas had probably been maintained more recently. Richness of sensitive data, Shannon diversity, mean sensitivity, organic pollution index, and multimetric quality were significantly lower for the modified sites than for the natural sites. Only total taxon richness and score of hydromorphology were not significantly affected by channelization. Thus, several macroinvertebrate metrics that indicate water pollution, proved to be sensitive to channelization as well. The recovery conditions (such as stream type, channelization season, recovering duration, etc.) have been poorly studied and would deserve further attention.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					167	177		10.1007/s10750-017-3091-9								WOS:000401474400012

Discharge-driven flood and seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass and composition of an Australian tropical savannah river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Discharge is a primary determinant of river phytoplankton, but its influence can be mediated by climate, water quality and catchment development. The relationship between discharge and phytoplankton over seasonal and flood temporal scales was examined for the Daly River in the Australian tropical savannah. Phytoplankton, water quality and hydrographic data were collected over the high-discharge wet season and lower-discharge dry season. Wet season main channel river conditions were unfavourable for phytoplankton growth. Floods, however, connected the main channel to off-channel water bodies that supplied phytoplankton, predominately Cryptomonas, to the river. Wet season phytoplankton biovolume and cell concentrations were higher than in the dry season and comprised the majority of the annual phytoplankton biomass load. High discharges served to both temporally connect the river to off-channel phytoplankton sources as well as dilute these sources. In the dry season, the Daly River was groundwater-fed and disconnected from off-channel phytoplankton sources and dominated by a potamoplanktonic population of Cryptomonas and Peridinium. River phytoplankton were determined by the seasonal discharge regime which drove water quality and underpinned a shift from highly productive, spatially extensive off-channel sources in the wet season to less productive more spatially confined in-channel sources in the dry season.

Improvements in water quality in developed countries have reignited debate about the limitations of family-level taxonomy to detect subtle change, and is resulting in a shift back towards generic and species-level analysis to assess smaller effects. Although the scale of pollution characterizing past condition of streams in developed countries persists in many developing regions, some areas are still considered to be only moderately disturbed. We sampled streams in Belize to investigate the ability of family-level macroinvertebrate metrics to detect change in stream catchments where less than 30% of forest had been cleared. Where disturbance did not co-vary with natural gradients of change, and in areas characterized by low intensity activities, none of the metrics tested detected significant change, despite evidence of environmental impacts. We highlight the need for further research to clarify the response of metrics to disturbance over a broader study area that allows replication for confounding sources of natural variation. We also recommend research to develop more detailed understanding of the taxonomy and ecology of Neotropical macroinvertebrates to improve the robustness of metric use.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					257	271		10.1007/s10750-017-3100-z								WOS:000401474400017						
J	Piepho, M				Piepho, Maike			Assessing maximum depth distribution, vegetated area, and production of submerged macrophytes in shallow, turbid coastal lagoons of the southern Baltic Sea	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Submerged macrophytes improve water quality in shallow coastal lagoons but eutrophication often resulted in a degradation of macrophytes. Management measures that protect and restore macrophyte stands require knowledge on what limits macrophyte distribution. Information on macrophyte production and distribution in the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain (southern Baltic Sea) is lacking since an almost complete loss of submerged vegetation in the 1980s. Nutrient input was reduced in the 1990s and macrophytes seem to recover, although turbidity is high and light conditions are still poor. However, this recovery raised hope that returning macrophytes could stabilize sediments and improve water clarity. In this study, seasonal changes in photosynthesis-irradiance curves of selected macrophyte species were used to calculate potential primary production in different depths and turbidity situations. Bathymetry of the area is then used to assess depth distribution and vegetated area. Since the so-calculated depth limits correspond well with the actual depth distribution in the field, macrophyte depth distribution is concluded to be mostly determined by light conditions. Most macrophytes grow in very shallow areas up to 50 cm depth where also 70% of potential primary production takes place. Present light conditions do not support a further expansion of macrophyte distribution in the DZBC.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					303	316		10.1007/s10750-017-3107-5								WOS:000401474400020

Exploiting the chance provided by the specific hybrid bigheaded carp stock in Lake Balaton (Hungary) covering the entire morphological range between the two species (including gill raker morphology), we implemented a comprehensive study (1) to reveal the feeding habits of hybrid bigheaded carps living in a mesotrophic, lacustrine habitat and (2) to assess how biotic and abiotic environmental factors and gill raker morphology affect diet composition. We found that all bigheaded carps utilized primarily zooplankton and neglected the scarce and inefficiently digestible phytoplankton, irrespective of gill raker morphology. Moreover, we observed strikingly high levels of inorganic debris consumption, but the proportion of inorganic matter in the guts was not associated directly with the concentration of suspended inorganic particles. Variance in the diet composition of bigheaded carps was related mostly to environmental factors, including the wind-induced resuspension of inorganic particles and seasonally variable availability of food resources. In conclusion, the effects of abiotic environmental factors and available food resources could overwhelm the effect of gill raker morphology in shaping the feeding habits of bigheaded carps.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	794	1					317	332		10.1007/s10750-017-3137-z								WOS:000401474400021

The physical parameters include total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity. The chemical parameters studied include pH, free carbon dioxide, total hardness, calcium hardness, magnesium hardness, phenolphthalein alkalinity, total alkalinity, biochemical oxygen demand and salinity. The present research was undertaken to monitor the irrigational suitability of this water body over the period of June 2009 to May 2010 by Sodium Absorption Ration (SAR), Magnesium Ratio (MR), Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC), Soluble Sodium Percentage (SSP), Residual Sodium Bicarbonate (RSBC), Kelly's Ratio (KR) and Permeability Index (PI) parameters. The UV-Spectrophotometer determined the concentrations of heavy metals such as iron, zinc, chromium and manganese. The sediments' physico-chemical characteristics like temperature, conductivity, pH, % carbon, organic matter and phosphate have been detected using standard methods. It is observed that the sediments are in a complex milieu with the overlying water in the aquatic ecosystem and they affect water chemistry and get affected by it. The water quality is found to be good and it is therefore safe for irrigation.																	2423-4958	2345-4806				SUM	2017	5	3					315	337										WOS:000433445300011

Study focus: The effects of that drainage on river and coastal area ecosystems remain unclear. We evaluated the impact of the hot spring drainage on fish communities near the estuary. New hydrological insights: Factor analysis results obtained using water quality data show that the scale of the hot spring drainage influence on rivers differs among rivers. The inflow of hot spring drainage into the rivers affects phytoplankton more than the inflow of domestic drainage, which increases the amount of phytoplankton. Furthermore, hot spring drainage creates a better habitat for Nile tilapia, a foreign species, by increasing food availability and water temperature. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Sources and spatial variability of groundwater-delivered nutrients in Maunalua Bay, O'ahu, Hawaii	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Maunalua Bay, Oahu, Hawai'i. Study focus: We examined submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), terrestrial groundwater, and nearshore marine water quality in two adjacent aquifers (Waialae East and Waialae West) with differing land-use and hydrogeologic characteristics to better understand the sources and spatial variability of SGD-conveyed nutrients. Nutrient concentrations and NO3- stable isotope ratios were measured and integrated with SGD flux, land-use, and recharge data to examine SGD nutrient loads and potential sources in each aquifer. New hydrological insights for the region: Regionally elevated NO3- concentrations (166171 mu M) and delta N-15-NO3- values (10.4-10.9%.) were apparent in SGD in the Waialae West Aquifer, an area with high on-site disposal system density (e.g., cesspools). Coastal sites sampled in the neighboring Waialae East Aquifer exhibited significantly lower values for these parameters, with delta N-15-NO3- values ranging from 5.7-5.9%. and NO3- concentrations from 43-69 mu M. The isotopic composition of NO3- in SGD originating from the Waialae West Aquifer was consistent with wastewater. Modeled recharge data corroborated the NO3- stable isotope source designation. SGD emanating from Waialae West Aquifer was primarily influenced by two-component mixing of a wastewater source with low nutrient groundwater as wastewater effluent accounted for more than 4% of total recharge and 54-95% of total N and P loads in the aquifer.

Study focus: Water security is central to decision-making within a water-energy nexus. In areas where energy resources, such as shale gas, are undergoing rapid development, water security and the associated risks to water quality and quantity are of paramount concern. However, in many regions there is a lack of understanding and data on the hydrologic system, particularly its vulnerability to hazards. The data and knowledge gap poses challenges for effective regulation of the shale gas activities and management of water resources. This paper describes initiatives that are addressing concerns surrounding water security in Northeast British Columbia. New hydrological insights for the region: Initiatives and tools enhancing water security in the region include strategic partnerships and stakeholder collaborations, policy and regulation development, and data collection and distribution efforts. The contributions and limitations of each of these are discussed. A vulnerability mapping framework is presented which addresses data gaps and provides a tool for decision-making surrounding risk to water quality from various hazards. An example vulnerability assessment was conducted for wastewater transport along pipeline and trucking corridors. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies that assess the advances of diffuse pollution modeling and studies of trace diffuse pollutants have been conducted. The adaption and development of imported model systems based on local observations and climatic features have improved study skills and presented unique characteristics. In addition to traditional diffuse pollutants (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), modeling trace heavy metals and pesticide also provides insights for watershed management. We reviewed existing literature on diffuse pollution model applications and developments in China, attempting to provide a better understanding of the advances of diffuse pollution and new research directions for pollution modeling. Diverse methods have been adopted to express diffuse pollution formation, transport and environmental impacts using modeling as an effective tool for developing management guidelines in China. Model applications at different temporal-spatial scales, development of diffuse pollution modeling for emerging pollutants, and impacts of diffuse pollution on water quality in China were analyzed. Pollution loading decreased from east to west, coinciding with farmland distributions, tillage intensity, and economic levels. The temporal patterns of pollution loading have increased in recent decades due to increased fertilizer additions and climate warming which has put more pressure on water quality. This analysis indicated that enhancing existing models, with more field observations, is key for future diffuse pollution studies of trace organic pollutants and heavy metals. Establishing national databases and validating standard model parameters are essential and currently weak points at the national scale with respect to diffuse pollution modeling. Diffuse pollution has become a challenging issue in watershed management, and agricultural diffuse pollution poses the greatest risk to watershed management in China. However, the mechanisms involved in trace pollutant transport and the environmental consequences of these pollutants are largely unknown in China, where complicated tillage methods are used and climatic conditions vary throughout the country. Accumulated field observations at diverse temporal-spatial scales are important to accurately model and perform water risk assessments.																	1439-0108	1614-7480				JUN	2017	17	6					1527	1536		10.1007/s11368-017-1688-2								WOS:000401436200001

Atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS or FAAS) allowed for measurements during the 18-month certification process. ETAAS or ICP optical emission spectrometry was used for 24-month post-certification monitoring measurements. CRM production took into account requirements of ISO Guides 34 and 35 for production of reference materials and criteria of the JCGM GUM and Eurachem QUAM Guides for uncertainty calculation. Mass fractions chosen for batch gravimetric preparation were based on the maximum permissible limits of the National Regulation for Drinking Water Quality in Peru. Characterization analytical measurements were performed using the bracketing calibration technique, applying a randomized 10-replicate measurement sequence and adjusting (matrix matching) the nitric acid concentration for all measured solutions. Characterization resulted from the combination of gravimetric preparation and analytical atomic absorption measurement results. Main sources of uncertainty were identified from the homogeneity study, characterization and the stability study. Expanded relative uncertainties for the assigned mass fractions (ng/g) of Pb, Cd, Ni, As, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mn and Al in the CRM produced were between 0.8 % and 1.9 %. INACAL's capability to achieve the stated uncertainties has been confirmed through successfully participating in a comparison of the Inter-American Metrology System (SIM-QM-S2). All declared results (ETAAS and FAAS) were comparable to those declared by primary methods of other participants in this comparison.

Evaluation of DRAINMOD-DSSAT simulated effects of controlled drainage on crop yield, water balance, and water quality for a corn-soybean cropping system in central Iowa	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Controlled drainage (CD) has been identified as a sustainable management practice whereby more soil water can be conserved and less nutrients are leached; alongside its potential benefit of alleviating drought stress and increasing yield. More than 12 million hectare of cropland in the US Midwest are suitable for implementing CD; however, the effectiveness of the practice can vary across the region with the variation in environmental conditions and management practices. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the integrated agro-ecosystem model; DRAINMOD-DSSAT, for simulating the effects of CD on drainage flow, nitrogen losses via drainage water and crop yield. Herein, we utilized a 4-yr dataset (2006-2009) that was collected from a corn-soybean cropping system near Story City, Iowa. This site was artificially drained under free drainage (FD) and CD treatments. The model was calibrated using the data collected from the FD plots, and validated for the CD plots. DRAINMOD-DSSAT predictions of drainage flow and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) losses were in good agreement with measured values under FD and CD, with the former treatment showed slightly better performance. The modeling efficiencies (NSE's) for simulating monthly drainage flows were 0.81 and 0.60 for FD and CD, respectively. Monthly NO3-N mass losses were simulated with NSE's of 0.76 and 0.66 for FD and CD, respectively. DRAINMOD-DSSAT well simulated CD-induced percent reductions in annual drainage flow (measured = 24.6%, simulated = 27.1%), and NO3-N losses (measured = 34.8%, simulated = 33.5%). Low percent error (PE) values were associated with the model predictions of corn yields (-1.3 <= PE <= 1.3) and soybean yields (-6.0 <= PE <= 12.6). Overall, results obtained from this relatively short-term modeling study demonstrated the potential use of DRAINMOD-DSSAT as a management design tool. Yet, further model testing CD effectiveness under different conditions is critically needed to establish a higher credibility in model predictions and to allow for further model improvement and expansion.

Seasonal water quality changes in on-farm water storage systems in a south-central US agricultural watershed	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The objective of this study was to investigate the ability of on-farm water storage (OFWS) systems to mitigate off-site nutrient movement in a south-central U.S. agricultural watershed. We examined the seasonal water quality changes in an OFWS system by measuring several physical and chemical constituents at multiple sampling points throughout the system. Water quality sampling occurred every three weeks during the growing season and every six weeks during the dormant season from February 2012 to December 2014. The collected data were grouped into four seasons and then analyzed using boxplots along with the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests for detecting changes in nutrient concentrations. Significant water quality changes were observed in the OFWS system by season and nutrient species, indicating a variation in downstream nutrient reduction with season. The in-ditch median removal efficiency, from the center of the tailwater recovery ditch to the outlet, was 54% during winter and 50% during spring for NO3-N; 60% during spring for NH3-N; 26% during autumn and 65% during winter for ortho-P; and 31% during winter and 10% during spring for TP. The in-pond median concentration removal efficiency was similar to 77% during summer for NO3-N, while the concentration remained stable during winter, spring and autumn; 53% from winter to spring and 58% from spring to summer for NH3-N; 70% from winter to spring for ortho-P, while remaining stable during the other seasons; and 28% from winter to spring and 55% from spring to summer for TP. Our results support the hypothesis that OFWS systems could mitigate downstream nutrient-enrichment pollution, especially during spring. The results obtained from this study offer a better insight into the behavior of OFWS systems and help enhance the management of agroecosystems from an ecological and hydrological perspective for water quality pollution control and water resource conservation.

The Celone, a temporary river case study	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												In a catchmnent, nitrogen (N) export from terrestrial ecosystems to rivers is controlled by the hydrological processes and N balance. In the present paper, the soil system N budget and riverine export were quantified in a Mediterranean watershed, the Celone (South-East, Italy). The study area (72 km(2)) consists of agricultural land (70%) and deciduous forests with three small residential areas. Major N inputs derived from fertilizers and animal manure, corresponding for the whole watershed area to 68 and 12 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. N input from point sources was 1% of total input and atmospheric depositions measured in a gauging station near the study area was quantified in similar to 6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Crop N uptake was the main N output from agricultural land; it was estimated in similar to 37 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) by using data on crop yields provided by local farmers. Total flux of N in surface water was quantified for a year at the outlet of the study area by using continuous measures of flow and discrete measures of N concentrations carried out with a different frequency during the normal and low flow and when floods occurred. The hydrological regime of the stream, which is a temporary river, plays an important role in N transport. Water quality was found to vary considerably through the year in terms of both nutrient concentrations and loads. Riverine N export was quantified in 41% of total N input, and it was mainly transported during flood events, similar to 60% of the annual load was delivered during floods occurred in 38 days. Organic nitrogen and nitrate were the main N forms in surface water, and the contribution per hectare was about 24 and 14kg N, respectively. On a yearly basis, the difference between N inputs and outputs including riverine export was estimated in about 4 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) for the whole watershed area. This amount partly accumulates in soils in different N forms and the remaining part, mainly in form of nitrate, percolates through unsaturated soil towards groundwater. This study reports an important analysis of N pollution in a Mediterranean watershed with a temporary river system and limited data availability. Data acquisition and handling have proved to be an important challenge to overcome in N balance quantification. The results and the methodology of the present work can be useful for understanding nitrogen loss dynamics and for functional water management and land use planning. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Microbial diversity is commonly used as a bioindicator of ecosystems functioning. However, there is a lack of sensitivity of microbial diversity indicators in the case of moderate and chronic environmental degradation, such as atmospheric deposition of pollutants, agricultural practices, diffuse pollution by wastewater and climate change. As a consequence, there is a need for alternative bioindicators of soils and water quality. Here, we discuss the interest of adopting a more integrative approach based on biotic interaction networks beyond the simple diversity indicators. We review how the various biotic interactions can be integrated in the various microbial networks such as trophic, mutualistic and co-occurrence networks. Then we discuss the efficiency of microbial networks and associated metrics to detect changes in microbial communities. We conclude that the connectance, the number of links and the average degree of co-occurrence networks could vary from 10 to 50% in response to minor perturbations when microbial diversity parameters remain stable. Finally, we analyze studies that aimed at linking microbial networks and activity to evaluate the potential of such networks for providing simple and operational indicators of ecosystem quality and functioning.

The framework conceptualizes GI practices using blocks (spatial features) and connectors (interfaces) representing functional components of a GI. The blocks represent spatial features with the ability to store water (e.g., pond, soil, benthic sediments, manhole, or a generic storage zone) and water quality constituents including chemical constituents and particles. The hydraulic module can solve a combination of Richards equation, kinematic/diffusive wave, Darcy, and other user-provided flow models. The particle transport module is based on performing mass-balance on particles in different phases, e.g., mobile and deposited in soil with constitutive theories controlling their transport, settling, deposition, and release. The reactive transport modules allow constituents to be in dissolved, sorbed, bound to particles, and undergo user-defined transformations. Four applications of the modeling framework are presented that demonstrate its flexibility for simulating urban GI performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Improved validation framework and R-package for artificial neural network models	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Validation is a critical component of any modelling process. In artificial neural network (ANN) modelling, validation generally consists of the assessment of model predictive performance on an independent validation set (predictive validity). However, this ignores other aspects of model validation considered to be good practice in other areas of environmental modelling, such as residual analysis (replicative validity) and checking the plausibility of the model in relation to a priori system understanding (structural validity). In order to address this shortcoming, a validation framework for ANNs is introduced in this paper that covers all of the above aspects of validation. In addition, the validann R-package is introduced that enables these validation methods to be implemented in a user-friendly and consistent fashion. The benefits of the framework and R-package are demonstrated for two environmental modelling case studies, highlighting the importance of considering replicative and structural validity in addition to predictive validity.

An adjoint-based numerical method has been developed to determine the optimal placement of chlorine sensors in drinking water networks at a low computational cost. From a practical engineering perspective, the proposed optimal placement corresponds to the set of sensors that minimizes the area in which the unknown model parameters cannot be identified. The numerical strategy is implemented in the hydraulic software EPANET. Using the adjoint framework, we develop and apply an adaptive strategy in a French drinking water network that provides the optimal placement from 1 sensor to 6 sensors. We show that the highest reduction of the non-identifiable area is obtained at the first stages of the adaptive strategy. After 4 sensors, a plateau is reached. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Input variable selection with a simple genetic algorithm for conceptual species distribution models: A case study of river pollution in Ecuador	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Species distribution models (SDMs) have received increasing attention in freshwater management to support decision making. Existing SDMs are mainly data-driven and often developed with statistical and machine learning methods but with little consideration of hypothetic ecological knowledge. Conceptual SDMs exist, but lack in performance, making them less interesting for decision management. Therefore, there is a need for model identification tools that search for alternative model formulations. This paper presents a methodology, illustrated with the example of river pollution in Ecuador, using a simple genetic algorithm (SGA) to identify well performing SDMs by means of an input variable selection (IVS). An analysis for 14 macroinvertebrate taxa shows that the SGA is able to identify well performing SDMs. It is observed that uncertainty on the model structure is relatively large. The developed tool can aid model developers and decision makers to obtain insights in driving factors shaping the species assemblage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Geochemical Characteristics and Groundwater Quality in the Vientiane Plain, Laos	EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												Groundwater from the shallow aquifers of the Vientiane Plain, Laos is used for domestic needs including to some extent for drinking and for household gardening. The objective of this study is to assess the groundwater quality for drinking and irrigation activities and to determine the processes that lead to the presence of major ions in groundwater. Twenty groundwater samples were collected from a village on the Plain in December 2014, January 2015, and May 2015, and analysed for major ions and selected suite of minor ions and heavy metals. Groundwater is largely acidic, fresh and soft in nature. Geochemistry showed dominant Ca-Mg-HCO3 and mixed Ca-Na-HCO3 groundwater. Sodium impacts the suitability of water for irrigation to some extent. Hydrogeochemical processes identified and verified through factor analysis indicate weathering, carbonate dissolution, ion exchange, and anthropogenic sources including salinisation, due to irrigation and use of fertilizers as sources for the occurrence of major ions at such concentrations in this area. Only concentrations of lead and iron were above the permissible limits with arsenic, copper, zinc, mercury, and uranium found to be within safe limits. Background sample (groundwater) collected 5 km from the study area and the bottled water sample were all within suitable limits for drinking. This study is the first to provide a local-level assessment of geochemical processes in groundwater of this area indicating that the groundwater does not pose any threat to human health if used for drinking based on major ions, minor ions and a suite heavy metals except for iron and lead.

Incorporation of wastes by native species during and after an experimental aquaculture operation	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Freshwater aquaculture increases dissolved and particulate nutrients near fish cages, but the degree to which they are incorporated into tissues of native animals is uncertain. At the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada, a cage culture of Rainbow Trout was operated seasonally for 5 y, and invertebrates and fishes were collected before, during, and after culturing from the experimental lake and a reference lake to assess changes in stable isotopes of C and N in their tissues. The feed contained marine fishmeal and was higher in C and N isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) than lake biota by >= 4 parts per thousand (all taxa) and 3 parts per thousand (all invertebrates), respectively. During the aquaculture operation, delta N-15 of littoral and pelagic invertebrates, profundal chironomids, minnows, and Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) increased by 2 to 5 parts per thousand relative to before aquaculture values. In the 1(st) and 2(nd) years after aquaculture, delta N-15 of several invertebrate taxa and all fishes continued to increase 1 to 2 parts per thousand/y. In contrast, during aquaculture, only minnows and trout had significant increases (up to 3 parts per thousand) in delta C-13. In the period after aquaculture, the delta C-13 of fishes, plankton, and profundal chironomids declined to below values measured before or during aquaculture. Isotopic analysis of native biota can be used to monitor assimilation of cage culture wastes in freshwater ecosystems.

Calibration of the biological condition gradient in Minnesota streams: a quantitative expert-based decision system	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												The Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) is a conceptual model that describes changes in aquatic communities with increasing levels of anthropogenic stress. The gradient represented by the BCG has been divided into 6 levels of condition that biologists consider readily discernible in most areas of North America. We developed quantitative BCG models for 7 warm-water stream types in Minnesota for both fish and macroinvertebrates. Panels of aquatic biologists calibrated the general BCG model to Minnesota streams by assigning test samples (271 macroinvertebrate and 288 fish samples) to BCG Levels 1 to 6. From the panelists' descriptions of their criteria for assigning sites to levels, a set of quantitative operational rules was developed for performing the same task. We developed a decision model based on fuzzy-set theory to account for discontinuities and to identify when BCG assignments might be intermediate between adjacent levels. This model captures the consensus professional judgment of the panel and uses panel-derived rules. Decisions based on the quantitative model for macroinvertebrates exactly matched 77% of the panel decisions, 89% within 1/2 BCG level, and 100% within 1 BCG level. Decisions based on the quantitative fish model exactly matched 70% of the panel decisions, 86% within 1/2 BCG level, and 99% within 1 BCG level. The BCG provides a tool to interpret aquatic biological condition along a gradient of naturalness and is consistent across stream types and political boundaries. It includes documentation of baselines to prevent inadvertent shifting, and the BCG logic rules are transparent, a desirable property for communicating condition, management goals, and water-quality criteria.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN	2017	36	2					427	451		10.1086/691712								WOS:000401114200015

Thus, the concept of "censoring'' and censoring types was handled in the first place. Then substitution, parametric (MLE), nonparametric (KM), and semi-parametric (ROS) methods were introduced for the evaluation of left-censored observations. Within the scope of the present study, the data were produced uncensored based on the different parameters of each distribution. Then the datasets were left-censored at the ratios of 5, 25, 45, and 65 %. The censored data were estimated through substitution (LOD and LOD/root 2), parametric (MLE), semiparametric (ROS), and nonparametric (KM) methods. In addition, evaluation was made by increasing the sample size from 20 to 300 by tens. Performance comparison was made between the uncensored dataset and the censored dataset on the basis of deviations from the median, the mean, and the SD. The results of simulation studies show that LOD/root 2 and ROS methods give better results than other methods in deviation from the mean in different sample sizes and at different censoring rates, while ROS gives better results than other methods in deviation from the median in almost all sample sizes and at almost all censoring rates.																	1913-2751	1867-1462				JUN	2017	9	2					153	172		10.1007/s12539-015-0132-9								WOS:000401323800001	26590921

Global model fitting to compare survival curves for faecal indicator bacteria and ruminant-associated genetic markers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims: To compare decay profiles of ruminant-and cattle-associated molecular markers for faecal contamination and Escherichia coli, facilitating their correct application in water quality studies. Methods and Results: We generated decay profiles for cultivable E. coli, a general Bacteroidales genetic marker (GenBac3), ruminant markers (CF128, Rum2Bac) and cattle markers (CowM2, CowM3) using faeces-seeded mesocosms, and selected best fitting models for each decay profile. Global model fitting tested for differences between decay profiles. After normalizing for initial concentration, decay curves differed significantly between E. coli and all genetic markers except CowM3. Decay curves for CF128 differed from GenBac3 and Rum2Bac, but Rum2Bac and GenBac3 decay profiles did not differ. Despite similar survival profiles for some markers, highly varied initial concentrations affected time to nondetection. Conclusions: Decay curves and time until nondetection differed among markers from the same host. However, the Rum2Bac and GenBac3 markers had similar decay profiles and could potentially be investigated further for source allocation using the ratio method. Significance and Impact of the Study: As the use of genetic markers for microbial source tracking becomes increasingly common, caution is necessary. Both the shape of decay curves and time to nondetect may differ depending on the marker selected, resulting in possible misinterpretation of results and precluding application of a 'ratio method' of source allocation.

Water Quality Survey of Splash Pads After a Waterborne Salmonellosis Outbreak-Tennessee, 2014	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Waterborne outbreaks of salmonellosis are uncommon. The Tennessee Department of Health investigated a salmonellosis outbreak of 10 cases with the only common risk factor being exposure to a single splash pad. Risks included water splashed in the face at the splash pad and no free residual chlorine in the water system. We surveyed water quality and patron behaviors at splash pads statewide. Of the 29 splash pads participating in the water quality survey, 24 (83%) used a recirculating water system. Of the 24, 5 (21%) water samples were tested by polymerase chain reaction and found to be positive for E. coli, Giardia, norovirus, or Salmonella. Among 95 patrons observed, we identified common high-risk behaviors of sitting on the fountain or spray head and putting mouth to water. Water venue regulations and improved education of patrons are important to aid prevention efforts.																	0022-0892					JUN	2017	79	10					8	12										WOS:000401303700002	29154527

Experimental comparison of point-of-use filters for drinking water ultrafiltration	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION												Background: Waterborne pathogens such as Pseudomonas spp. and Legionella spp. may persist in hospital water networks despite chemical disinfection. Point-of-use filtration represents a physical control measure that can be applied in high-risk areas to contain the exposure to such pathogens. New technologies have enabled an extension of filters' lifetimes and have made available faucet hollow-fibre filters for water ultrafiltration. Aim: To compare point-of-use filters applied to cold water within their period of validity. Methods: Faucet hollow-fibre filters (filter A), shower hollow-fibre filters (filter B) and faucet membrane filters (filter C) were contaminated in two different sets of tests with standard bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 939 and Brevundimonas diminuta ATCC 19146) and installed at points-of-use. Every day, from each faucet, 100 L of water was flushed. Before and after flushing, 250 mL of water was collected and analysed for microbiology. Findings: There was a high capacity of microbial retention from filter C; filter B released only low Brevundimonas spp. counts; filter A showed poor retention of both microorganisms. Conclusion: Hollow-fibre filters did not show good micro-organism retention. All point-of-use filters require an appropriate maintenance of structural parameters to ensure their efficiency.

J	Constantin, S; Constantinescu, S; Doxaran, D				Constantin, Sorin; Constantinescu, Stefan; Doxaran, David			Long-term analysis of turbidity patterns in Danube Delta coastal area based on MODIS satellite data	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The monitoring of coastal areas is becoming an urgent necessity in the context of increased pressure over these ecosystems due to climate change and human activities. Long term evaluation of specific parameters regarding water quality can now be achieved, thanks to the increased number of archived Earth Observation satellite data, now covering decades. Within this study, 12 years of MODIS information were used to compute surface water turbidity products that were further temporal binned into composite datasets (e.g. monthly, annual). A regional algorithm, based on local in situ measurements, was used in order to inverse remote sensing reflectance values into turbidity units. The interpretation of the final maps revealed important characteristics of the processes that play a major role in the regional turbidity dynamics. Observations were made regarding the relation between surface water turbidity and Danube River's discharge rates, winds, currents and also the bottom sedimentary characteristics of the shelf area. We discuss how different regions are affected by various external factors, depending on their geographical location, and we reinforce the idea that the river solid input is not the only parameter controlling water clarity in the Danube Delta coastal area, resuspension processes playing also an important role.

The analysis covers two main groups of particles: phytoplankton and non-algal. For this purpose we use the extensive database of optical measurements acquired from 2006 to 2013 during 40 cruises of r/v Oceania in various regions of the southern Baltic: open waters, coastal waters, the Gulf of Gdansk, the Pomeranian Bay and river mouths. Expressions are derived for each of these regions to describe the seasonal variations of the dependence of the light absorption coefficients for phytoplankton a(ph)(440) and non-algal particles a(NAP)(440) on concentrations of chlorophyll a (Tchla) and suspended particulate matter in sea water (SPM). With a knowledge of these dependences, one can determine the overall absorption coefficient for all suspended particles in any part of the Baltic Sea in particular seasons from known Tchla and SPM concentrations using the relationship a(p)(440) = a(ph)(440) + a(NAP)(440) = f(Tchla, SPM). These dependences reflect the characteristics of a study area and season, and their application increases the accuracy of determination of the overall absorption properties of suspended particles and their main constituents as confirmed by statistical error reduction, e.g. standard error factor falls from 1.46 to 1.38. The relationships derived in this work can be applied in the local remote sensing algorithms used for monitoring the southern Baltic. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Silva, CARE; Sternberg, LDL; Davalos, PB; de Souza, FES				Ramos e Silva, Carlos Augusto; Lobo Sternberg, Leonel da Silveira; Davalos, Pablo Bezerra; Soares de Souza, Flavo Elano			The impact of organic and intensive farming on the tropical estuary	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Two marine farm ponds, one practicing the organic method and the other practicing the intensive method of shrimp farming located near the Guaralras estuary (Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil), have the potential of causing eutrophication of the estuary by disposal of excess organic matter and nutrients. Here we report nutrients, chlorophyll concentrations and stable carbon isotope ratios from the respective ponds to access differences in their potential impact on estuary water quality. Total phosphate and chlorophyll-a concentrations of pond water under the organic and intensive management method were different (i.e., 3.39 +/- 0.63 mu M and 17.87 +/- 7.89 mu M for total phosphate and 11.88 +/- 9.91 mu g/L and 64.46 mu g/L for chlorophyll-a, respectively). With the exception of pCO(2), parameters related to carbonate system also showed greater values in the organic pond compared to the intensive pond. Sediment total phosphorus concentrations were: 1.48 +/- 0.13 mg/g for the organic pond and 5.99 +/- 1.30 mg/g for the intensive pond. The mean stable carbon isotopic composition of the shrimp muscle tissues from the organic pond (delta C-13 =-17.1 +/- 0.0 parts per thousand and intensive pond (delta C-13 =-18.2 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) were very similar, despite the fact that, compared to the delta C-13 value shrimp tissue, the feed in the intensive pond had very different carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13 =-25.3 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand). Pond water and sediments from the intensive shrimp farm, by having a higher phosphorus concentration, have a greater potential for causing estuary eutrophication compared to the organic shrimp farm. The small range in carbon isotope ratio between the shrimps from the two types of management indicates that the commercial shrimp feed had little contribution to the biomass of the cultured shrimp in the intensive shrimp pond.

This systematic review evaluates the potential impact of bioenergy buffers on multiple ecosystem services (ES) provision while describing key factors along the biomass supply chain. An Impact Assessment (IA) methodology was adopted to capture the direction and the level of confidence of impact on multiple ES including regulating (climate, water and biodiversity), supporting (soil health) and provisioning services (biomass and energy yield). The IA revealed that the implementation of bioenergy buffers on previous croplands rather than on grasslands sustains long-term provision of multiple ES such as climate, water quality and biodiversity regulation and soil health. Herbaceous buffers were found to be more effective than woody buffers in the provision of multiple ES. Knowledge gaps relative to climate and water quality regulation services were identified for the establishment phase of bioenergy buffers (0-3y). Regarding biomass logistics, the limited operating space for farm machinery was the main shortcoming when comparing bioenergy buffers to large-scale bioenergy plantations. The intra- and inter-farm spatial fragmentation of biomass supply areas may increase environmental costs related to biomass collection and transport operations, but this has not yet been fully tested. Establishing a network of bioenergy buffers increases landscape connectivity and the overall area of ES provision in the agricultural landscape. Payments for ES obtained from bioenergy buffers can ultimately improve the economics of sustainable bioenergy and help achieving environmental goals of EU policies on water, soil and biodiversity protection.

While satellite Earth observation offers great promise to support this need, significant challenges remain in quantifying connections between ecosystem functions, ecosystem services, and human well-being benefits. Here, we provide a framework showing how Earth observation together with socioeconomic information and model -based analysis can support assessments of ecosystem service supply, demand, and benefit, and illustrate this for three services. We argue that the full potential of Earth observation is not yet realized in ecosystem service studies. To provide guidance for priority setting and to spur research in this area, we propose five priorities to advance the capabilities of Earth observation -based monitoring of ecosystem services.

Multiple lines of evidence to identify sewage as the cause of water quality impairment in an urbanized tropical watershed	WATER RESEARCH												Indicator bacteria, which are conventionally used to evaluate recreational water quality, can originate from various non-human enteric and extra-enteric sources, hence they may not be indicative of human health risk nor do they provide information on the sources of contamination. In this study we utilized traditional (enterococci and Escherichia coli) and alternative (Clostridium perfringens) indicator bacteria, F-specific coliphage, molecular markers for microorganisms associated with human sewage (human associated Bacteroides and polyomaviruses), and microbial community analysis tools (16S rRNA gene fragment amplicon sequencing), to identify and evaluate human sewage-related impact in the Manoa watershed in Honolulu, Hawaii. Elevated concentrations of enterococci (geometric mean ranging from 1604 to 2575 CFU 100 mL(-1)) and C perfringens (45-77 CFU 100 mL(-1)) indicated impairment of the urbanized section of the stream, while indicator bacteria concentrations decreased downstream in the tidally influenced Ala Wai Canal. The threshold values triggering water quality violation notifications in Hawaii were exceeded in 33.3-75.0% of samples collected at sites in the urbanized section of Manoa Stream, but were not exceeded in any of the samples collected at an upstream site located in a forested area. Correlation between indicator bacteria concentrations and rainfall amounts was weak to moderate but significant (E. coli R = 0.251, P = 0.009; enterococci R = 0.369, P < 0.001; C. perfringens R = 0.343, P < 0.001), while concentrations of human fecal-associated molecular markers were not significantly correlated with rainfall (human-associated Bacteroides, R = 0.131, P = 0.256; human-associated polyomaviruses, R = 0.213, P = 0.464). Presence of human sewage was confirmed by detection of human associated Bacteroides and human polyomavirus in the urbanized section of Manoa Stream (83.3 -100% and 41.7-66.7% positive samples respectively). It was further confirmed by microbial community analyses which suggested that an average 2.4-3.4% of the total bacterial population in this section was associated with sewage. Microbial community profiles were significantly influenced by rainfall (R-2 = 0.4390, P < 0.001), pH (R-2 = 0.3077, P = 0.006), salinity (R-2 = 0.2614, P = 0.038), and conductivity (R-2 = 0.2676, P = 0.031). Although microbial diversity fluctuated throughout the watershed, it was lower in the impaired section. Leaking sewer systems and illegal cross-connections are implicated in the impairment of the watershed, hence both the sewer and the storm water lines should be routinely inspected. Collectively, our data suggest that information derived from the analysis of microbial communities complements current marker-based microbial source tracking techniques and environmental monitoring programs.

However, even though these elements lead to improved water quality, the water quality may be impacted during its distribution through piped networks due to the processes such as pipe material release, biofilm formation and detachment, accumulation and resuspension of loose deposits. Irregular changes in supply-water quality may cause physiochemical and microbiological de-stabilization of pipe material, biofilms and loose deposits in the distribution system that have been established over decades and may harbor components that cause health or esthetical issues (brown water). Even though it is clearly relevant to customers' health (e.g., recent Flint water crisis), until now, switching of supply-water quality is done without any systematic evaluation. This article reviews the contaminants that develop in the water distribution system and their characteristics, as well as the possible transition effects during the switching of treated water quality by destabilization and the release of pipe material and contaminants into the water and the subsequent risks. At the end of this article, a framework is proposed for the evaluation of potential transition effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Uncertainty analysis for effluent trading planning using a Bayesian estimation-based simulation-optimization modeling approach	WATER RESEARCH												In this study, a Bayesian estimation-based simulation-optimization modeling approach (BESMA) is developed for identifying effluent trading strategies. BESMA incorporates nutrient fate modeling with soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), Bayesian estimation, and probabilistic possibilistic interval programming with fuzzy random coefficients (PPI-FRC) within a general framework. Based on the water quality protocols provided by SWAT, posterior distributions of parameters can be analyzed through Bayesian estimation; stochastic characteristic of nutrient loading can be investigated which provides the inputs for the decision making. PPI-FRC can address multiple uncertainties in the form of intervals with fuzzy random boundaries and the associated system risk through incorporating the concept of possibility and necessity measures. The possibility and necessity measures are suitable for optimistic and pessimistic decision making, respectively. BESMA is applied to a real case of effluent trading planning in the Xiangxihe watershed, China. A number of decision alternatives can be obtained under different trading ratios and treatment rates. The results can not only facilitate identification of optimal effluent-trading schemes, but also gain insight into the effects of trading ratio and treatment rate on decision making. The results also reveal that decision maker's preference towards risk would affect decision alternatives on trading scheme as well as system benefit. Compared with the conventional optimization methods, it is proved that BESMA is advantageous in (i) dealing with multiple uncertainties associated with randomness and fuzziness in effluent-trading planning within a multi source, multi-reach and multi-period context; (ii) reflecting uncertainties existing in nutrient transport behaviors to improve the accuracy in water quality prediction; and (iii) supporting pessimistic and optimistic decision making for effluent trading as well as promoting diversity of decision alternatives.

To explore this, we combined iron-reducing or substrate-limited anaerobic conditions and aerobic pilot-scale reactors directly at a wastewater treatment plant. To investigate the detoxification by these processes, we applied two in vitro bioassays for baseline toxicity (Microtox) and reactive toxicity (AREc32) as well as in vivo bioassays with aquatic model species in two laboratory experiments (Desmodesmus subspicatus, Daphnia magna) and two on-site, flow-through experiments (Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Lumbriculus variegatus). Moreover, we analyzed 31 commonly occurring micropollutants and 10 metabolites. The baseline toxicity of raw wastewater was effectively removed in full-scale and reactor scale activated sludge treatment (>85%), while the oxidative stress response was only partially removed (>61%). A combination of an anaerobic pre-treatment under iron reducing conditions and an aerobic nitrification significantly further reduced the residual in vitro toxicities by 46-60% and outperformed the second combination consisting of an aerobic pre-treatment and an anaerobic post-treatment under substrate limiting conditions (27-43%). Exposure to effluents of the activated sludge treatment did not induce adverse in vivo effects in aquatic invertebrates. Accordingly, no further improvement in water quality could be observed. Compared to that, the removal of persistent micropollutants was increased. However, this observation was restricted to a limited number of compounds and the removal of the sum concentration of all target micropollutants was relative low (14-17%). In conclusion, combinations of strictly anaerobic and aerobic processes significantly enhanced the removal of specific and non-specific in vitro toxicities. Thus, an optimization of biological wastewater treatment can lead to a substantially improved detoxification. These otherwise hidden capacities of a treatment technology can only be uncovered by a complementary biological analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Monitoring UF membrane performance treating surface-groundwater blends: Limitations of FEEM-PARAFAC on the assessment of the organic matter role	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												The decrease of water quantity and quality in water scarcity areas is palliated by improving water treatments with membrane technologies. System performance and efficiency, and then cost, is mainly affected by membrane fouling, which is still not well understood and controlled appropriately. In this study, the influence of content and composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) on a membrane ultrafiltration (UF) stage from a full-scale UF stage in a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) fed with surface water, groundwater (or blends of them) was investigated. Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) was used to characterize and assess DOM changes in water samples Water streams feeding the UF stage showed high variability in DOM content and composition. FEEM-PARAFAC analysis allowed the differentiation of seven different organic components. Additionally to the characterization and monitoring of DOM in the full-scale UF stage, a bench scale UF pilot was run to experimentally correlate the impact of water quality with membrane performance. The experiments included testing synthetic solutions of model foulants (synthetic humic acid and bovine serum albumin) and blends of complex waters. To quantify fouling, the total fouling index (TFI) and the hydraulically irreversible fouling index (HIFI) were calculated for each filtration run. According to the results obtained, the correlation plots between the PARAFAC components and the fouling indices pointed at microbial byproducts (C1) and humic-like components (C2, C4, C5) as the ones showing higher correlations.

Decline of a giant salamander assessed with historical records, environmental DNA and multi-scale habitat data	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Freshwater species are declining rapidly but more complete data are needed for determining the extent and cause(s) of population declines and extirpations. Integrating newer survey techniques, freely available data, and traditional field work may allow for more effective assessment of population decline. We used detailed historical species records and environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods to identify changes in population distribution of a long-lived, imperiled stream salamander, the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis: Cryptobranchidae). We used logistic regression with Bayesian inference to test whether selected environmental variables may be good predictors of hellbender population persistence and extirpation. Hellbenders persisted in only 42% of the 24 historical record sites. The best fit model indicated electrical conductivity (EC) was the strongest predictor of hellbender population persistence (EC<278S/cm) and extirpation. Conductivity was strongly negatively correlated with canopy cover within the total watershed (r=-0.83, n=21, p<0.001) and riparian buffer of the watershed (r=-0.77, n=21, p<0.001). Electrical conductivity tends to increase following deforestation, and may inhibit sperm motility and thus limit recruitment of hellbenders and other aquatic vertebrate species with external fertilisation. By integrating historical data, eDNA, field data, and freely available high resolution remote sensing data, our study design allowed for rapid assessment of predictors of and changes in hellbender distribution over a relatively broad geographic area. This cost- and time-effective approach may be used for evaluating other rare aquatic species.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2017	62	6					967	976		10.1111/fwb.12917								WOS:000400571200001

To predict the consequences of river restoration, biological invasions and water quality change in the taxonomic composition of macroinvertebrate communities in rivers, we extended the mechanistic model Streambugs, which describes growth, respiration and death of interacting taxa under given environmental conditions. The model parameterised with prior knowledge on macroinvertebrate traits had already a reasonable explanatory power for data from restored and unrestored sites in two Swiss rivers. As anticipated, the explanatory power of the model was increased further by incorporation of learning from observations through Bayesian inference. The predictive application of the model to changes in water quality and invasions by alien species indicated the importance of integrative planning of management measures: although invasive species are predicted to be able to colonise restored and unrestored sites and replace native species, both invasion of alien species and subsequent exclusion of native taxa is predicted to be reduced when water quality improves. The unavoidable simplification in the mathematical description of complex interactions in the macroinvertebrate community results in predictions that are uncertain. Our modelling techniques make the best attempt to quantify this uncertainty. Despite the uncertainty that always calls for more research, this study makes a considerable step towards improving our understanding of community structure and supporting river management through mechanistic, predictive modelling of macroinvertebrate communities in rivers under changing environmental conditions.

The Electric catfish Malapterurus electricus was subjected to study the prevalence and mean intensity of parasitic infections throughout the whole year of 2015. Heavy metals accumulation in host fish and parasites were determined in relation to water quality and sediments of two different sites of Lake Manzala (Manzala and Bahr El-Baqar), Egypt. A total of 100 specimens of Electric catfish were collected and examined for the presence of helminth parasites. Two parasite species were recovered and morphologically identified. These were cestoda Electrotaenia malapteruri and nematode Dujardinnascaris malapteruri. Heavy metal analysis in water and sediments showed that measured heavy metals in Bahr El-Baqar were found in risky levels higher than permissible limits and Manzala site. Sediments were found to contain a higher level of metals than water samples. Heavy metals accumulation in recovered parasites and their host were also determined and showed significantly higher concentrations in parasites compared to their host tissues. According to bioconcentration factors, E. malapteruri showed that highest accumulation rate for all recorded elements up to 302. Essential elements like Cu and Fe were found in significantly higher concentrations in D. malapteruri, whereas E. malapteruri accumulated elements Cd, Pb, Ni, Mn, Zn and Ca to a significantly higher degree. Accordingly, the ratios (C-[D. malapteruri]/C-[E. malapteruri]) for most essential elements were higher than 0.5. Therefore, fish cestodes can be regarded as useful bio-indicators more than nematodes when evaluating the environmental pollution of aquatic ecosystems by heavy metals.																	1230-2821	1896-1851				JUN	2017	62	2					319	335		10.1515/ap-2017-0040								WOS:000399820700010	28426422					
J	Mills, J; Gaskell, P; Ingram, J; Dwyer, J; Reed, M; Short, C				Mills, Jane; Gaskell, Peter; Ingram, Julie; Dwyer, Janet; Reed, Matt; Short, Christopher			Engaging farmers in environmental management through a better understanding of behaviour	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES												The United Kingdom's approach to encouraging environmentally positive behaviour has been three-pronged, through voluntarism, incentives and regulation, and the balance between the approaches has fluctuated over time. Whilst financial incentives and regulatory approaches have been effective in achieving some environmental management behavioural change amongst farmers, ultimately these can be viewed as transient drivers without long-term sustainability. Increasingly, there is interest in 'nudging' managers towards voluntary environmentally friendly actions. This approach requires a good understanding of farmers' willingness and ability to take up environmental activities and the influences on farmer behavioural change. The paper aims to provide insights from 60 qualitative farmer interviews undertaken for a research project into farmers' willingness and ability to undertake environmental management, particularly focusing on social psychological insights. Furthermore, it explores farmers' level of engagement with advice and support networks that foster a genuine interest, responsibility and a sense of personal and social norm to sustain high quality environmental outcomes. Two conceptual frameworks are presented for usefully exploring the complex set of inter-relationships that can influence farmers' willingness to undertake environmental management practices. The research findings show how an in-depth understanding of farmer's willingness and ability to adopt environmental management practices and their existing level of engagement with advice and support are necessary to develop appropriate engagement approaches to achieve sustained and durable environmental management.

J	Roesch-McNally, GE; Arbuckle, JG; Tyndall, JC				Roesch-McNally, Gabrielle E.; Arbuckle, J. Gordon; Tyndall, John Charles			What would farmers do? Adaptation intentions under a Corn Belt climate change scenario	AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES												This paper examines farmer intentions to adapt to global climate change by analyzing responses to a climate change scenario presented in a survey given to large-scale farmers (n = 4778) across the US Corn Belt in 2012. Adaptive strategies are evaluated in the context of decision making and farmers' intention to increase their use of three production practices promoted across the Corn Belt: no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage. This paper also provides a novel conceptual framework that bridges a typology of adaptation with concepts that help predict intentionality in behavior change models. This conceptual framework was developed to facilitate examination of adaptive decision making in the context of agriculture. This research effort examines key factors that influence farmers' intentions to increase their use of the practices evaluated given a climate change scenario. Twenty-two covariates are examined across three models developed for no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage. Findings highlight that farmers who believed they should adjust their practices to protect their farm from the negative impacts of increased weather variability were more likely to indicate that they would increase their use of each of the practices in response to climate change. Additionally, visiting with other farmers to observe their practices was positively associated with farmers' intentions to increase their use of the adaptive strategies examined. Farmers who were currently using no-till farming, cover crops, and tile drainage were also more likely to plan to increase their use of these practices in response to increased weather variability associated with climate change. However, farmers who reported high levels of confidence in their current practices were less likely to plan on changing their use of these practices in response to climatic changes.

J	Minnes, S; Vodden, K				Minnes, Sarah; Vodden, Kelly			The capacity gap: Understanding impediments to sustainable drinking water systems in rural Newfoundland and Labrador	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												This article outlines the results of a two-year research project that examined drinking water challenges in rural and small-town Newfoundland and Labrador. A mixed-methods approach was used, including literature review, media scans, a driver-pressure-state-impact-response analysis, policy workshops, community surveys and consultations, case studies and key informant interviews. This interdisciplinary study examined four interrelated components of drinking water systems: source water quality and quantity; water infrastructure and operations; public perception, awareness and demand; and policy and governance. Issues identified include: aging, degrading and inappropriate infrastructure; high disinfectant by-products; use and misuse of chlorine; long-term boil water advisories; use of untreated water sources; and minimal source water protection. As other studies have found elsewhere in Canada, local actors in Newfoundland and Labrador communities of 1000 or fewer often exhibit inadequate technical/human, social, institutional and financial capacity to address their drinking water challenges. New water policies and governance arrangements are needed that emphasize strategic and efficient investments, including the utilization of regional approaches, long-term planning and asset management activities. Furthermore, greater focus is needed on capacity development and the engagement and education of decision makers, staff, the public, and other groups that can help local governments address their drinking water challenges.																	0701-1784	1918-1817				JUN	2017	42	2					163	178		10.1080/07011784.2016.1256232								WOS:000399666600005

We aimed at filling this gap by assessing the relative effects of hydroclimatic and water quality factors on the trait composition of invertebrate assemblages over 30 years in the Middle Loire River (France). Using a priori predictions on the long-term variation of trait-based adaptations over the three decades, we evaluated the ability of invertebrate traits to indicate the effects of warming, discharge reduction and water quality improvement. Hydroclimatic and water quality factors contributed to up to 65% of the variation in trait composition. More than 70% of the initial trait response predictions made according to observed long-term hydroclimatic changes were confirmed. They supported a general climate-induced trend involving adapted resistance and resilience strategies. A partial confounding effect of water quality improvement acting on trophic processes was also highlighted, indicating that improved water quality management can significantly help to reduce some adverse effects of climate change. This trait-based approach can have wider implications for investigating long-term changes driven by multiple, potentially confounded factors, as frequently encountered in the context of global change.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				JUN	2017	23	6					2297	2307		10.1111/gcb.13575								WOS:000400445900015	27873443					
J	Raimonet, M; Cloern, JE				Raimonet, Melanie; Cloern, James E.			Estuary-ocean connectivity: fast physics, slow biology	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Estuaries are connected to both land and ocean so their physical, chemical, and biological dynamics are influenced by climate patterns over watersheds and ocean basins. We explored climate-driven oceanic variability as a source of estuarine variability by comparing monthly time series of temperature and chlorophyll-a inside San Francisco Bay with those in adjacent shelf waters of the California Current System (CCS) that are strongly responsive to wind-driven upwelling. Monthly temperature fluctuations inside and outside the Bay were synchronous, but their correlations weakened with distance from the ocean. These results illustrate how variability of coastal water temperature (and associated properties such as nitrate and oxygen) propagates into estuaries through fast water exchanges that dissipate along the estuary. Unexpectedly, there was no correlation between monthly chlorophyll-a variability inside and outside the Bay. However, at the annual scale Bay chlorophyll-a was significantly correlated with the Spring Transition Index (STI) that sets biological production supporting fish recruitment in the CCS. Wind forcing of the CCS shifted in the late 1990s when the STI advanced 40 days. This shift was followed, with lags of 1-3 years, by 3- to 19-fold increased abundances of five ocean-produced demersal fish and crustaceans and 2.5-fold increase of summer chlorophyll-a in the Bay. These changes reflect a slow biological process of estuary-ocean connectivity operating through the immigration of fish and crustaceans that prey on bivalves, reduce their grazing pressure, and allow phytoplankton biomass to build. We identified clear signals of climate-mediated oceanic variability in this estuary and discovered that the response patterns vary with the process of connectivity and the timescale of ocean variability. This result has important implications for managing nutrient inputs to estuaries connected to upwelling systems, and for assessing their responses to changing patterns of upwelling timing and intensity as the planet continues to warm.

The importance of small waterbodies for biodiversity and ecosystem services: implications for policy makers	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Small waterbodies, including ponds and small lakes, low-order streams, ditches and springs, are the most numerous freshwater environments globally, are critical for freshwater biodiversity and are increasingly recognised for their role in ecosystem service delivery. Small waters often represent the best remaining examples of intact freshwater habitats and are the most likely to remain unpolluted, often being a refuge for species which have disappeared from larger, more damaged, waterbodies. Practically all water-related ecosystem services are initially mediated by small waters and some, such as carbon cycling, may be dominated by them. Small waters are exposed to all the threats affecting larger waters, and some experienced only by small waters. Despite this, small waters remain the least investigated part of the water environment and are largely excluded from water management planning. We identify the priorities for research to underpin better protection of small waters and recommend policy actions needed to better integrate small waters into the management of catchments and landscapes. The primary requirements are to identify reliable monitoring programmes for small waters, develop effective measures to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services they provide and ensure that regulators take full account of this critical part of the water environment.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	793	1					3	39		10.1007/s10750-016-3007-0								WOS:000399890800002

In this study of 165 small water bodies situated in the lowland high-productive agricultural landscape of western Poland we evaluate the effect of catchment, buffer zone, water body and water quality parameters on macrophyte functional groups (nymphaeids, elodeids, pleustophytes, helophytes) and zooplankton diversity. The potential pressure of the catchment on ponds was high (mean Ohle index 140). For macrophytes, shore length and depth of pond were highly significant and, subsequently the type of catchment and buffer, while for zooplankton, apart from water depth, trophic features of the habitat were decisive. Cluster analysis was used to identify functional types of water bodies on the basis of catchment and buffer zone attributes. Regardless of physico-geographical macroregion, water bodies of arable catchments with herbage buffer prevailed in a landscape. For protection and prevention of ecological deterioration of ponds and stability of trophic conditions the optimal situation is a buffer which is created by shrubs and trees around the pond.

J	Weigelhofer, G				Weigelhofer, Gabriele			The potential of agricultural headwater streams to retain soluble reactive phosphorus	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The study focuses on the capacity of agricultural headwater streams to retain soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). In-stream phosphorus uptake was determined via short-term SRP additions in 14 reaches differing in channel morphology and riparian vegetation. In addition, zero equilibrium phosphorus concentrations (EPC0) were estimated for 8 reaches based on adsorption experiments. Average SRP uptake lengths amounted to 3.8 km in channelized sections, 1.9 km in forested sections, and 0.5 km in open meanders. Mass transfer coefficients were highest in open meanders (0.1 cm min(-1)), followed by forested (0.05 cm min(-1)) and channelized sections (0.04 cm min(-1)). EPC0 ranged from 20 to 1,600 A mu g SRP l(-1) and correlated positively with inorganic P and reductant-soluble P concentrations of the sediments. In 50% of the reaches, phosphorus was released from the sediments at initial water concentrations of up to 500 A mu g SRP l(-1), indicating a high release potential. Although EPC0 did not correlate with in-stream SRP uptake, sediments probably play a significant role for the P retention in agricultural headwater streams as they supply the benthic community with phosphorus from the subsurface. Thus, it is crucial that sediment-water interactions are considered in the restoration and management of agricultural headwater streams.																	0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2017	793	1					149	160		10.1007/s10750-016-2789-4								WOS:000399890800011

Onset and termination of L. fortunei larval presence were coincident at the three sites in the reservoir. This may have been caused by environmental homogenization owing to artificial aeration for water quality improvement of the reservoir. The observations in this study support temperature as the trigger for onset of reproduction as suggested by previous studies. Occurrence of high turbidity that reduced food availability for mussels was probably the trigger for termination of reproduction in Lake Ohshio. During the period when L. fortunei larvae were present, the D-form larva of the earliest developmental stage was always observed and at much higher density than later developmental stages. The results indicate that spawning of L. fortunei continued in the reservoir throughout the period that larvae were observed and that predation and other factors reduced the proportion of later developmental stage larvae.																	0792-4259	2157-0272				JUN	2017	61	2					128	135		10.1080/07924259.2017.1287783								WOS:000399663100007						
J	Arya, FK; Zhang, L				Arya, Farid Khalil; Zhang, Lan			Copula-Based Markov Process for Forecasting and Analyzing Risk of Water Quality Time Series	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												This study applies the copula-based Markov process to model water quality time series. The bivariate copula is applied to investigate the first-order Markov processes. The D-Vine copula is applied to investigate the more complicated higher-order (k >= 2) Markov processes. The Value-at-Risk (VaR), computed using the best-fitted copula-based Markov process, is applied for the risk analysis. Using water quality time series at the Snohomish River watershed (Washington) and the Chattahoochee River watershed (Georgia), the results show that the copula-based Markov processes (1) are able to properly model the temporal dependence for dissolved oxygen (DO) series [i.e., forecast root-mean-square error (RMSE) <1 mg/L at both watersheds] and temperature (T) series (i.e., forecast RMSE = 1.5 degrees C at the Chattahoochee watershed); and (2) can only predict the overall trend for nitrate and conductivity series, due to the fact that these two series also depend heavily on other factors (e.g., runoff). Overall, the study indicates that the copula-based Markov process may be an efficient tool in the assessment of water quality and the associated risks with the following advantages: (1) constructing the transitional probability explicitly and properly; (2) studying the temporal dependence independently from the marginal distributions; (3) avoiding the strict assumptions of the classic time series modeling approach (e.g., the time series belonging to the Gaussian process); and (4) providing a reasonable risk measure through the VaR.

Resuspension of Escherichia coli and MS2 Bacteriophage from Bed Sediment in Irrigation Canals	JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING												Sediments are known to be potential reservoirs of pathogenic microorganisms that can influence the microbial quality of the overlaying water. A set of laboratory experiments was conducted to investigate the resuspension of Escherichia coli and the MS2 virus from bed sediment to the overlaying water in irrigation canals. Consequently, their concentration in moving water is dependent on flow properties (e.g., velocity, shear stress) and the size of bed sediment. When bed material is sandy loam, their quantity in water increases with the shear stress on bed surface. However, for a sandy bed, their presence in water has no apparent correlation with flow properties. The amount of MS2 virus in water was greater at low flow velocity and shear stress than Escherichia coli because the size of the MS2 virus is much smaller. Finally, an empirical relation was formulated for calculating the maximum allowable Escherichia coli concentration in sandy loamy bed sediment.

Setting water quality criteria for agricultural water reuse purposes	JOURNAL OF WATER REUSE AND DESALINATION												The use of reclaimed water for agricultural irrigation is practiced worldwide and will increase in the future. The definition of water quality limits is a useful instrument for the assessment of water quality regarding its suitability for irrigation purposes and the performance of wastewater treatment steps. This study elaborates water quality objectives for a water reuse project in a setting where national guidelines do not exist. Internationally established guidelines are therefore applied to the local context. Additional limits for turbidity, total suspended solids, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus and potassium are suggested to meet the requirements of water reuse projects. Emphasis is put on water quality requirements prior to UV disinfection and nutrient requirements of cultivated crops. The presented values can be of assistance when monitoring reclaimed water quality. To facilitate the realization of water reuse projects, comprehensive and more detailed information, in particular on water quality requirements prior to disinfection steps, should be provided as well as regarding the protection of the irrigation infrastructure.																	2220-1319					JUN	2017	7	2					121	135		10.2166/wrd.2016.194								WOS:000400139700002

CBZ concentration increased by a factor of two (from 37 to ca. 70 ng/L) regardless of the treatment conditions, and its metabolites, 10,11-dihydro-10hydroxycarbamazepine (approximately 500 ng/L after SAT) and CBZ-10,11-epoxide (12-42 ng/L after SAT) were not effectively removed after SAT. Our results indicated that some metabolites of pharmaceuticals are present at much higher concentration than the original forms in the SAT effluent, and that some metabolites are more persistent during SAT with a relatively short retention time (i.e., 30 days). The study indicated that more attention should be paid to the formation and fate of metabolites in the water quality management of SAT effluent.																	2220-1319					JUN	2017	7	2					142	151		10.2166/wrd.2016.208								WOS:000400139700004

This new concept, addressed as water-reuse risk assessment program (WRAP), has been further developed from hazard analysis of critical control points (HACCP) to illustrate the potential hazards which are the roots of hindering intra-facility water reuse strategies. For industrial sectors applying water reclamation and reuse schemes, it is paramount that the reclaimed water quality stays within the desired quality. The objective of WRAP is to establish a new methodology and knowledge, which will contribute to the sustainable development of industrial water management, and demonstrate its capabilities in identifying and addressing any potential hazards in the selected schemes adoption by the industries. A 'what-if' scenario was simulated using a refinery as a case study to show strategies on how to benefit reclaimed or reuse water based on reliable, applied and scientific research within the process integration area. In conclusion, the WRAP model will facilitate operators, consultants and decision makers to reuse water on a fit-for-use basis whilst avoiding contaminant accumulation in the overall system and production of sub-quality products from inadequate processes after several reuses.																	2220-1319					JUN	2017	7	2					162	174		10.2166/wrd.2016.175								WOS:000400139700006

The results show that there is an appreciable difference between indices values for the same water sample. The results also show that water quality categorization for sampling stations in the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment WQI (CCMEWQI) and British Columbia WQI (BCWQI) was found to be 'marginal' for all sampling stations, except Hammam Boughrara reservoir and Mouillah wadi where it was found to be 'poor'. For the Aquatic Toxicity Index, it was found to be 'totally unsuitable for normal fish life' for all stations and 'suitable only for hardy fish species' for Mouillah wadi and Boughrara reservoir. The results show that this transboundary catchment always needs strategies for more effective pollution control management. Future use of WQIs in this way should prove a valuable tool for environmental planning decision-makers in tracking water quality change.

Deficits in water quality, mainly from diffuse pollution such as agricultural run-off, but also from wastewater treatment plants (WVVTPs), have been suggested as important drivers of this decline in ecological quality. We modelled six macroinvertebrate based metrics indicating ecological quality for 184 streams in response to a) PCA-derived water quality gradients, b) individual water quality variables and c) catchment land use and wastewater exposure indices as pollution drivers. The aim was to evaluate the relative importance of key water quality variables and their sources. Indicator substances (i.e. carbamazepine and caffeine indicating wastewater exposure; herbicides indicating agricultural run-off) represented micropollutants in the analyses and successfully related water quality variables to pollution sources. Arable and urban catchment land covers were strongly associated with reduced ecological quality. Electric conductivity, oxygen concentration, caffeine, silicate and toxic units with respect to pesticides were identified as the most significant in-stream predictors in this order. Our results underline the importance to manage diffuse pollution, if ecological quality is to be improved. However, we also found a clear impact of wastewater on ecological quality through caffeine. Thus, improvement of WWTPs, especially preventing the release of poorly treated wastewater, will benefit freshwater communities. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The impact of pre-restoration land-use and disturbance on sediment structure, hydrology and the sediment geochemical environment in restored saltmarshes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Saltmarshes are being lost or degraded as a result of human activity resulting in loss of critical ecosystem services including the provision of wild species diversity, water quality regulation and flood regulation. To compensate, saltmarshes are being restored or re-created, usually driven by legislative requirements for increased habitat diversity, flood regulation and sustainable coastal defense. Yet, there is increasing evidence that restoration may not deliver anticipated ecosystem services; this is frequently attributed to poor drainage and sediment anoxia. However, physical sediment characteristics, hydrology and the sediment geochemical environment are rarely examined in restoration schemes, despite such factors being critical for plant succession. This study presents the novel integration of 3D-computed X-ray microtomography to quantify sediment structure and porosity, with water level and geochemical data to understand the impact of pre-restoration land use and disturbance on the structure and functioning of restored saitmarshes. The study combines a broad-scale investigation of physical sediment characteristics in nine de-embanked saitmarshes across SE England, with an intensive study at one site examining water levels, sediment structure and the sediment geochemical environment. De-embankment does not restore the hydrological regime, or the physical/chemical framework in the saltmarshes and evidence of disturbance, includes a reduction in microporosity, pore connectivity and water storage capacity, a lack of connectivity between the sub-surface environment and overlying floodwaters, and impeded sub-surface water flow and drainage. This has significant consequences for the sediment geochemical environment. This disturbance is evident for at least two decades following restoration and is likely to be irreversible. It has important implications for plant establishment in particular, ecosystem services including-flood regulation, nutrient cycling and wild species diversity and for future restoration design.

Generally, As(III) has a higher toxicity than As(V) due to the different mechanisms in arsenic toxicity. However, there are few studies about the water quality criteria (WQC) of As (III) and As(V) respectively because of the deficiency of arsenic toxicity data coming from diverse taxonomic groups. In this research, eight native Chinese aquatic organisms were adopted to conduct toxicity tests for As (III) and As(V) to supplement the published toxicity data. The species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method on the basis of the Log-normal model which was the most optimal among eight models was applied to derive WQCs of As(III) and As(V). Results showed that crustaceans were the most sensitive to As(III) and As(V) among all tested species, thus they could be a biological indicator, and the influence of pH values on arsenic toxicity was complex and species-specific. Besides, the sensitivity differences between native and non-native species were observed. Finally, a criterion maximum concentration (CMC) of 167 and 384 mu g/L for As(III) and As(V), and a criterion continuous concentration (CCC) of 42 and 44 pg/L for As(III) and As(V) were derived using native species, regardless of pH values. The WQCs were also verified by other two methods of ETX 2.0 and species sensitivity rank. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To date, however, the statistical basis for the design and recommended procedures for enumerating fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations from CBT results have not been formally documented. Here, we provide that documentation following protocols for communicating the evolution of similar water quality testing procedures. We begin with an overview of the statistical theory behind the CBT, followed by a description of how that theory was applied to determine an optimal CBT design. We then provide recommendations for interpreting CBT results, including procedures for estimating quantiles of the FIB concentration probability distribution, and the confidence of compliance with recognized water quality guidelines. We synthesize these values in custom user-oriented 'look-up' tables similar to those developed for other FIB water quality testing methods. Modified versions of our tables are currently distributed commercially as part of the CBT testing kit.

High throughput pyrosequencing technology was used to assess the shift in microbial community of leachate from animal carcass lysimeter. The leachate samples were collected monthly for one year and a total of 164,639 pyrosequencing reads were obtained and used in the taxonomic classification and operational taxonomy units (OTUs) distribution analysis based on sequence similarity. Our results show considerable changes in the phylum-level bacterial composition, suggesting that the microbial community is a sensitive parameter affected by the burial environment. The phylum classification results showed that Proteobacteria (Pseudomonas) were the most influential taxa in earlier decomposition stage whereas Firmicutes (Clostridium, Sporanaerobacter, and Peptostreptococcus) were dominant in later stage under anaerobic conditions. The result of this study can provide useful information on a time series of leachate profiles of microbial community structures and suggest patterns of microbial diversity in livestock burial sites. In addition, this result can be applicable to predict the decomposition stages under clay loam based soil conditions of animal livestock. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, agriculture as it is currently practiced, is contributing to the degradation of freshwater ecosystems globally. We investigated impacts of irrigation return flows from sugarcane farming on water quality and health status of the Chiredzi and Runde Rivers, a biodiversity hotspot region in south-eastern Lowveld of Zimbabwe. The water quality at inlets from the crop field into the wetland system; wetland outlets into the river systems; and river sites upstream and downstream of wetland outlets were monitored during the dry and wet seasons. The wetland system formed naturally from excessive drainage from the cane fields but its purifying capacity was unknown to date. An assessment of the water physical chemical variables (at all sites) and macroinvertebrate communities (at river sites only) was carried out. Results showed that the wetland was deficient in its purifying capacity as it was already saturated by salts and nutrients from high irrigation return flow loads. A significant seasonal variation was observed for conductivity, reactive phosphorus (RP), pH and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations among the inlets to the wetland whereas among the river sites significant seasonal differences were observed for ammonium, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, RP, pH, TP and turbidity concentrations during the dry season. From the macroinvertebrate community data the impact of the irrigation return flows on the river system was apparent, as the good water quality sites were characterised by a high diversity of pollution sensitive macroinvertebrate taxa, while the irrigation impacted sites were characterised and dominated by pollution tolerant taxa. High ion concentration (conductivity and salinity) and pH were found to be important in structuring macroinvertebrate communities as determined using multivariate analysis in the river system. In conclusion, the river water quality was significantly impacted by irrigation return flows and this greatly reduced the ecological health as highlighted by low macroinvertebrate diversity and increases in physical-chemical variables.

Chlorine is a widely-used disinfectant and the key factor in the inactivation of T tubifex. This study investigated the inactivation kinetics of chlorine on T tubifex and the synergistic effect of the sequential use of chlorine and UV irradiation. The experimental results indicated that the Ct (concentration x time(reaction)) concept could be used to evaluate the inactivation kinetics of T. tubifex with chlorine, thus allowing for the use of a simpler Ct approach for the assessment of T. tubifex chlorine inactivation requirements. The inactivation kinetics of T tubifex by chlorine was found to be well-fitted to a delayed pseudo first-order Chick-Watson expression. Sequential experiments revealed that UV irradiation and chlorine worked synergistically to effectively inactivate T tubifex as a result of the decreased activation energy, Ea, induced by primary UV irradiation. Furthermore, the inactivation effectiveness of T. tubifex by chlorine was found to be affected by several drinking water quality parameters including pH, turbidity, and chemical oxygen demand with potassium permanganate (CODMO) concentration. High pH exhibited pronounced inactivation effectiveness and the decrease in turbidity and CODMn concentrations contributed to the inactivation of T. tubifex. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

For an adsorption-based method, mesoporous carbon can be a promising supplemental adsorbent. The effect of mesoporous carbon (MCI, MC2, and MC3) properties and water quality parameters on the adsorption of MC-LR were investigated and the results were analyzed by kinetic, isotherm, thermodynamic, Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO), and intraparticle diffusion models. MC1 was the most appropriate type for the removal of MC-LR with a maximum adsorption capacity of 35,670.49 mu g/g. Adsorption of MC-LR is a spontaneous reaction dominated by van der Waals interactions. Pore sizes of 8.5 14 nm enhance the pore diffusion of MC-LR from the surface to the mesopores of MC1. The adsorption capacity was not sensitive to changes in the pH (3.2-8.0) and the existence of organic matter (2-5 mg/L). Furthermore, the final concentration of MC-LR was below the WHO guideline level after a 10-min reaction with 20 mg/L of MC1 in the Nak-Dong River, a drinking water source. The MC-LR adsorption mainly competed with humic substances (500-1000 g/mole); however, they did not have a great effect on adsorption.

In this study, to assess seasonal changes in the sources of organic matter in Lake Sihwa (Korea), biodegradability, fluorescence property, and stable isotopic compositions (carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur) of the organic matter were determined. Water samples were collected from the inner lake (n = 9) and inland creeks (n = 10) in five separate events, from November 2012 to October 2013. Organic matter originating from rural, urban, and industrial areas was examined as the potential sources. The organic matter contents and biodegradability in the industrial area were the highest, whereas low concentrations and poor biodegradability of organic matter were found in the rural area, and moderate properties were observed in the urban area. In Lake Sihwa, a large concentration of total organic matter and enhanced biodegradability were observed during March and August. However, main source of organic matter differed between the sampling events. The largest contribution of organic matter, deriving from marine phytoplankton, was found in March. On the other hand, in August, the organic matter originating from the industrial area, which is characterized by high levels of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants, was significantly increased. Our results could be useful to enhance the management of water bodies aimed at reducing the organic matter concentrations and improving the water quality of Lake Sihwa, and even that of the Yellow Sea.

J	Nigussie, TA; Altunkaynak, A				Nigussie, Tewodros Assefa; Altunkaynak, Abdusselam			Modeling Urbanization of Istanbul under Different Scenarios Using SLEUTH Urban Growth Model	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT												Urbanization competes with other important land uses such as agriculture and forests and makes ecosystem services and biodiversity sustenance a difficult challenge. It can also induce higher runoff peaks, increase the risk of flooding, and affect water quality. Informed planning and decision making, based on clear understanding of the extent of urbanization over time, can reduce these challenges. This can be achieved by investigating the effects of various scenarios reflecting various land-use policies. In this study, four scenarios were developed and their effects on the urban extent of Istanbul by 2050 were investigated by the slope, land use, exclusion, urban extent, transportation, and hillshade (SLEUTH) urban growth model. For this purpose, historical satellite images were used to develop all the input data using appropriate mapping software. The cell-by-cell matching index, which was found to be 0.773, was used as the performance evaluation criterion of the model. The result showed that the model can be used to predict the urban extent of Istanbul under the various scenarios. Accordingly, the total urban extent of Istanbul is predicted to reach 1,962, 1,188, 1,404, and 1,083 km(2) under Scenarios 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Based on these results, urbanization under Scenario 1 could be taken as the worst scenario because it affects agricultural and forest land uses. As opposed to this, Scenario 4 is the most desirable for the future urbanization of Istanbul because it limits development in ecologically sensitive areas. However, with the implementation of Project Canal Istanbul, it also results in further urbanization within Ayamama and Tavukcu watersheds. Therefore, studying the potential impacts of urbanization under such scenarios in advance on the rainfall-runoff process and the environment as a whole in these areas is recommended so that appropriate actions could be taken to reduce associated risks.

Multiobjective Optimization of Distributed Stormwater Harvesting Systems	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Stormwater harvesting (SWH) is an important water-sensitive urban design (WSUD) approach that provides an alternate water supply source and improves runoff quality through integrated systems of stormwater best management practice (BMP) technologies. In SWH system design, practitioners must account for trade-offs between cost, supply volume, and water quality improvement performance, which depend on design decisions for the type, size, and spatial distribution of BMPs. As such, the design of SWH systems with distributed BMPs is a complex, multiobjective optimization problem with a large decision space. This paper presents a multiobjective optimization framework to assess trade-offs in spatially distributed SWH system designs. The framework was applied to a case study for a housing development in Adelaide, South Australia. The results illustrated the potential benefits of distributing BMPs in an integrated SWH system where space at the catchment outlet is limited. Trade-offs between volumetric reliability and total suspended solids (TSS) reduction indicate that large gains in TSS reduction be achieved with limited reduction in volumetric reliability. Concept designs in low-cost/moderately reliable and low-cost/high TSS reduction trade-off regions contained biofilters in locations receiving large inflows.can (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

GISMOWA is a new GIS and risk-based analysis tool to identify and prioritize pipe segments for water quality monitoring and to comply with existing monitoring and sampling guidelines. The tool was designed to integrate multiple parameters categorized as (1) hydraulic and structural weaknesses in the system, e.g., residence time; (2) external threats, e.g., contaminated sites; and (3) sensitive consumers, e.g., hospitals, in a GIS environment. The tool used a multicriteria decision analysis to evaluate multiple monitoring site parameters and map zones particularly suitable for water quality monitoring. GISMOWA was applied to Danish water distribution systems as a transparent and simple-to-use tool facilitating a complete overview of the distribution system, including sensitive consumers and consumers in general, thus fulfilling a precondition for a HACCP-based monitoring strategy of drinking water.

J	Chen, WY; Li, X				Chen, Wendy Y.; Li, Xun			Cumulative impacts of polluted urban streams on property values: A 3-D spatial hedonic model at the micro-neighborhood level	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urban streams could concurrently bring about both positive amenities accruing to the view of waterscape and negative disamenities associated with water pollution. In this paper, we focus on a specific question that has not yet been explicitly answered in the extant literature: how-to estimate the cumulative impacts of urban streams (which refer to the combined impacts of amenities and disamenities of multiple sources) in high density and high-rise urban contexts. A typical residential apartment complex (comprised of a number of apartment units located in dozens of mid- to high-rise commercial apartment buildings on a contiguous land parcel) in Guangzhou, south China, is used as a case study. A detailed palette of natural amenities and environmental disamenities of two bifurcated streams are quantified via the generalized spatial two-stage least squares (GS2SLS) model. In this model, an originally constructed 3-D spatial connectivity matrix, cube contiguity, is applied to address, in a sophisticated manner, an array of endogenous, exogenous, and error interactions along both horizontal and vertical dimensions that inherently exist in the spatial context of high-rise housing markets. Our results from spatial hedonic models at the micro-neighborhood level demonstrate that homebuyers tend to evaluate urban streams' chemical, physical, and ecological features holistically. A cumulative impact is also found, as homebuyers would like to pay an extra premium for an apartment located farther away from both polluted streams. This study advances the extant literature by contributing to a novel and effective extension of the conventional two-dimensional spatial matrix which can capture the long-ignored spatial correlation existing amongst apartment units located on contiguous floors, as well as a robust estimation of the demand of urban natural and environmental amenities in the gradually rising mid- and high-rise housing market in both developing and developed countries.																	0169-2046	1872-6062				JUN	2017	162						1	12		10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.01.012								WOS:000399627800001

The role of trees in urban stormwater management	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urban impervious surfaces convert precipitation to stormwater runoff, which causes water quality and quantity problems. While traditional stormwater management has relied on gray infrastructure such as piped conveyances to collect and convey stormwater to wastewater treatment facilities or into surface waters, cities are exploring green infrastructure to manage stormwater at its source. Decentralized green infrastructure leverages the capabilities of soil and vegetation to infiltrate, redistribute, and otherwise store stormwater volume, with the potential to realize ancillary environmental, social, and economic benefits. To date, green infrastructure science and practice have largely focused on infiltration-based technologies that include rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable pavements. However, a narrow focus on infiltration overlooks other losses from the hydrologic cycle, and we propose that arboriculture - the cultivation of trees and other woody plants - deserves additional consideration as a stormwater control measure. Trees interact with the urban hydrologic cycle by intercepting incoming precipitation, removing water from the soil via transpiration, enhancing infiltration, and bolstering the performance of other green infrastructure technologies. However, many of these interactions are inadequately understood, particularly at spatial and temporal scales relevant to stormwater management. As such, the reliable use of trees for stormwater control depends on improved understanding of how and to what extent trees interact with stormwater, and the context-specific consideration of optimal arboricultural practices and institutional frameworks to maximize the stormwater benefits trees can provide.

J	Curtis, J; Breen, B				Curtis, John; Breen, Benjamin			Irish coarse and game anglers' preferences for fishing site attributes	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Knowing which site attributes have relevance for anglers is valuable information for fishery managers seeking to improve angler satisfaction and manage fish stocks. Recreation demand models typically have limited information about site attributes and in many instances is limited to just a few measures for each site. We assemble a recreational angling dataset with extensive information on site attributes and model angling demand to ascertain the importance of attributes in decisions on trip duration. However, we find that only a small number of site attributes are important determinants of trip duration, including attributes such as ease of physical access, availability of guiding services, specimen fish, and 'catch & release' status. We also find that importance of site attributes differs by target species. The key site attributes influencing trip duration of anglers targeting coarse species (i.e. non-salmonid) are good physical access or availability of specimen fish, with trip duration to such sites one day longer, on average. Key site attributes for anglers targeting salmonid game species are the availability of guiding services and whether the fishery is regulated as 'catch & release'. On average, anglers' trip duration is a half day less in 'catch & release' fisheries. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Beysens, D; Mongruel, A; Acker, K				Beysens, D.; Mongruel, A.; Acker, K.			Urban dew and rain in Paris, France: Occurrence and physico-chemical characteristics	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												This paper summarizes one year (April 2011 to March 2012) measurements on planar condensing surfaces of dew and rain events and related physico-chemical characteristics in the urban environment of Paris (city center). Yearly collected water was 3.48 mm for dew (63 events) and 593 mm for rain (146 events). The latter value compares well with rain data (547 mm and 107 events) collected within 12 km at Paris-Orly airport. An estimation of dew yield based on meteo data gives 235 mm and 74 events, to be compared with 17.11 mm and 196 events at Paris-Orly. These differences highlight the large reduction in dew events and dew yields in an urban area as compared to a close rural-like area. This reduction is not due to a sky view reduction but to heat island that increases air temperature and decreases relative humidity. Analysis of dew (34) and rain (77) samples were done concerning pH, electrical conductivity (EC), major anions and cations as well as selected trace metals and other minor ions. Mean pH values are found similar for both, dew (6.5) and rain (6.1), rain being slightly more acidic than dew. The mean dew total ionic content (TIC 1.8 meq/I) and EC value (124 mu S/cm) are about four times that of rain (0.45 meq/I; 35 mu S/cm), meaning that total dissolved solids in dew is nearly four times that in rain. Sulfate and nitrate are the most acidifying components, calcium the most neutralizing constituent with ratio of mean total acidity/total alkalinity comparable for dew and rain (similar to 0.9). Sulfate and nitrate have mainly anthropogenic sources, whereas chloride and magnesium are mostly connected with marine air masses.

J	Peng, M; Oleson, KLL				Peng, Marcus; Oleson, Kirsten L. L.			Beach Recreationalists' Willingness to Pay and Economic Implications of Coastal Water. Quality Problems in Hawaii	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												The economic value of water quality is poorly understood in Hawaii. Quantifying the economic value of coastal water quality would inform policy decisions that impact the coast and help justify expenditures in water quality improvements. We conducted a non-market valuation of beach recreationalists' preferences and willingness to pay for water quality and associated attributes at Oahu beaches. Using a discrete choice experiment analyzed by a conditional logit model, results suggest individuals were willing to pay $11.43 per day at the beach to reduce days of bacterial exceedance from 11 to 5 per year, a further $30.72 to reduce it to no bacterial exceedances at all. WTP to move from 15 ft to 30 ft of underwater visibility was $35.71, a further $14.80 to increase from 30 ft to 60 ft. Respondents were also willing to pay $15.33 to improve coral reef cover from 10% to 25%, a further $4.89 to improve to 45% cover. WTP for moving from 9 fish species to 18 species was $7.14, a further $2.47 to increase that to 27 fish species. These environmental improvements can improve Oahu recreationalists' welfare by $205 million, $550 million, $639 million, $265 million, $274 million, $88 million, $128 million, and $44 million per year, respectively. Welfare gains may justify increased spending in management and restoration of coastal ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Su, TC				Su, Tung-Ching			A study of a matching pixel by pixel (MPP) algorithm to establish an empirical model of water quality mapping, as based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION												Linear regression models are a popular choice for the relationships between water quality parameters and bands (or band ratios) of remote sensing data. However, this research regards the phenomena of mixed pixels, specular reflection, and water fluidity as the challenges to establish a robust regression infidel. Based on the data of measurements in situ and remote sensing data, this study presents an enumeration based algorithm, called matching pixel by pixel (MPP), and tests its performance in an empirical model of water quality mapping. Four small reservoirs, which cover a mere several hundred-thousand m(2), in Kinmen, Taiwan, are selected as the study sites. The multispectral sensors, carried on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), are adopted to acquire remote sensing data regarding water quality parameters, including chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Secchi disk depth (SDD), and turbidity in the reservoirs. The experimental results indicate that, while MPP can reduce the influence of specular reflection on regression model establishment, specular reflection does hamper the correction of thematic map production. Due to Water fluidity, sampling in situ should be followed by UAV imaging as soon as possible. Excluding turbidity, the obtained estimation accuracy can satisfy the national standard.

Influence of temperature and organic matter load on chlorine dioxide efficacy on Escherichia coli inactivation	LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Postharvest losses of fresh vegetables are mostly caused by microbial infections. Furthermore, contamination of raw-consumed fruits and vegetables with human pathogens may lead to serious foodborne illness. Washing with tap water reduces the total number of produce surface attached microorganisms by only 1-2 log. Addition of sanitizers to washing waters can help to effectively reduce the,microbial load. However, some sanitizers are less successful than initially assumed and/or may negatively affect produce quality. During recent years, efficiency of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) applications was tested as an alternative sanitation agent for fresh produce. Most published studies, however, were planned and performed under laboratory conditions, i.e. in tap water with a low chemical oxygen demand (COD). Thus, they do not necessarily reflect the practical conditions in processing lines, where effluent produce sap may largely increase COD. Factors such as pH, temperature and load of organic matter may influence the actual biocidal efficiency of ClO2. Successful technical implementations, thus, require information about the relationship between efficiency of ClO2 and influencing factors. Here, a comprehensive evaluation of the influence of temperature on the effectiveness of ClO2 treatment (ClO2 concentrations = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg L-1) on Escherichia coli (starting load: 5 10(5) cfu mL(-1)) and the influence of organic matter load on the effective ClO2 concentration in lettuce washing water is provided. Decreasing the temperature of the processing water (from 15 degrees C to 2 degrees C) resulted in a reduced and delayed reduction of E. coli counts. At 15 degrees C, not at 2 degrees C, a significant reduction of E. coli was found after 2 min. At a ClO2 concentration of 3 mg L-1, microbes were significantly and completely inactivated at 15 degrees C after 0.5 min. In contrast, E. coli loads were significantly, but only incompletely reduced at 2 degrees C after 1 min. The increase in COD from 250 mg L-1 to 1000 mg L-1 by the addition of respective amounts of organic matter resulted in a pronounced increase in the ClO2 demand. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yuan, Q; Wu, JY; Greenbaum, E; Evans, BR				Yuan, Quan; Wu, Jayne; Greenbaum, Elias; Evans, Barbara			A resettable in-line particle concentrator using AC electrokinetics for distributed monitoring of microalgae in source waters	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL												Green algae have been studied as an important and effective biomarker to indicate water quality due to their sensitivity to toxic agents in freshwater sources. However, conventional methods to monitor algal physiology use a chlorophyll fluorometer whose use is hampered by high-cost, large footprint, and limited sensitivity for practical samples containing low algal concentration. To overcome these constraints, we developed a multi-level electrode platform for resettable trapping of algae via AC electro-osmosis (ACEO) and negative dielectrophoresis. Preliminary experiments were performed in freshwater with conductivity of 0.02 S/m. Algal trapping was demonstrated at a low voltage of 2 V. The concentration effect was experimentally verified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of algae and using hemocytometer counting chambers at the inlet and outlet of the multilevel microchannel lab-on-a-chip. An optimal frequency was found for trapping, which agrees with the frequency dependence of ACED flow velocity. Through-flow rate and electrode dimensions were optimized as well. Trapping efficiencies within the range of 26%-65% have been obtained. A maximum trapping rate of 182 cells/s was obtained with a flow rate of 20 l/min. This lab-on-a-chip shows high potential for improving the limit of detection in algal monitoring and enabling the development of a portable, integrated and automated system for monitoring the quality of source drinking waters.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The immunosensor was constructed by immobilizing MC-LR antibody on the MoS2/AuNRs nanocomposite modified gold electrode. Using a competitive immunoassay format, the coated MC-LR antibody competed for MC-LR antigen with added target MC-LR, forming an antibody-antigen immunocomplex. Subsequently, horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-MC-LR antibody (HRP-Ab(2)) was captured and detected. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited a linear response to MC-LR ranging from 0.01 to 20 mu g L-1 with a detection limit of 5 ng L-1 at a signal to noise of 3. This electrochemical immunosensor showed good performance with high sensitivity, good stability, accepted reusability and promising applications in routine water quality monitoring for various toxins.

J	Pasternak, G; Greenman, J; Ieropoulos, I				Pasternak, Grzegorz; Greenman, John; Ieropoulos, Ioannis			Self-powered, autonomous Biological Oxygen Demand biosensor for online water quality monitoring	SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL												Standard Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) analysis requires 5 days to complete. To date, microbial fuel cell biosensors used as an alternative method for BOD assessment requires external apparatus, which limits their use for on-line monitoring in remote, off-grid locations. In this study, a self-powered, floating biosensor was developed for online water quality monitoring. This approach eliminated the need for external apparatus and maintenance that would otherwise be required by other techniques. The biosensor was able to detect urine in freshwater and turn ON a visual and sound cues (85 dB). The energy needed to operate the biosensor was produced by the system itself with the use of electroactive microorganisms, inside microbial fuel cells. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) was used as a fast method of biosensor validation. When urine concentration exceeded the lower threshold, corresponding to a COD concentration of 57.7 +/- 4.8 mgO(2) L-1, the biosensor turned the alarm ON. The shortest observed actuation time, required to switch ON the alarm was 61 min, when the urine concentration was 149.7 +/- 1.7 mgO(2) L-1. Once the sensor was switched ON, the signal was emitted until the urine organic load decreased to 15.3 +/- 1.9 mgO(2) L-1. When ON, the microbial fuel cell sensor produced a maximum power of 4.3 mW. When switched OFF, the biosensor produced 25.4 mu W. The frequency of the signal was proportional to the concentration of urine. The observed frequencies varied between 0.01 and 0.59 Hz. This approach allowed to correlate and quantitatively detect the presence of water contamination, based on signal frequency. The sensor was operating autonomously for 5 months. This is the first report of a self-powered, autonomous device, developed for online water quality monitoring. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

S.			Bedload as an indicator of heavy metal contamination in a Brazilian anthropized watershed	CATENA												Heavy metal contamination has long been a water quality concern worldwide. Most studies have focused on heavy metal concentration in water through suspended sediment and bottom sediment; however, the concentration transported by river-bottom sediment, known as bedload, has not been taken into account. In order to fill this gap, this study aimed to determine the concentration of Hg, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cu, Cr, Zn, As, Fe and Mn in bedload of Ipojuca River which is an environmentally impacted river in Brazil. The use of bedload in heavy metal contamination studies raises the following question: Is the bedload an adequate indicator of heavy metal contamination? To answer this question, sediment contamination assessment was performed using sediment contamination indices, principal component analysis, and comparison with background values and sediment quality guidelines (SQGs). Comparing with sediment quality guidelines, the Probable Effect Level (PEL) and Threshold Effect Level (TEL) seem to underestimate the harmful effect on sediment-dwelling organisms, being essential either to calibrate the SQGs for site specific conditions or develop site specific guidelines. The pollution load index (PLI) indicated that the upstream and downstream sites were not polluted and polluted, respectively. Principal component analysis explained roughly 91% and 81% of the total variance in heavy metal contamination upstream and downstream, respectively, and distinguished natural and anthropogenic contributions in Ipojuca River. Multiple lines of evidence suggested that heavy metal concentrations in bedload were an adequate and feasible indicator of anthropogenic impacts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study aims to spatially analyse the land degradation sensitivity in south-western Romania, a region currently known for this type of environmental deterioration. The analysis is based on mapping and assessing land susceptibility to degradation by means of a multifactorial approach using GIS techniques, such as the well-established MEDALUS (Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use) method. Widely used in the Mediterranean region and other areas worldwide due to advantageous features such as simplicity, flexibility and rapid implementation, the method was used in this study for the analysis of the main indicators identified to be driving forces of land degradation, i.e. Climate Quality Index, Soil Quality Index, Vegetation Quality Index and Management Quality Index The paper aims to adjust the method in relation to local conditions by considering certain additional variables (sub-indicators) for computing the main indicators, as well as by integrating a new regionally relevant indicator for this environmental issue Water Quality Index. The final results, assessed with the proposed Land Degradation Sensitivity Index (based on 21 sub-indicators, of which 15 are included in the original MEDALUS method, and 6 are additional), showed that approximately 70% of the total study area is critically sensitive to degradation, mainly due to high agricultural pressures and very low vegetation cover. Surprisingly, in terms of administration, it was found that >80% of the region's territorial administrative units include sectors which are critically exposed to degradation that exceed half their area. The results can constitute a basic support for regional-level decision makers who can implement the appropriate measures in order to attenuate the restrictive environmental conditions.

Evaluation of riparian condition is essential to achieve and maintain good stream health, as well as to sustain ecological functions that riparian areas provide. This manuscript is aimed to evaluate riparian conditions of Songhua River, the fifth longest river in China, using physical structural integrality (PSI) values derived from remote sensing and validated by field measurements. The variation and clusters of PSI values were discriminated by the spatial statistics to quantify variation of riparian condition in each measurement section. Evaluation results derived from 13 measurement sections indicated that over 60% of the riparian zones have been disturbed by human activities. Analysis of land use patterns of riparian zone in the cold and hot spots found that land-use patterns had an important effect on riparian condition. The build-up and farmland areas had been the main human disturbances to the riparian condition, which were increased from 1976 to 2013. The low-low clusters (low PSI values with low neighbors) of PSI values can be implemented to identify the vulnerability of the riparian zone.																	2045-2322					MAY 31	2017	7								2565	10.1038/s41598-017-02772-3								WOS:000402519400029	28566728

Functional diversity of microbial communities in pristine aquifers inferred by PLFA- and sequencing-based approaches	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Microorganisms in groundwater play an important role in aquifer biogeochemical cycles and water quality. However, the mechanisms linking the functional diversity of microbial populations and the groundwater physico-chemistry are still not well understood due to the complexity of interactions between surface and subsurface. Within the framework of Hainich (north-western Thuringia, central Germany) Critical Zone Exploratory of the Collaborative Research Centre AquaDiva, we used the relative abundances of phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs) to link specific biochemical markers within the microbial communities to the spatio-temporal changes of the groundwater physico-chemistry. The functional diversities of the microbial communities were mainly correlated with groundwater chemistry, including dissolved O-2, Fe-t and NH4+ concentrations. Abundances of PLFAs derived from eukaryotes and potential nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (11Me16:0 as biomarker for Nitro-spira moscoviensis) were high at sites with elevated O-2 concentration where groundwater recharge supplies bioavailable substrates. In anoxic groundwaters more rich in Fe-t, PLFAs abundant in sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), iron-reducing bacteria and fungi increased with Fe-t and HCO3- concentrations, suggesting the occurrence of active iron reduction and the possible role of fungi in meditating iron solubilization and transport in those aquifer domains. In more NH4+ -rich anoxic groundwaters, anammox bacteria and SRB-derived PLFAs increased with NH4+ concentration, further evidencing the dependence of the anammox process on ammonium concentration and potential links between SRB and anammox bacteria. Additional support of the PLFA-based bacterial communities was found in DNA- and RNA-based Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, which showed high predominance of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria Nitrospira, e.g. Nitrospira moscoviensis, in oxic aquifer zones and of anammox bacteria in more NH4+ -rich anoxic groundwater. Higher relative abundances of sequence reads in the RNA-based datasets affiliated with iron-reducing bacteria in more Fe-t-rich groundwater supported the occurrence of active dissimilatory iron reduction. The functional diversity of the microbial communities in the biogeochemically distinct groundwater assemblages can be largely attributed to the redox conditions linked to changes in bioavailable substrates and input of substrates with the seepage. Our results demonstrate the power of complementary information derived from PLFA-based and sequencing-based approaches.

Quantifying the effects of conservation practice implementation on predicted runoff and chemical losses under climate change	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The Soil and Water Assessment Tool with downscaled weather data generated using the MarkSim weather file generator was used to evaluate the impact of long-term conservation practice implementation on runoff, sediment, atrazine, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) losses in an agricultural watershed located in northeastern Indiana. As part of the Conservation Effects Assessment Project, evaluation of these conservation practices is required to provide insight on how their implementation is benefiting the environment. The results indicate that individual conservation practices were effective in reducing a particular pollutant load, but combined practices were more effective in reducing multiple pollutant loads simultaneously. Of the individual best management practices (BMPs) assessed, no-till was the most effective in reducing multiple pollutant loads (reduced surface runoff by an average of 25%, sediment by 46%, atrazine by 46%, total N by 9%, soluble P by 16%, and total P by 29%). When BMPs were combined, pollutant load reductions were increased significantly (at alpha = 0.05) for all pollutants, both under baseline and future climate scenarios. The reductions in runoff and pollutant loads for each decade of future climate ranged from 15 to 25% for surface runoff, 32-68% for sediment loss, 37-60% for atrazine loss, 5-13% for soluble N loss, 12-35% for total N loss, 9-41% for soluble P loss, and 33-60% for total P loss.

J	Xi, JY; Zhang, F; Lu, Y; Hu, HY				Xi, Jinying; Zhang, Feng; Lu, Yun; Hu, Hong-Ying			A novel model simulating reclaimed water disinfection by ozonation	SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY												Ozonation is broadly used as a disinfection technique for inactivation of pathogens in drinking water or reclaimed water. The conventional Chick-Watson model (C-W model) considering ozone exposure is sub-optimal in predicting the inactivation performance by ozonation in reclaimed water. In this study, the Escherichia coli (E. coli) and the Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) spore were used as test microorganisms and ozonation experiments were carried out upon different systems. The relationship between experimental inactivation and TOD was found to follow an S-shape curve. A novel and practical empirical model (L-I model) was set up to simulate the inactivation performance in reclaimed waters, regarding the transferred ozone dose (TOD), the instantaneous ozone demand (IOD) and the microbial resistance to ozone as the main parameters. According to the data fitting results, the parameters for E. coli and B. subtilis spores were determined. With TOD in 0-20 mg L-1 and IOD in 2-5 mg L-1, the calculated inactivation rates of the two test microorganisms could successfully match the experimental data derived from the batch ozonation test and the semi-continuous ozonation test for reclaimed water disinfection. The squared correlation coefficients (R-2) for different tests range from 0.86 to 0.96 and the average relative errors (8) are 0.08-0.59. This result verified that the L-I model is a practical way to simulate performances of ozonation systems for reclaimed water disinfection. Based on the model, the effects of water quality (IOD) and microbial resistance on disinfection performance were also analyzed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Low-cost, Real-Time, Autonomous Water Quality Testing and Notification System	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY												Input Traditionally, water quality was tested by collecting the samples of water and experimentally analyzing it in the laboratories. However, in today's world, where time is the scarcest resource available and industrialization and economy is growing rapidly, the traditional method of water quality testing is not applicable anymore. To tackle the issue, several electronic (microcontroller and sensor based) water quality monitoring systems were developed in the past decade. However, as most of these systems were studied, besides their strengths, each of them have their own limitations to be taken into consideration. Therefore, an automatic, remote, portable, real time, and low cost water quality monitoring system has been developed. This system consists of a self-made Arduino microcontroller, multiple sensors, GSM module, LCD display screen, and alarm system. The water quality data is read from the physical world through the water quality testing sensors and sent to microcontroller. The data is then analyzed by the microcontroller and the result is displayed on the LCD screen on the device itself. Another copy of the sensor readings is sent remotely to the water quality monitoring user's mobile phone in the form of SMS. When an abnormal water quality parameter is detected by any sensor, the alarm system will turn on the respective red LED for that parameter and the buzzer will give warning sound. At the same time, the abnormality of the water parameter is reported to the user through SMS. The system has been designed so that it can be used for wide applications and by all kinds of users.																	1738-7906					MAY 30	2017	17	5					277	282										WOS:000412566800037

However, to solve the problem of counter-intuitive outcomes by using classical Dempster-Shafer combination rule is still an open issue while fusing the conflicting evidences. Many approaches based on discounted evidence and weighted average evidence have been investigated and have made significant improvements. Nevertheless, all of these approaches have inherent flaws. In this paper, a new weighting factor is proposed to address this problem. First, a modified dissimilarity measurement is proposed which is characterized by both distance and conflict between evidences. Second, a measurement of information volume of each evidence based on Deng entropy is introduced. Then two kinds of weight derived from aforementioned measurement are combined to obtain a new weighting factor and a weighted average method based on the new weighting factor is proposed. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. In the end, the new method is applied to a real-life application of river water quality monitoring, which effectively identify the major land use activities contributing to river pollution.																	1932-6203					MAY 25	2017	12	5							e0177695	10.1371/journal.pone.0177695								WOS:000402062800023	28542549

Predicting the impacts of Mississippi River diversions and sea-level rise on spatial patterns of eastern oyster growth rate and production	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												There remains much debate regarding the perceived tradeoffs of using freshwater and sediment diver-sions for coastal restoration in terms of balancing the need for wetland restoration versus preserving eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) production. Further complicating the issue, climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence are also expected to affect estuarine water quality. In this study, we developed a process-based numerical modeling system that couples hydrodynamic, water quality, and oyster population dynamics. We selected Breton Sound Estuary (BSE) (similar to 2740 km(2)) in the eastern Mississippi River Deltaic Plain since it is home to several of the largest public oyster seed grounds and private leases for the Gulf coast. The coupled oyster population model was calibrated and validated against field observed oyster growth data. We predicted the responses of oyster population in BSE to small-(142 m(3) s(-1)) and large-scale (7080 m(3) s(-1)) river diversions at the Caernarvon Freshwater Diversion structure planned in the 2012 Coastal Master Plan (Louisiana) under low (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative sea-level rise (RSLR=eustatic SLR+subsidence) compared to a baseline condition (Year 2009). Model results showed that the large-scale diversion had a stronger negative impact on oyster population dynamics via freshening of the entire estuary, resulting in reduced oyster growth rate and production than RSLR. Under the large-scale diversion, areas with optimal oyster growth rates (>15 mg ash-free dry weight (AFDW) oyster(-1) wk(-1)) and production (>500 g AFDW m(-2) yr(-1)) would shift seaward to the southeastern edge of the estuary, turning the estuary into a very low oyster production system. RSLR however played a greater role than the small-scale diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of oyster growth rate and production. RSLR would result in an overall estuary-wide decrease in oyster growth rate and production as a consequence of decreased salinities in the middle and lower estuary because rising sea level likely causes increased stage and overbank flow downstream along the lower Mississippi River.

Water-quality variability in dryland riverine waterholes: a challenge for ecosystem assessment	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Waterholes in intermittent dryland rivers are important biotic refugia, but detailed water-quality descriptions of these habitats are rare. Their possible variability in water quality, due to variable flow regimes, may impede development of appropriate water-quality guidelines. We investigated this issue by describing spatial and temporal variation in water quality in waterholes in a tropical Australian dryland system. Water quality varied considerably among three rivers, between sites within rivers and within sites, reflecting lithology, hydrology, bathymetry, local catchment influences, stratification and within-site patchiness. Seasonal variation was due to differences in insolation, temperature, flow and depth. Diel variation was high for pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) at some sites. Variation among locations within waterholes was low for DO, temperature and pH, but higher for chlorophyll and nutrients, due to shade-related patchy photosynthesis. Neither the rivers nor the waterholes within them could indicate water-quality reference conditions because of their different characteristics. Our results highlight the need for strategic timing and location of sampling to capture spatial and temporal variation in key water-quality variables and to identify critical ecological conditions in dryland riverine waterholes.																	0003-4088	2100-000X				MAY 22	2017	53						221	232		10.1051/limn/2017008								WOS:000412945200001

Samples were injected with fully deuterated acetaldehyde, and concentrations measured periodically by purge and trap isotope dilution GC/MS. For unfiltered seawater, measured first-order rate constants ranged from 3.3 x 10(-4) min(-1) to 5.4 x 10(-3) min(-1), with an average of 2.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(-3) min(-1). This suggests an acetaldehyde turnover in these waters ranging from 185 min to similar to 3000 min with an average of 500 min. Loss rate constants measured in seawater filtered through 0.2 mu m filters (attributed to chemical degradation) were negligible relative to those for unfiltered seawater (attributed to abiotic or biotic particles). First order rate constants in filtered seawater were on average 4 +/- 2% of those measured in unfiltered seawater. Unfiltered rate constants increased during regional rainfall events and were positively correlated with aerobic bacterial counts. The correlation was stronger in the wetter first half of the experiment (R-2 = 0.873 vs. 0.685). Correlations with bacteria levels and activation/deactivation experiments suggest that the loss in unfiltered seawater samples is driven by biotic particles rather than abiotic particles. Acetaldehyde degradation rate constants are higher than acetone degradation rate constants measured previously at the same site. Comparison with estimated photochemical production rates suggests that these waters are a source of acetaldehyde to the atmosphere. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Water quality related macroinvertebrate community responses to environmental gradients in the Portoviejo River (Ecuador)	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The Portoviejo River, located in the central western part of Ecuador, has been heavily impacted by damming, intensive agriculture and untreated wastewater discharge. Unfortunately, detailed information on the water quality and the ecological status of the Portoviejo River is not available, inhibiting decision-making and the development of water management plans. Therefore, the aims of this study were (1) to assess the ecological water quality, (2) to investigate the point along the environmental gradient where the most significant change in macroinvertebrate community occurs and (3) to find potential macroinvertebrate taxa that significantly change in abundance and frequency of occurrence along the Portoviejo River. To this end, macroinvertebrate and physico-chemical data were collected and hydro-morphological conditions were recorded at 31 locations during the dry season of 2015. The results showed that the ecological water quality of the sampling sites ranged from good to bad. In addition, the Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis was used to examine changes in macroinvertebrate communities and revealed significant community change points for sensitive taxa declining at a conductivity value of 930 (mu S.cm(-1)) and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations of 0.6 mg.L-1. In addition, the thresholds estimated for tolerant taxa were set at a conductivity value of 1430 mu S.cm(-1) and nitrate-nitrogen concentration of 2.3 mg. L. Atyidae, Corbiculidae, Thiaridae, Acari, Baetidae and Leptohyphidae can be considered indicator taxa, showing shifts in the community. This study suggests that values of conductivity and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations should not exceed the threshold levels in order to protect macroinvertebrate biodiversity in the Portoviejo River.

Emergent archetype patterns of coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical responses in catchments	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Relationships between in-stream dissolved solute concentrations (C) and discharge (Q) are useful indicators of catchment-scale processes. We combine a synthesis of observational records with a parsimonious stochastic modeling approach to test how C-Q relationships arise from spatial heterogeneity in catchment solute sources coupled with different timescales of reactions. Our model indicates that the dominant driver of emergent archetypical dilution, enrichment, and constant C-Q patterns was structured heterogeneity of solute sources implemented as correlation of source concentration to travel time. Regardless of the C-Q pattern, with weak correlation between solute-source concentration and travel time, we consistently find lower variability in C than in Q, such that the predominant solute export regime is chemostatic. Consequently, the variance in exported loads is determined primarily by variance of Q. Efforts to improve stream water quality and ecological integrity in intensely managed catchments should lead away from landscape homogenization by introducing structured source heterogeneity.

The spatial patterns of delta N-15 corresponded to the urbanization level, and the nitrogen cycle was associated with the hydrological regime at the basin level. During the high flow season of summer, nonpoint sources from fertilizer/soils and atmospheric deposition constituted the highest proportion of the total nitrogen load. The point sources from sewage/manure, with high ammonium concentrations and high delta N-15 and delta O-18 contents in the form of nitrate, accounted for the largest inputs among all sources during the low flow season of winter. Hot spot areas with heavy point source pollution were identified, and the pollutant transport routes were revealed. Nitrification widely during the warm seasons, with decreased delta O-18 values; whereas great potential for denitrification existed during the low flow seasons of autumn and spring. The study showed that point source reduction could have effects over the short-term; however, long-term efforts to substantially control agriculture nonpoint sources are essential to eutrophication alleviation for the receiving lake, which clarifies the relationship between point and nonpoint source control.

However, the relative contribution of abiotic and biotic factors to riparian denitrification capacity remains elusive. Here we report the,spatioternporal dynamics of potential and unamended soil denitrification rates in 20 wetlands along the Han River, an important water source in central China. We also quantified the abundance Of soil denitrifying microorganisms using nirK and nirS genes. Results showed that soil denitrification rates were significantly different between riparian and reservoir Shoreline wetlands, but not between mountain and lowland wetlands. In addition, soil denitrification rates showed strong seasonality, with higher values in August (summer) and April (spring) but lower values in January (winter). The potential and unamended denitrification rates were positively correlated with edaphic conditions (moisture and carbon concentration), denitrifier abundance, and plant species richness. Path analysis further revealed that edaphic conditions could regulate denitrification rates both directly and indirectly through their effects on denitrifier abundance. Our findings highlight that not only environmental factors, but also biotic factors including denitrifying microorganisms and standing vegetation, play an important role in regulating denitrification rate and N removal capacity in riparian wetlands.

Variation of Bacterial Communities with Water Quality in an Urban Tropical Catchment	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A major challenge for assessment of water quality in tropical environments is the natural occurrence and potential growth of Fecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB). To gain a better understanding of the relationship between measured levels of FIB and the distribution of sewage-associated bacteria, including potential pathogens, in the tropics this study compared the abundance of FIB (Total coliforms and E. coli) and the Bacteroidales (HF183 marker) with bacterial community structure determined by next-generation amplicon sequencing. Water was sampled twice over 6 months from 18 sites within a tropical urban catchment and reservoir, followed by extraction of DNA from microorganisms, and sequencing targeting the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that bacterial community composition (BCC) varied between reservoir and catchment, within catchment land-uses, and with E. coli concentration. B eta regression indicated that the proportion of sequences from sewage-associated taxa (SAT) or, pathogen-like sequences (PLS) were predicted most significantly by measured levels of E. coli(log MPN/100 mL) (chi(2) > 8.7; p < 0.003). In addition, SAT were significantly predicted by log HF183 levels (chi(2)=13.1; p = 0.0003) while PLS were not. Our study suggests that measurements of E. coli concentration could be useful in predicting samples enriched in sewage-associated and pathogen-like bacteria in tropical environments despite the potential for nonconservative behavior.

Predictive Power of Clean Bed Filtration Theory for Fecal Indicator Bacteria Removal in Stormwater Biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Green infrastructure (also referred to as low impact development, or LID) has the potential to transform urban stormwater runoff from an environmental threat to a valuable water resource. In this paper we focus on the removal of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB, a pollutant responsible for runoff associated inland and coastal beach closures) in stormwater biofilters (a common type of green infrastructure). Drawing on a combination of previously published and new laboratory studies of FIB removal in biofilters, we find that 66% of the variance in FIB removal rates can be explained by clean bed filtration theory (CBFT, 31%), antecedent dry period (14%), study effect (8%), biofilter age (7%), and the presence or absence of shrubs (6%). Our analysis suggests that, with the exception of shrubs, plants affect FIB removal indirectly by changing the infiltration rate, not directly by changing the FIB removal mechanisms or altering filtration rates in ways not already accounted for by CBFT. The analysis presented here represents a significant step forward in our understanding of how physicochemical theories (such as CBFT) can be melded with hydrology, engineering design, and ecology to improve the water quality benefits of green infrastructure.

Large-scale coastal land reclamation can have adverse effects on the coastal environment, including loss of marine habitats and deterioration of coastal water quality. In recent decades, coastal land reclamation has occurred extensively to meet the increasing needs of rapid economic development and urbanization in China. The overall objective of this study is to understand the coastal reclamation status of China from 1979 to 2014 and analyzed its driving factors for mitigating negative ecological effects. The data of coastal reclamation were done with the ERDAS Imagine V9.2 platform and ArcGIS software based on remote images including Landsat, SPOT, ZY-2 and ZY-3. Potential driving factors for sea reclamation were selected based on statistics bulletins and the knowledge of experts in coastal management. In order to understand the relationships among possible impact factors and coastal reclamation, the Partial Least-Squares Regression models was constructed. The analysis results indicated that the total area of reclamation was 11162.89 km(2) based on remote sensing images between 1979 and 2014. Shandong Province is the largest reclamation area, reaching 2736.54 km(2), and the reclamation is mainly concentrated in Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Liaoning, where the reclamation areas were all more than 1000 km(2). According to the remote sensing images, there are three coastal reclamation hotspot regions including Bohai bay (in which is located Liaoning, Tianjin and Hebei), Jiangsu province coastal area and Hangzhou bay (in Zhejiang province). A large scale land reclamation plan of more than 5880 km(2) has been made by local government and 2469 km(2) has approved by the State Council. From the analyzed results, there is a significant collinearity between these indicators, and no significant correlation between the area of reclamation and selected indicators. Economic development and employees in marine industries have weak positive correlation and correspondingly, the area of cultivated land (ACL) had a negative correlation. Because of the weak correlation, there is an assumption that economic development, outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth were not only was the direct driving factor, but also the outcome of coastal reclamation and population growth was not the direct driving indicator. Construction land quota and huge economic returns to local government may be the direct driving factors according to our field investigation. To resolve the contradiction between the need for land and coastal wetland conservation, it is recommended that China should establish a special management agency and coordination mechanisms, reconsidered the implementation of the reclamation plans and projects that have been approved, enhance law enforcement and increase penalties and strengthen public participation in reclamation management.

In this paper, we use a relationship between MODIS-Terra red light reflectance and total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in order to develop a fourteen-year time period of TSS estimates during which effects of storms and land cover can be studied over a large portion of the Bay. Exponential fits were most appropriate, resulting in viable reflectance TSS relationships for the five major Western Shore rivers and the Mainstem of the Bay. Other tributaries were less well-disposed for such relationships due to lack of a large range of TSS concentrations, shallow river beds, or low number of data points. Treating the entire Chesapeake as a single entity and modeling a single reflectance-TSS relationship for the entire estuary produced poorer models with less significance compared to treating each channel separately. Over 2800 rain events were studied in the Lower Western Shore between 2000 and 2014. We found some evidence that higher rainfall amounts correspond to a lower distribution of TSS concentrations 1 day following the event in forested watersheds. At rainfall events of < 50 mm, maximum TSS within one day of the storm was highly variable, suggesting that rainfall amounts alone cannot explain variation in TSS levels. Finally, we found value in the use of prediction intervals around TSS estimates, a statistical procedure uncommonly used heretofore with satellite-based estimates but which can help to determine if results are significant or not.

Substrate origin and morphology differentially determine oxygen dynamics in two major European estuaries, the Elbe and the Schelde	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The expansion of oxygen minimum zones (DMZ's) in estuaries can be harmful for ecology and economy, prompting the demand for expensive measures. Here we look at the oxygen dynamics in two northern temperate European estuaries, the Schelde (The Netherlands/Belgium) and the Elbe (Germany) and analysed data from the period of 2004-2009. The Schelde is characterized by two zones of increased oxygen consumption; the Elbe shows one zone of increased oxygen consumption. Despite reduction in biochemical oxygen demand in both estuaries, oxygen conditions improved in the Schelde estuary, while the oxygen minimum zone persisted in the Elbe estuary. To understand these different oxygen dynamics, we applied a one-dimensional reactive transport model to both estuaries. In the Schelde we found low oxygen concentrations to be related to organic matter and ammonium input from the major tributaries. In the Elbe, additionally to a high input of organic matter from upstream, oxygen dynamics were influenced by abrupt changes in estuarine morphology. Next, the origin of the organic matter substrate differs between the two estuaries. In the Elbe, the organic matter imported is mostly composed of algal die-off produced in the Elbe River upstream. In the Schelde the organic matter and ammonium input is mostly related to sewage input of anthropogenic origin. This implies that waste water treatment will be more effective to remediate hypoxia related problems in the Schelde than in the Elbe. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Alosairi, Y; Pokavanich, T				Alosairi, Yousef; Pokavanich, Tanuspong			Residence and transport time scales associated with Shatt Al-Arab discharges under various hydrological conditions estimated using a numerical model	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Over the last several decades, concerns in the Northwest Arabian Gulf have risen regarding water quality and ecological conditions, particularly near Kuwait. This interest is mainly attributed to the reduction of freshwater discharge and its associated constituents from the Shatt Al Arab as a result of human activities at diverse scales. From the hydrological perspective, the reduction has also resulted in alteration to the dynamic regime and related residence time and transport conditions. Using a previously well-validated three-dimensional numerical model of the Northern Arabian Gulf (NAG) (Alosairi and Pokavanich, 2017), the residence and transport conditions of numerical tracers have been assessed through a series of numerical tests. The results indicate that density-driven circulations have played a key role in reducing the residence time in the Northwest Gulf by approximately 15% to 20% compared to tidal forces only. The transport conditions correlated well with the Shatt Al Arab discharges, but they were only significant along the Kuwait coast due to counter-clockwise circulations and alongshore currents. Arrival times and mixing processes varied reasonably with the Shatt Al Arab discharges; the results exhibited the enhancement in mixing and transport with increases in discharge. Residence times in the NAG associated with Shatt Al Arab discharge displayed spatial variations, particularly in Kuwait Bay, where the residence time increased by 60 days during low discharge compared to high discharge.

The study was carried out at One Tree Island, southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Rates of microbioerosion and external erosion by grazing were significantly higher at the enriched sites than at the control sites. Rates of accretion by coralline algae were also significantly higher at enriched sites. In contrast, rates of macroboring were not significantly different between enriched and control sites. This study highlights the importance of improving water quality on the reef to reduce rates of bioerosion given that quantities of dead coral substrates have recently substantially increased as a result of coral bleaching (Hughes et al., 2015) and several Crown of Thorns plagues (Fabricius et al., 2010; Death et al., 2012), on the Great Barrier Reef.

We make use of both satellite SAR and MODIS-Aqua ocean color imagery to examine two different components of runoff plumes, the surface slick and the sediment discharge. We expand on earlier satellite SAR studies by examining an extensive collection of multi-platform SAR imagery, spanning from 1992 to 2014, that provides a more comprehensive view of the plume surface slick characteristics, illustrated with distribution maps of the extent and flow direction of the plumes. The SAR-detected surface plumes are compared with coincident rain and runoff measurements, and with available measured shoreline fecal bacteria loads. We illustrate differences in the detection of SAR surface plumes with the sediment-related discharge plumes derived from MODIS imagery.

We argue, however, that the direct negative effects on the symbiosis are not necessarily caused by the nutrient enrichment itself but by the phosphorus starvation of the algal symbionts that can be caused by skewed nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratios. We exposed corals to imbalanced N:P ratios in long-term experiments and found that the undersupply of phosphate severely disturbed the symbiosis, indicated by the loss of coral biomass, malfunctioning of algal photosynthesis and bleaching of the corals. In contrast, the corals tolerated an undersupply with nitrogen at high phosphate concentrations without negative effects on symbiont photosynthesis, suggesting a better adaptation to nitrogen limitation. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed that the signatures of ultrastructural biomarkers represent versatile tools for the classification of nutrient stress in symbiotic algae.

Comparing different methods for fast screening of microbiological quality of beach sand aimed at rapid-response remediation	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												There is scientific evidence that beach sands are a significant contributor to the pathogen load to which visitors are exposed. To develop beach quality guidelines all beach zones must be included in microbiological evaluations, but monitoring methods for beach sand quality are relatively longstanding, expensive, laborious and require moderate laboratory infrastructure. This paper aimed to evaluate the microorganism activity in different beach zones applying and comparing a classical method of membrane filtration (MF) with two colorimetric screening methods based on fluorescein (FDA) and tetrazolium (TTC) salt biotransformation to evaluate a new rapid and low-cost method for beach sand microbiological contamination assessments. The colorimetric results can help beach managers to evaluate rapidly and at low cost the microbiological quality of different beach zones in order to decide whether remedial actions need to be adopted to prevent exposure of the public to microbes due to beach sand and/or water contamination.

J	Ma, DQ; Zhang, LY; Fang, QH; Jiang, YW; Elliott, M				Ma, Deqiang; Zhang, Liyu; Fang, Qinhua; Jiang, Yuwu; Elliott, Michael			The cumulative effects assessment of a coastal ecological restoration project in China: An integrated perspective	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												Large scale coastal land-claim and sea-enclosing (CLASE) activities have caused habitat destruction, biodiversity losses and water deterioration, thus the local governments in China have recently undertaken seabed dredging and dyke opening (SDADO) as typical ecological restoration projects. However, some projects focus on a single impact on hydrodynamic conditions, water quality or marine organisms. In a case study in Xiamen, China, an integrated effects assessment framework centres on ecohydrology, using modeling of hydrodynamic conditions and statistical analysis of water quality, was developed to assess the effects of ecological restoration projects. The benefits of SDADO projects include improving hydrodynamic conditions and water quality, as a precursor to further marine biological improvements. This study highlights the need to comprehensively consider ecological effects of SDADO projects in the planning stage, and an integrative assessment method combining cumulative effects of hydrodynamic conditions, water quality and biological factors.

Snow disappearance timing is dominated by forest effects on snow accumulation in warm winter climates of the Pacific Northwest, United States	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Forests modify snow processes and affect snow water storage as well as snow disappearance timing. However, forest influences on snow accumulation and ablation vary with climate and topography and are therefore subject to temporal and spatial variability. We utilize multiple years of snow observations from across the Pacific Northwest, United States, to assess forest-snow interactions in the relatively warm winter conditions characteristic of maritime and transitional maritime-continental climates. We (a) quantify the difference in snow magnitude and disappearance timing between forests and open areas and (b) assess how forest modifications of snow accumulation and ablation combine to determine whether snow disappears later in the forest or in the open. We find that snow disappearance timing at 12 (out of 14) sites ranges from synchronous in the forest and open to snow persisting up to 13weeks longer in the open relative to a forested area. By analyzing accumulation and ablation rates up to the day when snow first disappears from the forest, we find that the difference between accumulation rates in the open and forest is larger than the difference between ablation rates. Thus, canopy snow interception and subsequent loss, rather than ablation, set up longer snow duration in the open. However, at two relatively windy sites (hourly average wind speeds up to 8 and 17m/s), differential snow disappearance timing is reversed: Snow persists 2-5weeks longer in the forest. At the windiest sites, accumulation rates in the forest and open are similar. Ablation rates are higher in the open, but the difference between ablation rates in the forest and open at these sites is approximately equivalent to the difference at less windy sites. Thus, longer snow retention in the forest at the windiest sites is controlled by depositional differences rather than by reduced ablation rates. These findings suggest that improved quantification of forest effects on snow accumulation processes is needed to accurately predict the effect of forest management or natural disturbance on snow water resources.

Annual runoff assessment in arid and semiarid Mediterranean watersheds under the Budyko's framework	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The solution of many practical water problems is strictly connected to the availability of reliable and widespread information about runoff. The estimation of mean annual runoff and its interannual variability for any basin over a wide region, even if ungauged, would be fundamental for both water resources assessment and planning and for water quality analysis. Starting from these premises, the main aim of this work is to show a new approach, based on the Budyko's framework, for mapping the mean annual surface runoff and deriving the probability distribution of the annual runoff in arid and semiarid watersheds. As a case study, the entire island of Sicily, Italy, is here proposed. First, time series data of annual rainfall, runoff, and reconstructed series of potential evapotranspiration have been combined within the Budyko's curve framework to obtain regional rules for rainfall partitioning between evapotranspiration and runoff. Then this knowledge has been used to infer long-term annual runoff at the point scale by means of interpolated rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. The long-term annual runoff raster layer has been obtained at each pixel of the drainage network, averaging the upstream runoff using advanced spatial analysis techniques within a GIS environment. Furthermore, 2 alternative methods are here proposed to derive the distribution of annual runoff, under the assumption of negligible interannual variations of basin water storage. The first method uses Monte Carlo simulations, combining rainfall and potential evapotranspiration randomly extracted from independent distributions. The second method is based on a simplification of the Budyko's curve and analytically provides the annual runoff distribution as the derived distribution of annual rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. Results are very encouraging: long-term annual runoff and its distribution have been derived and compared with historical records at several gauged stations, obtaining satisfactory matching.

Water and nitrogen movement through a semiarid dryland agricultural catchment: Seasonal and decadal trends	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Water and nutrient budgets in dryland agroecosystems are difficult to manage for efficiency and water quality. This is particularly true where complex terrain and soilscapes interact with pronounced hydrologic seasonality. The purpose of this research was to understand water and hydrologic nitrogen (N) export from a hillslope dryland agroecosystem in a semiarid region where most precipitation occurs outside the growing season. We studied 13years (2001-2013) of records of water and N inputs and outputs from a 12ha no-till artificially drained catchment in the semiarid Palouse Basin of eastern Washington State, USA. Fall- and winter-dominated annual precipitation averaged 462mm. About 350mm went to evapotranspiration; crops used similar to 160mm from stored soil water during the summer dry-down season. Soil water replenishment after crop senescence, during the fall wet-up season, delayed the threshold onset of the high-discharge season until December. Winter-dominated drainage fluxes averaged 111mm or 24% of annual precipitation. Nitrate export in drainage averaged 15kgNha(-1)year(-1), which was about 10 times the average rate of dissolved organic N export and 15% of the average rate of N application in chemical fertilizer. Fertilizer applications to the catchment were reduced, due to cropping changes, by 1/3 during the last 5years of the study; however, no corresponding reduction was observed in the nitrate export flux. This lack of change could not be attributed to mineralization of the soil-organic N legacy of fertilization nor to hydrologic lag of the catchment. Likeliest explanations are (a) despite the reduction, N application continued to exceed crop uptake and accumulation in organic matter; (b) seasonal and interannual variability of catchment connectivity resulted in year-to-year field-scale nitrate storage and carryover. Water and N use efficiencies observed here may be near maximum obtainable for existing crops in this climate. Substantial improvements that would also address multiple environmental issues associated with the N cascade may involve shifts to perennial systems and/or rotations in which N is fixed biologically.					/0000-0002-0446-2806												0885-6087	1099-1085				MAY 15	2017	31	10					1889	1899		10.1002/hyp.11152								WOS:000400854700005						
J	Nieminen, M; Sarkkola, S; Lauren, A				Nieminen, Mika; Sarkkola, Sakari; Lauren, Ari			Impacts of forest harvesting on nutrient, sediment and dissolved organic carbon exports from drained peatlands: A literature review, synthesis and suggestions for the future	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We reviewed the studies on the impacts of forest harvesting on nutrient, sediment, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) exports from drained peatlands with the aim to identify the best practices for mitigation of detrimental water quality impacts. We concluded that so far there are no such practices that would effectively mitigate all harmful consequences of forest harvestings concurrently. Controlling water levels by executing drainage operations immediately after harvesting may decrease the exports of easily soluble and redox-sensitive elements, but the very intensive drainage necessary to lower water levels in highly decomposed peats, as those that typify peats at the clear-felling phase, would result in large exports of sediments and mineral nitrogen. Establishing a wetland buffer area between a forest harvested peatland and the receiving water course may decrease sediment and inorganic nutrient exports, but restored wetland buffers, in particular, may act as a source of DOC and dissolved organic nutrients to receiving water courses. Whole-tree harvesting might decrease nutrient exports in blanket peat areas, but its practical application is hindered by nutritional and forest harvest technology related aspects. We propose that future studies should focus on assessing the impacts of partial harvestings, which so far have received very limited attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although still little is known about the ecological consequences of altered hydromorphology, understanding the factors at play can contribute to sustainable environmental management. In this study we aimed to identify the hydromorphological features controlling a key ecosystem function and the spatial scales where such linkages operate. As hydromorphological and chemical pressures often occur in parallel, we examined the relative importance of hydromorphological and chemical factors as determinants of leaf breakdown. Leaf breakdown assays were investigated at 82 sites of rivers throughout the French territory. Leaf breakdown data were then crossed with data on water quality and with a multi-scale hydro morphological assessment (i.e. upstream catchment, river segment, reach and habitat) when quantitative data were available. Microbial and total leaf breakdown rates exhibited differential responses to both hydromorphological and chemical alterations. Relationships between the chemical quality of the water and leaf breakdown were weak, while hydromorphological integrity explained independently up to 84.2% of leaf breakdown. Hydrological and morphological parameters were the main predictors of microbial leaf breakdown, whereas hydrological parameters had a major effect on total leaf breakdown, particularly at large scales, while morphological parameters were important at smaller scales. Microbial leaf breakdown were best predicted by hydromorphological features defined at the upstream catchment level whereas total leaf breakdown were best predicted by reach and habitat level geomorphic variables. This study demonstrates the use of leaf breakdown in a biomonitoring context and the importance of hydromorphological integrity for the functioning of running water. It provides new insights for environmental decision-makers to identify the management and restoration actions that have to be undertaken including the hydromorphogical features that should be kept in minimal maintenance to support leaf breakdown.

J	Su, Y; Gao, B; Mao, L				Su, Yu; Gao, Bin; Mao, Liang			Concurrent agglomeration and straining govern the transport of C-14-labeled few-layer graphene in saturated porous media	WATER RESEARCH												Deposition of graphene on environmental surfaces will dictate its transport and risks. In this work, the deposition, mobilization, and transport of C-14-labeled few-layer graphene (FLG) in saturated quartz sand were systematically examined. Increasing solution ionic strength (IS) (1-100 mmol/L NaCl) resulted in greater retention of FLG (33-89%) in the sand and more hyper-exponential distribution of FLG along the sand column. Only a small fraction (<= 7.4%) of the retained FLG was remobilized due to perturbation of IS by deionized water. These results indicate that trapping in pore spaces (i.e., physical straining) plays a dominant role in FLG deposition rather than attachment onto the surfaces of the sand. When IS, FLG input concentration, and flow velocity favor particle-particle interaction over particle-collector interaction, concurrent agglomeration within the pores promotes straining. In addition, electrostatic and steric repulsion that derived from the adsorbed organic macromolecules on FLG effectively reduced agglomeration and thereby enhanced transport and release of FLG. Moreover, the recovery of FLG (that deposited at 100 mmol/L NaCl) in the effluent reached 33% after speeding up the deionized water flushing rate. These findings highlight the need for FLG management in view of variations in transport behavior when assessing water quality and associated risks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Krueger, T				Krueger, Tobias			Bayesian inference of uncertainty in freshwater quality caused by low-resolution monitoring	WATER RESEARCH												Regulatory, low temporal resolution monitoring of freshwater quality does not fully capture the frequency distributions of the requisite parameters, particularly those that are highly skewed and heavy tailed. Hence the summary statistics ultimately compared to environmental standards are uncertain. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for robust water quality assessment and possible remediation, but requires strong assumptions. This paper compares three ways to model the missing data needed to fully characterise a frequency distribution in a Bayesian framework using multi-year/multi-location orthophosphate (arithmetic mean standard), dissolved oxygen (DO; 10th percentile standard) and ammonia (90th percentile standard) data from the Tamar catchment in Southwest England. First, fitting an assumed parametric model of the frequency distribution (lognormal or Weibull), there is appreciable uncertainty around the "best" model fit. Second, Bayesian Model Averaging is more general in accommodating cases where the data are ambiguous with regard to the best model, but does not take into account possibly missing data. Third, a quasi-nonparametric multinomial model of the monitoring process that places some weight on those missing data yields wider and heavier-tailed frequency distributions. One-at-a-time sensitivity analysis suggests that the multinomial model for mean orthophosphate is sensitive to the choice of support range and the prior weights given to the missing data. Sensitivity is lower for 10th percentile DO and 90th percentile ammonia. The resultant probability densities of ecological status under the EU Water Framework Directive span several status classes, meaning ecological status is more uncertain than previously acknowledged. For orthophosphate, the regulatory, empirical determination of ecological status is not only overly precise but also biased. (C) 2017 The Author.

J	Wan, YS; Wan, L; Li, YC; Doering, P				Wan, Yongshan; Wan, Lei; Li, Yuncong; Doering, Peter			Decadal and seasonal trends of nutrient concentration and export from highly managed coastal catchments	WATER RESEARCH												Understanding anthropogenic and hydro-climatic influences on nutrient concentrations and export from highly managed catchments often necessitates trend detection using long-term monitoring data. This study analyzed the temporal trend (1979-2014) of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and export from four adjacent coastal basins in south Florida where land and water resources are highly managed through an intricate canal network. The method of integrated seasonal-trend decomposition using LOESS (LOcally weighted regrESSion) was employed for trend detection. The results indicated that long-term trends in TN and TP concentrations (increasing/decreasing) varied with basins and nutrient species, reflecting the influence of basin specific land and water management practices. These long-term trends were intervened by short-term highs driven by high rainfall and discharges and lows associated with regional droughts. Seasonal variations in TP were more apparent than for TN. Nutrient export exhibited a chemostatic behavior for TN from all the basins, largely due to the biogenic nature of organic N associated with the ubiquity of organic materials in the managed canal network. Varying degrees of chemodynamic export was present for TP, reflecting complex biogeochemical responses to the legacy of long-term fertilization, low soil P holding capacity, and intensive stormwater management. The anthropogenic and hydro-climatic influences on nutrient concentration and export behavior had great implications in nutrient loading abatement strategies for aquatic ecosystem restoration of the downstream receiving waterbody.

With a global focus, the pertinent practical, theoretical and social aspects of RWH are reviewed in order to ascertain the state of the art. Avenues for future research are also identified. A major finding is that the degree of RWH systems implementation and the technology selection are strongly influenced by economic constraints and local regulations. Moreover, despite design protocols having been set up in many countries, recommendations are still often organized only with the objective of conserving water without considering other potential benefits associated with the multiple-purpose nature of RWH. It is suggested that future work on RWH addresses three priority challenges. Firstly, more empirical data on system operation is needed to allow improved modelling by taking into account multiple objectives of RWH systems. Secondly, maintenance aspects and how they may impact the quality of collected rainwater should be explored in the future as a way to increase confidence on rainwater use. Finally, research should be devoted to the understanding of how institutional and socio-political support can be best targeted to improve system efficacy and community acceptance.

Both nanoSiO(2)-added PCNS and nanoFe-added PCNI had a higher compressive strength (similar to 17 MPa), a greater resistance to abrasion (<30% mass loss), and a better water quality improvement (<12 Water Quality Index) and runoff volume control (>8 mm/s permeability) than other two PCs. Nevertheless, the production of the nanomaterial-added PCs was costly than the control PCCT. For those areas where a high compressive strength is not required, a cost-effective (similar to$360/m(3)) PCCT could manage stormwater well for runoff quality and volume. Although PCGP could be produced with a high-volume FA substitution (60%), it was poor in other four criteria, especially in the compressive strength (4.7 MPa) and physical durability (59% mass loss).

GPs should be captured at source before the material clogs the drainage network, seals the infiltration capacity of side entry pits or affects the aquatic life in receiving waters. BMPs intended to reduce stormwater pollutants include oil and grit separators, grassed swales, vegetated filter strips, retention' ponds, and catch basin inserts (CBIs) are used to remove GP at the source and have no extra land use requirement because they are typically mounted within a catch basin (e.g. side entry pits; grate or gully pits). In this study, a new type of CBI, recently developed by Urban Stormwater Technologies (UST) was studied for its performance at a site in Gosnells, Western Australia. This new type of CBI can capture pollutants down to particle sizes of 150 pm while retaining its shape and pollutant capturing capacity for at least 1 year. Data on GP and associated water samples were collected during monthly servicing of CBIs for one year. The main component of GPs was found to be vegetation (93%): its accumulation showed a strong relationship (r(2) = 0.9) with rainfall especially during the wet season. The average accumulation of total GP load for each CBI was 384 kg/ha/yr (dry mass) with the GP moisture content ranging from 24 to 52.5%. Analysis of grain sizes of GPs captured in each CBI showed similar distributions in the different CBIs. The loading rate coefficient (K) calculated from runoff and GP load showed higher K-values for CBI located near trees. The UST developed CBI in this study showed higher potential to capture GPs down to 150 pm in diameter than similar CBI devices described in previous studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A 22-indicator system was established that was based on the major ecosystem services of Lake Biwa and its water courses, i.e., provisioning services regarding aquatic products and water; regulating services regarding floods and water quality; cultural services regarding recreation and tourism, scientific research, and environmental education; and supporting services regarding biodiversity. First, changes in the eight ecosystem services were discussed together with the considerable experience and difficult lessons that can be drawn from the development trajectory. Next, with the indicators rearranged according to sustainability principles, the regional sustainability over the past six plus decades was assessed. In general, this urban agglomeration has been progressing in terms of its sustainability, although economic and social development was achieved at the cost of environmental degradation in the past, and the current economic downturn is hurting the balanced development and integrated benefits. The results lead directly to recommendations for regional development, especially in terms of economic rejuvenation, from the perspective of improving management of Lake Biwa's water resources. Moreover, the relevant knowledge is educational and inspirational for other places in the world that are facing similar development issues. For example, the effective and even pioneering countermeasures that have been taken against environmental degradation, as well as the participation and collaboration of multiple stakeholders, could be useful as a model. Moreover, the study invites increased understanding of ecosystem vulnerability to anthropogenic devastation and emphasizes the priority of precautionary measures over countermeasures in the context of holistic urban planning and sustainable urban development.

Enteric viruses and adenovirus diversity in waters from 2016 Olympic venues	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Rio de Janeiro's inner and coastal waters are heavily impacted by human sewage pollution for decades. Enteric viruses, including human adenoviruses (HAdV), human enterovirus (EV), group A rotavirus (RV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) are more likely to be found in contaminated surface waters. The present work aimed to assess the frequency and loads of EV, HAdV-C and -F species, RV and HAV in sand and water samples from venues used during the 2016 Summer Olympics and by tourists attending the event. Sixteen monthly collections were carried out from March 2015 to July 2016 in 12 different sites from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Total and thermotolerant coliform counting was performed along molecular detection of virus was performed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Analyses of all samples were further investigated by integrated cell culture PCR to check about the presence of HAdV infectious virus particles. The results show that 95.9% of water samples showed contamination with at least one type of virus. Regarding the viruses individually (% for water and sand respectively): HAdV-C (93.1%-57.8%), HAdV-F (25.3%-0%), RV (12.3%-4.4%), EV (26.7%-8.8%) and HAV (0%). The viral loads ranged from 103 gc/L up to 10(9) gc/L (water), and 10(3) gc/g to 10(6) gc/g (sand). In the phylogenetic tree, were classified into four main clusters, referring to species C, D, F and BAdV. And up to 90% of sites studied presented at least once presence of infectious HAdV-C. The most contaminated points were the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, where Olympic rowing took place, and the Marina da Gloria, the starting point for the sailing races, demonstrating serious problem of fecal contamination of water resources and threatens the health of Olympic athletes, tourists and residents.

Drainage water management combined with cover crop enhances reduction of soil phosphorus loss	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Integrating multiple practices for mitigation of phosphorus (P) loss from soils may enhance the reduction efficiency, but this has not been studied as much as individual ones. A four-year study was conducted to determine the effects of cover crop (CC) (CC vs. no CC, NCC) and drainage water management (DWM) (controlled drainage with sub-irrigation, CDS, vs. regular free tile drainage, RFD) and their interaction on P loss through both surface runoff (SR) and tile drainage (ID) water in a day loam soil of the Lake Erie region. Cover crop reduced SR flow volume by 32% relative to NCC, regardless of DWM treatment. In contrast, CC increased ID flow volume by 57 and 9.4% with CDS and RFD, respectively, compared to the corresponding DWM treatment with NCC The total (SR + TD) field water discharge volumes were comparable amongst all the treatments. Cover crop reduced flow-weighted mean (FWM) concentrations of particulate P (PP) by 26% and total P (TP) by 12% in SR, while it didn't affect the FWM dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentration, regardless of DWM treatments. Compared with RFD, CDS reduced FWM DRP concentration in TD water by 19%, while CC reduced FWM PP and TP concentrations in ID by 21 and 17%, respectively. Total (SR + TD) soil TP loss was the least with CDS-CC followed by RFD-CC, CDS-NCC, and RFD-NCC. Compared with RFD-NCC, currently popular practice in the region, total TP loss Was reduced by 23% with CDS-CC The CDS-CC system can be an effective practice to ultimately mitigate soil P loading to water resource.

Therefore, effective assessment methods addressing multiple pressures are needed. In addition, these systems have to be harmonised (i.e. intercalibrated) to achieve common management objectives across Europe. Assessments of fish communities inform environmental policies on ecological conditions integrating the impacts of multiple pressures. However, the challenge is to ensure consistency in ecological assessments through time, across ecosystem types and across jurisdictional boundaries. To overcome the serious comparability issues between national assessment systems in Europe, a total anthropogenic pressure intensity (TAPI) index was developed as a weighted combination of the most common pressures in European lakes that is validated against 10 national fish-based Water quality assessment systems using data from 556 lakes. Multi-pressure indices showed significantly higher correlations with fish indices than single-pressure indices. The best-performing index combines eutrophication, hydromorphological alterations and human use intensity of lakes. For specific lake types also biological pressures may constitute an important additional pressure. The best-performing index showed a strong correlation with eight national fish-based assessment systems. This index can be used in lake management for assessing total anthropogenic pressure on lake ecosystems and creates a benchmark for comparison of fish assessments independent of fish community composition, size structure and fishing-gear. We argue that fish-based multiple-pressure assessment tools should be seen as complementary to single-pressure tools offering the major advantage of integrating direct and indirect effects of multiple pressures over large scales of space and time.

Specimens of the Neotropical fish, Astyanax altiparanae, were confined for 168 h in three lakes along the stream. Additionally, during the weeks of in situ exposure, wild specimens of this species were collected from the same sites. Biochemical biomarkers were analyzed, such as phase I biotransformation enzyme 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and phase II biotransformation enzyme glutathione S-transferase, and we also determined hepatic and branchial levels of non-protein thiols (NPSH), oxidative damage such as lipid peroxidation (LPO), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in muscle and brain. Genetic biomarkers such as DNA breaks (comet assay), frequency of micronuclei (MN) and erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) were also examined. The results indicate that the most sensitive biomarkers for discriminating contamination levels are DNA breaks, LPO and AChE activity. Similar results were obtained for both caged and feral fish. The biomarkers that reflect the results of cumulative events, such as ENA, were more discriminative for chronically exposed specimens (feral fishes). Analyzing biomarkers using an integrated response index showed that both approaches (using feral and caged A. altiparanae) were effective for discriminating contamination levels along the stream, corroborating the results of chemical analyses for selected pesticides. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of biomarker selection and show that both approaches (caged and feral fish) are satisfactory for evaluating Water quality in streams impacted by agricultural activities.

These measures were: buffer strips, pernianent grassland in the lowest 7% of arable fields, dry detention bunds, wetlandS, and temporary barriers such as sediment fences. Baseline field P export was estimated using export coefficients (low risk crops) or a modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (high risk crops). The impact of measures Was estimated using simple equations. Costs were estimated from gross margin losses or local data on grants. We used a net cost:benefit (NCB) factor to normalise the costs and impacts of each measure over time. Costs minimisation for target impact was done using PuLP, a linear programming module for Pythoh, across 1634 riparian and non-riparian fields in the Lunan Water, a mixed arable catchment in Eastern Scotland. With all measures in place, average cost-effectiveness increases from 9 pound to 48 pound/kg P as target P mitigation increases from 500 to 2500 kg P across the catchment. Costs increase significantly when the measures available are restricted only to those currently eligible for government grants (buffers, bunds and wetlands). The assumed orientation of the average field slope makes a strong difference to the potential for storage of water by bunds and overall cost-effectiveness, but the non-funded measures can substitute for the extra expense incurred by bunds, where the slope orientation is not suitable. Economic discounting over time of impacts and costs of measures favours those measures, such as sediment fences, which are strongly targeted both spatially and temporally. This tool could be a useful guide for dialogue with land users about the potential fields to target for mitigation to achieve catchment targets. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Geochemical and mineralogical characterization of sulfur and iron in coal waste rock, Elk Valley, British Columbia, Canada	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Exposure of coal waste rock to atmospheric oxygen can result in the oxidation of sulfide minerals and the release of sulfate (SO42-) and associated trace elements (e.g., Se, As, Cd, and Zn) to groundwaters and surface waters. Similarly, reduced iron minerals such as siderite, ankerite, and the sulfide, pyrite, present in the waste rock can also undergo oxidation, resulting in the formation of iron oxyhydroxides that can adsorb trace elements released from the oxidation of the sulfide minerals. Characterization and quantification of the distribution of sulfide and iron minerals, their oxidation products, as well as leaching rates are critical to assessing present-day and future impacts of SO42- and associated trace elements on receiving waters. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopic analysis of coal waste rock samples from the Elk Valley, British Columbia showed Fe present as pyrite (mean 6.0%), siderite (mean 443%), goethite (mean 35.4%), and lepidocrocite (mean 14.3%) with S present as sulfide (mean 26.9%), organic S (mean 58.7%), and SO42- (mean 14.4%). Squeezed porewater samples from dump solids yielded mean concentrations of 0.28 mg/L Fe and 1246 mg/L SO42-. Geochemical modeling showed the porewaters in the dumps to be supersaturated with respect to Fe oxyhydroxides and undersaturated with respect to gypsum, consistent with solids analyses. Coupling Fe and S mineralogical data with long-term water quality and quantity measurements from the base of one dump suggest about 10% of the sulfides (which represent 2% of total S) in the dump were oxidized over the past 30 years. The S from these oxidized sulfides was released to the receiving surface water as SO42- and the majority of the Fe precipitated as secondary Fe oxyhydroxides (only 3.0 x 10(-5)% of the Fe was released to the receiving waters over the past 30 years). Although the data suggest that the leaching of SO42- from the waste rock dump could continue for about 300 years, assuming no change in the rate of oxidation of sulfides, SO42- is currently not a concern in receiving surface waters as the concentration levels are below regulatory limits.

Eight catchments were included: three mesotrophic (one undrained control, two treatments), two ombrotrophic (one drained control, one treatment) and three oligotrophic catchments (one undrained control, two treatments). Three calibration years and four post-restoration years were included in the data from seven catchments, for which runoff was recorded. For one mesotrophic treatment catchment only one year of pre-restoration and two years of post-restoration water quality data is reported. Restoration was done by filling in and damming the ditches. Water samples were collected monthly-biweekly during the snow-free period; runoff was recorded continuously during the same period. Water quality was estimated for winter using ratios derived from external data. Runoff for non-recorded periods were estimated using the FEMMA model. A high impact on DOC, nitrogen (N) and phosporus (P) was observed in the mesotrophic catchments, and mostly no significant impact in the nutrient-poor catchments. The DOC load from one catchment exceeded 1000 kg (restored-ha)(-1) in the first year; increase of DOC concentration from 50 to 250 mg l(-1) was observed in the other mesotrophic treatment catchment. Impact on total nitrogen export of over 30 kg (restored-ha)(-1) was observed in one fertile catchment during the first year. An impact of over 5 kg (restored-ha()-1) on ammonium export was observed in one year in the mesotrophic catchment. Impact on P export from the mesotrophic catchment was nearly 5 kg P (restored-ha)(-1) in the first year. The results imply that restoration of nutrient-rich forestry-drained peatlands poses significant risk for at least short term elevated loads degrading the water quality in receiving water bodies. Restoration of nutrient-poor peatlands poses a minor risk in comparison. Research is needed regarding the factors behind these risks and how to mitigate them. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite diatom-based indices are known to respond fastly to water quality degradation, they are not designed to precisely identify the nature of pressures co-occurring in the environment. Based on large scale monitoring data, we aimed at building models able to estimate the risk of stream impairment by many types of anthropogenic pressures from taxonomy based and trait-based characteristics of diatom assemblages. Random forest models were built to individually evaluate the impairment risk of diatom assemblages for six chemical and five hydromorphological or land-use related pressure categories. Eight models provided good impairment risk assessment (Area Under the Curve >= 0.70). Under multi-pressure scenarios, models built for chemical pressures exhibited a better accuracy than hydromorphological or land-use related ones. Models were able to detect both ecological restoration and degradation, based on long-term surveys. These models have been implemented in a R user-friendly routine, to help stream managers to early identify degrading processes and prioritize management actions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing agricultural land use is associated with the spread of an invasive fish (Gambusia affinis)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Land-use change and invasive species pose major threats to ecosystems globally. These stressors can act together, with disturbance due to changes in land-use facilitating invasion. We examined the potential for agricultural land use to facilitate the establishment and population growth (abundance) of a globally invasive fish (Gambusia affinis). To achieve this we examined Gambusia presence, abundance, and life history traits in 31 streams spanning an agricultural land use gradient in the North Island of New Zealand. We used regression models to quantify the relationship between agricultural land use and in-stream physiochemical and habitat variables, and zero-inflated models to explore the relationship among physiochemical, habitat and catchment-scale variables and Gambusia's distribution and abundance. The percentage of the catchment in agricultural land use was associated with changes to physiochemical and habitat conditions. Increasing agricultural land use was associated with increasing macrophyte cover and water temperature and decreasing velocity in streams. Catchment-scale variables (land use and site position in the network) and water temperature were the most important determinants of whether Gambusia dccurred at a site. Local in-stream habitat (macrophyte cover and Water velocity) and nutrient conditions were the most influential predictors of Gambusia abundance given Gambusia were present. Gambusia life-history traits, sex ratio and body length varied among sites but were not predicted by physiochemical gradients. The distribution of Gambusia in streams in New Zealand is partially controlled by catchment-scale conditions via a combination of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering, both of which are affected by agricultural land use. Agricultural land use alters local in-stream conditions, resulting in systems that are similar to those in Gambusia's natural range; these altered systems have the potential to support an increased abundance of Gambusia. This study provides preliminary quantitative evidence that agricultural land use is related to the spread of a globally invasive freshwater fish. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Intra-annual variation of the association between agricultural best management practices and stream nutrient concentrations	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Temporal variation may influence the ability of best management practices (BMPs) to Mitigate the loss of agricultural pollutants to streams. Our goal was to assess variation in mitigation effects of BMPs by examining the associations between instream nutrient concentrations and the abundance and location of four structural BMPs over a hydrologic year. Water samples were collected monthly (Nov. 2013-Oct. 2014) in 15 headwater streams representing a gradient of BMP use in Southern Ontario, Canada. Partial least squares (PLS) regression models were used to associate two groups of collinear nutrient forms with the abundance and location of BMPs, antecedent precipitation and time of year. BMP metrics in PLS models were associated with instream concentrations of major phosphorus forms and ammonium throughout the year. In contrast, total nitrogen and nitrate-nitrite were only associated with BMPs during snowmelt. BMP metrics associated with reductions of phosphorus and ammonium included greater abundances of riparian buffers and manure storage structures, but not livestock restriction fences. Likewise, the abundance and location riparian vegetation in areas capturing more surface runoff were associated With decreased stream nitrogen concentrations during snowmelt. However, the amount of tile drainage was associated with increased nitrogen concentrations following snowmelt, as well as with greater phosphorUs and ammonium concentrations throughout the year. Overall, our findings indicate that increasing the abundance of riparian buffers and manure storage structures may decrease instream nutrient concentrations in agricultural areas. Additionally, the implementation of these structural BMPs appear to be an effective yearround strategy to assist management objectives in reducing phosphorus concentrations in small agricultural streams and thus loadings to downstream tributaries. Further mitigation measures, such as managerial BMPs and controlled tile drainage, may be required to further reduce instream nutrient concentrations during baseflow periods and snowmelt events.

This study evaluates differences in water quality due to land use in the upper transboundary catchment of the river Nisa (694 km(2)) in the Czech German-Polish triangle. Water samples collected weekly from the river and its tributaries at 29 sampling sites were analysed for a total of 25 parameters, including nutrients, major ions, major elements and traces of heavy metals. Each sampling site represents a sub catchment characterized by a specific composition of 8 land-use categories. Cluster analysis has been applied to divide the sub catchments into five land-use classes. When all measured parameters were taken into account, this statistical method resulted in six groups of sampling sites that are similar in their chemical water composition and that, at the same time, reflects the land use, regardless of sub-catchment size. Water quality was particularly affected by the portions of settlement areas and arable land. Sub catchments which were mainly forested (above 70%) show the smallest level of concentration for all monitored parameters (except Cd, Mn, SO4). Densely populated areas reduce water quality despite high proportions of forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Cui, WH; Chui, TFM				Cui, Wenhui; Chui, Ting Fong May			Temporal variations in water quality in a brackish tidal pond: Implications for governing processes and management strategies	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Brackish tidal ponds have been constructed along coastal areas in many parts of the world for aqua culture, including some Ramsar Sites. Such ponds are considered a sustainable, wise use of wetlands if managed properly, but they can also pose serious environmental problems if mismanaged. To understand the governing processes and to promote sustainable management strategies, this study examines the different temporal variations in water quality parameters in a brackish tidal pond located within the wetland complex of the Mai Po Ramsar Site in Hong Kong, China. The variations are compared with those of the receiving bay, and the water channel that connects the pond and the bay. Equations are then developed to link the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the pond with the governing processes, and to analyze their relative contributions to DO levels. Field data show seasonal patterns in water temperature and salinity in response to the seasonal variations in solar radiation and rainfall. For the pond and the channel, DO, chlorophyll and pH exhibit fortnightly variations due to the bi-weekly water exchange between the pond and the bay. There were also diurnal variations in water temperature and DO in response to changes in solar radiation for both locations, and the tidal flushing for the water channel. Analysis of the findings indicates that water exchange influences the DO concentration more strongly than solar radiation. The DO equation links pond water quality with the time of day, and the time in a water exchange cycle, and thus provides some guidance for determining water exchange and water sampling schedules. The study sheds light on the governing processes and management strategies related to the sustainable management of a brackish tidal pond. The results are thus beneficial in elucidating and promoting the sustainable management and wise use of wetlands in other locations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Clogging in permeable concrete: A review	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Permeable concrete (or "pervious concrete" in North America) is used to reduce local flooding in urban areas and is an important sustainable urban drainage system. However, permeable concrete exhibits reduction in permeability due to clogging by particulates, which severely limits service life. This paper reviews the clogging mechanism and current mitigating strategies in order to inform future research needs. The pore structure of permeable concrete and characteristics of flowing particulates influence clogging, which occurs when particles build-up and block connected porosity. Permeable concrete requires regular maintenance by vacuum sweeping and pressure washing, but the effectiveness and viability of these methods is questionable. The potential for clogging is related to the tortuosity of the connected porosity, with greater tortuosity resulting in increased potential for clogging. Research is required to develop permeable concrete that can be poured on -site, which produces a pore structure with significantly reduced tortuosity.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Temporal performance assessment of wastewater treatment plants by using multivariate statistical analysis	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												For most water treatment plants, a significant number of performance data variables are attained on a time series basis. Due to the interconnectedness of the variables, it is often difficult to assess over -arching trends and quantify operational performance. The objective of this study was to establish simple and reliable predictive models to correlate target variables with specific measured parameters. This study presents a multivariate analysis of the physicochemical parameters of municipal wastewater. Fifteen quality and quantity parameters were analyzed using data recorded from 2010 to 2016. To determine the overall quality condition of raw and treated wastewater, a Wastewater Quality Index (WWQI) was developed. The index summarizes a large amount of measured quality parameters into a single water quality term by considering pre -established quality limitation standards. To identify treatment process performance, the interdependencies between the variables were determined by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The five extracted components from the 15 variables accounted for 75.25% of total dataset information and adequately represented the organic, nutrient, oxygen demanding, and ion activity loadings of influent and effluent streams. The study also utilized the model to predict quality parameters such as Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Phosphorus (TP), and WWQI. High accuracies ranging from 71% to 97% were achieved for fitting the models with the training dataset and relative prediction percentage errors less than 9% were achieved for the testing dataset. The presented techniques and procedures in this paper provide an assessment framework for the wastewater treatment monitoring programs.(C)2017 Elesvier Ltd.All rights reserved.																	0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY 15	2017	193						234	246		10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.02.027								WOS:000397687100024	28226260					
J	Beck, NG; Conley, G; Kanner, L; Mathias, M				Beck, Nicole G.; Conley, Gary; Kanner, Lisa; Mathias, Margaret			An urban runoff model designed to inform stormwater management decisions	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												We present an urban runoff model designed for stormwater managers to quantify runoff reduction benefits of mitigation actions that has lower input data and user expertise requirements than most commonly used models. The stormwater tool to estimate load reductions (TELR) employs a semi distributed approach, where landscape characteristics and process representation are spatially -lumped within urban catchments on the order of 100 acres (40 ha). Hydrologic computations use a set of metrics that describe a 30 -year rainfall distribution, combined with well -tested algorithms for rainfall runoff transformation and routing to generate average annual runoff estimates for each catchment. User inputs include the locations and specifications for a range of structural best management practice (BMP) types. The model was tested in a set of urban catchments within the Lake Tahoe Basin of California, USA, where modeled annual flows matched that of the observed flows within 18% relative error for 5 of the 6 catchments and had good regional performance for a suite of performance metrics. Comparisons with continuous simulation models showed an average of 3% difference from TELR predicted runoff for a range of hypothetical urban catchments. The model usually identified the dominant BMP outflow components within 5% relative error of event -based measured flow data and simulated the correct proportionality between outflow components. TELR has been implemented as a web -based platform for use by municipal stormwater managers to inform prioritization, report program benefits and meet regulatory reporting requirements (www.swtelr.com).(C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.																	0301-4797	1095-8630				MAY 15	2017	193						257	269		10.1016/jjenvman.2017.02.007								WOS:000397687100026	28226262

The most effective strategy under given conditions is often unclear to these stakeholders as it requires insight into several aspects of the contaminants such as sources, properties, and mitigation options. Furthermore the various parties in the urban water cycle are not always aware of each other's requirements and priorities. Processes to set priorities and come to agreements are lacking, hampering the articulation and implementation of possible solutions. To support decision makers with this task, a decision support system was developed to serve as a point of departure for getting the relevant stakeholders together and finding common ground. The decision support system was iteratively developed in stages. Stakeholders were interviewed and a decision support system prototype developed. Subsequently, this prototype was evaluated by the stakeholders and adjusted accordingly. The iterative process lead to a final system focused on the management of contaminants of emerging concern within the urban water cycle, from wastewater, surface water and groundwater to drinking water, that suggests mitigation methods beyond technical solutions. Possible wastewater and drinking water treatment techniques in combination with decentralised and nontechnical methods were taken into account in an integrated way. The system contains background information on contaminants of emerging concern such as physical/chemical characteristics, toxicity and legislative frameworks, water cycle entrance pathways and a database with associated possible mitigation methods. Monitoring data can be uploaded to assess environmental and human health risks in a specific water system. The developed system was received with great interest by potential users, and implemented in an international water cycle network. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

An economic inquisition of water quality trading programs, with a case study of Jordan Lake, NC	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												A water quality trading (WQT) program was promulgated in North Carolina to address water quality issues related to nutrients in the highly urbanizing Jordan Lake Watershed. Although WQT programs are appealing in theory, the concept has not proved feasible in several attempts between point and nonpoint polluters in the United States. Many application hurdles that create wedges between success and failure have been evaluated in the literature. Most programs, however, face multiple hurdles; eliminating one may not clear a pathway to success. Therefore, we identify and evaluate the combined impact of four different wedges including baseline, transaction cost, trading ratio, and trading cost in the Jordan Lake Watershed program. Unfortunately, when applied to the Jordan Lake program, the analysis clearly shows that a traditional WQT program will not be feasible or address nutrient management needs in a meaningful way. The hurdles individually would be difficult to overcome, but together they appear to be unsurmountable. This analysis shows that there is enough information to pre-identify potential hurdles that could inform policy makers where, and how, the concept might work. It would have saved time, energy, and financial resources if North Carolina had done so before embarking to implement their program in the Jordan Lake Watershed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluating the impacts of agricultural land management practices on water resources: A probabilistic hydrologic modeling approach	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Evaluating the effectiveness of agricultural land management practices in minimizing environmental impacts using models is challenged by the presence of inherent uncertainties during the model development stage. One issue faced during the model development stage is the uncertainty involved in model parameterization. Using a single optimized set of parameters (one snapshot) to represent baseline conditions of the system limits the applicability and robustness of the model to properly represent future or alternative scenarios. The objective of this study was to develop a framework that facilitates model parameter selection while evaluating uncertainty to assess the impacts of land management practices at the watershed scale. The model framework was applied to the Lake Creek watershed located in southwestern Oklahoma, USA. A two-step probabilistic approach was implemented to parameterize the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) model using global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to estimate the full spectrum of total monthly water yield (WYLD) and total monthly Nitrogen loads (N) in the watershed under different land management practices. Twenty-seven models were found to represent the baseline scenario in which uncertainty of up to 29% and 400% in WYLD and N, respectively, is plausible. Changing the land cover to pasture manifested the highest decrease in N to up to 30% for a full pasture coverage while changing to full winter wheat cover can increase the N up to 11%. The methodology developed in this study was able to quantify the full spectrum of system responses, the uncertainty associated with them, and the most important parameters that drive their variability. Results from this study can be used to develop strategic decisions on the risks and tradeoffs associated with different management alternatives that aim to increase productivity while also minimizing their environmental impacts.

J	Sari, MA; Chellam, S				Sari, Mutiara Ayu; Chellam, Shankararaman			Electrocoagulation process considerations during advanced pretreatment for brackish inland surface water desalination: Nanofilter fouling control and permeate water quality	DESALINATION												Pretreatment with coupled aluminum electrocoagulation (EC) - microfiltration (MF) successfully mitigated colloidal and organic fouling during nanofiltration (NF) of an inland natural brackish surface water. Natural organic matter (NOM) removal by EC was enhanced due to (i) greater degree of NOM protonation by maintaining a slightly acidic pH during electrolysis, compared with that of minimum aluminum solubility (pH of 5.5 compared to 6.2), (ii) providing sufficient contact time during electrolysis and flocculation by utilizing intermediate current density (10 mA/cm(2)), and (iii) combination of charge neutralization and sweep coagulation by increasing aluminum dosage. Direct evidence for removal of the hydrophobic fraction of NOM along with a portion of the hydrophilic moieties by EC-MF compared to MF-only was provided by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. NF flux profiles with EC-MF pretreatment of natural saline water were nearly identical to that of a model solution with similar ionic composition with no added NOM suggesting insignificant role of organic fouling. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed trace amounts of CaCO3 precipitates after EC-MF pretreatment, confirmed by electron microscopy, that caused only minor flux decline. Finally, NF achieves excellent strontium removal as well as other divalent ions and. NOM. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite its numerous advantages over culture-based monitoring approaches, qPCR monitoring has yet to become widely used in the US or elsewhere. Considering qPCR results obtained on a given day as the best available measure of that day's water quality, we evaluated the frequency of correct vs. incorrect beach management decisions that are driven by culture testing. Methods: Beaches in Chicago, USA, were monitored using E. coli culture and enterococci qPCR methods over 894 beach-days in the summers of 2015 and 2016. Agreement in beach management using the two methods, after taking into account agreement due to chance, was summarized using Cohen's kappa statistic. Results: No meaningful agreement (beyond that expected by chance) was observed between beach management actions driven by the two pieces of information available to beach managers on a given day: enterococci qPCR results ofsamples collected that morning and E. coli culture results of samples collected the previous day. The E. coli culture beach action value was exceeded 3.4 times more frequently than the enterococci qPCR beach action value (22.6 vs. 6.6% of beach-days). Conclusions: The largest evaluation of qPCR-based beach monitoring to date provides little scientific rationale for continued E. coli culture testing of beach water in our setting. The observation that the E. coli culture beach action value was exceeded three times as frequently as the enterococci qPCR beach action value suggests that, although the beach action values for bacteria using different measurement methods are thought to provide comparable information about health risk, this does not appear to be the case in all settings.

A 3D graphene-based biosensor as an early microcystin-LR screening tool in sources of drinking water supply	ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA												Recent advances in graphene synthesis and understanding of properties have led to enormous applications in a variety of areas. Graphene and its unique electrical properties can favor electrochemical biosensor applications for aqueous toxin monitoring. Graphene-based biosensors can be used as an alternative to time-consuming, expensive and non-portable conventional methods of analysis involved in water quality monitoring and assessment. In this work, we showcased a three-dimensional (3D) graphene-based biosensor for microcystin-LR (MC-LR) detection and quantification. We report the efficient functionalization and immobilization of microcystin-LR and its antibodies on the facile synthesized CVD 3D graphene. The modified graphene electrodes were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to electrochemically characterize the biochemical events on the electrodes. Specifically, as-prepared 3D graphene-based biosensors can detect MC-LR with remarkable sensitivity due to its macro-porous structure and large surface area, and high conductivity. A very good linear correlation of the electron-transfer resistance (R-2 = 0.93) was achieved over 0.05 and 20 mu g/L MC-LR concentration range. Also, a detection limit of 0.05 mu g/L was accomplished, which is much lower than the World Health Organization (WHO) provisional guideline limit of MC-LR concentration (i.e. 1 mu g/L) in drinking water.

Heavy metals in the order of Fe > Mn > Zn > Co > Ni > Cu =Cr were present in the waste water. Gills had high metal load followed by liver and then kidney. Albumin, albumin to globulin (A: G) ratio, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) were found to be lower but phospholipid, low density lipoprotein (LDL), total protein, lipid and cholesterol were higher as compared to the reference. Oxidative stress markers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S transferase (GST) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were significantly higher in all tissues, whereas reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were comparatively low. Damage to DNA was observed with significantly higher mean tail length of comets in the exposed fish gill cells (30.9 mu m) followed by liver (24.3 mu m) and kidney (20.6 mu m) as compared to reference fish (5.2, 4.8 and 5.9 mu m respectively). Histopathology in gill, liver and kidney also showed marked damage. Integrated biochemical, oxidative stress, genotoxicity and histopathological findings are valuable biomarkers for native fish adaptive patterns, and monitoring of water quality/ pollution of freshwater ecosystems.																	2045-2322					MAY 10	2017	7								1675	10.1038/s41598-017-01749-6								WOS:000400886100015	28490783					
J	Reder, K; Alcamo, J; Florke, M				Reder, Klara; Alcamo, Joseph; Floerke, Martina			A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a continental-scale water quality model of pathogen pollution in African rivers	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Continental-scale water quality modeling is a new scientific approach concerned with computing the level of water pollution for several river basins at once. Uncertainties in these models, and in models of smaller scale, arise especially from the specification of model parameters. To identify and analyze these uncertainties we perform a global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling on the WorldQual water quality model. The focus of the analysis is the river pathogen model of WorldQual as applied to rivers in Africa. This is the first uncertainty and sensitivity analysis performed on a continental-scale pathogen river pollution model. The median output uncertainty of the model (coefficient of variation, based on log-transformed data), assuming plausible estimates of 42 parameter uncertainties, was 10.7%; 90% of grid cells had output uncertainties below 23%. The parameters making the largest contribution to this uncertainty (in order of importance) are the pathogen waste loading per capita, the in-stream settling velocity of pathogens, the percentage of population in a river basin connected to a sewer system, and the raw effluent concentration from the manufacturing sector. Over the continental study area, model output uncertainty and the most sensitive parameters were found to have a highly irregular spatial pattern. This finding suggests that model performance is a strong function of local and regional conditions and that reducing the uncertainty of a single parameter may not lead to large improvements in model performance over the entire continent. A more efficient approach would be to improve model performance region-by-region and improve the estimation of specific parameters known to have a large influence on model uncertainty in those regions. The analysis showed that only four parameters dominate output uncertainty over 93% of the study area, implying that model performance can be substantially improved by reducing the uncertainty of a small number of parameters.

Potential of floating production for delta and coastal cities	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												The disruption of nutrient cycles caused by human activities such as agriculture and burning fossil fuels is impacting ecosystem services on global and local scales. The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to rising global temperatures and ocean acidification, whereas the accumulation of nutrients in water systems is leading to degradation of water quality and biodiversity. City populations play a major role in carbon dioxide and nutrient emissions as 'end consumers' of resources. The current challenge towards more resource-efficient cities is to transform urban metabolism from linear to cyclical. Discharged nutrients and carbon dioxide can be used as input for algae, which fixate carbon very efficiently into energetic storage compounds as starch or lipids. However, cities often lack the space to implement large-scale algae production. This article evaluates the potential of reusing nutrients and carbon dioxide to produce algae, food and biofuel on water nearby coastal and delta cities. First, nutrients and carbon dioxide discharge is estimated and two scenarios are developed. From the cities nutrient production, the potential algal yield is evaluated and translated into feed, food and oil yields. Two delta cities are chosen as case studies: Rotterdam and Metro Manila. The conclusion of this article is that Floating Production can help cities increasing their resilience in the field of food and energy. Floating Production can also contribute to a solution for global land shortage. The combination of food and energy production with floating urban development provides a climate-proof urban expansion in delta and coastal areas. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Detailed NMR investigation of cyclodextrin-perfluorinated surfactant interactions in aqueous media	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are contaminants of serious concern because of their toxicological properties, widespread presence in drinking water sources, and incredible stability in the environment. To assess the potential application of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrins for PFC remediation, we investigated their complexation with linear fluorinated carboxylic acids, sulfonates, and a sulfonamide with carbon backbones ranging from C4-C9. F-19 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies demonstrated beta-CD formed the strongest complexes with these PFCs. The polar head group had a modest influence, but for PFCs with backbones longer than six carbons, strong association constants are observed for 1:1 (K-1:1 similar to 10(5) M-1) and 2:1 (K-2:1 similar to 10(3) M-1) beta-CD:PFC complexes. Excess beta-CD can be used to complex 99.5% of the longer chain PFCs. Competition studies with adamantane-carboxylic acid and phenol confirmed the nature and persistence of the beta-CD:PFC complex. Detailed analyses of the individual NMR chemical shifts and Job plots indicate the favored positions of the beta-CD along the PFC chain. Solution pH, ionic strength, and the presence of humic acid have modest influence on the 13-CD:PFC complexes. The strong encapsulation of PFCs by (beta-CD under a variety of water quality conditions demonstrates the tremendous potential of CD-based materials for the environmental remediation of PFCs.

Application of Moringa Oleifera seed extract to treat coffee fermentation wastewater	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Wastewater generated from wet processing of coffee cherries degrades stream water quality downstream of processing mills and impacts human health. The widespread popularity of coffee as an export makes this a global problem, although the immediate impact is local. Approximately 40% of all coffee around the world is wet processed, producing wastewater rich in organic nutrients that can be hazardous to aquatic systems. Moringa Oleifera Seed Extract (MOSE) offers promise as a local and affordable "appropriate" coagulation technology for aiding in the treatment of coffee wastewater. Field research was conducted at the Kauai Coffee Company to investigate the application of MOSE to treat coffee fermentation wastewater (CFW). Coagulation tests were conducted at five pH CFW levels (3-7) and MOSE doses (0-4 g/L). After settling, TSS, COD, nitrate, nitrite, total nitrogen, and pH of supernatant from each test were measured. MOSE reduced TSS, COD, nitrate, and nitrite in CFW to varying degrees dependent on pH and dose applied. TSS removal ranged from 8% to 54%. Insoluble COD removal ranged from 26% to 100% and total COD removal ranged from 1% to 25%. Nitrate and nitrite reduction ranged from 20% to 100%. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Comparison of three corrosion inhibitors in simulated partial lead service line replacements	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Partial lead service line replacements (PLSLR) were simulated using five recirculating pipe loops treated with either zinc orthophosphate (1 mg/L as P), orthophosphate (1 mg/L as P) or sodium silicate (10 mg/L). Two pipe loops served as "inhibitor-free" (Pb-Cu) and "galvanic free" (Pb-PVC) controls. Changes in water quality (CSMR [0.2 or 1], conductivity[approximate to 330 mu S/cm or approximate to 560 mu S/cm], chlorine [1.4mg/L]) were not observed to provide a significant impact on lead or copper release, although galvanic corrosion was shown to be a driving factor. Generally, both orthophosphate and zinc orthophosphate provided better corrosion control for both total and dissolved lead (30 min, 6 h, 65 h) and copper (30 min, 6 h), when compared to either the inhibitor-free control or the sodium silicate treated system. This work highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay of corrosion inhibitors on particulate and dissolved species when considering both lead and copper. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, it is shown that a low-cost nanocomposite sponge prepared by growing selenium (Se) nanomaterials on the surface and throughout the bulk of a polyurethane sponge exhibits a record breaking-mercury ion (Hg2+) removal rate, regardless of the pH. The exposure of aqueous solutions containing 10 mg L-1-12 ng L-1 Hg2+ to the sponge for a few seconds results in clean water with undetectable mercury levels (detection limit: 0.2 ng L-1). Such performance is far below the acceptable limits in drinking water (2 mu g L-1), industrial effluents (0.2 mu g L-1), and the most stringent surface water quality standards (1.3 ng L-1). The sponge shows a unique preference for Hg, does not retain water nutrients, and can significantly reduce the concentration of other heavy metal pollutants. Furthermore, the sponge shows no cytotoxic effect on human cells while exhibiting strong antimicrobial properties. The high affinity of Hg for Se results in irreversible sequestration and detoxification of mercury by the sponge, confirming the suitability for landfill disposal.

Allelic Variation in Outer Membrane Protein A and Its Influence on Attachment of Escherichia coli to Corn Stover	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Understanding the genetic factors that govern microbe-sediment interactions in aquatic environments is important for water quality management and reduction of waterborne disease outbreaks.

In this study we explored the attachment of 78 Escherichia coli environmental isolates to corn stover, a representative agricultural residue. Outer membrane proteome analysis led to the observation of amino acid variations, some of which had not been previously described, in outer membrane protein A (OmpA) at 10 distinct locations, including each of the four extracellular loops, three of the eight transmembrane segments, the proline-rich linker and the dimerization domain. Some of the polymorphisms within loops 1, 2, and 3 were found to significantly co-occur. Grouping of sequences according to the outer loop polymorphisms revealed five distinct patterns that each occur in at least 5% of our isolates. The two most common patterns, I and II, are encoded by 33.3 and 20.5% of these isolates and differ at each of the four loops. Statistically significant differences in attachment to corn stover were observed among isolates expressing different versions of OmpA and when different versions of OmpA were expressed in the same genetic background. Most notable was the increased corn stover attachment associated with a loop 3 sequence of SNFDGKN relative to the standard SNVYGKN sequence. These results provide further insight into the allelic variation of OmpA and implicate OmpA in contributing to attachment to corn stover.

Microplastics in the gastrointestinal tracts of fish and the water from an urban prairie creek	FACETS												Microplastics are defined as any plastic with a diameter <= 5 mm. Problems associated with these plastics such as contamination of both marine and freshwater environments and ingestion by aquatic organisms are of increasing concern. Our study quantifies the number of microplastics in a prairie creek immediately downstream of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. Water samples and five species of fish were collected from sample sites upstream and downstream of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in the summers of 2015 and 2016. Samples were digested in either a Fe(II)/H2O2 or NaClO solution and observed under a microscope where plastics present were enumerated by colour and type. At least one microplastic was detected in 73.5% of fish and 95.6% of water samples, showing that the creek does, in fact, contain microplastics. Concentrations were higher in water from upstream sites, likely due to dilution of creek water by the release of treated effluent. The results of this study provide baseline conditions for the presence of plastics in the creek prior to a major upgrade of the WWTP scheduled for completion in 2016.																	2371-1671					MAY 2	2017	2						395	409		10.1139/facets-2017-0008								WOS:000409850200001

Path to Impact for Autonomous Field Deployable Chemical Sensors: A Case Study of in Situ Nitrite Sensors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Natural freshwater systems have been severely affected by excess loading of macronutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus) from fertilizers, fossil fuels, and human and livestock waste. In the USA, impacts to drinking water quality, biogeochemical cycles, and aquatic ecosystems are estimated to cost US$210 billion annually: Field-deployable nutrient sensors (FDS) offer potential to support research and resource management efforts by acquiring higher resolution data than are currently supported by expensive conventional sampling methods. Following nearly 40 years of research and development, FDS instruments are now starting to penetrate commercial markets. However, instrument uncertainty factors (high cost, reliability, accuracy, and precision) are key drivers impeding the uptake of FDS by the majority of users. Using nitrite sensors as a case study, we review the trends, opportunities, and challenges in producing and implementing FDS from a perspective of innovation and impact. We characterize the user community and consumer needs, identify trends in research roaches, tabulate state-of-the-art examples and specifications, and, discuss data life, cycle considerations. With further development of FDS through prototyping and testing in real-world applications, these tools can deliver information for protecting and restoring natural waters, enhancing process control for industrial operations and water treatment, and providing novel research insights.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY 2	2017	51	9					4755	4771		10.1021/acs.est.6b06171								WOS:000400723200004	28332819

Occurrence and In Vitro Bioactivity of Estrogen, Androgen, and Glucocorticoid Compounds in a Nationwide Screen of United States Stream Waters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												In vitro bioassays are sensitive, effect-based tools used to quantitatively screen for chemicals with nuclear receptor activity in environmental samples. We measured in vitro estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity, along with a broad suite of chemical analytes, in streamwater from 35 well-characterized sites (3 reference and 32 impacted) across 24 states and Puerto Rico. ER agonism was the most frequently detected with nearly all sites (34/35) displaying activity (range, 0.054(-1)16 ng E2Eq L-1). There was a strong linear relationship (r2 = 0.917) between in vitro ER activity and concentrations of steroidal estrogens after correcting for the in vitro potency of each compound. AR agonism was detected in 5/35 samples (range, 1.6-4.8 ng DHTEq L-1) but concentrations of androgenic compounds were largely unable to account for the in vitro activity. Similarly, GR agonism was detected in 9/35 samples (range, 6.0-43 ng DexEq L-1); however, none of the recognized GR-active compounds on the target-chemical analyte list were detected. The utility of in vitro assays in water quality monitoring was evident from both the quantitative agreement between ER activity and estrogen concentrations, as well as the detection of AR and GR activity for which there were limited or no corresponding target-chemical detections to explain the bioactivity. Incorporation of in vitro bioassays as complements to chemical analyses in standard water quality monitoring efforts would allow for more complete assessment of the chemical mixtures present in many surface waters.

Use of Multiple Linear Regression Models for Setting Water Quality Criteria for Copper: A Complementary Approach to the Biotic Ligand Model	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs) for metals are widely applied in ecological risk assessments and in the development of regulatory water quality guidelines in Europe, and in 2007 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommended BLM-based water quality criteria (WQC) for Cu in freshwater. However, to-date, few states have adopted BLM-based Cu criteria into their water quality standards on a state-wide basis, which appears to be due to the perception that the BLM is too complicated or requires too many input variables. Using the mechanistic BLM framework to first identify key water chemistry parameters that influence Cu bioavailability, namely dissolved organic carbon (DOC), pH, and hardness, we developed Cu criteria using the same basic methodology used by the USEPA to derive hardness-based criteria but with the addition of DOC and pH. As an initial proof of concept, we developed stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) models for species that have been tested over wide ranges of DOC, pH, and hardness conditions. These models predicted acute Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of +/- 2 in 77% to 97% of tests (5 species had adequate data) and chronic Cu toxicity values that were within a factor of +/- 2 in 92% of tests (1 species had adequate data). This level of accuracy is comparable to the BLM. Following USEPA guidelines for WQC development, the species data were then combined to develop a linear model with pooled slopes for each independent parameter (i.e., DOC, pH, and hardness) and species-specific intercepts using Analysis of Covariance. The pooled MLR and BLM models predicted species-specific toxicity with similar precision; adjusted R2 and R2 values ranged from 0.56 to 0.86 and 0.66-0.85, respectively. Graphical exploration of relationships between predicted and observed toxicity, residuals and observed toxicity, and residuals and concentrations of key input parameters revealed many similarities and a few key distinctions between the performances of the two models. The pooled MLR model was then applied to the species sensitivity distribution to derive acute and chronic criteria equations similar in form to the USEPAs current hardness-based criteria equations but with DOC, pH, and hardness as the independent variables. Overall, the MLR is less responsive to DOC than the BLM across a range of hardness and pH conditions but more responsive to hardness than the BLM. Additionally, at low and intermediate hardness, the MLR model is less responsive than the BLM to pH, but the two models respond comparably at high hardness. The net effect of these different response profiles is that under many typical water quality conditions, MLR- and BLM-based criteria are quite comparable. Indeed, conditions where the two models differ most (high pH/low hardness and low pH/high hardness) are relatively rare in natural aquatic systems. We suggest that this MLR-based approach, which includes the mechanistic foundation of the BLM but is also consistent with widely accepted hardness-dependent WQC in terms of development and form, may facilitate adoption of updated state-wide Cu criteria that more accurately account for the parameters influencing Cu bioavailability than current hardness-based criteria.

The objective of this study was to evaluate drinking water quality for beef cattle in the cow-calf operation through calculation of a water quality index (WQI) that relates water physical-chemical composition with common cattle drinking water sources. The study was conducted in 25 cattle ranches of the cow-calf system in seven municipalities of Chihuahua, Mexico. In all cattle ranches, water samples were collected from the main water sources, and physical and chemical parameters were analyzed. Statistical analyses were done through Kruskal-Wallis test, considering water sources (WS) as a source of variation. The WQI was calculated considering the parameters closely related to animal health and productivity and following standard procedures. Most parameters showed high variation among WS. The only parameters in uenced by WS were pH, As (p < 0.05) and Co (p < 0.01). The parameters that surpassed the optimum level for cattle drinking were turbidity for all WS and Mn for earthen tank and spring/river water. Groundwater showed the best quality with a 50.34 WQI, corresponding to good class. Earthen tank water also corresponded to good class with a 98.8 WQI, while spring/river water was classi ed as poor water for cattle with a 114.47 WQI.																	2007-901X					MAY-AUG	2017	4	11					331	340		10.19136/era.a4n11.1071								WOS:000424596700013

In microbiological analysis, 288 samples showed positive results for indicator microorganisms, occurring an increase of 80% in the rainy season compared with the dry period. Physico-chemical analysis: in 1514 samples, lithium concentration was equal to or higher than the detection limit of the method; the nitrate concentration was greater than the maximum value allowed in 17 samples; 1730 samples showed fluoride content out-of-range of drinking pattern; bromate concentration was greater than the maximum value allowed in 16 samples; the pH value was outside the range recommended in 161 samples; 292 samples showed levels of free residual chlorine (FRC) outside the recommended range; 17 samples showed apparent color values above the maximum allowed; 13 samples showed turbidity values above the maximum allowed. By means of principal components analysis, it was possible to discriminate the waters of the region, with the formation of groups of municipalities with similar physico-chemical profiles, generating a mapping based on prominent variables.																	2317-269X					MAY	2017	5	2					53	63		10.22239/2317-269x.00862								WOS:000424344800007

Semi-volatile organic pollutants in Jordanian surface water	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Jordan relies heavily on rainwater stored in reservoirs because it has extremely limited alternative water resources. These reservoirs are essential for drinking water and irrigation, so monitoring their water quality is extremely important. In this study we monitored 55 semi-volatile organic chemicals (SVOCs) in monthly samples from the Zarqa River and three reservoirs between April and August 2010, and also screened the samples for non-target pollutants. Twelve SVOCs were detected and quantified at King Talal Dam followed by ten at Zarqa River and four each at Wadi Al-Arab and Mujib dams. Phenol and phthalate esters were detected at wide range concentrations (0.01-25 mu g/L) in all water samples. Phenol has the highest level at the Zarqa River (18.5 +/- 5.5 mu g/L) followed by King Talal (12.5 +/- 2.5 mu g/L) and Wadi Al-Arab (2.5 +/- 0.63 mu g/L). Phthalate esters (total) were detected at the Zarqa River, King Talal, Wadi Al-Arab, and Mujib dams at levels 3.85, 3.75, 1.03 and 0.12 mu g/L. Other contaminants, including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were detected at low concentrations in the King Talal Dam reservoir and Zarqa River samples. Two non-targeted phosphate plasticizers, tri-n-butylphosphate and tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate were identified in the July and August Zarqa River samples. A comparison study reveals that SVOC pollution of surface water in Jordan is within acceptable international limits, but long-term monitoring programs should be implemented.

In view of the above, this study aims to evaluate the water quality index of a water body that receives treated industrial effluent. The work was developed in the Rio Pessegueirinho located in the municipality of Curitibanos/SC, through parameters established by the Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental - CETESB of the state of Sao Paulo, obtaining a poor to optimum index. The study site has a "Good" quality classification due to its variation between 51 and 79, however the interaction of the industrial effluent even though it was with the values of release according to the pertinent legislation presented a negative interaction, since the greater the anthropic interaction greater loss of water body quality. Thus, the present study aims at the importance of monitoring the WQI by the present company and other companies that release their effluents directly into water bodies.																	2236-1170					MAY-AUG	2017	21	2					179	185		10.5902/2236117028220								WOS:000418850200008

Even, the oxygen concentration in surface waters is a main indicator of the water quality for human use as well as for the aquatic biota. Air entrainment on stepped spillway is also recognised for its contribution to the oxygen transfer. The oxygen transfer on stepped spillways in skimming flow regime is increased due to earlier self-aeration and slower flow velocities in comparison to smooth spillways. This paper presents the results gained on a physical model by using a variety of different configurations of stepped spillway. The slopes of stepped spillway (theta) used are 30 degrees and 45 degrees, the number of step (N) are 40 and 20, and two types of steps are flat steps and pooled steps. The experiments were conducted for ten Froude number (Fr) run ranging from 1.117 to 9.909. This research aimed to investigate the influence of different configuration in stepped spillway for predicting of dissolved oxygen. The results showed that the dissolved oxygen of the stepped spillway increases with an increase in chute of slope, number of step, and surface roughness on steps. The increases of Froude number as a function of discharge will cause turbulence flow becomes decreases, and the concentration of air bubble in the water will be decreased. The decreased value of turbulence flow will make dissolved oxygen level decrease. In skimming flow condition, the dissolved oxygen level decreases with increasing discharge per unit width especially for steep bed slope.																	0127-9696	2180-3722				MAY	2017	79	4					73	79										WOS:000418501800009

Ralstonia pickettii (ST.1) and Chryseobacterium gambrini (ST.2) were isolated from river Nile during increasing ammonia concentration and identified morphologically using enrichment technique then molecularly using 16S rDNA gene. The isolates were tested against the environmental conditions temperature and conductivity) during 25 days to detect the most optimum conditions for isolates growth. The tested isolates were evaluated for ammonia bioremecliation in aquatic system. The results showed that the optimum degree pH for the growth of Ammonia removal isolates (ST.1) and (ST.2) were 7. The temperature 35 C appeared to be the optimum degree for the growth of isolate (ST.1) while 30 degrees C optimum degree for the growth of isolates (ST.2). Ralstonia pickettii (STl) and Chryseobacterium gambrini (ST.2) have the ability to grow in conductivity 2000p.s/cm after incubation period 25 days. Application confirmed that ability of isolates (ST.1) and (ST.2) to remove ammonia co f concentration were (82%) and (84.5%), respectively while mixture from two isolates was able to remove 91.8/0 ammonia concentration. The results showed that isolates have substrate specificity on other substances as chlorinated pesticides and crystal violet dye. In conclusion, biorennediation by mixture of R. pickettii (ST,1) and C. gambrini (ST.2) isolates were considered to be effective method for ammonia removal in aqueous media (river Nile); this study useful for eradication the ammonia problems in river Nile.																	0975-8585					MAY-JUN	2017	8	3					497	505										WOS:000410665400059

A Self-Sufficient Reservoir Directorate with Capacity-Velocity Sensing Using Android App.	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												Nowadays the rate of rainfall is increasing in an irregular rate. Rain water can be treated and used efficiently for various purposes. So, the rainwater can be stored in the dam as backwater and can be used later. For this, wireless sensor network is used in which the water filling level is designed with level sensors to measure water levels in DAM. When the level is high, the water will be released from the dam. The speed of the water being released will also be monitored. Another device on the river bank will monitor the level of the water in the river. The details of the level and speed are sent to the server wirelessly.

It integrates numerical simulation, meta-modeling analysis, and fuzzy programming within a general framework. A set of models between remediation strategies and remediation performance can well guarantee the mitigation in computational efforts in the simulation and optimization process. In order to prevent the occurrence of over-optimistic and pessimistic optimization strategies, a high satisfaction level resulting from the implementation of a flexible standard can indicate the degree to which the environmental standard is satisfied. The proposed approach is applied to a naphthalene-contaminated site in China. Results show that a longer remediation period corresponds to a lower total pumping rate and a stringent risk standard implies a high total pumping rate. The wells located near or in the down-gradient direction to the contaminant sources have the most significant efficiency among all of remediation schemes.																	1061-4303	1554-7531				MAY 1	2017	89	5					456	465		10.2175/106143017X14839994523541								WOS:000411925000008	28442006

Physical and isotopic characteristics in peri-urban landscapes: a case study at the lower Volta River Basin, Ghana	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The study presents the application of selected multivariate techniques: display methods (principal component analysis) and unsupervised pattern recognition (cluster analysis) in an attempt to discriminate sources of variation of water quality. PCA has allowed the identification of a reduced number of latent factors with a hydrochemical meaning: natural and anthropogenic (domestic and agricultural activities) factors, which also agrees with the R-mode hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Q-mode HCA also corroborates the results of the correlation analysis in relation to sampling sites established on hydrochemical parameters, indicating that there are no spatial and temporal characteristics among the sampling sites in the study area. The suitability of river water for irrigation use was assessed in the study area. A plot of the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and salinity data on a semilog axis suggests that river water provides good irrigation quality in the area. According to the SAR values plotted in the USSL Staff diagram, 100 % of the river water samples fall in C1S1 (low salinity-low sodium type) group, which provides good irrigation quality to river water from this area. Also, all the data points showed permeability index values in Class II category which is suitable for irrigation purposes. Recorded magnesium ratio and Kelly's ratio showed that <50 % of the river water samples were suitable for irrigation purposes. Stable isotope data of water (delta O-18 and delta H-2) obtained revealed that stream waters joining the Volta River were depleted and possibly recharged by rain and waters from the Akwapim Mountains (located at the western part of the Volta River) than the isotopically heavy evaporated waters found within the Lower Volta River. These results would therefore be useful for water balance studies in the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					729	744		10.1007/s13201-015-0286-y								WOS:000411081600017

Subba			Geochemical evolution of groundwater in the Western Delta region of River Godavari, Andhra Pradesh, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The present study on geochemical evolution of groundwater is taken up to assess the controlling processes of water chemistry in the Western Delta region of the River Godavari (Andhra Pradesh), which is one of the major rice-producing centers in India. The study region is underlain by coarse sand with black clay (buried channels), black silty clay of recent origin (floodplain) and gray/white fine sand of modern beach sediment of marine source (coastal zone), including brown silty clay with fine sand (paleo-beach ridges). Groundwater is mostly brackish and very hard. It is characterized by Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+:HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > NO3-, Na+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+:Cl- > HCO3- > SO42-, and Mg2+ > Na+ > Ca2+ > or < K+:HCO3- > Cl- > or > SO42- facies. The ionic relations (Ca2+ + Mg2+:HCO3-, Ca2+ + Mg2+:SO42- + HCO3-, Na+ + K+:TC, Na+ + K+:Cl- + SO42-, HCO3-: TC, HCO3-: Ca2+ + Mg2+, Na+:Cl- and Na+:Ca2+) indicate that the rock weathering, mineral dissolution, evaporation and ion exchange are the processes to control the aquifer chemistry. Anthropogenic and marine sources are also the supplementary factors for brackish water quality. These observations are further supported by Gibbs mechanisms that control the water chemistry. Thus, the study suggests that the initial quality of groundwater of geogenic origin has been subsequently modified by the influences of anthropogenic and marine sources.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					813	822		10.1007/s13201-015-0294-y								WOS:000411081600024

Application of multivariate statistical analysis concepts for assessment of hydrogeochemistry of groundwater-a study in Suri I and II blocks of Birbhum District, West Bengal, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Multivariate statistical techniques, cluster and principal component analysis were applied to the data on groundwater quality of Suri I and II Blocks of Birbhum District, West Bengal, India, to extract principal factors corresponding to the different sources of variation in the hydrochemistry as well as the main controls on the hydrochemistry. For this, bore well water samples have been collected in two phases, during Post-monsoon (November 2012) and Pre-monsoon (April 2013) from 26 sampling locations spread homogeneously over the two blocks. Excess fluoride in groundwater has been reported at two locations both in post-and in pre-monsoon sessions, with a rise observed in pre-monsoon. Localized presence of excess iron has also been observed during both sessions. The water is found to be mildly alkaline in post-monsoon but slightly acidic at some locations during pre-monsoon. Correlation and cluster analysis studies demonstrate that fluoride shares a moderately positive correlation with pH in post-monsoon and a very strong one with carbonate in pre-monsoon indicating dominance of rock water interaction and ion exchange activity in the study area. Certain locations in the study area have been reported with less than 0.6 mg/l fluoride in groundwater, leading to possibility of occurrence of severe dental caries especially in children. Low values of sulfate and phosphate in water indicate a meager chance of contamination of groundwater due to anthropogenic factors.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					873	888		10.1007/s13201-015-0299-6								WOS:000411081600029

Assessment of heavy metal and bacterial pollution in coastal aquifers from SIPCOT industrial zones, Gulf of Mannar, South Coast of Tamil Nadu, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Heavy metals and microbiological contamination were investigated in groundwater in the industrial and coastal city of Thoothukudi. The main sources of drinking water in this area are water bores which are dug up to the depth of 10-50 m in almost every house. A number of chemical and pharmaceutical industries have been established since past three decades. Effluents from these industries are reportedly being directly discharged onto surrounding land, irrigation fields and surface water bodies forming point and non-point sources of contamination for groundwater in the study area. The study consists of the determination of physico-chemical properties, trace metals, heavy metals and microbiological quality of drinking water. Heavy metals were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry and compared with the (WHO in Guidelines for drinking water quality, 2004) standards. The organic contamination was detected in terms of most probable number (MPN) test in order to find out faecal coliforms that were identified through biochemical tests. A comparison of the results of groundwater samples with WHO guidelines reveals that most of the groundwater samples are heavily contaminated with heavy metals like arsenic, selenium, lead, boron, aluminium, iron and vanadium. The selenium level was higher than 0.01 mg/l in 82 % of the study area and the arsenic concentration exceeded 0.01 mg/l in 42 % of the area. The results reveal that heavy metal contamination in the area is mainly due to the discharge of effluents from copper industries, alkali chemical industry, fertiliser industry, thermal power plant and sea food industries. The results showed that there are pollutions for the groundwater, and the total Coliform means values ranged from 0.6-145 MPN ml(-1), faecal Coliform ranged from 2.2-143 MPN ml(-1), Escherichia coli ranged from 0.9 to 40 MPN ml(-1) and faecal streptococci ranged from 10-9.20 x 10(2) CFU ml(-1). The coastal regions are highly contaminated with total coliform bacteria, faecal coliform bacteria and E. coli. This might be due to the mixing of sewage from Thoothukudi town through the Buckle channel and fishing activity.

Temporal water quality response in an urban river: a case study in peninsular Malaysia	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Ambient water quality is a prerequisite for the health and self-purification capacity of riverine ecosystems. To understand the general water quality situation, the time series data of selected water quality parameters were analyzed in an urban river in Peninsular Malaysia. In this regard, the stations were selected from the main stem of the river as well as from the side channel. The stations located at the main stem of the river are less polluted than that in the side channel. Water Quality Index scores indicated that the side channel station is the most polluted, breaching the Class IV water quality criteria threshold during the monitoring period, followed by stations at the river mouth and the main channel. The effect of immediate anthropogenic waste input is also evident at the side channel station. The Organic Pollution Index of side channel station is (14.99) similar to 3 times higher than at stations at river mouth (4.11) and similar to 6 times higher than at the main channel (2.57). The two-way ANOVA showed significant difference among different stations. Further, the factor analysis on water quality parameters yielded two significant factors. They discriminated the stations into two groups. The land- use land cover classification of the study area shows that the region near the sampling sites is dominated by urban settlements (33.23 %) and this can contribute significantly to the deterioration of ambient river water quality. The present study estimated the water quality condition and response in the river and the study can be an immediate yardstick for base lining river water quality, and a basis for future water quality modeling studies in the region.

Surface water characteristics and trace metals level of the Bonny/New Calabar River Estuary, Niger Delta, Nigeria	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Surface water samples from three stations in the Bonny/New Calabar River Estuary were analyzed for the physicochemical characteristics and trace metal level in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Results show pH ranged from 7.56 to 7.88 mg/L; conductivity, 33,489.00 to 33,592.00 mu Scm(-1); salinity, 15.33 to 15.50 parts per thousand; turbidity, 4.35 to 6.65 NTU; total dissolved solids, 22111.00 to 23263.00 gm(-3); dissolved oxygen, 4.53 to 6.65 mg/L; and biochemical oxygen demand, 1.72 mg/L. The level of some trace metals (Ca, Mg, K, Zn, Pb, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, and Na) were also analyzed by Atomic absorption spectrometry with K, Zn, and Co being statistically significant (P < 0.05). The results were compared with USEPA and WHO Permissible Limits for water quality standards. It was observed that the water quality parameters in the Bonny Estuary show seasonal variation with higher values for pH, DO, BOD, temperature, and salinity during the dry season than wet season. Concentrations of trace metals such as Pb, Cd, Zn, Ni, and Cr were higher than stipulated limits by WHO (2006). The result of the Metal Pollution Index suggests that the river was slightly affected and therefore continuous monitoring is necessary to avert possible public health implications of these metals on consumers of water and seafood from the study area.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					951	959		10.1007/s13201-015-0306-y								WOS:000411081600035

Assessment of surface water quality of inland valleys for cropping in SW Nigeria	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Inland valley agro-ecosystems which are a category of wetlands have potential for sustainable crop production relative to uplands. A major challenge to their utilisation in the study area is their heterogeneity in hydrology, morphology, soil types and agro-economy. The study assessed the surface water quality of three typologies of the agro-ecosystems-amphitheatre-like valley-heads (Am), valley-side (VS), and low depression (LD)-for cropping. Surface water of six sites were sampled during the wet and dry seasons. The physicochemical properties and metal concentrations of the samples were analysed. Descriptive statistics and water quality indices were used to assess the suitability of the waters of the agro-ecosystems for cropping. Results showed that the valleys have neutral to slightly alkaline waters. Values of physicochemical parameters are generally within the acceptable range for cropping. The concentration of major cations varied across the inland valley types, but exhibited similar characteristics within each valley. The dominance of the major cations is in the order of Na > Ca > K > Mg. ANOVA results indicated that there is no significant difference in the concentration of heavy metals across the valleys (F = 2.044, p = 0.138, alpha = 0.05). Generally, most of the physicochemical parameters and trace metals have low concentrations and are non-toxic to plants. Values of water quality indices (sodium adsorption ratio, soluble sodium percentage, total dissolved solids and permeability index) indicated that the concentrations of minerals in waters across the valley typologies are generally within permissible limits for cropping.																	2190-5487	2190-5495				MAY	2017	7	2					987	996		10.1007/s13201-015-0309-8								WOS:000411081600037

Environmental assessment of water and soil contamination in Rajakhali Canal of Karnaphuli River (Bangladesh) impacted by anthropogenic influences: a preliminary case study	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Soil and water quality determines the health of an aquatic ecosystem. Rajakhali Canal, a tributary of Karnaphuli River estuary, flowing through Chittagong City (the commercial capital of Bangladesh) receives a huge amount of domestic and industrial wastes and sewages. Monitoring the environmental status of Karnaphuli River and its tributaries is very important for their ecological and economical services provided to city areas. This study evaluated some environmental characteristics of water and soil in the Rajakhali Canal as it affected the environment, and ultimately the life and human beings of Chittagong City. The mean concentrations of physicochemical parameters were pH (8.5), DO (0.1 mg/L), TA (47.6 mg/L), TDS (631.8 mg/L), TSS (280 mg/L), SO4-S (2.3 mg/L), NH3 (1.1 mg/L), NO3-N (0.2 mg/L) and PO4P (0.1 mg/L) in the dry season. During the rainy season, the mean concentrations of physico-chemical parameters were pH (7.01), DO (0.55 mg/L), TA (65.9 mg/L), TDS 653.6 mg/L), TSS (300.3 mg/L), SO4-S (1 mg/L), NH3- (0.6 mg/L), (NO3-N (0.3 mg/L) and PO4-P (0.5 mg/L) in water. In case of soil, the mean concentration of physicochemical parameters in dry and rainy seasons was represented respectively as follows: pH (6.8), OM (4.5 %), sand (71.7 %), silt (3.1 %), clay (25.2 %), organic nitrogen (45.4 ppm) and phosphorus (9.6 ppm); and pH (6.7), OM (4.5 %), sand (74.4 %), silt (2.4 %), clay (23.2 %), organic nitrogen (35.3 ppm) and phosphorus (7.6 ppm). The result revealed that water and soil quality of this canal became deteriorated and that the total environment of the water body became polluted due to the anthropogenic activities such as industrial, domestic and irrigation effluents. Statistical analyses also supported that water and soil parameters were strongly correlated (1tailed 0.05 level and 0.01 level significant) with each other at all stations during all seasons. The result of this study will be useful for management and planning for water quality monitoring in this estuary. To protect this vital estuarine region, the government agencies, private agencies and scientists should work with proper attention.

K.; Abraham, Marykutty			An Assessment Of Physico Chemical Charecteristics Of Nandhivaram Lake Water To Reduce Environmental Impacts	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES												Water quality of peri-urban lakes is deteriorating due to fast urbanization and industrialization. This study pertains to assessment of physico-Chemical characteristics of Nandhivaram lake for effective mangement of lakes. Water samples were collected during the Northeast monsoon season from the biggest lake Nandhivaram of Guduvanchery watershed in Kanchipuram district of Tamilnadu, India. The sampling and analytical methodologies were followed for the estimation of selected parameters as per 'Standard methods of water and wastewater analysis' (APHA et al. 1998). The NIST traceable standards are used for calibration of instruments before and after sample analysis for quality control check [6]. Water samples were collected from various locations of the lake. The water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, conductivity, COD, BOD, Total Dissolved Solids, Phosphate, Nitrate and Chlorophyll-a were analyzed. The ranges of water quality parameters obtained are as follows. pH (6.71-7.04), Turbidity (2.4-3.3NTU), conductivity(565-660 mu s/m), COD (3.512.8mg/l), BOD(1.5-3.7mg/l), TDS(294-335mg/l), PO4(0.219-0.608mg/l), NO2(0.094-2.359mg/l), chlorophyll-a (3.14-3.93 mu g/l). The analysis revealed that the parameters pH, TDS, COD, BOD, conductivity levels are within the standard limits for surface water quality whereas Nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll-a were noticed exceeding the permissible level at many of the sampling locations. The phyto plankton is an important index of presence of high nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen, which are the factors responsible for eutrophication of the lake.																	0975-8585					MAY-JUN	2017	8			S			173	178										WOS:000410802400021

Assessing coral reef health in the North Ari Atoll (Maldives) using the FoRAM Index	MARINE MICROPALEONTOLOGY												Tropical marine ecosystems are richly diverse, but are experiencing growing pressure from coastal development and tourism. Assessing the status of coral reef communities along gradients of human pressure is necessary to predict recovery capacity of reefs exposed to acute events such as mass bleaching or storm destruction. Islands in the central Maldives Archipelago, which experience three different management regimes (four for each category: local community, uninhabited, and resort islands), were sampled during the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)-REGENERATE Cruise in 2015. Assessments were carried out using the FoRAM Index (FI), based on relative abundances of larger foraminiferal shells in reef sediments. Overall, FI values ( > 5) indicate that water quality currently should support active accretion by reef-building corals and larger benthic foraminifers. The highest median FI values (5.9) were recorded from sites associated with the uninhabited islands. Slightly, but significantly lower medians were recorded at sites near community and resort islands (FI = 5.3 and 5.1, respectively) that host permanent human settlement, indicating possible local deterioration of water quality by disposal of domestic wastes. Note that the FI was designed to assess suitability of local water quality and not to assess responses to regional to global changes associated with temperature stress or ocean acidification.

The objective of this paper is to identify a new technical solution that contributes to the increase of DO level in the water passing through the turbine. The current technical solutions improve the DO level but affect the hydraulic efficiency of the turbine. There is no general technical solution for aeration of water used by hydraulic turbines, and every implementation of the aeration devices needs a specific design. Available studies are done directly in site, on Francis turbines which are equipped with different aeration devices. The air injection methods used until now have different energetic characteristics, aeration efficiency and influence over the flow in the turbine draft tube. They are described in the literature, analysed and compared, focused on turbine geometry, injected air quantity and the place of injection. The main parameters important for the aeration process (the air bubbles size, bubble distribution and shape) and its effect over the DO transfer in the turbulent flow cannot be determined from in site investigations because onerous. The paper presents an experimental set-up for the study of air bubble injection parameters over the water aeration process, which is designed to operate with similar parameters of the turbine draft tube flow. Also, aeration parameters are measured and analysed from energetic and ecological point of view.

The numerical model of Buzau's DWDN was set up in EPANET, considering the main pipes of the network that interconnect 4 pumping stations and 45 booster stations (viewed here as end-users). The calibration of the numerical model was based on real-time recordings available for January and July 2014. The chlorination scheduling was simulated at each reservoir supplying a pumping station, by a variable injection pattern added to the EPANET DWDN model. The injected amount of chlorine was determined by values of the chlorine concentration obtained at 4 key monitoring points, spread over the network. The simulations were performed over an extended time period of 72 hours. The system behaviour has been analysed for two cases: with all pumping stations in operation, and with the biggest pumping station shutdown. For each case, the proposed schedule corresponds to the injection in the network of less chlorine than the corresponding recorded values for January and July 2014, and yet obtaining at the 4 key points a chlorine concentration variation similar to the recorded one, while the chlorine concentration at the end users was within the admissible range, across the whole DWDN.

The contributing basin area of 872 km(2) is furthermore divided into 15 sub-basins designated according to the characteristics of hydrological network and water sampling programme. The river basin of interest is a spatially complex system with agricultural land and forests as two predominant land use types. Complexity of the system reflects in the discharge intensity and diffuse pollution of nitrogen compounds into the water bodies of the river basin. The presence of urban area has an impact as the load from the existing wastewater treatment plants consist up to 76 % of the total nitrogen load in the Berze River basin. Representative data sets of land cover, agricultural field data base for crop distribution analysis, estimation of crop management, soil type map, digital elevation model, drainage conditions, network of water bodies and point sources were used for the modelling procedures. The semi-distributed hydro chemical model HYPE has a setup to simulate discharge and nitrogen transfer. In order to make the model more robust and appropriate for the current study the data sets previously stated were classified by unifying similar spatially located polygons. The data layers were overlaid and 53 hydrological response units (SLCs) were created. Agricultural land consists of 48 SLCs with the details of soils, drainage conditions, crop types, and land management practices. Manual calibration procedure was applied to improve the performance of discharge simulation. Simulated discharge values showed good agreement with the observed values with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.82 and bias of -6.6 %. Manual calibration of parameters related to nitrogen leakage simulation was applied to test the most sensitive parameters.																	1691-5208	2255-8837				MAY	2017	19	1					51	64		10.1515/rtuect-2017-0005								WOS:000408475100005

However, relatively few works have been accomplished for fundamental understanding of the fouling in pilotor full-scale systems. Accordingly, this study intended to predict membrane fouling in a pilot-scale MF plant using a mathematical model and a statistical model based on artificial neural network (ANN). The effects of temperature, turbidity, total organic carbon, total operating time, and filtration time after chemical cleaning on the membrane fouling were considered. The major fouling mechanism was determined to be cake formation regardless of feed water quality changes. The cake formation model was found to be useful in explaining the membrane fouling in the short-term prediction of pilot-scale hollow fiber submerged membrane system. The results of application of the ANN model indicated high correlation coefficient between the measured and predicted output variables. Therefore, it appears that the ANN model is applicable in the long-term prediction of the membrane performance at different water qualities of the pilot-scale system.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	77						69	74		10.5004/dwt.2017.20661								WOS:000407719900009

Accordingly, this study focused on the application of microfiltration (MF) together with coagulation for the treatment of the paper mill wastewater. A statistical model based on the response surface methodology (RSM) was attempted to determine the optimum coagulation conditions (i.e., coagulant dose, pH, and temperature). Empirical models were developed to understand the interactive correlation between the responses and process variables. After the coagulation, the MF membranes prepared by an electrospinning method were used to treat the wastewater. Nevertheless, it seems that the coagulation conditions optimized for water quality parameters are not always the appropriate conditions for pretreatment of MF feed water.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	77						83	88		10.5004/dwt.2017.20676								WOS:000407719900011

The use of activated Effective Microorganism Solution (EMS) mixed with rice bran or wheat bran, as well as soil and shaped into mudballs has in recent years shown promise as a direct method to improve quality of polluted river water. This study examined the effect of temperature on removal of COD and TSS by mudballs made from activated EM4 solution, rice bran and clay soil. Batch experiments treating artificial river water by the mudballs were conducted at temperatures 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C with the artificial river water having initial levels of 120 mg/L COD and 100 mg/L TSS. Efficiency removals of COD by 2.5 cm. mudballs at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C were 66.7% and 59.4%, whereas that of TSS were 100% and 99.7% respectively. TSS sorption by the mudballs appears to better fit the Langmuir than the Freundlich isotherm models. At 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, maximum sorption (Q(m)) of TSS is 6.89 mg/g and 7.52 mg/g; Langmuir constant (K-L) is 0.0196 L/mg and 0.0168 L/mg, while equilibrium parameter (R-L) is 0.338 and 0.373 respectively. Statistical hypothesis testing of the experimental data suggests that at alpha=0.05, temperature affects removal efficiency of COD but not that of TSS.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				MAY	2017	12	33					91	95		10.21660/2017.33.2626								WOS:000406909100014

The effectiveness of such systems depends heavily on the properties of the riverbank material that is used for filtering and treating the water. To improve the system's treatment efficiency, modifications may be conducted to the riverbank soil. Altering the properties of the soil might, however, affect the stability of the riverbank. In this study, soil and water samples near Lake Chini were collected and characterized. Filtration test was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the soil in treating the water. The soil was modified by mixing it with powdered activated carbon (PAC) at varying percentage of 5 and 10%. In addition, compressibility test was carried out using a standard oedometer. Test results indicated that the soil alone was insufficient to treat the water to drinking water quality standards. Modification with activated carbon improved the water quality from Class II to Class I. However, compressibility test revealed that there were some changes to the pressure - void ratio relationship, indicating that the alteration of soil properties with the addition of activated carbon filters might affect the stability of the riverbank.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				MAY	2017	12	33					122	126		10.21660/2017.33.2590								WOS:000406909100019

In this study, microcosm experiments on a coconut-fibre biofilm treatment system were carried out to evaluate wastewater treatment efficiencies in the laboratory using two wastewaters, synthetic sewage and leachate, with different pollutant loads. Three coconut-fibre conditions were set as a single bundle (low fibre density: LFD), two bundles (high fibre density: HFD), and no coconut fibre (blank). The wastewater was first circulated in the system for six weeks (circulation stage) and then discharged from the treatment tank for 7-24 weeks (treatment stage). Water quality parameters of effluents, pH, DO, EC, BOD, COD, TC, and TN, were measured at one-week intervals, and the sedimented sludge in each treatment tank was collected to determine C, N, and P contents. Results showed effective reductions in BOD and COD in the LFD and HFD conditions for the synthetic leachate, indicating that the coconut fibre contributed to the treatment of wastewater. On the other hand, the fibre density had less or no effect on the reduction of water quality parameters in the synthetic sewage. For both synthetic sewage and leachate, the C and N consumptions generally increased in the order of blank, LFD, and HFD. In particular, sludge sedimentation contributed to C consumption under the HFD condition.																	2186-2982	2186-2990				MAY	2017	12	33					160	166		10.21660/2017.33.2754								WOS:000406909100025

Methods: Thirty randomly selected commercial brands of bottled water were purchased from Saudi local markets. Moreover, samples from tap water and filtered water were collected in sterilized glass bottles and stored at 4 degrees C. Biochemical analyses including pH, temperature, lactose fermentation test (LAC), indole test (IND), methyl red test (MR), Voges-Proskauer test (VP), urease test (URE), catalase test (CAT), aerobic and anaerobic test (Ae/An) were measured. Molecular identification and comparative sequence analyses were done by full length 16S rRNA gene sequences using gene bank databases and phylogenetic trees were constructed to see the closely related similarity index between bacterial strains. Results: Among 30 water samples tested, 18 were found positive for bacterial growth. Molecular identification of four selected bacterial strains indicated the alarming presence of pathogenic bacteria Bacillus spp. in most common commercial types of drinking water used in Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: The lack of awareness about good sanitation, poor personal hygienic practices and failure of safe water management and supply are the important factors for poor drinking water quality in these sources, need to be addressed.																	1682-024X					MAY-JUN	2017	33	3					703	708		10.12669/pjms.333.12347								WOS:000406648700038	28811799

New ocean, new needs: Application of pteropod shell dissolution as a biological indicator for marine resource management	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Pteropods, planktonic marine snails with a cosmopolitan distribution, are highly sensitive to changing ocean chemistry. Graphical abstract shows pteropod responses to be related to aragonite saturation state, with progressing decrease in Omega(ar) causing deteriorating biological conditions. Under high saturation state (Omega(ar) > 1.1; zone 0), pteropods are healthy with no presence of stress or shell dissolution. With decreasing Oar (zone 1), pteropod stress is demonstrated through increased dissolution and reduced calcification. At Omega(ar) < 0.8 (zones 2 and 3), severe dissolution and absence of calcification prevail: the impairment is followed by significant damages. Pteropods responses to OA are closely correlated to shell dissolution that is characterized by clearly delineated thresholds. Yet the practical utility of these species as indicators of the status of marine ecosystem integrity has been overlooked. Here, we set out the scientific and policy rationales for the use of pteropods as a biological indicator appropriate for low-cost assessment of the effect of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems. While no single species or group of species can adequately capture all aspects of ecosystem change, pteropods are sensitive, specific, quantifiable indicators of OA's effects on marine biota. In an indicator screening methodology, shell dissolution scored highly compared to other indicators of marine ecological integrity. As the socioeconomic challenges of changing ocean chemistry continue to grow in coming decades, the availability of such straightforward and sensitive metrics of impact will become indispensable. Pteropods can be a valuable addition to suites of indicators intended to support OA water quality assessment, ecosystem based management, policy development, and regulatory applications.

J	Brill, G; Anderson, P; O'Farrell, P				Brill, Gregg; Anderson, Pippin; O'Farrell, Patrick			Methodological and empirical considerations when assessing freshwater ecosystem service provision in a developing city context: Making the best of what we have	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												This study contributes to both the methodological and empirical literature by developing an integrative approach to assessing temporal and spatial change in riparian ecosystem service delivery by drawing on available and diverse data sets.These data sets act as multiple lines of evidence in supporting comparisons between data sets to test the validity of developed methods and the application of such methods. In order to synthesise these data as well as to determine the fluctuations in riparian ecosystem service provision a scoring system was developed. Methodologically, the scoring system proved informative across the majority of ecosystem services categories, showing close to 80% similarity in outcomes when comparing the scoring method to trends in long-term water quality measurements. Other benefits of the scoring system included its design simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and applicability and replicability across various urban settings. Empirically, the data sets used support the findings of the ecosystem services scoring exercise and suggests that fluctuations in ecosystem service delivery through time and across the river reaches are linked to land-use change and other human activities. Findings suggest that as water leaves an urban protected area and travels across transformed and impacted landscapes, the results are poor water quality and diminished ability of rivers to yield ecosystem services the further the river flows into the urban setting. Urbanisation and changes in land-uses in developing city contexts is therefore shown to affect potential ecosystem services benefits, necessitating increasing management interventions.

A new tool for the assessment of severe anthropogenic eutrophication in small shallow water bodies	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Unlike in deep stratified lakes, the assessment of eutrophication in shallow aquatic systems (i.e., wetlands, marshes, ponds) should be based on the interaction between water and sediment. The availability of P to primary producers is naturally higher in shallow systems, because the sediment plays an active part via adsorption, precipitation and release processes. Thus, many wetlands in protected areas are naturally eutrophic and have a high trophic status due to intrinsic features and thus, display a high concentration of total-P in the water without necessarily implying pollution or poor quality. We have provided a diagnostic tool based on the chemical equilibrium of dissolved reactive P (operationally-defined as o-P) between water and sediment that distinguish anthropogenic eutrophication from a background of natural eutrophy. When the P-binding capacity of the sediment becomes saturated, the o-P concentration increases in the water as long as both the biological uptake and the sediment adsorption are unable to cope with the rate of P-release from the sediment under a long-term P load (or severe anthropogenic eutrophication). In such conditions, we have found that the ratio of total-P/particulate-P exceeds 2.0 in the water, and have used this threshold to validate this tool in other sets of wetlands.

On this basis, this paper studied the catalytic performance of the molecule to methanol, and then calculated the ZSM-5 using the methanol conversion rate and liquid hydrocarbon mass formula. Finally, it is found that the reason for the deactivation of the catalyst is that when the temperature of the reaction tube is below 370 degrees C, the oil phase is yellow or it is not produced, and the water quality is obviously not good enough. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the catalyst of multiple catalytic factors, so as to promote the catalytic methanol production of gasoline technology and made it more perfect.																	1722-6996	2035-4606				MAY-JUN	2017	28	3					3483	3485										WOS:000405993200385

This study evaluated the effects of compost on the water quality of a stream used mainly for irrigation of agricultural crops cultivated in nearby soil that has been treated with organic compost produced by carcasses, animal and vegetable waste for the last ten years. We sampled water biannually for two years, 2013 and 2014, from five locations along the stream. Physical variables and some chemical variables were analyzed. We also analyzed the total number of coliforms (Escherichia coli). Bacterial populations were compared by carbon substrate consumption. Total phosphorus contents in the samples from 2014 exceeded 0.1 mg L-1. The concentrations of other chemical species analyzed and the results for the physical variables were in accordance with the expected values compared with national and international water quality standards. The environment showed differential carbon source consumption and a high diversity of microorganisms, but our results did not show any evidence that the applied compost is changing the microbial population or its metabolic activity. This study shows that the use of the organic compost in agricultural areas seen does not negatively influence the quality of surface water in the study area. These results are important because the process of composting animal and vegetable waste and the use of compost obtained can be an alternative sustainable for adequate destination of these wastes.

Influence of inlet water on the biotic and abiotic variables in a fish pond	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												The effects of treated and untreated water inlets with macrophytes on the improvement of water quality and zooplankton community were evaluated in a fish pond with continuous water flow. Water and zooplankton samples were retrieved at four sites during nine months. There were differences (p<0.01) between inlet water from fish pond and inlet water from canal with macrophytes, featuring higher concentrations of nutrient load, mainly TAN and TP in the former. The inlet water from fish pond contained a higher number of abundant species (9 species), whilst the water supply from the canal with macrophytes had a greater richness (31 species) of zooplankton species. Results showed that inlet water without macrophytes directly affected the characteristics of the water column and the dominance of zooplankton species such as Thermocyclops decipiens, and greater abundance of Rotifera species. Since aquatic plants in the inlet water of fish pond analyzed showed lower allochthonous material loads from the previous fish pond, the management adopted with macrophytes may be applied to avoid eutrophication risks, common in farm ponds.																	1519-6984	1678-4375				MAY	2017	77	2					277	283		10.1590/1519-6984.12315								WOS:000405940100009	27533726

Seasonal variation of limnological features and trophic state index of two oligotrophic reservoirs of southeast Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Limnological features of two reservoirs were studied in dry (August 2013) and rainy (January 2014) periods to evaluate the water quality that supply the city of Guarulhos, southeast Brazil. Water samples were collected in three depths and the following characteristics were measured: alkalinity, dissolved O-2, free and total CO2, HCO3, soluble reactive silica, dissolved and total nitrogen and phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a. Water transparency was also measured and temperature, pH and electric conductivity profiles were obtained. Great seasonal and low spatial variability of the water characteristics occurred in the reservoirs. High values of water transparency, free CO2 availability, and low of pH, soluble reactive silica and total and dissolved nutrients values were recorded at the dry period, and different conditions were found at the rainy season. The two reservoirs were characterized by low nutrients, chlorophyll-a and turbidity, and high transparency, these features being typical of oligotrophic systems. The two reservoirs still remain under low anthropogenic impact conditions, and are presently considered reference systems for the SPMR, Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region. The need for actions that will reduce the input of nutrients from the neighboring cities and the main tributaries of the hydrographic basin is emphasized to maintain the ecological quality of the reservoirs and their reference conditions among the SPRM reservoirs.																	1519-6984	1678-4375				MAY	2017	77	2					323	331		10.1590/1519-6984.14015								WOS:000405940100016	27683805

Under optimized analytical conditions, chromatographic separation was performed in 3 min, in isocratic mode, using an Acquity UHPLC C18 column and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, water, and formic acid (60:40:0.1, v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL min 1. Electrospray ionization tandem interface was employed prior to mass spectrometric detection. Good linearity (R-2 >= 0.9987) and low limits of detection (0.04-0.4 ng L-1) and quantification (0.1-1.2 ng L-1) were obtained. The extraction recoveries ranged from 98 +/- 1% to 100 +/- 1% and the relative standard deviations were less than 1.53%. The matrix effect was between 9812 and 100 +/- 1%. The obtained results clearly demonstrate that the developed method is accurate and highly sensitive for the simultaneous determination of N-nitroso-n-propylamine, Nnitrosomorpholine, N-nitrosomethylethylamine and N-nitrosodimethylamine at ultra-trace levels (ng L-1) in different types of water samples. Therefore, this method can be a useful analytical tool for future toxicological, water quality surveillance studies and for the investigation of drinking water quality.

These management options, differing especially in type (centralized or decentralized system) and wastewaters treatment system, were emphasized, mainly by real datasets on treatment performance, polluting species removals, risk of some residuals in treated effluents and natural watercourse nearby, but also environmental impact assessment, using the alternative methodology of global pollution index (I*(Gp)). Interpreting datasets based on in-time analyzed physical-chemical quality indicators and river characteristics, it was estimated the standard quality classification of receiving watercourse as 'medium' (water quality indices, WQI = 55.58 - 67.47), affected more or less by treated effluents discharged in it. The environmental risks of some selected residuals in treated effluents and natural aquatic receptor were assessed by the risk quotient (RQ) which appreciated the risk of residuals toward aquatic life as no to low-medium level, with few exceptions. The impact assessment results conclude an admissible pollution status of natural water receptor due to company wastewaters mechanical-chemical-biological treatment plant activities, in decentralized (I*(Gp) = 1.73) and centralized (I*(Gp) =1.83) system, but generating discomfort effects to aquatic life due to only mechanical-chemical treatment plant operating in decentralized system (I*(Gp) =2.205). Direct discharge of un-treated industrial wastewaters had been interdicted. These real results underline that decentralized systems are reliable, qualitatively efficient and costly effective, offering long-term solution, and that all wastewaters management strategies of petroleum chemical company had been adapted to specific on-site functioning situations.

J	Carlo, G; Paolo, G; Roberto, P				Carlo, Gaetan; Paolo, Girardi; Roberto, Pastres			Spatial clustering of curves with an application of satellite data	SPATIAL STATISTICS												Water quality indicators are important to identify risks to the environment, society and human health. The European Community Water Framework Directive establishes guidelines for the classification of all water bodies across Europe and chemical and biological indicators were used to this scope. In particular, the Chlorophyll type A index (Chl-a) is a shared indicator of trophic status and monitoring activities may be useful to explain its spatial distribution and to discover local dangerous behaviours (for example the anoxic events). Differently by the classical approach based on an "average'' values over a period, we propose a functional clustering model that takes into account temporal and spatial dependence of Chl-a concentrations in the Adriatic Sea for defining appropriate clusters of sites. We use satellite monthly data, during the period 2002-2012, and we model the spatial dependence among the sites by means of a Markov random field model. Compared to similar attempts in literature by Jiang and Serban (2012) our formulation includes spatial covariates. This inclusion allows for more flexibility to obtain more homogeneous and representative clusters of sites in the Adriatic Sea. The estimation of the model and the identification of the number of clusters are carried out using a pseudolikelihood function. A small simulation study complements the real data analysis.

J	Itsukushima, R; Morita, K; Shimatani, Y				Itsukushima, Rei; Morita, Kai; Shimatani, Yukihiro			The Use of Molluscan Fauna as Model Taxon for the Ecological Classification of River Estuaries	WATER												River estuaries are important aquatic environments characterized by large environmental gradients in their water quality, riverbed material, and microtopography in the longitudinal and transverse directions. The geography or habitats in river estuaries differ depending on the energy from the tide, waves, and river; therefore, the biota inhabiting river estuaries vary depending on the river estuary type. In view of this, for effective conservation in river estuaries, there is a need for information about potential habitats and biota based on objective data about the river estuary type. The objective of this study thus was to classify river estuaries by their molluscan fauna and physical indicators to reveal the relationship between molluscan fauna and the physical environment. The classification results using physical indicators indicated three types of river estuaries (wave energy-dominated group, tide energy-dominated group, and low tide and wave energy group). This classification result was similar to the classification of molluscan fauna. Therefore, it was suggested that molluscan fauna is extremely useful as a variable representing the river estuary environment. From the comparison between molluscan fauna and the physical environment, some rivers were not classified into the same group in the classification of molluscan fauna, despite them having similar physical environments. Some of these rivers with a molluscan fauna that diverged from expectations had undergone channel modification, which is expected to have caused a shift in this fauna group. These results suggest that this approach could be used to identify rivers that have been degraded by human activities.

To understand the pollutant transport behaviors in Tieshangang Bay, we developed a combination model (MIKE 21 FM) of the hydrodynamic module and particle tracking module. Simulation results suggest that the water velocities in the west and east troughs (near the entrance of the bay) are distinctly higher than any other areas. Meanwhile, small semi-enclosed bays adjacent to the shoreline could affect local water flow patterns, thereby causing gyres within them. The residence time of pollutants in Tieshangang Bay is significantly affected by seasonal variations (i.e., the residence time of pollutants in Tieshangang Bay in winter is less than that in summer). The results of transport trajectory simulations reveal that the bay head is a slow flushing zone, while the entrance of the bay (west trough) can be identified as a fast flushing zone.

J	Li, D; Jiang, X; Zheng, BH				Li, Da; Jiang, Xia; Zheng, Binghui			Using delta N-15 and delta O-18 Signatures to Evaluate Nitrate Sources and Transformations in Four Inflowing Rivers, North of Taihu Lake	WATER												Taihu Lake is the third largest freshwater lake in China. Due to rapid economic development and excessive nutrient discharges, there is serious eutrophication in the northern part of the lake. Nitrogen (N) is one of the key factors for eutrophication in Taihu Lake, which mainly comes from the rivers around the lake. Samples from four inflowing rivers were analysed for delta N-15 and delta O-18 isotopes in December 2013 to identify the different sources of nitrogen in the northern part of Taihu Lake. The results indicated that the water quality in Taihu Lake was clearly influenced by the water quality of the inflowing rivers and nitrate (NO3--N) was the main component of the soluble inorganic nitrogen in water. The soil organic N represented more than 70% of the total NO3--N loads in the Zhihugang. Domestic sewage was the major NO3--N source in the Liangxi river, with a contribution of greater than 50%. Soil organic N and domestic sewage, with contributions of more than 30% and 35% respectively, were the major NO3--N sources in the Lihe river and Daxigang river. Denitrification might be responsible for the shifting delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- values in the Daxigang river, and a mixing process may play a major role in N transformations in the Lihe river in winter. The results of this study will be useful as reference values for reducing NO3- pollution in the inflowing rivers in the north of Taihu Lake.																	2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							345	10.3390/w9050345								WOS:000404558100045						
J	Liu, J; Li, YP; Huang, GH; Fan, YR				Liu, Jing; Li, Yongping; Huang, Guohe; Fan, Yurui			A Semi-Infinite Interval-Stochastic Risk Management Model for River Water Pollution Control under Uncertainty	WATER												In this study, a semi-infinite interval-stochastic risk management (SIRM) model is developed for river water pollution control, where various policy scenarios are explored in response to economic penalties due to randomness and functional intervals. SIRM can also control the variability of the recourse cost as well as capture the notion of risk in stochastic programming. Then, the SIRM model is applied to water pollution control of the Xiangxihe watershed. Tradeoffs between risks and benefits are evaluated, indicating any change in the targeted benefit and risk level would yield varied expected benefits. Results disclose that the uncertainty of system components and risk preference of decision makers have significant effects on the watershed's production generation pattern and pollutant control schemes as well as system benefit. Decision makers with risk-aversive attitude would accept a lower system benefit (with lower production level and pollutant discharge); a policy based on risk-neutral attitude would lead to a higher system benefit (with higher production level and pollutant discharge). The findings can facilitate the decision makers in identifying desired product generation plans in association with financial risk minimization and pollution mitigation.

Algal Bioproductivity in Turbulent Water: An Experimental Study	WATER												Excessive growth of biomass causes eutrophication and other related water quality problems. For the past several decades, these problems have been managed based on the principle of limiting nutrient, which is to reduce the loading of essential nutrients-either nitrogen or phosphorus-through point and non-point waste source control. More recent research efforts indicated that eutrophication of a natural water body such as a lake or a reservoir can be controlled alternatively by altering its turbulent intensity. The success of this alternative approach depends on more knowledge on the intimate relationship between turbulent intensity and the bioproductivity of a water body. In this experimental study, an oscillating grid turbulence (OGT) reactor was constructed to evaluate the effect of turbulent pulsation strength in terms of vibration frequency on algae bioproductivity under adequate nutrient, light, and temperature conditions. Experimental results showed that moderate turbulent intensity with vibration frequency of 0.5 Hz or less increased algal growth; with a vibration frequency of 1.0 Hz, the observed peak chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration in the reactor was 0.112 mg/L. The experimental results also showed that strong turbulent intensity with vibration frequency of 1.5 Hz or more reduced algal growth; with vibration frequency of 1.5 Hz, the observed peak Chl-a concentration in the reactor was only 0.06 mg/L, which was even lower than the observed peak Chl-a concentration in the reactor with stationary water. In this study, the effect of water turbulence on algal bioproductivity was further verified with experimental data on the variations of other relevant water quality parameters in the OGT reactor including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO).																	2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							304	10.3390/w9050304								WOS:000404558100005						
J	Shi, LL; Mao, ZH; Wu, JP; Liu, ML; Zhang, YW; Wang, Z				Shi, Liangliang; Mao, Zhihua; Wu, Jiaping; Liu, Mingliang; Zhang, Yiwei; Wang, Zheng			Variations in Spectral Absorption Properties of Phytoplankton, Non-Algal Particles and Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter in Lake Qiandaohu	WATER												Light absorption by phytoplankton, non-algal particles (NAP) and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was investigated at 90 sites of a clear, deep artificial lake (Lake Qiandaohu) to study natural variability of absorption coefficients. Our study shows that CDOM absorption is a major contributor to the total absorption signal in Lake Qiandaohu during all seasons, except autumn when it has an equivalent contribution as total particle absorption. The exponential slope of CDOM absorption varies within a narrow range around a mean value of 0.0164 nm(-1) (sd = 0.00176 nm(-1)). Our study finds some evidence for thIS autochthonous production of CDOM in winter and spring. Absorption by phytoplankton, and therefore its contribution to total absorption, is generally greatest in spring, suggesting that phytoplankton growth in Lake Qiandaohu occurs predominantly in the spring. Phytoplankton absorption in freshwater lakes generally has a direct relationship with chlorophyll-a concentration, similar to the one established for open ocean waters. The NAP absorption, whose relative contribution to total absorption is highest in summer, has a spectral shape that can be well fitted by an exponential function with an average slope of 0.0065 nm(-1) (sd = 0.00076 nm(-1)). There is significant spatial variability present in the summer of Lake Qiandaohu, especially in the northwestern and southwestern extremes where the optical properties of the water column are strongly affected by the presence of allochthonous matter. Variations in the properties of the particle absorption spectra with depths provides evidence that the water column was vertically inhomogeneous and can be monitored with an optical measurement program. Moreover, the optical inhomogeneity in winter is less obvious. Our study will support the parameterization of the Bio-optical model for Lake Qiandaohu from in situ or remotely sensing aquatic color signals.																	2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							352	10.3390/w9050352								WOS:000404558100052						
J	Turcotte, B; Morse, B				Turcotte, Benoit; Morse, Brian			The Winter Environmental Continuum of Two Watersheds	WATER												This paper examines the winter ecosystemic behavior of two distinct watersheds. In cold-temperate regions, the hydrological signal and environmental parameters can fluctuate dramatically over short periods of time, causing major impacts to aquatic habitats. This paper presents the results of the 2011-2012 winter field campaign in streams and rivers near Quebec City, QC, Canada. The objective was to quantify water quantity and quality parameters and their environmental connectivity from headwater creeks above to the larger rivers below over the entire freeze-up, mid-winter and breakup periods with a view toward exploring the watershed continuum. The paper presents how aquatic pulses (water level, discharge, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity, measured at seven sites on an hourly basis along channels of different sizes and orders) evolve through the aquatic environment. Ice conditions and the areal ice coverage were also evaluated (on a daily time step along each instrumented channel). Some findings of the investigation revealed that water temperatures remained well above 0 degrees C during winter in headwater channels, that dissolved oxygen levels during winter were relatively high, but with severe depletions prior to and during breakup in specific settings, that high conductivity spikes occurred during runoff events, that annual turbidity extremes were measured in the presence of ice and that dynamic ice cover breakup events have the potential to generate direct or indirect mortality among aquatic species and to dislodge the largest rocks in the channel. The authors believe that the environmental impact of a number of winter fluvial processes needs to be further investigated, and the relative significance of the winter period in the annual environmental cycle should be given additional attention.																	2073-4441					MAY	2017	9	5							337	10.3390/w9050337								WOS:000404558100037

Direct laboratory methods have long lead times; indirect methods (refraction, pH, conductivity, turbidity, etc.) would be suitable as they measure indirect values, so correlations must be found between the measured values and the component(s) for analysis. These correlations are often stochastic in nature having a standard deviation of the same magnitude as the measured values. This paper deals with pharmaceutical wastewater with a high sucrose content, the online measurement of its organic material content characterised by chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), refraction and resistance. It finds a correlation between the CODcr and resistance-corrected refraction (r*). To reduce the standard deviation, the concept of cumulative CODcr is introduced. Concentration limit values could be determined to compare with the cumulative CODcr values calculated continuously during the fill up of the wastewater tank. This means that the treatment with the wastewater (into the drain, dilution and transfer) can be decided. The validity of the model is checked by trial calculations based on a high number of measurements.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	75						268	273		10.5004/dwt.2017.20401								WOS:000404396100029

Assessment of soil degradation through soil aggregation and particulate organic matter following conversion of riparian buffer to continuous cultivation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Agriculture in the temperate zone of the Midwestern USA has removed most riparian buffer zones from the landscape, which impairs the soil functioning of the soil in these ecosystems. The objective of this study was to assess soil degradation in a non-buffered riparian zone with an annual row crop (ARC) and in a longer established (more than 85 years) riparian cool season grass (CSG) buffer in central Iowa, USA. To achieve our objective, we compared the functioning of the target system, ARC, with a system that has been undisturbed since 1990, CSG. We measured the aggregate size distribution and stability of macroaggregrates, aggregate-associated soil organic carbon and particulate organic matter (POM). The categorization of aggregates by size and water stability (slaking resistance) showed a significantly larger (P<0.05) proportion of water-stable macroaggregates (> 250 mu m) under CSG (53%) than under ARC (26.3%). On the other hand, soil under ARC had the larger proportion of large and small water-unstablemacroaggregates. The results indicate that the concentration of organic C associated with the total water-stable aggregates is 1.9 times greater under CSG (23.9 mgC g(-1)) than for the ARC (12.4 mgC g(-1)). The concentration of carbon in light particulate organic matter (LPOM-C) under CSG accounted for 12% of total soil organic carbon (TSOC), but only 6% under ARC management. The chemical composition of LPOM in the ARC soil had a large alkyl-C/O-alkyl C ratio, which suggests more organic matter decomposition than with the CSG. Electronic micrographs showed evidence that under CSG roots and fungal hyphae form an extensive network around the large macroaggregates (> 2000 mu m), and thus maintain the stability of the macroaggregates. Preserving the CSG buffer reduces soil erosion and the processes associated with nonpoint source pollutants, which improves water quality in an intensively managed agricultural system.																	1351-0754	1365-2389				MAY	2017	68	3					295	304		10.1111/ejss.12422								WOS:000405267200004

It has a catchment of similar to 450000 km(2) in the boundary region between Northern Mongolia and Southern Siberia. Climate, land use and dynamic socioeconomic changes go along with rising water abstractions and contaminant loads originating from mining sites and urban wastewater. In the future, these pressures might have negative impacts on the ecosystems of Lake Baikal and the Selenga River Delta, which is an important wetland region in itself and forms the last geobiochemical barrier before the Selenga drains into Lake Baikal. The following study aims to assess current trends in hydrology and water quality in the Selenga-Baikal basin, identify their drivers and to set up models (WaterGAP3 framework and ECOMAG) for the prediction of future changes. Of particular relevance for hydrological and water quality changes in the recent past were climate and land use trends as well as contaminant influx from mining areas and urban settlements. In the near future, additional hydrological modifications due to the construction of dams and abstractions/water diversions from the Selenga's Mongolian tributaries could lead to additional alterations.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				MAY	2017	44	3					399	416		10.1134/S0097807817030113								WOS:000405126000006

Suspended Sediment Balance in Selenga Delta at the Late XX-Early XXI Century: Simulation by LANDSAT Satellite Images	WATER RESOURCES												Adaptation of the technology of water turbidity simulation by satellite image data for the delta of the Selenga R., the largest Baikal tributary is given. The results of processing a series of 82 Landsat images are used to assess the seasonal variability of suspended sediment balance in the Selenga delta in period from 1989 up to the present time. It is shown that, at higher water discharges (> 1500 m(3)/s), suspended material will accumulate in the delta (on the average 15% of the total sediment transport at the delta head), governed by material precipitation within inundated floodplain area and lakes in the lower part of the delta. At lower water discharges (< 1500 m(3)/s), a longitudinal increase in suspended sediment transport may take place, caused by setups from Baikal side and channel erosion in the branches.																	0097-8078	1608-344X				MAY	2017	44	3					463	470		10.1134/S0097807817030071								WOS:000405126000011

Milne Edwards, 1854)) on submersed macrophytes'	AQUATIC BOTANY					2nd International Symposium of Aquatic Plant Biology (MACROPHYTE)	OCT 27-31, 2014	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA					The Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis (H. Milne Edwards, 1854)), is a highly invasive species and poses a great threat to endemic species and infrastructure in Europe and North America. Although it is partly herbivorous and prefers to live in lakes with abundant submersed macrophytes, little is known about its effect on macrophytes. We used its native range, the mid-lower Yangtze Basin where the species has been cultured intensively for decades, as our study site to test the hypotheses that (1) high crab densities weaken the positive feedback between macrophytes and water transparency, and that (2) the effects of crabs become apparent only on decadal timescales and (3) are density dependent. We used correlative analyses based on 12 years of monitoring and multi-lake comparisons among 20 sub-areas in 4 lakes. High crab densities were found to cause negative effects on submersed macrophytes and transparency, and to weaken the positive relation between macrophytes and transparency. High densities of macrophytes showed resilience to disturbance from crabs. This resilience, however, reduced with continuous presence of high crab densities. Crab densities were strongly positively related with total phosphorus and negatively with transparency and total nitrogen. Phosphorus concentrations and transparency were not related with phytoplankton chlorophyll a, suggesting that crab's bioturbation strongly influences water quality. The apparent resilience of the dense macrophyte stands should however, not delay attempts to eradicate the crab where it is invasive as this becomes more difficult once they have become established. When macrophyte abundance is already low at the time of invasion, immediate loss of macrophytes may occur. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, few studies have considered the interactions between the mining industry and water resources on a global scale. These interactions are often complex and site specific, and so an understanding of the local water contexts of individual mining projects is required before associated risks can be adequately assessed. Here, we address this important issue by providing the first quantitative assessment of the contextual water risks facing the global base metal mining industry, focusing on the location of known copper, lead, zinc and nickel resources. The relative exposure of copper, lead-zinc and nickel resources to water risks were assessed by considering a variety of spatial water indices, with each providing a different perspective of contextual water risks. Provincial data was considered for water criticality (CRIT), supply risk (SR), vulnerability to supply restrictions (VSR) and the environmental implications (El) of water use. Additionally, watershed or sub-basin scale data for blue water scarcity (BWS), the water stress index (WSI), the available water remaining (AWaRe), basin internal evaporation recycling (BIER) ratios and the water depletion index (WDI) were also considered, as these have particular relevance for life cycle assessment and water footprint studies. All of the indices indicate that global copper resources are more exposed to water risks than lead-zinc or nickel resources, in part due to the large copper endowment of countries such as Chile and Peru that experience high water criticality, stress and scarcity. Copper resources are located in regions where water consumption is more likely to contribute to long-term decreases in water availability and also where evaporation is less likely to re-precipitate in the same drainage basin to cause surface-runoff or groundwater recharge. The global resource datasets were also assessed against regional Koppen-Geiger climate classifications for the observed period 1951-2000 and changes to 2100 using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's AlFI, A2, B1 and B2 emission scenarios. The results indicate that regions containing copper resources are also more exposed to likely changes in climate than those containing lead-zinc or nickel resources. Overall, regions containing 27-32% (473-574 Mt Cu) of copper, 17-29% (139-241 Mt Pb + Zn) of lead-zinc and 6-13% (19-39 Mt Ni) of nickel resources may have a major climate re-classification as a result of anthropogenic climate change. A further 15-23% (262-412 Mt) of copper, 23-32% (195-270 Mt) of lead-zinc and 29-32% (84-94 Mt) of nickel are exposed to regional precipitation or temperature sub-classification changes. These climate changes are likely to alter the water balance, water quality and infrastructure risks at mining and mineral processing operations. Effective management of long-term changes to mine site water and climate risks requires the further adoption of anticipatory risk management strategies.

Not only has that but also affected plants and living organisms, the health of the population and the economy. This study reviews the state of river water quality and sources of river water pollution in Malaysia. The Department of Environment program continued monitoring of the quality of river water in 2014 to determine the status of water quality of the river and to detect changes in water quality of the river. They found that 52% of the river was found to be clean, 39% slightly contaminated and 9% contaminated. The number of the polluted river is declined over the period of time. They also observed that beverage industries are the major source of pollution in this country. This paper reviews the environmental policy related to water pollution and studies related to water pollution and health impacts. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by IASE.

Long-term Changes in Grassland Soil Phosphorus with Fertilizer Application and Withdrawal	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Long-term phosphorus (P) applications can increase soil P concentrations in excess of agronomic optima, posing a risk to water quality. Once fertilization stops, however, it may take time for soil P concentrations to decline. Whereas P fertilization adds orthophosphate, little is known about changes in other soil P forms during P buildup and drawdown. This study examined changes in P pools (total P, Olsen P, Mehlich P, and waterextractable P) and P forms determined by P-31-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-NMR) in grazed grassland plots from Northern Ireland. Between 1994 and 1999, all plots received 8.3 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) with variable rates of nitrogen (100-500 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). From 2000 to 2005, plots received 0, 20, 40, or 80 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) and 250 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1); from 2005 to 2010, no P fertilizer was applied to any plots. In 2005, soil P pool concentrations at the highest P fertilization rates were significantly elevated compared with those in 2000 but had decreased to 2000 concentrations by 2010. In soils receiving no P, soil P pool concentrations were significantly lower than those in 1994 only in 2010. There were few changes in P forms determined by P-NMR. Orthophosphate followed the same trend observed for the soil P pools; total organic P, total inositol phosphates, and total orthophosphate monoesters and diesters were highest in 2010 in the soil receiving no P fertilizer for 10 yr. For these soils, fertilizer application and cessation influenced inorganic P more than organic P.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					537	545		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0373								WOS:000404385100008	28724086

Nitrate Leaching from Winter Cereal Cover Crops Using Undisturbed Soil-Column Lysimetersle	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Cover crops are important management practices for reducing nitrogen (N) leaching, especially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which is under total maximum daily load (TMDL) restraints. Winter cereals are common cool-season crops in the Bay watershed, but studies have not directly compared nitrate-N (NO3-N) leaching losses from these species. A 3-yr cover crop lysimeter study was conducted in Beltsville, MD, to directly compare NO3-N leaching from a commonly grown cultivar of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), along with a no-cover control, using eight tension-drained undisturbed soil column lysimeters in a completely randomized design with two replicates. The lysimeters were configured to exclude runoff and to estimate NO3-N leaching and flow-weighted NO3-N concentration (FWNC). The temporal pattern of NO3-N leaching showed a consistent highly significant (p < 0.001) effect of lower NO3-N leaching with cover crops compared with no cover but showed only small and periodically significant (p < 0.05) effects among the cultivars of barley, rye, and wheat covers. Nitrate-N leaching was more affected by the quantity of establishmentseason (mid-October to mid-December) precipitation than by cover crop species. For example, compared with no cover, winter cereal covers reduced NO3-N leaching 95% in a dry year and 50% in wet years, with corresponding reductions in FWNC of 92 and 43%, respectively. These results are important for scientists, nutrient managers, and policymakers because they directly compare NO3-N leaching from winter cereal covers and expand knowledge for developing management practices for winter cereals that can improve water quality and increase N efficiency in cropping systems.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					576	584		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0372								WOS:000404385100013	28724087

Hydrology and Soil Manipulations of Iron-Rich Ditch Mesocosms Provide Little Evidence of Phosphorus Capture within the Profile	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Agricultural drainage ditches function as first-order streams and affect nutrient management. Soil mesocosms from a ditch featuring a vertical (increasing upward) gradient in iron (Fe) and phosphorus (P) were subjected to hydraulic and soil treatments. These manipulations mimicked aspects of dredging and controlled drainage and inspected the soil release and retention of P. Treatments did not remove P from simulated groundwater. Throughput water either gained in P (lack of dredging, especially under Fe-reducing conditions) or had P concentrations indistinguishable from input water (dredging). Undredged mesocosms, when Fe-reducing, released Fe and P simultaneously. Simultaneous release of P and Fe from our Fereducing mesocosms indicates a mechanism whereby P capture occurs by Fe precipitation upon emergence to aerated surficial waters. Upwelling and surficial phases of ditch hydrology and the lowering of the ditch surface on dredging complicate interpretation of traditional means of describing ditch P retention and release.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					596	604		10.2134/jeq2016.10.0397								WOS:000404385100015	28724096

The Chinese government established national total emission control (TEC) policies related to the nation's surface water quality over the past 10 yr to restore, protect, and promote healthy water quality. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of China's TEC policies by analyzing three water quality constituents (ammonium nitrogen [NH4-N], dissolved oxygen [DO], and the permanganate index [CODMn]) at 73 monitoring stations, which account for most of the surface waters of eastern China. The seasonal Mann-Kendall test revealed that approximately 60, 50, and 65% of stations had nonsignificant trends for CODMn, NH4-N, and DO, respectively. Concentrations of CODMn and NH4-N significantly (a = 0.05) decreased by 27.4 and 38.4% at the monitoring stations over the 11-yr study period, whereas DO significantly (a = 0.05) increased by 24.7%. Correlation analysis indicated that the water quality improved at approximately 30% (CODMn) and 20% (NH4-N) of monitoring sites with the reduction of water pollutant emissions from industrial sources. A seasonal pattern was observed for the three water quality parameters at most of the stations but not at a regional scale. Results also indicated that CODMn concentrations decreased significantly (alpha = 0.05) at most river stations but increased significantly (alpha = 0.05) at nearly all lake stations, suggesting that TEC in China might be more effective for rivers than for lakes and reservoirs. Although there are many nonsignificant relationships with the water quality constituents selected as top pollutants in China, a few noticeable significant relationships were established.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					605	613		10.2134/jeq2016.10.0404								WOS:000404385100016	28724101

Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) Mercury Unaffected by Wildland Fires in Northern Minnesota	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Wildland fire can alter mercury (Hg) cycling on land and in adjacent aquatic environments. In addition to enhancing local atmospheric Hg redeposition, fire can influence terrestrial movement of Hg and other elements into lakes via runoff from burned upland soil. However, the impact of fire on water quality and the accumulation of Hg in fish remain equivocal. We investigated the effects of fire-specifically, a low-severity prescribed fire and moderate-severity wildfire-on youngof- the-year yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and lake chemistry in a small remote watershed in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in northeastern Minnesota. We used a paired watershed approach: the fire-affected watershed was compared with an adjacent, unimpacted (reference) watershed. Prior to fire, upland organic horizons in the two study watersheds contained 1549 mu g Hg m(-2) on average. Despite a 19% decrease in upland organic horizon Hg stocks due to the moderate severity wildfire fire, fish Hg accumulation and lake productivity were not affected by fire in subsequent years. Instead, climate and lake water levels were the strongest predictors of lake chemistry and fish responses in our study lakes over 9 yr. Our results suggest that low-to moderate-severity wildland fire does not alter lake productivity or Hg accumulation in young-of-the-year yellow perch in these small, shallow lakes in the northern deciduous and boreal forest region.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					623	631		10.2134/jeq2016.10.0418								WOS:000404385100018	28724108

Land Use and Field Boundary Database Development and Structure	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												Conservation planning information is important for identifying options for watershed water quality improvement and can be developed for use at field, farm, and watershed scales. Translation across scales is a key issue impeding progress at watershed scales because watershed improvement goals must be connected with implementation of farm-and field-level conservation practices to demonstrate success. This is particularly true when examining alternatives for "trap and treat" practices implemented at agricultural-field edges to control (or influence) water flows through fields, landscapes, and riparian corridors within agricultural watersheds. We propose that database structures used in developing conservation planning information can achieve translation across conservation-planning scales, and we developed the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) to enable practical planning applications. The ACPF comprises a planning concept, a database to facilitate field-level and watershed-scale analyses, and an ArcGIS toolbox with Python scripts to identify specific options for placement of conservation practices. This paper appends two prior publications and describes the structure of the ACPF database, which contains land use, crop history, and soils information and is available for download for 6091 HUC12 watersheds located across Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, and parts of Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wisconsin and comprises information on 2.74 x 10(6) agricultural fields (available through http://northcentralwater.org/acpf/). Sample results examining land use trends across Iowa and Illinois are presented here to demonstrate potential uses of the database. While designed for use with the ACPF toolbox, users are welcome to use the ACPF watershed data in a variety of planning and modeling approaches.																	0047-2425	1537-2537				MAY-JUN	2017	46	3					676	686		10.2134/jeq2016.09.0363								WOS:000404385100024	28724111					
J	Liu, WW; Zhao, EM; Kuo, YM; Jang, CS				Liu, Wen-wen; Zhao, Enmin; Kuo, Yi-Ming; Jang, Cheng-Shin			Identifying the relationships between trophic states and their driving factors in the Shihmen Reservoir, Taiwan	LIMNOLOGICA												Eutrophication has become a crucial issue for water resource management in recent years. In addition, reservoir trophic states are varied with environmental and water quality variables. The objectives of this study were to apply the DFA model to examine which water quality variables significantly affect variations of trophic state index (TSI) factors (i.e. total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll -a (Chl-a), and Secchi disk transparency (SD)) and use classification and regression tree (CART) to determine the trophic states of the Shinmen Reservoir based on the levels of TSI factors during spring 2001 winter 2009. Results showed that the optimal DFA model contained one common trend (the underlying processes influencing trophic states, which can be rainfall intensity or runoff volume) and 7 explanatory variables. Turbidity (TB), pH, and dissolved oxygen (DO) influence concentrations of TP, while ammonium nitrogen (NH3-N), organic nitrogen (O-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) control variations of Chl-a, and TB is related to SD. The CART model can specify trophic states only using two dominant driving factors, i.e. TP and Chl-a. The results of the CART illustrated that eutrophication could be occurred in the Shihmen Reservoir if TP is greater than 31.65 mu g/L or if Chl-a is greater than 5.95 mu g/L while TP concentration is less than 31.65 mu g/L. Runoff nonpoint source pollution resulted from heavy storms may be the important factor affecting reservoir trophic states. Establishing vegetative filter strips along the riparian zone may able to effectively reduce this pollution in a reservoir. The integrated DFA and CART serves as good -fit relationships among trophic states, TSI factors, and water quality variables and provide control strategies for managing water quality in the Shihmen Reservoir.																	0075-9511	1873-5851				MAY	2017	64						38	45		10.1016/j.limno.2017.04.004								WOS:000404798100005

Seasonality of Coliform Bacteria Detection Rates in New Jersey Domestic Wells	GROUNDWATER												It is important that indicators of fecal pollution are reliable. Coliform bacteria are a commonly used indicator of fecal pollution. As other investigators have reported elsewhere, we observed a seasonal pattern of coliform bacteria detections in domestic wells in New Jersey. Examination of a statewide database of 10 years of water quality data from 93,447 samples, from 78,207 wells, generated during real estate transactions, revealed that coliform bacteria were detected in a higher proportion of wells during warm weather months. Further examination of the seasonal pattern of other data, including well water pH, precipitation, ground and surface water temperatures, surface water coliform bacteria concentrations, and vegetation, resulted in the hypothesis that these bacteria may be derived from nonfecal (or environmentally adapted) as well as fecal sources. We provide evidence that the coliform seasonality may be the result of seasonal changes in groundwater extraction volumes (and to a lesser extent precipitation), and temperature-driven changes in the concentration of surface or near-surface coliform sources. Nonfecal coliform sources may not indicate the presence of fecal wastes and hence the potential presence of pathogens, or do so in an inconsistent fashion. Additional research is needed to identify the sources of the coliforms detected in groundwater.																	0017-467X	1745-6584				MAY-JUN	2017	55	3					346	361		10.1111/gwat.12482								WOS:000404746300009	27775834

Agricultural practices, intensities, and nutrient losses vary across the Baltic Sea drainage basin (1.75 x 10(6) km(2), 14 countries and 85 million inhabitants). Six "Soil andWater Assessment Tool" (SWAT) models were set up for catchments representing the major agricultural systems, and covering the different climate gradients in the Baltic Sea drainage basin. Four fertilizer application scenarios were run for each catchment to evaluate the sensitivity of changed fertilizer applications. Increasing sensitivity was found for catchments with an increasing proportion of agricultural land use and increased amounts of applied fertilizers. A change in chemical fertilizer use of +/- 20% was found to affect watershed NO3-N loads between zero effect and +/- 13%, while a change in manure application of +/- 20% affected watershed NO3-N loads between zero effect and -6% to + 7%.

However, questions still remain regarding what type of production system is best suited to maximize indoor production. In this project, two types of systems were compared: clear-water (CW) RAS and biofloc (BF) systems. Three, 1.36 m(3) tanks were assigned to each of the two treatments; CW tanks had external settling chambers, two foam fractionators, and external biofilters, all operated continuously. BF tanks had settling chambers and one foam fractionator which were operated as needed to control solids accumulation. Shrimp weighing 0.42 g were stocked in all tanks at 250 m(-3) and grown for 55 days. Ammonia and pH levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the CW treatment, while nitrite, nitrate, and turbidity were all significantly higher in the BF treatment, although all parameters remained within acceptable ranges for shrimp growth. Shrimp mean harvest weight was significantly higher, biomass (kg m(-3)) was significantly greater, and FCR was significantly lower in the CW treatment; there were no significant differences in survival between treatments. Isotope levels indicated that shrimp in the BF treatment obtained a portion of the C (18-60%) and N (1-18%) in their tissues from biofloc material; however, this effect did not positively influence production in that treatment. By nearly eliminating solids from the water and using an external biofilter, substantially better water quality was maintained in the CW systems, which may have been a major contributor to the improved shrimp production in that treatment.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of using different feeding rates for a period of 21 days with a posterior re-feeding period in a microcosm system in the presence of bioflocs. Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles (1.14 +/- 0.38 g) were stocked at 400 shrimp m(-3) in 150-L tanks in a biofloc recirculation system in two phases. The feeding rates were calculated considering an expected weekly growth of 1 g week(-1) and an estimated weekly mortality of 0.5%; each treatment corresponded to a different feeding rate, and each feeding rate corresponded to a fixed food conversion ratio. The first phase (food restriction) lasted 21 days, and the following treatments were used: T0 (no artificial feed addition), T0.3, T0.6, T0.9, T1.2, T1.5, T1.8 and T2.1. In the second phase (re-feeding), the feeding rate was calculated based on the average of the best results in the first phase of the experiment (FCR = 1.45). The re-feeding period lasted for more 29 days. There were no observed significant differences in the water quality parameters among the treatments (P > 0.05). At the end of the food restriction, the shrimp in T0, T0.3 and T0.6 presented lower final weights (P < 0.05), and the weights in the other treatments did not significantly differ (P > 0.05). The survival rate was lower only in T0 in the two phases of the study. The other treatments presented survival rates higher than 95%, with no significant differences among them. The feed intake did not increase during the re-feeding period, indicating that hyperphagia did not occur after a period of food restriction. The SGRs were higher for treatments that received lower amounts of feed in the first phase, and treatments T0, T0.3 and T0.6 presented partial weight compensation compared with the treatments with higher feeding rates. This study indicates that shrimp can be reared in a biofloc system with lower feeding rates, obtaining partial weight compensation and high survival rates and saving up to 24.79% of the artificial feed.

J	Liu, DB; Straus, DL; Pedersen, LF; Meinelt, T				Liu, Dibo; Straus, David L.; Pedersen, Lars-Flemming; Meinelt, Thomas			Pulse versus continuous peracetic acid applications: Effects on rainbow trout performance, biofilm formation and water quality	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												Peracetic acid (PAA) products are being introduced to aquaculture as sustainable disinfectants. Two strategies are used to apply PM: high dose pulse applications, or low dose continuous application. In the present study, their impacts on fish health and water quality were investigated in triplicate flow through tanks stocked with rainbow trout. The gentler and shorter water cortisol increase measured along twice-per-week pulse applications of 1 mg L-1 PM indicated a progressive adaptation of fish. In contrast, the continuous application of 0.2 mg L-1 PM caused no stress to fish. Meanwhile, no mortality and no impact on growth or innate cellular immunity were observed. The pulse applications restricted biofilm formation, and partially inhibited nitrification. Additionally, the highest oxygen concentration and stable pH were observed. In contrast, the continuous application promoted biofilm formation, and caused a pH increase and intermediate oxygen concentration. The contrast was probably due to different susceptibility of microbes to PM-induced oxidative stress. To summarize, pulse PM applications cause minor stress in fish, but have advantages over continuous application by ensuring better water quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Thomas, PJ; Atamanchuk, D; Hovdenes, J; Tengberg, A				Thomas, Peter J.; Atamanchuk, Dariia; Hovdenes, Jostein; Tengberg, Anders			The use of novel optode sensor technologies for monitoring dissolved carbon dioxide and ammonia concentrations under live haul conditions	AQUACULTURAL ENGINEERING												Fish health under live haul transportation on wellboats and in other recirculating aquaculture systems depends on frequent and reliable measurements of water quality, that may change in response to changes in the environmental conditions and treatment processes. While reliable technologies exist for sensors measuring some water quality parameters such as Oxygen concentration and salinity, there is a lack of sensor technologies for the measurement of other critical water quality parameters such as water pCO(2) and NH3 concentrations. Presented is the theory of operation and performance of prototype optical sensors for the measurement of pCO(2) and NH3, as well as the methods used for their calibration and characterization. In order to evaluate the sensor's suitability for aquaculture applications we temporarily installed the sensors on a weliboat and monitored the water quality during the transportation of live mature Atlantic salmon between fish farms and slaughter facilities on the Norwegian coast. Under transportation with different stocking weights and recirculation conditions, the CO2 optode prototypes recorded measurements that coincided with measurements from standard laboratory analysis of spot samples. The pCO(2) concentration in the well throughout the testing was shown to vary between approximately 300ilatm and 20 000 atm. Compared to the pH derived pCO(2) estimation method widely applied in aquaculture, the CO2 optode was more sensitive to small fluctuations in CO2 concentration, and gave measurements closer to the CO2 values recorded by laboratory analysis of spot samples. The NH3 optode reported measurements that were consistent with spot samples analyzed using the salicylate-hypochlorite reaction. In contrast to pCO(2), the concentration of NH3 during the observed weliboat missions was found to be very low and stable at 0.8 0.31.4L(-1). Once fully developed, the CO2 and NH3 optodes could contribute to better water quality control and efficiency during well boat transportations and other recirculating aquaculture systems.

At the same time, deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are becoming an extensively used technique for image classification in a variety of problems. This paper approaches diatom classification with this technique, in order to demonstrate whether it is suitable for solving the classification problem. An extensive dataset was specifically collected (80 types, 100 samples/type) for this study. The dataset covers different illumination conditions and it was computationally augmented to more than 160,000 samples. After that, CNNs were applied over datasets pre-processed with different image processing techniques. An overall accuracy of 99% is obtained for the 80-class problem and different kinds of images (brightfield, normalized). Results were compared to previous presented classification techniques with different number of samples. As far as the authors know, this is the first time that CNNs are applied to diatom classification.

However, its utilization in water desalination is not common due to several barriers and limitations including the saline water quality to be treated and the high cost of such a combined process. Some brackish desalination plants using reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are constructed and under operation. In some of these plants, the raw water is first cooled by damping its heat into the atmosphere using cooling towers. The cooled brackish water is then pumped to the RO membranes. This work discusses several configurations of using geothermal energy to drive desalination of brackish waters. It focuses on the modeling and simulation of a direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) unit powered by geothermal energy sources. The performance of the whole system composed of the geothermal energy source and the desalination unit is modeled using balance equations of mass, energy and species. Hybrid desalination linking membrane distillation (MD) and RO units is also investigated. The results illustrate the benefits of combining the MD-RO and geothermal energy source in terms of enhancement of the plant recovery ratio. They show in particular that the overall recovery ratio for low salinity feed solutions (lower than 2,000 ppm) is high. The simulations show that it can be around 79% and 67% when the feed salinity equals 800 and 2,000 ppm, respectively.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	76						40	52		10.5004/dwt.2016.11378								WOS:000404397600004

In addition, the surface modifications of luffa sponge were investigated. The results showed that luffa sponge functioned well in a bench scale experiment and in a demonstration project, and the main effluent water indexes reached the class IV standard defined by the surface water quality standard of China (GB3838-2002). However, natural luffa sponge is easily hydrolyzed and should be replaced at regular intervals. A microwave-enhanced KH550 (Silane coupling agent gamma-aminopropyltriethoxysilane) coupling method for modifying luffa sponges were performed to reduce the water absorption rate and prolong the engineering service time of the sponge. The results showed that the water absorption rate of the tested luffa sponge fibers was reduced to 22.39% after the fourth set of modifications, and an orthogonal test revealed that the priority order for the factors that affected the modification process was KH550 concentration >microwave reaction time >NAOH concentration > soaking time. The optimal set of modification conditions for luffa sponge fibers was 2% (w/w) NAOH, 1% (w/w) KH550, 30 min of soaking and 180 s of microwave treatment.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	76						155	165		10.5004/dwt.2017.20338								WOS:000404397600015

Water quality of Hanna Lake; Balochistan province in Pakistan has been investigated during 2014. A total of 22 samples were collected during summer and winter months. The physicochemical parameters, metals and bacteriological analysis were performed and compared with WHO, guidelines 2011 and NSDWQ (National Standard of Drinking Water Quality, Pakistan). pH, chloride, hardness, nitrate, total dissolved solids (TDS), Na, K, and Zn are well within the permissible limit as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines and NSDWQ. The concentration of sulphate, Ni and Pb were relatively higher with respect to WHO guidelines and NSDWQ. As concentration was within the limit as per NSDWQ while it is relatively higher (0.04 mg/l) as per WHO guidelines of (0.01 mg/l). All bacteriological parameters (total coliform, total fecal coliforms and total faecal streptococci) were extremely high from public health stand point that renders the water unfit for human consumption. The continued deteriorating environmental conditions of Hanna lake reflect ignorance from government side that can be mended by consistent supervision, long term management and strict enforcement of environmental laws pertaining to the protection of environmental resources. The present study recommends that priority should be given to monitor the water quality of Hanna lake on long term basis which would be helpful in future planning and management of this important water resource in already water scarce area.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	76						174	183		10.5004/dwt.2017.20410								WOS:000404397600017

An investigation of the degree of metal contamination in water, sediment and fish species (Puntius sarana and Labeo rohita) of two sampling sites of the Damodar River, situated in close vicinity to fly ash dump site, in India was performed. Bioaccumulation of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn, Fe and Cd) in liver, gills and muscles of fishes were analyzed by Flame Atomic Absorption spectrophotometry (FAAS). The concentrations of Cu, Mn and Fe in water samples of Site 1 (1.04 mg/L Cu; 0.74 mg/L Mn; 1.13 mg/L Fe) and Site 2 (0.64 mg/L Cu; 0.56 mg/L Mn; 0.90 mg/L Fe) were found above permissible limits (Indian Standards, IS: 10500) of drinking water. Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in sediments of Site 1 ranged from 541.08-552.92 mg/kg and 744.68-754.76 mg/kg dry weight, respectively. Sediments of Site 1 had higher Cu and Zn levels as compared to Site 2 but both the sites had Cu and Zn concentrations above the prescribed sediment limits of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) 1986. Risk Index (RI) for sediments of Site 1 was 102.2, while, for Site 2 was 59.59. The trend for chromium (Cr) concentration in tissues of P. sarana from Site 1 was: muscles > liver > gills and for Lead (Pb) in P. sarana was: liver > gills > muscles. In Site 2, the trend for Zn concentration in L. rohita was: liver > gills > muscles. Concentrations of Cu and Iron (Fe) in muscles of P. sarana of Site 1 were found to be 18.64 mg/kg and 14.26 mg/kg, wet weight, respectively, and were above permissible limits as prescribed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) 1983 while, at Site 2, Fe (13.91 mg/kg) was above FAO limits for muscles of L. rohita. Highest bioaccumulation factor (BAF) value was observed for Pb (145.18) in liver of L. rohita of Site 2. Target hazard quotient (THQ) values for all the metals were below 1, indicating no risk relating to the consumption of fish on human health.

J	Das, A; Munoz-Arriola, F; Singh, SK; Jha, PK; Kumar, M				Das, Aparna; Munoz-Arriola, Francisco; Singh, Sudhir Kumar; Jha, Pawan Kumar; Kumar, Manish			Nutrient dynamics of the Brahmaputra (tropical river) during the monsoon period	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												A rapid population growth and continuous migration to urban centers are posing serious challenges to urban water supplies and demands. Urban demands for continuous and secure water supplies relays on available water resources in quantity and quality. The same supplies of water in urban areas are associated with the uncontrolled releases of organic and inorganic chemical species, including nutrients. The lack of technologies or access to them reduces the ability of water systems to restore its original water quality. Further, areas driven by a single release of water in the form of summer precipitation such as the monsoon require water management strategies that allow assessments of water availability, in quantity and quality, all year long. This work aims to characterize the intra-seasonal drivers of contaminant dynamics in response to rainfall. The objective is to use a single precipitation pulse (intra-seasonal monsoonal rainfall) in a large-scale river basin [Brahmaputra River Basin (BRB)] to evidence water quality responses to hydro-climate forcings. The BRB is located in South East Asia, where summer rainfall influences nutrient replenishment, displacement, and dilution of unregulated pollutants through the basin. Results show that changes in nutrient concentration in streams respond to rainfall patterns and events, evidenced by nutrient displacement through surface runoff. Elevated nutrient concentrations found in some downstream sites can be associated to anthropogenic activities such as agriculture and urban sewage release from densely populated areas in the lower lands of the BRB. Multivariate analysis substantiated the probable source of nutrient release in the BRB. While the source of NO3- can be associated with anthropogenic inputs that of PO43- could be attributed to point sources such as sewage from the ammonia/urea manufacturing industry present near the mainstream. Cluster analysis indicated the potential mobility of PO43- carried by suspended solids in river water and subsequently to organisms some distance away from the source.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	76						212	224		10.5004/dwt.2017.20788								WOS:000404397600020

The results suggest that 71.4% of households use city water as their potable water and define the quality of potable city water as average quality. While the survey findings indicate that the colour and turbidity qualities of accessed water were ranked quite high, conductivity, taste and odour of the water have received lower rankings of satisfaction within a five Likert-scale. Additionally, lack of pre-information on water cuts, insufficient maintenance and repair services and unsatisfactory responses to the consumer complaints were listed as the main problems encountered in city water services. Besides, quality improvement of potable water, water pricing and safety issues were found as the most important items.

Microcystis and Cylindrospermopsis are two common harmful cyanobacterial genera detected in freshwater lakes and reservoirs, with microcystins (MCs) and cylindrospermopsin (CYN) as their important metabolites, respectively. In this study, two sets of duplex qPCR systems were developed, one for quantifying potentially-toxigenic Microcystis and Microcystis, and the other one for cylindrospermopsin-producing cyanobacteria and Cylindrospermopsis. The duplex qPCR systems were developed and validated in the laboratory by using 338 samples collected from 29 reservoirs in Taiwan and her offshore islands. Results show that cell numbers of Microcystis and Cylindorspermopsis enumerated with microscopy, and MCs and CYN concentrations measured with the enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay method, correlated well with their corresponding gene copies determined with the qPCR systems (range of coefficients of determination R-2 = 0.392-0.740). The developed qPCR approach may serve as a useful tool for the water industry to diagnose the presence of harmful cyanobacteria and the potential presence of cyanotoxins in source waters.

A water quality index (WQI) is an available tool to approximate the quality of water and facilitate the work of decision-makers by grouping and analyzing numerous parameters with a single numerical classification system. The objective of this study was to develop a WQI for a dam used for irrigation of about 5000 ha of agricultural land. The dam, La Vega, is located in Teuchitlan, Jalisco, Mexico. Seven sites were selected for water sampling and samples were collected in March, June, July, September, and December 2014 in an initial effort to develop a WQI for the dam. The WQI methodology, which was recommended by the Mexican National Water Commission (CNA), was used. The parameters employed to calculate the WQI were pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), total dissolved solids (TDS), total hardness (TH), alkalinity (Alk), total phosphorous (TP), Cl-, NO3, SO4, Ca, Mg, K, B, As, Cu, and Zn. No significant differences in WQI values were found among the seven sampling sites along the dam. However, seasonal differences in WQI were noted. In March and June, water quality was categorized as poor. By July and September, water quality was classified as medium to good. Quality then decreased, and by December water quality was classified as medium to poor. In conclusion, water treatment must be applied before waters from La Vega dam reservoir can be used for irrigation or other purposes. It is recommended that the water quality at La Vega dam is continually monitored for several years in order to confirm the findings of this short-term study.

The Occurrence and Diversity of Waterborne Fungi in African Aquatic Systems: Their Impact on Water Quality and Human Health	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												Currently, there is a worldwide growing interest in the occurrence and diversity of fungi and their secondary metabolites in aquatic systems, especially concerning their role in water quality and human health. However, this concern is hampered by the scant information that is available in the literature about aquatic fungi and how they affect water quality. There are only few published reports that link certain species of aquatic fungi to human health. The common aquatic fungal species that have been reported so far in African aquatic systems belong to the hyphomycetes kingdom. This paper thus aims to survey the information about the occurrence and factors that control the distribution of different species of fungi in African aquatic systems, as well as their effect on water quality and the possible metabolic pathways that lead to the formation of toxic secondary metabolites that are responsible for the deterioration of water quality. This review will also investigate the analytical and bioanalytical procedures that have been reported for the identification of different species of waterborne fungi and their secondary metabolites.

Levels and Distribution of Pollutants in the Waters of an Aquatic Ecosystem in Northern Mexico	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH												The availability of good quality water resources is essential to ensure healthy crops and livestock. The objective of this study was to evaluate the level of pollution in Bustillos Lagoon in northern Mexico. Physical-chemical parameters like sodium, chloride, sulfate, electrical conductivity, nitrates, and the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) were analyzed to determine the water quality available in the lagoon. Although DDT has been banned in several countries, it is still used for agricultural purposes in Mexico and its presence in this area had not been analyzed previously. Bustillos Lagoon was divided into three zones for the evaluation: (1) industrial; (2) communal lands; and (3) agricultural. The highest concentrations of sodium (2360 mg/L) and SAR (41 meq/L) reported in the industrial zone are values exceeding the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) irrigation water quality guidelines. DDT and its metabolites were detected in all of the 21 sites analyzed, in the agricultural zone Sigma DDTs = 2804 ng/mL, this level is much higher than those reported for other water bodies in Mexico and around the world where DDT has been used heavily. The water in the communal zone is the least contaminated, but can only be recommended for irrigation of plants with high stress tolerance and not for crops.																	1660-4601					MAY	2017	14	5							456	10.3390/ijerph14050456								WOS:000404106400004

Fjord light regime: Bio-optical variability, absorption budget, and hyperspectral light availability in Sognefjord and Trondheimsfjord, Norway	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Optically active constituents (OACs) in addition to water molecules attenuate light via processes of absorption and scattering and thereby determine underwater light availability. An analysis of their optical properties helps in determining the contribution of each of these to light attenuation. With an aim to study the bio-optical variability, absorption budget and 1% spectral light availability, hydrographical (temperature and salinity), and hyperspectral optical (downwelling irradiance and upwelling radiance) profiles were measured along fjord transects in Sognefjord and Trondheimsfjord, Norway. Optical water quality observations were also performed using Secchi disc and Forel-Ule scale. In concurrence, water samples were collected and analyzed via visible spectrophotometry, fluorometry, and gravimetry to quantify and derive inherent optical properties of the water constituents. An absorption model (R-2=0.91, n=36, p<0.05) as a function of OACs is developed for Sognefjord using multiple regression analysis. Influenced by glacial meltwater, Sognefjord had higher concentration of inorganic suspended matter, while Trondheimsfjord had higher concentrations of CDOM. Increase in turbidity caused increased attenuation of light upstream, as a result of which the euphotic depth decreased from outer to inner fjord sections. Triangular representation of absorption budget revealed dominant absorption by CDOM at 443-555 nm, while that by phytoplankton at 665 nm. Sognefjord however exhibited much greater optical complexity. A significantly strong correlation between salinity and a(cdom)440 is used to develop an algorithm to estimate a(cdom)440 using salinity in Trondheimsfjord.																	2169-9275	2169-9291				MAY	2017	122	5					3828	3847		10.1002/2016JC012610								WOS:000404363600018

To evaluate the outcomes of WSP application in large drinking water systems in France and Spain, we undertook analysis of water quality and compliance indicators between 2003 and 2015, in conjunction with an observational retrospective cohort study of acute gastroenteritis incidence, before and after WSPs were implemented at five locations. Measured water quality indicators included bacteria (E. coli, fecal streptococci, total coliform, heterotrophic plate count), disinfectants (residual free and total chlorine), disinfection by-products (trihalomethanes, bromate), aluminum, pH, turbidity, and total organic carbon, comprising about 240 K manual samples and 1.2 M automated sensor readings. We used multiple, Poisson, or Tobit regression models to evaluate water quality before and after the WSP intervention. The compliance assessment analyzed exceedances of regulated, recommended, or operational water quality thresholds using chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests. Poisson regression was used to examine acute gastroenteritis incidence rates in WSP-affected drinking water service areas relative to a comparison area. Implementation of a WSP generally resulted in unchanged or improved water quality, while compliance improved at most locations. Evidence for reduced acute gastroenteritis incidence following WSP implementation was found at only one of the three locations examined. Outcomes of WSPs should be expected to vary across large water utilities in developed nations, as the intervention itself is adapted to the needs of each location. The approach may translate to diverse water quality, compliance, and health outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

We applied ensemble modelling to study the hydrodynamic and thermal behaviour of the Mediterranean reservoir of Bimont (France). We used a single-model ensemble composed of three realizations of the same hydrodynamic model (Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model, DYRESM) with different calibration parameter values as follows: 1) default parameter values, 2) parameter values obtained by manual calibration, and 3) parameter values corresponding to the best performing member of a set of behavioural parameter sets obtained using the GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) method. The results confirmed the good performance of the ensemble average for lake water temperature simulations. A loss of signal was present because of the smoothing induced by model averaging, especially for the simulation of surface temperature. Single ensembles are a good alternative to obtain consistently better simulation results in hydrodynamic simulations, as well as providing a qualitative estimation of uncertainty. However, awareness of its limitations is necessary when interpreting the results.																	0213-8409	1989-1806				MAY	2017	36	1					1	14		10.23818/limn.36.01								WOS:000404325000001

However, describing the overall groundwater quality condition-particularly in a mining basin-is more complicated due to the spatial variability of multiple contaminants and the wide range of indicators found in these areas. This study applies a geographic information system (GIS)-based groundwater quality index (GQI) to assess water quality in a mining basin. The study synthesized nine different water quality parameters available-nitrate, sulphate, chloride, sodium, magnesium, calcium, dissolved mineral solids, potassium, and floride (NO3-, SO42-, Cl-, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, DMS, K+ and F-)-from 90 boreholes across the basin by indexing them numerically relative to the World Health Organization standards. The study compared data from 2006 and 2011. The produced map indicated a lower GQI of 67 in 2011 compared to 72 in 2006. The maximum GQI of 84.4 calculated using only three parameters (Mg2+, K+ and F-) compared well with the GQI of 84.6 obtained using all nine parameters. A noticeable declining groundwater quality trend was observed in most parts of the basin, especially in the south-western and the northern parts of the basin. The temporal variation between the GQIs for 2006 and 2011 indicated variable groundwater quality (coefficient of variation = 15-30%) in areas around the mining field, and even more variability (coefficient of variation >30%) in the south-western and eastern parts of the basin.																	2071-1050					MAY	2017	9	5							823	10.3390/su9050823								WOS:000404127800148

In this study, a long-term (3.7 years) investigation experiment was conducted to estimate the sustainability of a constructed wetland (CW) under the impact of aquatic organisms overloading. The situation of aquatic organisms overloading in this study meant that around 27,000 kg of fishes had to be moved and accommodated in a 4 ha water area of wetland for six months. Experimental results indicated that the pH value of CW water was slightly acidic and the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) level decreased under the impact. On the other hand, the levels of Electrical Conductivity (EC), Suspended Solids (SS), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) of CW water were increased under the impact. The pathogen analysis revealed that total coliforms, Salmonella spp., Enterococcus spp., and Escherichia coli, in the wetland water increased under the impact. The analyzed factors of water quality and amount of pathogens were all returned to their original statuses soon after the impact ended. Eventually, the results of microbial community structure analysis showed that overloading of aquatic organisms slightly increased the specific richness (R) of wetland bacteria, whereas higher structural biodiversity (H) of CW could stabilize the whole microbial community and prevent the pathogens or other bacteria from increasing to become the dominant strains. These results were novel and could be possible to conclude that a CW environment could not only stabilize the water quality and amount of pathogens resulting from the impact of aquatic organisms overloading, but also they could stabilize the microbial community structures, allowing the biogeochemical cycles of the CW to function. They could provide the useful information for wetland sustainability.

Optimum Returns from Greenhouse Vegetables under Water Quality and Risk Constraints in the UAE	SUSTAINABILITY												Greenhouses have been used in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to produce vegetables that contribute toward UAE food security, including offering fresh vegetable produce in the off-season. However, to manage such greenhouses, farmers face both technical and environmental limitations (i.e., high water scarcity), as well as vegetable market price instability. The objective of this study is to explore tradeoffs between returns (i.e., gross margin) of selected vegetables (tomato, pepper, and cucumber), risk (deviation from gross margin means), and an environmental constraint (water salinity) using a unique target MOTAD (minimization of total absolute deviations) approach to support UAE farmer decision-making processes. The optimal target MOTAD solution included all three vegetables and no corner solution. The results showed tradeoffs between returns and risks, and confirmed that product diversification reduces overall risk. The analysis was consistent with farmer perceptions based on a survey of 78 producers in the region. The search for the optimal mix of vegetable production under UAE greenhouse conditions revealed that reduction in tomato production should be offset by an increase in cucumber production while maintaining a constant level of pepper production. In other words, risk is reduced as cucumber production increases due to the high level of tomato and lettuce price volatility as the alternative to cucumber. The results also demonstrated the importance of the water salinity environmental constraint, as it was found to have a positive marginal value in the optimal vegetable mix solution (i.e., important factor). Thus the optimal solution was highly sensitive to changes in the crop water salinity constraint. The study results also demonstrate that the target MOTAD approach is a suitable optimization methodology. As a practical approach, a decision-maker in the UAE can consider gross margin (total revenue-variable costs) maximization with risk and water quality constraints to find the optimal vegetable product mix under greenhouse conditions.

An Analysis of Multiyear Measurements	SUSTAINABILITY												It has become increasingly important to study the urban heat island phenomenon due to the adverse effects on summertime cooling energy demand, air and water quality and most importantly, heat-related illness and mortality. The present article analyses the magnitude and the characteristics of the urban heat island in Sydney, Australia. Climatic data from six meteorological stations distributed around the greater Sydney region and covering a period of 10 years are used. It is found that both strong urban heat island (UHI) and oasis phenomena are developed. The average maximum magnitude of the phenomena may exceed 6 K. The intensity and the characteristics of the phenomena are strongly influenced by the synoptic weather conditions and in particular the development of the sea breeze and the westerly winds from the desert area. The magnitude of the urban heat island varies between 0 and 11 degrees C, as a function of the prevailing weather conditions. The urban heat island mainly develops during the warm summer season while the oasis phenomenon is stronger during the winter and intermediate seasons. Using data from an extended network of stations the distribution of Cooling Degree Days in the greater Sydney area is calculated. It is found that because of the intense development of the UHI, Cooling Degree Days in Western Sydney are about three times higher than in the Eastern coastal zone. The present study will help us to better design and implement urban mitigation strategies to counterbalance the impact of the urban heat island in the city.

In this work, jet water flow and ultrasonic irradiation with a 200-kHz frequency were integrated to study the effect of the system operation on the water quality of a stagnant Yeo-cheon River section. Samples were continuously collected only under jet flow and then under the combined system for 2 and 10 weeks, respectively. In general, the integrated system showed a localized improvement in the water quality in terms of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and dissolved reactive phosphate. Dissolved oxygen (DO) increased by more than 100% at 5 and 25 m, and increased in average by 60% further downstream. Even though flow was expected to suspend the sediments and increase turbidity, in the combined treatment, there was no increase, which was likely due to the agglomeration and settling out of particles due to sonication. However, the nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon concentrations showed a fluctuating trend. The inverse association between DO and Chl-a decreased from a coefficient of 0.51-0.37 when the ultrasonic irradiation unit was coupled with the flow, which resulted in a reduction effect on the Chl-a concentration from ultrasonication. The relationship between DO and reactive phosphate also indicated a higher influence of ultrasonication than flow on the phosphorus concentration. In general, the cumulative effect of the water flow and ultrasonic irradiation met the water quality requirement of the river for a healthy ecological interaction.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				MAY	2017	74						115	124		10.5004/dwt.2017.20600								WOS:000403572000011

Assessment of water quality of man-made lakes in Klang Valley (Malaysia) using chemometrics: the impact of mining	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Assessing water quality of the ex-mining ponds for its proper utilization is pertinent considering the metal pollutants and lack of proper environmental measures is associated with the mining operations. In this study, water samples from 13 man-made lakes including 8 ex-mining ponds in the Klang Valley, Malaysia were analyzed for dissolved oxygen, suspended solid, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammoniacal nitrogen (AN), total dissolved solid (TDS), and metals including As, Cd, Pb, Mn, Fe, Na, Mg, and Ca. The variations in these parameters were evaluated with the chemometric techniques. The results from the principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis suggested that in addition to the degree of contamination, the variations in heavy metal concentrations were mainly attributed to the ex-mining activities, whereas deviations in BOD, TDS, AN, and EC were subjected to the current domestic inputs. The linear discriminant analysis showed that water samples from the ex-mining ponds were highly associated with Mn, Cd, Ca, and As. The As and Cd levels recorded in most of the ex-mining ponds were 11.3 +/- 0.4, 116 +/- 2, and 42 +/- 0.5 mu g/L; and 12.9 +/- 0.2, 12.23 +/- 0.02, 12.19 +/- 0.01, and 12.15 +/- 0.01 mu g/L, respectively. These values surpassed the reference limits, which make them unfit for domestic uses.

Chemical depletion-enrichment profiles of soils, combined with regolith thickness and groundwater data indicate the importance to stream hydrochemistry of incongruent dissolution of silicate minerals during deep bedrock weathering, which is primarily limited by water fluxes, in this highly fractured, young volcanic terrain. Under high flow conditions (e.g., spring snowmelt), wetting of soil and regolith surfaces and presence of organic acids promote mineral dissolution and provide a constant supply of base cations, Si, and DIC to soil water and groundwater. Mixing of waters from different hydrochemical reservoirs in the near stream environment during wet periods leads to the chemostatic behavior of DIC, base cations, and Si in stream flow. Metals transported by organic matter complexation (i.e., Ge, Al) and/or colloids (i.e., Al) during periods of soil saturation and lateral connectivity to the stream display a positive relationship with Q. Variable Si-Q relationships, under all but the highest flow conditions, can be explained by nonconservative transport and precipitation of clay minerals, which influences long versus short-term Si weathering fluxes. By combining measurements of the CZ obtained across different spatial and temporal scales, we were able to constrain weathering processes in different hydrological reservoirs that may be flushed to the stream during hydrologic events, thereby informing C-Q relationships.

Partitioning of the diffuse attenuation coefficient for photosynthetically available irradiance in a deep dendritic tropical lake	ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS												We studied the effects of particulate and dissolved optically active components on the attenuation of photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) in a tropical lake. The temporal and spatial distribution of tripton, Chl-a and a CDOM (440) and their relative contribution to the diffuse PAR attenuation coefficient (Kd) was investigated at 21 sites (dry and wet seasons and two intermediate periods) and at monthly interval at 1 pelagic site. Higher values of Kd were observed during the mixing period, characterized by a higher concentration of tripton and Chl-a compared to the stratified rainy season. In the spatial sampling PAR attenuation was dominated by tripton absorption/scattering (average relative contribution of 79%), followed by Chl-a (average 11.6%). In the monthly sampling tripton and Chl-a accounted for most of the Kd with relative contributions of 47.8% and 35.6%, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that Chl-a and tripton in combination explained 97% of the monthly variation in Kd (p< 0.001), but Chl-a had more influence (higher regression coefficient). Thus, although most of light attenuation was due to tripton, seasonal variations in phytoplankton abundance were responsible for most of the temporal fluctuations in Kd.

These insects have been, in some cases, well studied because they are vectors of several diseases. This is the first comprehensive faunistic study of aquatic insects from Babol County. The results may provide basic data for further taxonomic and ecological studies of aquatic insects as biological control agent or classification of water quality for the country. Methods: The specimens were collected using different methods including: D-frame net collector, standard mosquito dipper (350ml), Sweep-Netting and plastic pipette. Sampling carried out in different part of breading places in several times. Results: During this study a total of 196 aquatic specimens were collected from different habitats and were morphologically identified including 18 families classified in 6 orders: Diptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Hemiptera and Odonata. Babol and Amol district in Mazandaran Province are located in humid climate regions with suitable ecological factors of humidity, moderate temperature and the variety of plant species. There are different species of aquatic insects in different habitats. Conclusion: The results will provide information for biodeveristy, species richness, their role for biological control as well as calcification of rivers based on abundance of aquatic insects. Therefore the understanding of ecological specifications of aquatic insects could provide a clue for further Arthropod-borne disease control. Additionally aquatic insect could be used for classification of water bodies																	2322-1984	2322-2271				MAY	2017	11	2					286	301										WOS:000403823700012	29062853

In the present study, three outlier identification methods the three sigma rule (3 sigma), inter quantile range (IQR), and median absolute deviation (MAD) that take advantage of the ensemble regression method are proposed by considering non-Gaussian characteristics of groundwater data. For validation purposes, the performance of the methods is compared using simulated and actual groundwater data with a few hypothetical conditions. In the validations using simulated data, all of the proposed methods reasonably identify outliers at a 5% outlier level; whereas, only the IQR method performs well for identifying outliers at a 30% outlier level. When applying the methods to real groundwater data, the outlier identification performance of the IQR method is found to be superior to the other two methods. However, the IQR method shows limitation by identifying excessive false outliers, which may be overcome by its joint application with other methods (for example, the 3 sigma rule and MAD methods). The proposed methods can be also applied as potential tools for the detection of future anomalies by model training based on currently available data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of in-stream structures and channel flow rate variation on transient storage	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In-stream structures can potentially enhance surface and subsurface solute retention. They form naturally in small streams and their installation has gained popularity in stream restoration for multiple purposes, including improved water quality. Yet few studies have quantified the cumulative effect of multiple structures on solute transport at the reach scale, nor how this varies with changing stream flow. We built a series of weirs in a small stream to simulate channel spanning structures such as natural debris dams and stream restoration log dams and boulder weirs. We conducted constant rate conservative (NaCl) tracer injections to quantify the effect of the weirs on solute transport at the reach scale. We used a one dimensional solute transport model with transient storage to quantify the change of solute transport parameters with increasing number of weirs. Results indicate that adding weirs significantly increased the cross-sectional area of the surface stream (A) and transient storage zones (A(s)) while exchange with transient storage (cc) decreased. The increase in A and As is due to backwater behind weirs and increased hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange induced by the weirs, while we surmise that the reduction in alpha is due at least in part to reduced hydrodynamically driven hyporheic exchange in bed ripples drowned by the weir backwater. In order for weir installation to achieve net improvement in solute retention and thus water quality, cumulative reactions in weir backwater and enhanced hydrostatically driven hyporheic exchange would have to overcome the reduced hydrodynamically driven exchange. Analysis of channel flow variation over the course of the experiments indicated that weirs change the relationship between transient storage parameters and flow, for example the trend of increasing a with flow without weirs was reversed in the presence of weirs. Effects of flow variation were substantial, indicating that transient storage measurements at a single point in time typically cannot be extrapolated to estimate net annual effects. Thus, rigorous evaluation of water quality effects of stream restoration structures requires measurements at multiple channel flow rates. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.					Rana, S.M.

In this paper, two scenarios were considered for Multi-Station (MS) nitrate load modeling of the Little River watershed. In the first scenario, Markovian characteristics of streamflow-nitrate time series were proposed for the MS modeling. For this purpose, feature extraction criterion of Mutual Information (MI) was employed for input selection of artificial intelligence models (Feed Forward Neural Network, FFNN and least square support vector machine). In the second scenario for considering seasonality-based characteristics of the time series, wavelet transform was used to extract multi-scale features of streamflow-nitrate time series of the watershed's sub-basins to model MS nitrate loads. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) clustering technique which finds homogeneous sub series clusters was also linked to MI for proper cluster agent choice to be imposed into the models for predicting the nitrate loads of the watershed's sub-basins. The proposed MS method not only considers the prediction of the outlet nitrate but also covers predictions of interior sub-basins nitrate load values. The results indicated that the proposed FFNN model coupled with the SOM-MI improved the performance of MS nitrate predictions compared to the Markovian-based models up to 39%. Overall, accurate selection of dominant inputs which consider seasonality-based characteristics of streamflow-nitrate process could enhance the efficiency of nitrate load predictions.

Data and techniques that allow detailed identification and quantification of pyrite oxidation are therefore crucial for assessing and predicting the adverse water quality changes that may be associated with this process. In this study, we explore the benefits of combining stable sulphur isotope analysis with reactive transport modelling to improve the identification and characterisation of pyrite oxidation during an aquifer storage and recovery experiment in a chemically and physically heterogeneous aquifer. We characterise the stable sulphur isotope signal (634S) in both the ambient groundwater and the injectant as well as its spatial distribution within the sedimentary sulphur species. The identified stable sulphur isotope signal for pyrite was found to vary between 32 and +34%o, while the signal of the injectant ranged between +9.06 and +14.45%0 during the injection phase of the experiment. Both isotope and hydrochemical data together suggest a substantial contribution of pyrite oxidation to the observed, temporally variable delta S-34 signals. The variability of the delta S-34 signal in pyrite and the injectant were both found to complicate the analysis of the stable isotope data. However, the incorporation of the data into a numerical modelling approach allowed to successfully employ the delta S-34 signatures as a valuable additional constraint for identifying and quantifying the contribution of pyrite oxidation to the redox transformations that occur in response to the injection of oxygenated water.

M.; Han, Dawei			Representing radar rainfall uncertainty with ensembles based on a time-variant geostatistical error modelling approach	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The application of radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) to hydrology and water quality models can be preferred to interpolated rainfall point measurements because of the wide coverage that radars can provide, together with a good spatio-temporal resolutions. Nonetheless, it is often limited by the proneness of radar QPE to a multitude of errors. Although radar errors have been widely studied and techniques have been developed to correct most of them, residual errors are still intrinsic in radar QPE. An estimation of uncertainty of radar QPE and an assessment of uncertainty propagation in modelling applications is important to quantify the relative importance of the uncertainty associated to radar rainfall input in the overall modelling uncertainty. A suitable tool for this purpose is the generation of radar rainfall ensembles. An ensemble is the representation of the rainfall field and its uncertainty through a collection of possible alternative rainfall fields, produced according to the observed errors, their spatial characteristics, and their probability distribution. The errors are derived from a comparison between radar QPE and ground point measurements. The novelty of the proposed ensemble generator is that it is based on a geostatistical approach that assures a fast and robust generation of synthetic error fields, based on the time-variant characteristics of errors. The method is developed to meet the requirement of operational applications to large datasets. The method is applied to a case study in Northern England, using the UK Met Office NIMROD radar composites at 1 km resolution and at 1 h accumulation on an area of 180 km by 180 km. The errors are estimated using a network of 199 tipping bucket rain gauges from the Environment Agency. 183 of the rain gauges are used for the error modelling, while 16 are kept apart for validation. The validation is done by comparing the radar rainfall ensemble with the values recorded by the validation rain gauges. The validated ensemble is then tested on a hydrological case study, to show the advantage of probabilistic rainfall for uncertainty propagation. The ensemble spread only partially captures the mismatch between the modelled and the observed flow. The residual uncertainty can be attributed to other sources of uncertainty, in particular to model structural uncertainty, parameter identification uncertainty, uncertainty in other inputs, and uncertainty in the observed flow.

Trace organic chemical attenuation during managed aquifer recharge: Insights from a variably saturated 2D tank experiment	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Meaningful model-based predictions of water quality and quantity are imperative for the designed footprint of managed aquifer recharge installations. A two-dimensional (2D) synthetic MAR system equipped with automated sensors (temperature, water pressure, conductivity, soil moisture, oxidation-reduction potential) and embedded water sampling ports was used to test and model fundamental subsurface processes during surface spreading managed aquifer recharge operations under controlled flow and redox conditions at the meso-scale. The fate and transport of contaminants in the variably saturated synthetic aquifer were simulated using the finite element analysis model, FEFLOW. In general, the model concurred with travel times derived from contaminant breakthrough curves at individual sensor locations throughout the 2D tank. However, discrepancies between measured and simulated trace organic chemical concentrations (i.e., carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, tris (2-chloroethyl) phosphate, trimethoprim) were observed. While the FEFLOW simulation of breakthrough curves captured overall shapes of trace organic chemical concentrations well, the model struggled with matching individual data points, although compound-specific attenuation parameters were used. Interestingly, despite steady-state operation, oxidation-reduction potential measurements indicated temporal disturbances in hydraulic properties in the saturated zone of the 2D tank that affected water quality.

A position percent interpolation equation was established to determine nodal vertical-coordinates and match boundaries. For 3-D simulations of subsurface zones, an additional mesh generation method was proposed to create quadrilaterals for filling the empty regions along river reaches and around junctions with storage, ponds or lakes. In order to deal With special storage region with an odd number of boundary nodes, an additional triangle was inserted. Five topological optimization templates were proposed to improve the quality of degenerated elements. This paper proposed the basic algorithms to generate quadrilateral-prism meshes through stretching the quadrilateral mesh along vertical directions based on material domains. Aiming at four types of fractures, corresponding extraction methods were presented to preserve geometric features. In order to accommodate the need for overland and subsurface simulations, 1-D/2-D/3-D correspondence was established between rivers, junctions, ponds, lakes, control structures and finite element meshes. Finally, several realistic hydrologic and geologic examples for meshing multi-domain areas were provided to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the mesh generator developed in this paper.

Monitoring of both anti-inflammatory and the parameters temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen was held in this water body during 12 consecutive months (October 2008 to September 2009). Water samples were collected monthly at six points representing different sections of the stream. The samples were subjected to solid phase extraction procedure and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. To check the influence of water temperature on the occurrence of the anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and naproxen in aquatic environments, it was used a logistic model of regression, the Statistical Analysis System version 9.0. The anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac and naproxen were detected at different points in the Stream of Onca. The other parameters evaluated in this study were compared with the water quality standards established by the CONAMA Resolution 357/2005. The highest concentration of diclofenac was detected in the point located downstream of the wastewater treatment plant of the city, while the largest concentration of naproxen was recorded at the mouth of the stream. The water temperature influence, in an inversely proportional way, the occurrence of both anti-inflammatory in the stream, the higher the temperature the lower the water body probability of detection of drug diclofenac and naproxen.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAY-JUN	2017	22	3					429	435		10.1590/S1413-41522017128719								WOS:000403268900003

This paper aims to present an innovative technology for building rainwater storage tanks in western Santa Catarina. It presents a slate tank with a capacity of 250 m(3), which is part of a rainwater harvesting system implanted on a pig production in western Santa Catarina (Brazil). In this system, the rainwater is used for livestock drinking and to sanitation farms. It also presents, with less focus, rainwater treatment devices developed in this research project. A comparative analysis of costs between this tank and commonly used tanks in the study area was realized. Physico-chemical and bacteriological tests of rainwater were done in different parts of the system in order to check if the water quality is suitable for the intended uses. This technology showed speed and ease construction and low cost of implementation. The slate plaque, besides serving as a form to ferrocement layer, it's a natural and abundant material in the central region of Santa Catarina. The physical-chemical and bacteriological tests displayed the efficiency of the rainwater treatment devices applied in this research project. Finally, it was noted that rainwater is suitable for animal consumption, since it observed the conditions and standards for waters of Class 3 of CONAMA Resolution 357. Thus, this new technology has great potential for application and economic viability for the study area.																	1413-4152	1809-4457				MAY-JUN	2017	22	3					563	570		10.1590/S1413-41522017177829								WOS:000403268900018						
J	Dvorak, JS; Zhang, NQ				Dvorak, Joseph Scot; Zhang, Naiqian			Optimal design of velocity sensor for open channel flow using CFD	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In this study, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to design the geometry of a new velocity sensor for measuring open channel flows. This sensor determined velocity by observing the travel of dye carried in the flow. Evaluation of this design required the development of fluid dynamics models to determine potential errors in fluid velocity measurement due to velocity changes caused by intrusion of the sensor in the fluid. It also required an analysis technique to determine the expected sensor response to the flow fields that resulted from the CFD modeling. These models were then used to improve the geometry of the sensor to minimize the measurement error. Starting with a simple design for the sensor geometry, the CFD analysis modeled the open channel flow around the sensor as turbulent using both the k-omega and k-epsilon Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models. The model predicted that the original sensor design would underestimate the free-stream velocities of open channels by 7.9% to 2.0% across a range from 0.1 m/s to 5.0 m/s. After using CFD to improve the sensor design, the velocity measurement error was limited to less than 4% across the same velocity range.																	1934-6344	1934-6352				MAY	2017	10	3					130	142		10.3965/j.ijabe.20171003.2147								WOS:000403582400014

A STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF LAND USE AND OCCUPATION ON BASIN WATER QUALITY THROUGH MULTIVARIATE STATISTICS	ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA												Without effective actions to improve environmental management, water resources tend to become scarce. Thus, this study aimed to understand the processes influencing the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the water due to land uses and occupation in the Ipe stream basin, in Ilha Solteira - SP (Brazil), regarding the dependence of the analyzed variables. Monitoring of chemical, physical, and biological water quality was performed from 2006 to 2011, and the records of land use and occupation in 2011. A factorial multivariate analysis allowed us to understand that the processes in densely populated areas increased degradation of water by the input of organic loads, yet those of farming areas enhanced the degradation of the chemical and physical quality of spring waters. Therefore, installing irrigation systems near populated areas, for crops consumed in natura, may compromise this agricultural activity, as well as the absence of water filtration systems downstream agricultural areas. Furthermore, we concluded that multivariate statistics is a powerful tool to detect these influencing processes in water quality. In this study, this type of analysis played an important role isolating the processes acting on water quality.																	0100-6916					MAY-JUN	2017	37	3					453	462		10.1590/1809-4430-Eng.Agric.v37n3p453-462/2017								WOS:000403433700006

The Effect of Salinity on the Growth and Nutrient Status of Zinnia Grown Under Short- and Long-cycle Subirrigation Management	HORTSCIENCE												As water resources become limited, agricultural producers must resort to alternative sources for irrigation, including municipal reclaimed water which may contain impurities such as salts that can adversely impact irrigation management practices and crop yield. To test the effects of salinity on plant growth and nutrient composition under greenhouse conditions, zinnia (Zinnia elegans) was produced under two different subirrigation management regimes and exposed to various concentrations of NaCl to simulate the crop production challenges associated with poor water quality. Plants received either short-or long-cycle subirrigation to achieve differing levels of potting medium saturation at each irrigation event. Plants under these two irrigation management regimes were challenged with NaCl at concentrations up to 1.5 g.L-1 or 3 dS.mL(-1). Zinnia plants accumulated more Na in shoot tissues as salinity in the irrigation water increased from 0 to 1.5 g.L-1. The electrical conductivity (EC) in the potting medium also increased over time, and the rate of leaf area expansion decreased with increasing levels of salinity in the irrigation water. Short-cycle irrigation management has been shown to increase fertilizer and water use efficiency (WUE), thereby reducing the costs associated with these resources and also reducing the environmental impacts of agricultural crop production. In our study, the medium under short-cycle subirrigation management had lower gravimetric water content (GWC), both before and after irrigation, than the medium under long-cycle subirrigation, but the drier medium conditions did not increase susceptibility to salt injury. Furthermore, plants grown under short-cycle irrigation management for 4 to 6 weeks accumulated less Na in shoot tissue than plants grown under long-cycle irrigation management. Sodium accumulation in the shoot tissues was a product of both the amount of sodium in the irrigation solution and the amount of water used by the plant over time. Therefore, short-cycle subirrigation can be used as an effective water management technique even when raw water quality is poor as represented by elevated salinity. Our research indicates that zinnia can be irrigated with saline water up to 0.5 g.L-1 NaCl (an EC of 1 dS.m(-1)) in a 5-week production cycle without adverse effects on growth.																	0018-5345	2327-9834				MAY	2017	52	5					770	773		10.21273/HORTSCI10764-16								WOS:000403210900016

Toward mountains without permanent snow and ice	EARTHS FUTURE												The cryosphere in mountain regions is rapidly declining, a trend that is expected to accelerate over the next several decades due to anthropogenic climate change. A cascade of effects will result, extending from mountains to lowlands with associated impacts on human livelihood, economy, and ecosystems. With rising air temperatures and increased radiative forcing, glaciers will become smaller and, in some cases, disappear, the area of frozen ground will diminish, the ratio of snow to rainfall will decrease, and the timing and magnitude of both maximum and minimum streamflow will change. These changes will affect erosion rates, sediment, and nutrient flux, and the biogeochemistry of rivers and proglacial lakes, all of which influence water quality, aquatic habitat, and biotic communities. Changes in the length of the growing season will allow low-elevation plants and animals to expand their ranges upward. Slope failures due to thawing alpine permafrost, and outburst floods from glacier-and moraine-dammed lakes will threaten downstream populations.Societies even well beyond the mountains depend on meltwater from glaciers and snow for drinking water supplies, irrigation, mining, hydropower, agriculture, and recreation. Here, we review and, where possible, quantify the impacts of anticipated climate change on the alpine cryosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere, and consider the implications for adaptation to a future of mountains without permanent snow and ice.

Large seaweed (Gracilaria lemaneiformis) cultivation zones (LZ), fish culture zones (FZ), and control zones (CZ) were sampled. According to community-level physiological profiling, D-mannitol, D-mannitol/alpha-D-lactose, and D-mannitol/alpha-cyclodextrin were the carbon sources with the highest utilization rates in CZ, LZ, and FZ, respectively (R-s > 1.9). Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the dominant bacteria in CZ and LZ were Alphaproteobacteria (39.9 and 34.5%, respectively), whereas in FZ they were Flavobacteria (32.2%). The Shannon diversity in CZ and LZ was significantly higher than in FZ (P < 0.05). Some opportunistic pathogens, such as Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas and Loktanella, were abundant in FZ. The microbial communities and most of the dominant bacteria in FZ were more affected by environmental factors including salinity, chemical oxygen demand and total phosphorus. Some bacteria, such as Brevundimonas and Polaribater, have the potential to degrade agar in seaweed, and were isolated from samples rich in algae which are dominant in LZ. The cultivation of G. lemaneiformis created the notable structures and functions of macroalgae-associated bacterial communities that were less affected by the environmental factors examined.																	0919-9268	1444-2906				MAY	2017	83	3					465	477		10.1007/s12562-017-1073-5								WOS:000403085500013

Understanding the dominant processes shaping eutrophication processes is crucial to sustainable water management in lake catchments. The aim of the study was to determine the importance of elements of lake-catchment system structures in the processes of shaping lake water quality. The values of loads delivered to the lake basins from their catchments as well as nutrient output were calculated on the basis of stream discharge and nutrient concentration. A range of hydro-chemical influences of each stream was presented by means of a range of a radius. A model of nutrient transport (prepared in GIS software) was used in the catchment of a lake without tributaries. Additionally, phytoplankton abundance and water quality indices were calculated. The results showed a clear pattern for the following lakes, Syczynskie > Pniowno > Chuteckie > Tarnowskie, in terms of nutrient load as well as water quality. The hydrochemical influence of lake tributaries was determined by runoff processes, which reflected catchment geology, relief, and flushing time. The Q index showed a good ecological status for lakes Chuteckie and Tarnowskie, moderate for Lake Pniowno, and poor for Lake Syczynskie.

This study focused on the composition and stability of blooms as well as their taxa-specific ecological sensitivity to the main causal factors (especially phosphorus and nitrogen) in degraded urban lakes. The analyzed lakes were assessed with respect to the trophic state as well as ecological status. Total phytoplankton biomass (ranging from 1.5 to 181.3 mg dm(-3)) was typical of blooms of different intensity, which can appear during a whole growing season but are the most severe in early or late summer. Our results suggested that steady-state and non-steady-state bloom assemblages including mono-, bi- and multi-species or heterogeneous blooms may occur in urban lakes. The most intense blooms were formed by the genera of Cyanobacteria: Microcystis, Limnothrix, Pseudanabaena, Planktothrix, Bacillariophyta: Cyclotella and Dinophyta mainly Ceratium and Peridinium. Considering the sensitivity of phytoplankton assemblages, a new eco-sensitivity factor was proposed (E-SF), based on the concept of Phytoplankton Trophic Index composed of trophic scores of phytoplankton taxa along the eutrophication gradient: The E-SF values of 0.5, 1.3, 6.7 and 15.1 were recognized in lakes having a high, good, moderate or poor ecological status, respectively. For lake restoration, each type of bloom should be considered separately because of different sensitivities of taxa and relationships with environmental variables. Proper recognition of the taxa-specific response to abiotic (especially to N and P enrichment) and biotic factors could have significant implications for further water protection and management (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The present study was conducted to propose a standard solution for the removal of Bacillus subtilis as a model of Cryptosporidium from drinking water using a bipolar electrochemical system. The initial number of Bacillus subtilis spores used as a Cryptosporidium surrogate for water quality assessment was 10(2)-10(4) spores/mL. The electrochemical reaction took 15 to 60 minutes to complete and occurred in the presence of 0.4 M of ethanol and 4 mg/L of KI and at a current density of 3-5 mA/cm(2), at ambient temperature and with normal pH water. The findings suggest that, under optimal conditions of Bacillus subtilis spore removal, the synergistic effects of bipolar electrochemical reactions in the presence of KI and ethanol lead to a 32% reduction in energy consumption compared to when only a single electrochemical process is used.					nasseri, simin/0000-0003-4498-5617												1452-3981					MAY	2017	12	5					4319	4326		10.20964/2017.05.71								WOS:000402485100060

Application of taxonomic and morpho-functional properties of phytoplankton communities to water quality assessment for artificial lakes in the Mediterranean Ecoregion(aEuro)	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Starting in September 2010, a monitoring program was developed for evaluating the water quality in six artificial lakes (reservoirs) of the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). Lake ecological status was evaluated according to the requirements of the 2000/60/EC Water Framework Directive. Phytoplankton taxonomic composition, biovolume and chlorophyll a data were used in an application of the Italian methods (Italian Phytoplankton Assessment Method or New Italian Method) for water quality assessment of artificial lakes. Even though all the reservoirs were classified as being in good ecological status, the phytoplankton communities of the six reservoirs were different and characterized by highly site-specific components and by distinctive dominant taxa. The influences of environmental variables on the phytoplankton communities were analyzed. Results of Constrained Coordinate Analysis (CCA) indicated strong influences of the trophic gradient and water depth on the phytoplankton assemblages, but significant factors are also the surrounding landscape and the origin and the history of the lakes. A functional traits-based analysis was carried out to support the water quality assessment tools. Twenty-one morpho-functional groups were identified. Most of them were common in all six lakes, so functional properties clearly recur among different phytoplankton species.																	0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					550	563		10.1093/plankt/fbx011								WOS:000402613800015						
J	Shin, WJ; Ryu, JS; Min, JS; Lee, KS				Shin, Woo-Jin; Ryu, Jong-Sik; Min, Ji-Sook; Lee, Kwang-Sik			Identification of sources affecting water chemistry in the Nakdong River, South Korea	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The sources impacting the water chemistry of the Nakdong River (NR) in South Korea were investigated in order to examine the pollution mechanism including the fate and transport of the contaminants and how much such sources may affect its main channel of water resource. Water samples were collected between 2007 and 2008 from 8 sites along a 510 km downstream transect of the NR, and chemical and isotopic compositions of the water samples were evaluated to identify natural and anthropogenic sources contributing to the water chemistry of the NR. The results showed that the major ion concentrations were mainly controlled by chemical weathering that occurred in the watershed, in which a silicate weathering is more dominant than a carbonate weathering. The Sr-87/(86) Sr ratios of the water samples were in a range from 0.71043 to 0.71520 within those of the Mesozoic volcanogenic sedimentary rocks long developed in the watershed, thereby supporting the fact that the water chemistry is governed by a chemical weathering. The delta S-34 values varied in a narrow range of 1.8-3.1%, regardless of spatial and seasonal variations. Mass balance calculations indicated that the contributions of chemical weathering and anthropogenic sources during summer time increased along a downstream transect, from 67.3 +/- 1.3 to 73.6 +/- 0.5% and from 6.0 to 15.7%, respectively. In contrast, the contribution of chemical weathering during winter time decreased from 82.7 +/- 0.8 to 72.5 +/- 0.3%, while anthropogenic contribution increased up to 22.2%. These results indicated that the water chemistry of the NR was mainly caused by a chemical weathering, followed by anthropogenic inputs and rainwater. This study will provide baseline information for comparing the water quality issue before and after the implementation of the Four Rivers Restoration Project of South Korea.

Environmental variability indicates a climate-adaptive center under threat in northern Mozambique coral reefs	ECOSPHERE												A priority for modern conservation is finding and managing regions with environmental and biodiversity portfolio characteristics that will promote adaptation and the persistence of species during times of rapid climate change. The latitudinal edges of high-diversity biomes are likely to provide a mixture of environmental gradients and biological diversity that meet the portfolio criteria needed for adaptive systems. Northern Mozambique and the Quirimbas Islands represent the edge of a coral reef diversity center with limited potential to expand because of geologic and oceanographic limits on the southern edges. This region does, however, have the potential to be its own discrete adaptive center if it contains climate refugia and there are environmental gradients that promote acclimatization, ecological reorganization, and natural selection. Consequently, to evaluate this potential we tested for strong regional environmental spatial heterogeneity that might indicate a climate-adaptive center. Additionally, we evaluated human influences and environmental and demographic data on finfish, coral, and sea urchins in 66 reefs across similar to 4 degrees of latitude to evaluate ecological changes and human threats. A number of clear gradients in environmental and human influences were observed. For example, temperature increased and became more centralized and right-skewed, while water quality decreased to the south. Coral communities susceptible to thermal stress were found in the north where dispersed temperatures indicated a location with either tolerance to or refugium from recent thermal disturbances. Nevertheless, high coral diversity was found in southern deep-water channels. Further, spatial patterns for corals and fish differed indicating complex geographic-fishing-biodiversity gradients. Consequently, environmental conditions for an adaptive portfolio exist and include refugia for preserving climate-sensitive and for numbers of coral taxa. Fishing and urban threats were observable as reduced fish biomass, diversity, and body sizes but higher biomass of sea urchins. We observed that many remote and protected areas had fish biomass values lower than expected or near maximum sustainable yields. This indicates low compliance and widespread migratory fishing, which is reducing fish diversity below maximum levels. Recommendations to sustain this adaptive center are to maintain fish biomass >500 kg/ha by increasing fisheries restrictions and compliance.
