Mapping marginal croplands suitable for cellulosic feedstock crops in the Great Plains, United States	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY												Growing cellulosic feedstock crops (e.g., switchgrass) for biofuel is more environmentally sustainable than cornbased ethanol. Specifically, this practice can reduce soil erosion and water quality impairment from pesticides and fertilizer, improve ecosystem services and sustainability (e.g., serve as carbon sinks), and minimize impacts on global food supplies. The main goal of this study was to identify high-risk marginal croplands that are potentially suitable for growing cellulosic feedstock crops (e.g., switchgrass) in the US Great Plains (GP). Satellitederived growing season Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, a switchgrass biomass productivity map obtained from a previous study, US Geological Survey (USGS) irrigation and crop masks, and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop indemnity maps for the GP were used in this study. Our hypothesis was that croplands with relatively low crop yield but high productivity potential for switchgrass may be suitable for converting to switchgrass. Areas with relatively low crop indemnity (crop indemnity <$ 2 157 068) were excluded from the suitable areas based on low probability of crop failures. Results show that approximately 650 000 ha of marginal croplands in the GP are potentially suitable for switchgrass development. The total estimated switchgrass biomass productivity gain from these suitable areas is about 5.9 million metric tons. Switchgrass can be cultivated in either lowland or upland regions in the GP depending on the local soil and environmental conditions. This study improves our understanding of ecosystem services and the sustainability of cropland systems in the GP. Results from this study provide useful information to land managers for making informed decisions regarding switchgrass development in the GP.

Switchgrass growth and pine-switchgrass interactions in established intercropping systems	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY BIOENERGY												Intercropping switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) with loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) has been proposed for producing bioenergy feedstock in the southeastern United States. This study investigated switchgrass growth and pine-switchgrass interactions at two established experimental fields (7-year-old Lenoir site and 5-year-old Carteret site) located on the coastal plain of eastern United States. Position effects (edge and center of switchgrass alley in intercropping plots) and treatment effects (intercropping vs. grass-only) on aboveground switchgrass growth were evaluated. Interspecific interactions with respect to capturing resources (light, soil water, and nitrogen) were investigated by measuring photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) above grass canopy, soil moisture, and soil mineral nitrogen contents. Switchgrass growth was significantly (P = 0.001) affected by treatments in Lenoir and by position (P < 0.0001) in both study sites. Relative to the center, PAR above grass canopy at edge in both sites was about 48% less during the growing season. Soil water content during the growing season at the edge of grass alley was significantly (P = 0.0001) lower by 23% than at the center in Lenoir, while no significant (P = 0.42) difference was observed in Carteret, in spite of more grass growth at center at both sites. Soil mineral nitrogen content at the center of intercropping plots in Lenoir (no fertilization during 2015) was significantly (P < 0.07) lower than at the edge during the peak of growing season (June, July, and August), but not during early and late parts of growing season (May, September, and November). Position effects on soil water and mineral nitrogen were less evident under conditions with higher external inputs (rainfall and fertilization) and lower plant uptake during nongrowing seasons. Results from this study contributed to a better understanding of above-and belowground pine-switchgrass interactions which is necessary to properly manage this new cultivation system for bioenergy production in the southeastern United States.

M.; Brockmann, Carsten			An Optical Classification Tool for Global Lake Waters	REMOTE SENSING												Shallow and deep lakes receive and recycle organic and inorganic substances from within the confines of these lakes, their watershed and beyond. Hence, a large range in absorption and scattering and extreme differences in optical variability can be found between and within global lakes. This poses a challenge for atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms applied to optical remote sensing for water quality monitoring applications. To optimize these applications for the wide variety of lake optical conditions, we adapted a spectral classification scheme based on the concept of optical water types. The optical water types were defined through a cluster analysis of in situ hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance spectra collected by partners and advisors of the European Union 7th Framework Programme (FP7) Global Lakes Sentinel Services (GLaSS) project. The method has been integrated in the Envisat-BEAM software and the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) and generates maps of water types from image data. Two variations of water type classification are provided: one based on area-normalized spectral reflectance focusing on spectral shape (6CN, six-class normalized) and one that retains magnitude with no modification to the reflectance signal (6C). This resulted in a protocol, or processing scheme, that can also be applied or adapted for Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) datasets. We apply both treatments to MERIS imagery of a variety of European lakes to demonstrate its applicability. The studied target lakes cover a range of biophysical types, from shallow turbid to deep and clear, as well as eutrophic and dark absorbing waters, rich in colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). In shallow, high-reflecting Dutch and Estonian lakes with high sediment load, 6C performed better, while in deep, low-reflecting clear Italian and Swedish lakes, 6CN performed better. The 6CN classification of in situ data is promising for very dark, high CDOM, absorbing lakes, but we show that our atmospheric correction of the imagery was insufficient to corroborate this. We anticipate that the application of the protocol to other lakes with unknown in-water characterization, but with comparable biophysical properties will suggest similar atmospheric correction (AC) and in-water retrieval algorithms for global lakes.

Spatiotemporal Variability of Lake Water Quality in the Context of Remote Sensing Models	REMOTE SENSING												This study demonstrates a number of methods for using field sampling and observed lake characteristics and patterns to improve techniques for development of algae remote sensing models and applications. As satellite and airborne sensors improve and their data are more readily available, applications of models to estimate water quality via remote sensing are becoming more practical for local water quality monitoring, particularly of surface algal conditions. Despite the increasing number of applications, there are significant concerns associated with remote sensing model development and application, several of which are addressed in this study. These concerns include: (1) selecting sensors which are suitable for the spatial and temporal variability in the water body; (2) determining appropriate uses of near-coincident data in empirical model calibration; and (3) recognizing potential limitations of remote sensing measurements which are biased toward surface and near-surface conditions. We address these issues in three lakes in the Great Salt Lake surface water system (namely the Great Salt Lake, Farmington Bay, and Utah Lake) through sampling at scales that are representative of commonly used sensors, repeated sampling, and sampling at both near-surface depths and throughout the water column. The variability across distances representative of the spatial resolutions of Landsat, SENTINEL-2 and MODIS sensors suggests that these sensors are appropriate for this lake system. We also use observed temporal variability in the system to evaluate sensors. These relationships proved to be complex, and observed temporal variability indicates the revisit time of Landsat may be problematic for detecting short events in some lakes, while it may be sufficient for other areas of the system with lower short-term variability. Temporal variability patterns in these lakes are also used to assess near-coincident data in empirical model development. Finally, relationships between the surface and water column conditions illustrate potential issues with near-surface remote sensing, particularly when there are events that cause mixing in the water column.

A common way to do so is to include ecological regions in sampling schemes and empirical models. However, most existing ecological regions were developed for specific purposes, using a limited set of geospatial features and irreproducible methods. Our study purpose was to: (1) describe a method that takes advantage of recent computational advances and increased availability of regional and global data sets to create customizable and reproducible ecological regions, (2) make this algorithm available for use and modification by others studying different ecosystems, variables of interest, study extents, and macroscale ecology research questions, and (3) demonstrate the power of this approach for the research question-How well do these regions capture regional-scale variation in lake water quality? To achieve our purpose we: (1) used a spatially constrained spectral clustering algorithm that balances geospatial homogeneity and region contiguity to create ecological regions using multiple terrestrial, climatic, and freshwater geospatial data for 17 northeastern U.S. states (similar to 1,800,000 km(2)); (2) identified which of the 52 geospatial features were most influential in creating the resulting 100 regions; and (3) tested the ability of these ecological regions to capture regional variation in water nutrients and clarity for similar to 6,000 lakes. We found that: (1) a combination of terrestrial, climatic, and freshwater geospatial features influenced region creation, suggesting that the oft-ignored freshwater landscape provides novel information on landscape variability not captured by traditionally used climate and terrestrial metrics; and (2) the delineated regions captured macroscale heterogeneity in ecosystem properties not included in region delineation-approximately 40% of the variation in total phosphorus and water clarity among lakes was at the regional scale. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of this method for creating customizable and reproducible regions for research and management applications.

To determine the environmental benefit of lowering soil P fertility, a meta-analysis of the relationship between soil test P (measured as Olsen-P) and P concentrations in agricultural drainflow and surface runoff in mostly UK soils was undertaken in relation to current eutrophication control targets (30-35 mu g P L-1). At agronomic-optimum Olsen P (16-25 mg kg(-1)), concentrations of soluble reactive P (SRP), total dissolved P (TDP), total P (TP) and sediment-P (SS-P) in runoff were predicted by linear regression analysis to vary between 24 and 183 mu g L-1, 38 and 315 mu g L-1, 0.2 and 9.6 mg L-1, and 0.31 and 3.2 g kg(-1), respectively. Concentrations of SRP and TDP in runoff were much more sensitive to changes in Olsen-P than were TP and SS-P concentrations, which confirms that separate strategies are required for mitigating the mobilisation of dissolved and particulate P forms. As the main driver of eutrophication, SRP concentrations in runoff were reduced on average by 60 mg L-1 (71%) by lowering soil Olsen-P from optimum (25 mg kg(-1)) to 10 mg kg(-1). At Olsen-P concentrations below 12 mg kg(-1), dissolved hydrolysable P (largely organic) became the dominant form of soluble P transported. We concluded that maintaining agronomic-optimum Olsen-P could still pose a eutrophication risk, and that a greater research focus on reducing critical soil test P through innovative agro-engineering of soils, crops and fertilisers would give long-term benefits in reducing the endemic eutrophication risk arising from legacy soil P. Soil P testing should become compulsory in priority catchments suffering, or sensitive to, eutrophication to ensure soil P reserves are fully accounted for as part of good fertiliser and manure management.																	1748-9326					MAY	2017	12	6							063001	10.1088/1748-9326/aa69fc								WOS:000402550800001

Burning of sugarcane leaf residue in the field has been under scrutiny in recent years due to urban encroachment and air-quality concerns and excess leaf residue left in the field can also reduce ratoon crop yields due to lower soil temperatures and higher soil moisture. Sugarcane mills produce excess bagasse during the grinding season which is left unused indefinitely. These two organic feedstocks, sugarcane leaf residue and bagasse, can be thermo-chemically converted into biochars (BC) that can be brought back to the field to be used as a soil amendment to enhance soil health, water holding capacity and improve sugarcane yields. Biochars from sugarcane leaf residue (HoCP 96-540) and sugarcane bagasse were applied at three application rates, 0, 4 and 8%, with and without commercial fertilizer. Biochars and feedstock materials were chemically characterized for their nutrient content and several physico-chemical properties. Sugarcane biomass and theoretical recoverable sucrose (TRS) content were measured and compared across the different treatments. Best results were observed with a 4% addition of bagasse biochar with a TRS yield improvement of 22.3% and 31.6% from control, for fertilizer and no fertilizer additions, respectively. Benefits of applying biochar to cane fields include an increase in soil carbon content, improvement to soil drainage and aeration, and addition of nutrients for the sugarcane crop. Economic benefits are expected for both sugarcane growers and processors through the production of valued by-products from pyrolysis of sugarcane leaf residues and bagasse as well as enhancing the sugarcane industry's footprint in renewable energy markets.																	0020-8841					MAY	2017	119	1421					382	390										WOS:000402449000034

Ultraviolet and visible absorption spectrum for real-time monitoring of water quality has the advantages of in-situ detection as well as no need for reagents and rapid analysis, which makes it suitable for online detection. However, the ultraviolet and visible spectra are of large size and easily interfered by instrument and the normal water quality fluctuation, which affect the water quality anomaly detection result. In this paper, the baseline correction and principal component analysis method for UV/Vis spectra is proposed to detect abnormal water quality. The asymmetric least squares algorithm is used to correct the baseline and the principal component analysis for UV/Vis spectral matrix is adopted to reduce dimensions and extract features. Afterwards the outliers in the test samples are evaluated according to the Q statistic in the residual subspace. Finally, anomalies warning is updated by calculating the cumulative probability. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by using data from phenol injection experiments. Results show that the proposed method effectively improves the detection limit of pollutants and has a higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate compared with the result without baseline correction.																	1000-0593					MAY	2017	37	5					1460	1465		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2017)05-1460-06								WOS:000401880000024

Biofilm composition in the Olt River (Romania) reservoirs impacted by a chlor-alkali production plant	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Freshwater biofilms can be useful indicators of water quality and offer the possibility to assess contaminant effects at the community level. The present field study examines the effects of chlor-alkali plant effluents on the community composition of biofilms grown in the Olt River (Romania) reservoirs. The relationship between ambient water quality variables and community composition alterations was explored. Amplicon sequencing revealed a significant modification of the composition of microalgal, bacterial and fungal communities in the biofilms collected in the impacted reservoirs in comparison with those living in the uncontaminated control reservoir. The abundance corrected Simpson index showed lower richness and diversity in biofilms collected in the impacted reservoirs than in the control reservoir. The biofilm bacterial communities of the impacted reservoirs were characterized by the contaminant-tolerant Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes, whereas microalgal communities were predominantly composed of Bacillariophyta and fungal communities of Lecanoromycetes and Paraglomycetes. A principal component analysis revealed that major contaminants present in the waste water of the chlor-alkali production plant, i.e. Na+, Ca2+, Cl- and Hg, were correlated with the alteration of biofilm community composition in the impacted reservoirs. However, the biofilm composition was also influenced by water quality variables such as NO3-, SO42-, DOC and Zn from unknown sources. The results of the present study imply that, even when below the environmental quality standards, typical contaminants of chlor-alkali plant releases may affect biofilm composition and that their impacts on the microbial biodiversity might be currently overlooked.

BOARD-INVITED REVIEW: Quantifying water use in ruminant production	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												The depletion of water resources, in terms of both quantity and quality, has become a major concern both locally and globally. Ruminants, in particular, are under increased public scrutiny due to their relatively high water use per unit of meat or milk produced. Estimating the water footprint of livestock production is a relatively new field of research for which methods are still evolving. This review describes the approaches used to quantify water use in ruminant production systems as well as the methodological and conceptual issues associated with each approach. Water use estimates for the main products from ruminant production systems are also presented, along with possible management strategies to reduce water use. In the past, quantifying water withdrawal in ruminant production focused on the water demand for drinking or operational purposes. Recently, the recognition of water as a scarce resource has led to the development of several methodologies including water footprint assessment, life cycle assessment, and livestock water productivity to assess water use and its environmental impacts. These methods differ with respect to their target outcome (efficiency or environmental impacts), geographic focus (local or global), description of water sources (green, blue, and gray), handling of water quality concerns, the interpretation of environmental impacts, and the metric by which results are communicated (volumetric units or impact equivalents). Ruminant production is a complex activity where animals are often reared at different sites using a range of resources over their lifetime. Additional water use occurs during slaughter, product processing, and packaging. Estimating water use at the various stages of meat and milk production and communicating those estimates will help producers and other stakeholders identify hotspots and implement strategies to improve water use efficiency. Improvements in ruminant productivity (i.e., BW and milk production) and reproductive efficiency can also reduce the water footprint per unit product. However, given that feed production makes up the majority of water use by ruminants, research and development efforts should focus on this area. More research and clarity are needed to examine the validity of assumptions and possible trade-offs between ruminants' water use and other sustainability indicators.

High-sulfate water consumption determines intake and metabolic responses to protein supplementation in lambs consuming low-quality forage	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE												Twenty Hampshire lambs (31 +/- 4 kg BW) in individual metabolism cages were used in a 10-treatment by 2-period (n = 4) trial to evaluate the interaction between protein supplementation and sulfate water on intake and metabolic responses when lambs were fed low-quality grass hay (Megathyrsus maximus; 6.4% CP, 79.5% NDF). The treatment structure was a 2 x 5 factorial: 2 water qualities (WQ; low-sulfate [LS] and high-sulfate [HS]; 442 and 8,358 mg/kg total dissolved solids, respectively) and 5 soybean meal levels (SBM; 0%, 0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1.00% BW/d). After 15 d of adaptation, periods consisted of 5 d for determination of forage and water intake, nitrogen balance, and digestion measurements (d 16 to 20) and 1 d for blood sampling and determination of ruminal hydrogen sulfide (H2S) concentration (d 21). Supplemental SBM x WQ interactions were significant for forage OM intake (P = 0.04) and total OM intake (P = 0.04), whereas a tendency was observed for total tract digestible OM intake (P = 0.07). Intake values of LS lambs were higher than those of HS lambs (P < 0.05) in only the first and second levels of SBM. Water intake increased linearly (P < 0.01) with SBM level but was not affected by WQ (P = 0.39). Water quality and SBM supplementation affected total tract OM digestibility (TTOMD; P < 0.01); LS lambs had lower TTOMD than HS lambs (P < 0.01). Plasma urea N increased linearly in response to SBM (P < 0.01) but was not affected by WQ (P = 0.11). Nitrogen balance was not affected by SBM x WQ interaction (P > 0.12), except for N utilization (N retained/N intake ratio; P < 0.01). Regardless of WQ, N intake (P > 0.01), N urine (P > 0.01), and N balance increased linearly (P > 0.01) with SBM level. Water quality adversely affected N intake and N balance, although at the highest level of SBM no differences in N balance were observed between LS and HS lambs (P = 0.85). No changes due to WQ were observed for either urea reabsorbed by kidneys (P = 0.63) or glomerular filtration rate (P = 0.30), but renal function was affected by SBM level (P < 0.01). There was a supplemental SBM x WQ interaction for ruminal H2S concentration (P < 0.01) due mainly to a greater concentration from 0.25% BW SBM in HS than in LS lambs. In conclusion, these results confirmed the existence of an interaction between sulfate water and supplemental protein, which alters intake and metabolic responses when lambs are fed low-quality grass hay.																	0021-8812	1525-3163				MAY	2017	95	5					2111	2120		10.2527/jas2016.1264								WOS:000402379700024	28726991

These analyses were conducted to trace the provenance of the sediments. Textural parameters reveal that the lake sediments consist predominantly clay and silt fractions. The C/N ratio of the sediments indicates a mixed source of TOC, both autochthonous and allochthonous in origin. The log (Fe2O3/K2O) Vs. log (SiO2/Al2O3) graph of the sediments discriminates the rock types of the catchment area that are Fe-shale, Fe-sand, wacke, shale and litharenite. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) falls between 59.11 to 90.16% and Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW) between 63.97 to 99.68% and these values are higher than the Post-Archaean Australian Shale (PAAS), indicating moderate to highly chemically weathered lake floor sediments. Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) values (60.74-99.63%) suggests the occurrence of plagioclase feldspars in the lake floor sediments. Geochemical characteristics signify a mixed-nature of provenance of the lake floor sediments due to the tectonic settings of the lake basin in a complex catchment area.																	0016-7622	0974-6889				MAY	2017	89	5					563	572		10.1007/s12594-017-0645-4								WOS:000402076300010

These wastewaters contribute to the degradation of Oued Seybouse river water quality. Five water points were sampled on the bed of Oued Seybouse since the source Medjez Amar on the outskirts of the town of Sidi Salem (Annaba), with a monthly frequency during duration of 2 years (on 2012 and 2013). We analyzed eighteen (18) physic-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, conductivity, chlorides, sulfates, phosphates, nitrogenous components, oxygenates dissolved, oxidizible material, dry residue, total hardness, suspension materials....). The main physic-chemical parameters of the quality of the water were thus measured then an analysis in main components was realized from the average values of every parameter; we were able to reveal so the existence of a spatial variation relatively marked with these descriptors, revealing four components very uneven and well differentiated. The interpretation of the results by means of these tools allowed to understand (include) that the parameters responsible for the quality of waters are connected for the component 1 (anthropological contributions: organic and mineral) and the components 2 and 3 respectively bound in the effects of seasonality's and the anthropological activities. The component 4 could be connected with the agricultural activities.

The extent of water eutrophication of this segment was also assessed using a universal index formula for eutrophic evaluation and a logarithmic power function. The results showed that the average concentration of total N (TN) was 27.2 mg/L (NH3-N, 63.5%), total P (TP) was 2.0 mg/L (solution reactive phosphorus, 68.8%). Temporal and spatial variations of N and P in this segment were observed. Concentrations of N and P in the arid season were higher than those in the rainy season. Spatially, the N and P concentrations followed the same trend; i.e., higher in the city segment than in the suburbs, and decreasing along the river. The water eutrophication in the studied segment reached extremely high levels at all times (eutrophication index >76.3). Spatially, its trend was clearly linked with N and P. Water shortage, pollution accumulation and a weak self-purification function are the main reasons for the prominent eutrophication in this segment.

Lohan)	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The effect of two different water sources (treated waste water and lake water) used for irrigation on the soil geochemical properties and the fruit quality parameters of the Lohan guava were studied. The fruits' physical attributes, physicochemical attributes, nutritional attributes, mineral content as well as consumers' acceptance were evaluated. The properties of the different water sources and their effect, on both the soil and the quality of the fruits, were evaluated. Analysis of the irrigation water revealed that treated waste water was of acceptable quality with reference to irrigation water quality guidelines, while the lake water used for irrigation fell short in several aspects. The different water sources used for irrigation in the farms affected the soil geochemical properties significantly. The quality of guavas harvested from the farms that were irrigated with different water sources was significantly different. Irrigation water qualities were observed to have positive effects on the quality of the fruits and consumers' acceptance as observed from the results of quality analysis and the consumers' acceptance test.

Alternative futures of dissolved inorganic nitrogen export from the Mississippi River Basin: influence of crop management, atmospheric deposition, and population growth	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrogen (N) export from the Mississippi River Basin contributes to seasonal hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). We explored monthly dissolved inorganic N (DIN) export to the GOM for a historical year (2002) and two future scenarios (year 2022) by linking macroeonomic energy, agriculture market, air quality, and agriculture land management models to a DIN export model. Future scenarios considered policies aimed at encouraging bioenergy crop production and reducing atmospheric N-emissions, as well as the effect of population growth and the states' infrastructure plans on sewage fluxes. Model-derived DIN export decreased by about 9% (from 279 to 254 kg N km(-2) year(-1)) between 2002 and 2022 due to a 28% increase in area planted with corn, 24% improvement in crop N-recovery efficiency (NRE, to 0.52), 22% reduction in atmospheric N deposition, and 23% increase in sewage inputs. Changes in atmospheric and sewage inputs had a relatively small effect on DIN export and the effect of bioenergy crop production depended on nutrient management practices. Without improved NRE, increased production of corn would have increased DIN export by about 14% (to 289 kg N km(-2) year(-1)) between 2002 and 2022. Model results suggest that meeting future crop demand while reducing the areal extent of hypoxia could require aggressive actions, such improving basin-level crop NRE to 0.62 or upgrading N-removal capabilities in waste water treatment plants beyond current plans. Tile-drained cropland could contribute up to half of DIN export; thus, practices that reduce N losses from tile drains could also have substantial benefit.

Impact of seasonal changes in stream metabolism on nitrate concentrations in an urban stream	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Nitrate (NO3-) dynamics in urban streams differ from many natural streams due to stormwater runoff, sewage inputs, decreased groundwater discharge, often limited hyporheic exchange, increased primary productivity, and limited carbon input. We investigated NO3- dynamics in a first-order urban stream in Syracuse, NY, which has urbanized headwaters and a geomorphologically natural downstream section. Twice-monthly water sampling, NO3- injection tests, NO3- isotopic analysis, filamentous algae mat density, and riparian shading were used to identify processes regulating NO3- dynamics in the stream over a 12-month period. The urban headwater reach had low NO3- (0.006-0.2 mg N/L) in the spring through fall, with a minimum uptake length of 900 m, no canopy cover, and high algae mat density. The downstream natural reach (100% canopy cover during the summer and low algae mat density) had nitrate concentrations between 0.6 and 1.2 mg N/L from winter to summer, which decreased during autumn leaf-off. In the urban reach, autotrophic uptake by filamentous green algae is a major NO3- sink in summer. In the natural reach, the addition of organic matter to the stream at leaf-off led to a decrease in NO3- concentration followed by an increase in NO3- concentration in winter as gross primary productivity decreased. This study shows that the balance between autotrophy and heterotrophy in urban streams is variable and depends on an interplay of drivers such as temperature, light, and carbon inputs that are mediated by the riparian ecosystem.

THE MECHANISMS OF NICKEL TOXICITY IN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS: AN ADVERSE OUTCOME PATHWAY ANALYSIS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Current ecological risk assessment and water quality regulations for nickel (Ni) use mechanistically based, predictive tools such as biotic ligand models (BLMs). However, despite many detailed studies, the precise mechanism(s) of Ni toxicity to aquatic organisms remains elusive. This uncertainty in the mechanism(s) of action for Ni has led to concern over the use of tools like the BLM in some regulatory settings. To address this knowledge gap, the authors used an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) analysis, the first AOP for a metal, to identify multiple potential mechanisms of Ni toxicity and their interactions with freshwater aquatic organisms. The analysis considered potential mechanisms of action based on data from a wide range of organisms in aquatic and terrestrial environments on the premise that molecular initiating events for an essential metal would potentially be conserved across taxa. Through this analysis the authors identified 5 potential molecular initiating events by which Ni may exert toxicity on aquatic organisms: disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, disruption of Mg2+ homeostasis, disruption of Fe2+/3+ homeostasis, reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative damage, and an allergic-type response of respiratory epithelia. At the organ level of biological organization, these 5 potential molecular initiating events collapse into 3 potential pathways: reduced Ca2+ availability to support formation of exoskeleton, shell, and bone for growth; impaired respiration; and cytotoxicity and tumor formation. At the level of the whole organism, the organ-level responses contribute to potential reductions in growth and reproduction and/or alterations in energy metabolism, with several potential feedback loops between each of the pathways. Overall, the present AOP analysis provides a robust framework for future directed studies on the mechanisms of Ni toxicity and for developing AOPs for other metals.

THE TOXICITY OF CREOSOTE-TREATED WOOD TO PACIFIC HERRING EMBRYOS AND CHARACTERIZATION OF POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS NEAR CREOSOTED PILINGS IN JUNEAU, ALASKA	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from creosote exposure in the laboratory resulted in deleterious effects in developing Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) embryos, and potentially toxic concentrations of PAHs were measured using passive water samplers at 1 of 3 harbor field sites in Juneau, Alaska, USA. Aqueous total PAH concentrations of 4.6 mu g/L and 8.4 mu g/L from creosote exposure resulted in skeletal defects and ineffective swimming in hatched larvae in the laboratory (10% effective concentrations) and were the most sensitive parameters measured. Hatch rates also suffered from creosote exposure in a dose-dependent manner: at exposures between 5 mu g/L and 50 mu g/L total PAH, 50% of the population failed to hatch. Comparisons between laboratory and field deployed passive samplers suggested that for at least 1 harbor in Juneau, concentrations sufficient to induce teratogenic effects were found directly on creosoted pilings, within 10 cm of them, and sometimes at a distance of 10 m. Total PAH concentrations generally decreased with distance from creosoted pilings. Creosote pilings contribute to the PAH load within a marina and can rise to PAH concentrations that are harmful to fish embryos, but at a scale that is localized in the environment.

J	Li, C; Li, FB; Wu, ZF; Cheng, J				Li, Cheng; Li, Fangbai; Wu, Zhifeng; Cheng, Jiong			Exploring spatially varying and scale-dependent relationships between soil contamination and landscape patterns using geographically weighted regression	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Landscape pattern is an important determinant of soil contamination at multiple scales, and a proper understanding of their relationship is essential for alleviating soil contamination and making decisions for land planners. Both soil contamination and landscape patterns are heterogeneous across spaces and scale-dependent, but most studies were carried out on a single scale and used the conventional multivariate analyses (e.g. correlation analysis, ordinary least squared regression-OLS) that ignored the issue of spatial autocorrelation. To move forward, this paper examined spatially varying relationships between agricultural soil trace metal contamination and landscape patterns at three block scales (i.e. 5 km x 5 km, 10 km x 10 km, 15 km x 15 km) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), south China, using geographically weighted regression (GWR). This paper found that GWR performed better than OLS in terms of increasing R square of the model, lowering Akaike Information Criterion values and reducing spatial autocorrelation. GWR results revealed great spatial variations in the relationships across scales, with an increasing explanatory power of the model from small to large block scales. Despite a few negative correlations, more positive correlations were found between soil contamination and different aspects of landscape patterns of water, urban land and the whole landscape (i.e. the proportion, mean patch area, the degree of landscape fragmentation, landscape-level structural complexity, aggregation/connectivity, road density and river density). Similarly, more negative correlations were found between soil contamination and landscape patterns of forest and the distance to the river and industry land (p < 0.05). Furthermore, most significant correlations between soil contamination and landscape variables occurred in the western PRD across scales, which could be explained by the prevailing wind, the distribution of pollutant sources and the pathway of trace metal inputs.

For this purpose, monthly water sampling was performed from 11 sampling stations on streams that fed the dam. According to land surveys they have a potential to inflict pollution to the dam. Thus the physical and chemical parameters (i.e. pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, temperature, chemical oxygen demand, turbidity and suspended solids) were monitored monthly for 1-year period. Chloride, sulfate, total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate were monitored for a 6-month period, and the results were evaluated in accordance with the Turkish Regulation of Surface Water Quality Management. Results of the study show that the most important reasons for the- pollution in the dam are caused by domestic and industrial wastewaters, which were released to the system without being treated, or without being sufficiently treated, and also of agricultural activities. It was determined that electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, suspended solids, nitrite, nitrate, total nitrogen, sulfate, and chloride parameters which were high at the sampling stations where domestic and industrial wastewaters discharge were present. pH and temperature demonstrate a difference at a significant level by seasons. As a result of the study, it was determined that the water was of IVth quality in terms of nitrate, chemical oxygen demand, and total nitrogen, and it was of 111rd quality water with respect to ammonium, electrical conductivity, and dissolved oxygen. It was observed that the dam outflow water was of IVth quality with respect to nitrate, chemical oxygen demand, and total nitrogen, and of IIIrd quality with respect to dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity. It is considered that the pollution problem in the Akkaya Dam can only be resolved with prevention studies on a watershed scale. Therefore, coordination between the institutions is necessary. The preparation for the integrated water management plan of the watershed will provide a significant contribution to the solution of the water quality problem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It analyses the temporal and spatial distributions and utilisation of underground water according to the main components and corresponding water quality standards for underground water. Thereby, it can provide a scientific basis for the development, utilisation, planning, and management of groundwater resources. Set pair analysis (SPA), based on the improved five-element connectivity degree, was used in this research to establish a comprehensive evaluation model of water quality, so as to evaluate the groundwater quality in XuChang, Henan Province, China. Meanwhile, fuzzy evaluation was also used to measure groundwater quality. As demonstrated in the research results, SPA is proven to be convenient and useful with objective and stable results, it therefore is an effective approach with which to evaluate groundwater quality. In addition, the results obtained using SPA matched those from fuzzy comprehensive evaluation; it was concluded, based on the analysis, that the groundwater in XuChang was severely polluted. The groundwater quality at the observation points located in the lower reaches is poorer than that of the upper reaches; hazardous substances permeate underground to pollute shallow groundwater through decomposition and loss due to weathering and rainfall.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					632	642		10.2166/ws.2016.135								WOS:000401654600002

However, little information exists on the effects of cistern materials and construction methods on water quality. This study assessed the quality of rainwater and harvested rainwater stored in different types of cisterns, using multivariate statistical analysis techniques. The harvesting system consisted of ditches underground to direct the water stream collected by catchments through pipes to the two-stage grit chambers, the rainwater runoff ultimately being fed into the cisterns. Water samples were collected monthly over 6 months from October 2008 to April 2009. The harvested rainwater generally did not meet drinking water standards due to severe bacterial contamination. To determine the factors affecting water quality, principal components and factor analysis divided the water's physicochemical composition into four principal components: ions, suspended pollutants, reducing substances, and acidity-alkalinity, which collectively accounted for 80.4% of the total variance. Cluster analysis confirmed the results. It was determined that pollutants in harvested rainwater were mainly derived from the catchments, surrounding fields, and local atmosphere. Furthermore, factor scores ranked water quality to select the optimum material and construction method. It was concluded that cement was superior to stabilized soil for rainwater storage. However, considering water quality, cost, and environmental friendliness the stabilized soil cistern using the stiff construction method was worthy of consideration.

Legislation mandating the establishment of water resources monitoring, presence of hazardous contaminants in effluents, and perception of the vulnerability of the water distribution system to attacks, have spurred technical and economic interest. Alternatively to traditional analyzers, chemosensors operate according to physical principles, without sample collection (online), and are capable of supplying parameter values continuously and in real-time. This review paper contains a comprehensive survey of existing and expected online monitoring technologies for measurement/detection of pollutants in water. The state-of-the-art in online water monitoring and contaminant warning systems is presented. Application examples are reported.

This study aimed to better understand the presence of these metals in the source water, removal of these metals through the conventional treatment process, and final water quality trends, for the period 2008 to 2014. Aluminium and iron concentrations were highly variable and showed significant influence on colour and turbidity in source water. Sedimentation performed well, and removed over 70% of the metal concentration from the raw water. Filtration removed 15% of the remaining aluminium and iron concentrations. The pH and turbidity of the final water had minor effects on the metal concentration in the final water. The conventional treatment process was shown to be capable of removing aluminium and iron from the source water as both were within water quality limits in the final water. This study highlighted the importance of source water quality monitoring and treatment plant efficacy in evaluating whether the current treatment technology is appropriate for current and future challenges.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					733	744		10.2166/ws.2016.170								WOS:000401654600011

Many factors affect the delivery of water through distribution networks. Some of these factors are relevant to water quality, quantity and the condition of the infrastructure itself. The deterioration of water quality in the WDN leads to failure at the water quality level, which can be critical because it is closest to the point of delivery and there are virtually no safety barriers before consumption. Accordingly, developing a powerful monitoring system that takes into consideration water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the distribution system and the sensitivity of the population to the deterioration of water quality can be very beneficial and, more importantly, could save lives if there was any deterioration of water quality due to operational failure or cross-contamination events. In this paper, a framework for a water quality monitoring system that considers water demand distribution, the vulnerability of the system and the sensitivity of the population using fuzzy synthetic evaluation and optimization algorithms is developed. The proposed approach has been applied to develop a monitoring system for a real WDN in Saudi Arabia.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					811	824		10.2166/ws.2016.174								WOS:000401654600019						
J	Parsaie, A; Haghiabi, AH				Parsaie, Abbas; Haghiabi, Amir Hamzeh			Numerical routing of tracer concentrations in rivers with stagnant zones	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY												Modeling pollution transmission in rivers is an important subject in environmental engineering studies. Numerical approaches to modeling pollution transmission in rivers are useful tools for managing the water quality. The advection-dispersion equation is the governing equation in the transport of pollution in rivers. Recently, due to advances in fractional calculus in engineering modeling, the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers has been improved using the fractional derivative approach. In this study, by solving the fractional advection-dispersion equation (FRADE), a numerical model was developed for the simulation of pollution transmission in rivers with stagnant zones. To this purpose, both terms of the FRADE equation (advection and fractional dispersion) were discretized separately and the results were connected using a time-splitting technique. The analytical solution of a modified advection-dispersion equation (MADE) model and observed data from the Severn River in the UK were used to demonstrate the model capabilities. Results indicated that there is a good agreement between observed data, the analytical solution of the MADE model, and the results of the developed numerical model. The developed numerical model can accurately simulate the long-tailed dispersion processes in a natural river.

We manufactured filter disks with varied clay, burn-out material, burn-out material sieved with different mesh sizes, and burn-out material to clay ratios and calculated filter characteristics, including porosity, density, shrinkage, and flow rate. Water was run through filters daily for 4 weeks, and flow rate and Escherichia coli reduction, as measured by log reduction value (LRV), were tested twice weekly. Our results suggest: (1) the first and last LRV test results do not correlate strongly (R-2 = 0.38, p < 0.010); (2) there is not a strong association between flow rate and first, average, or last LRV results (R-2 = 0.17, p = 0.090; R-2 = 0.30, p = 0.020; R-2 = 0.24, p = 0.040); and (3) first and average LRV are associated with burn-out material (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.001; R-2 = 0.60, p < 0.001), and last LRV is associated with burn-out material and mesh size (R-2 = 0.54, p < 0.050). Recommendations for filter factories, are to: (1) verify filtration efficacy with repeated bacteria reduction tests when materials, processing, or filter characteristics vary; (2) carefully control production variables; and (3) continue flow rate testing each filter to evaluate within and across batch production consistency.																	1606-9749					MAY	2017	17	3					859	869		10.2166/ws.2016.176								WOS:000401654600024

The science behind One Health: at the interface of humans, animals, and the environment	ANNALS OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCES												Humans face a grand quality-of-life challenge as growing demands for resources for an ever-expanding population threaten the existence of wildlife populations, degrade land, and pollute air and water. Public investment and policy decisions that will shape future interactions of humans, animals, and the environment need scientific input to help find common ground for durable and sustainable success. The Second International Conference on One Medicine One Science brought together a broad range of scientists, trainees, regulatory authorities, and health experts from 34 countries to inform and discuss the human impacts of air quality; the complexities of water quality, access, and conflicts; the opportunities and uncertainties in precisionmedicine; and the role of science communication in health policy formulation. Workshops focused on the roles and development of physician-scientists and multidisciplinary teams in complex problem solving, Big Data tools for analysis and visualization, international policy development processes, and health models that benefit animals and humans. Key realizations were that local and regional health challenges at the interface of humans, animals, and the environment are variations of the same overarching conflicts and that international gatherings provide new opportunities for investigation and policy development that are broadly applicable.

J	Lazard, J				Lazard, Jerome			Aquaculture systems facing climate change	CAHIERS AGRICULTURES												Aquaculture accounts today for approximately 50% of total aquatic products for human consumption. This contribution is expected to increase in the future taking into account the fact that capture fisheries are estimated to have reached their maximum level of catches. While some research has been carried out concerning the impact of climate change on capture fisheries, only very few has been done yet dealing with aquaculture. The present review paper aims at identifying the challenges aquaculture will need to face in this new context of climate change and at suggesting ways in order to forecast and overcome them. Six main components of the aquatic environment are investigated in view of their potential direct impact on aquaculture: sea level rise, changes in temperature, rainfall, river floods and droughts, water availability, water quality deterioration and ocean acidification. Indirect impact of climate change on aquaculture concerns mainly fish meal and oil as strategic inputs for feed manufacture, coming from pelagic fisheries whose catches are affected by climate change. Two strategies may be developed to address climate change challenges. The first one consists in developing solutions enabling to deal with the environmental changes induced by climate change (high salinity tolerant strain, site selection); the second consists in developing systems where all the environmental parameters are strictly monitored and controlled. Reciprocally, the impact of aquaculture on climate change is briefly mentioned. At the end of this paper, a comprehensive worldwide survey carried out by FAO in 2016 shows clearly that measures have already started to be implemented to deal with climate change in the field of aquaculture.																	1777-5949					MAY-JUN	2017	26	3							34001	10.1051/cagri/2017018								WOS:000401419900001

Hydrochemical characterization and suitability assessment of groundwater in Baga-Calangute stretch of Goa, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The present study is the first attempt to determine the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation in the Baga-Calangute stretch of Goa. The suitability of groundwater for potable use was assessed by comparing observed values against standards prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards, and the quality was classified based on the Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index. Most of the groundwater samples (90%) were found to be suitable for drinking except for hardness, chlorides, and nitrates. The percent sodium (%Na), residual sodium carbonate, soluble sodium percentage, sodium adsorption ratio, Kelly's ratio, and Permeability Index were found to be within the prescribed limits for irrigation purposes. The major mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry, i.e., rock-water interaction, was also studied, and it was found that silicate weathering plays a major role in the dissolution of minerals. Based on the hydrochemical characterization, the water was observed to be of the Ca-Na-SO4 composition type except for one sample which was of the Na-Cl composition type. Classification of the meteoric genesis suggested that the groundwater in surficial aquifers in the region had a deep meteoric percolation, and its chemistry is regulated by rock-water interaction.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							341	10.1007/s12665-017-6679-5								WOS:000401323600013

Multivariate statistical analysis for the assessment of groundwater quality under different hydrogeological regimes	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Multivariate statistical analysis has been widely used for hydrogeochemical characterization of groundwater quality. In this study, hydrochemical data from three hydrological basins were used and two methods (factor and cluster analyses) were applied. The first area is the coastal area of Eastern Thermaikos Gulf where groundwater is influenced by seawater intrusion and geothermal fluids. The other two areas are the inland basins of Gallikos and Perdikas in which agricultural and industrial activities constitute the main anthropogenic pollution sources of groundwater. Initially, the aforementioned methods were applied for each area separately and resulted in a different number of significant factors and clusters, while the natural and anthropogenic influences were spatially determined in each area. Additionally, factor and cluster analyses were applied coupling data from all areas. Therefore, five clusters and three major factors were determined distinguishing the hydrochemical processes and impacts from anthropogenic activities in more detail. It is worth mentioning that the application of cluster analysis in the coupled groundwater samples of all studied areas resulted beneficially in the most hydrochemically complex area. Salinization dominates in the coastal area, while in Gallikos and Perdikas basins high concentrations of NO3 occur mainly due to agricultural activities and small livestock units. The numerous hydrochemical samples are identified as the main issue for the higher discretization and reliability of the second approach. Nevertheless, this study is associated with a number of limitations of multivariable statistical analysis regarding extreme concentrations of Cl and Na. This issue stimulates further research in overcoming and understanding these drawbacks.

All major groundwater quality descriptors and selected trace elements (iron, manganese, arsenic, and aluminum) were studied. The study demonstrated evidence of higher concentrations of bicarbonates (60-590 mg/L), total iron (2.2-5336 mu g/L), total manganese (0.1-804 mu g/L) and total arsenic (0.4-14.5 mu g/L) in certain samples with low values of Eh (-32.0 to +25.8) and NO3- (<= 8.2 mg/L) against WHO standards. Thirty-six percent of samples were rated as poor using the water quality index (WQI) criteria. No scaling potential was observed using the Langelier analysis. The majority of samples were of the mixed-bicarbonate type with the abundance order of cations as Ca2+>Na+>Mg2+>K+. Carbonate dissolution, silicate weathering and cation exchange were identified as possible main geochemical control mechanisms. The sources responsible for fluoride and nitrate include anthropogenic activities and rock-water interaction. Dissolution/precipitation and pH control the levels of As, Fe and Mn.

Large tracts of the Selenga River Basin have been developed for industry, urbanization, mining, and agriculture, resulting in the release of suspended solids (SS) that affect downstream water quality and primary productivity. This study addressed SS as the main factor controlling pollutant transport and the primary indicator of land degradation in the Selenga River system. Tributaries with larger areas dedicated to agricultural use had higher SS concentrations, reaching 862 mg L-1, especially during the high runoff and intensive cultivation season. Although the large SS flux was detected in the main river, the small tributaries were distinguished by high SS concentrations. The high SS concentration corresponded to widespread development in the watershed. Watersheds with high potential of SS release are sensitive to intensive land uses. SS in the river system had a constant elemental composition consisting mainly of Fe and Al oxides, indicating that surface soils were major constituents of the tributary SS. Three heavymetals (Zn, Cu, and Cr) appeared in high concentrations downstream of urban and mining areas (two-to sixfold increases), indicating that these contaminants are carried by SS. At two tributary junctions, the concentration of contaminants on the SS decreased due to a large influx of SS with low heavy metal contents. Changes in electric conductivity and pH at downstream of tributary junctions enhanced the sedimentation of SS and the removal of contaminants from the water phase after aggregation of the SS. Land use changes in the tributary watersheds are major controlling factors for the fate of contaminants in the river system.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							346	10.1007/s12665-017-6664-z								WOS:000401323600018

Assessment of the quality of groundwater from different parts of southeastern Nigeria for potable use	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater samples from three different states of southeastern Nigeria were analyzed for a range of physicochemical parameters and heavy metal constituents in order to determine their potability as drinking water sources. The results indicate that the physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature, TDS, TH, electrical conductivity, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-) tested for have most of their values fall within the permissible limits given by the Nigerian and World Health Organization standards for drinking water quality. The results also reveal that apart from Cu and Pb the rest of the tested heavy metals (As, Zn, Ni, total Fe, Cd and Mn) recorded values that are significantly above the maximum permissible limits for drinking water purposes and therefore have the potential to cause health impacts for long-term potable use. On the basis of principal component analysis, the sources of the measured chemical constituents are likely to be predominantly geogenic (weathering of soluble minerals in the formations) and partly anthropogenic (industrial effluent, agricultural practices and mining activities). Single-factor ANOVA tests indicated insignificant differences in the datasets within/between states or geological units. Caution or adequate treatment is generally required when utilizing the groundwater from the area for drinking purpose due to the elevated metal concentrations and rating as poor to unsuitable water quality.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							344	10.1007/s12665-017-6680-z								WOS:000401323600016

Stormwater is a carrier of non-point source pollutants and contains VOCs from land surfaces and air. Samples of stormwater and influent to sewage treatment plants were collected and analyzed for 61 VOCs, while the VOCs in emission sources, air and groundwater were investigated through literature reviews for comparison. The results showed that the most frequently detected VOCs in stormwater were similar to those in air. However, the atmospheric concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), and methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) were too low to explain their frequent detection and high concentrations in stormwater. As a result, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of these VOCs in stormwater. Comparison of the VOCs in stormwater and groundwater showed that toluene and MTBE were frequently detected in both media, but more often and at higher concentrations in stormwater. This finding indicates that stormwater recharge is a source of toluene and MTBE in groundwater. Regarding groundwater, land surfaces seem to be a primary source of toluene, while urban air is the primary source in the case of MTBE. Specifically, the MTBE values in air were sufficiently high to explain its levels in groundwater, which had continually increased and remained low afterward. Furthermore, the high ratios of TEX (toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) to benzene and MTBE in stormwater indicated that TEX had additional sources other than vehicles, most likely hydrocarbon solvents. These solvents seem to be a primary source of TEX and other frequently detected VOCs in stormwater. However, trichloroethylene (TCE), tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and their dechlorination intermediates were far more frequently detected and at higher concentrations in groundwater than in stormwater. Additionally, their concentrations frequently exceeded the water- quality criteria. It seems that halogenated solvents had produced contamination plumes of these chlorinated VOCs in the Seoul aquifer. Based on VOCs detected in Seoul, stormwater was mixed with groundwater in combined sewers and flowed into sewage treatment plants. The results imply that organic solvents should be handled with extreme care to protect groundwater quality.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2017	76	9							338	10.1007/s12665-017-6666-x								WOS:000401323600010

There is abundant literature on equations describing the wash-off of pollutants from roads during a storm event and there are a number of watershed models incorporating those equations in storm water quality algorithms that route runoff and pollution yields through a drainage system towards the catchment outlet. However, methods describing catchment vulnerability to contamination by road spills based solely on biophysical parameters are scarce. These methods could be particularly attractive to managers because they can operate with a limited amount of easily collectable data, while still being able to provide important insights on the areas more prone to contamination within the studied watershed. The purpose of this paper was then to contribute with a new vulnerability model. To accomplish the goal, a selection of medium properties appearing in wash-off equations and routing algorithms were assembled and processed in a parametric framework based on multi criteria analysis to define the watershed vulnerability: However, parameters had to be adapted because wash-off equations and water quality models have been developed to operate primarily in the urban environment while the vulnerability model is meant to run in rural watersheds. The selected parameters were hillside slope, ground roughness (depending on land use), soil permeability (depending on soil type), distance to water courses and stream density. The vulnerability model is a spatially distributed algorithm that was prepared to run under the IDRISI Selva software, a GIS platform capable of handling spatial and alphanumeric data and execute the necessary terrain model, hydrographic and thematic analyses. For illustrative purposes, the vulnerability model was applied to the legally protected Environmental Protection Area (APA), located in the Uberaba region, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In this region, the risk of accidents causing chemical spills is preoccupying because large quantities of dangerous materials are transported in two important distribution highways while the APA is fundamental for the protection of water resources, the riverine ecosystems and remnants of native vegetation. In some tested scenarios, model results show 60% of vulnerable areas within the studied area. The most sensitive parameter to vulnerability is soil type. To prevent soils from contamination, specific measures were proposed involving minimization of land use conflicts that would presumably raise the soil's organic matter and in the sequel restore the soil's structural functions. Additionally, the present study proposed the preservation and reinforcement of riparian forests as one measure to protect the quality of surface water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

UV-visible spectra were analyzed using the maximum of the second derivative at 225 nm (related to nitrates), specific absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)), and the spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm (S275-295) (related to the aromaticity and molecular weight of dissolved organic carbon). The synchronous fluorescence spectra (wavelength difference = 50 nm) exhibited a high variability in the composition of dissolved organic material between the upstream and downstream sections and also versus time. The principal components analysis of the entire set of synchronous fluorescence spectra helped to define three river sections with different pollution characteristics. Spectral decomposition was applied to the two most upstream sections: five fluorophores, classical in rivers impacted by domestic sewage and related to protein-like (lambda(ex) = 280 nm) and humic-like fluorescence (M-type with lambda(ex) approximate to 305-310 nm and C-type with lambda(ex) >= 335 nm), were identified. The irregular shape of the synchronous fluorescence spectra in the most downstream section is likely due to organic pollutants of industrial origin; however, their variability and the complexity of the spectra did not allow the further elucidation of their nature.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							229	10.1007/s10661-017-5933-3								WOS:000401010900026	28435997

Unconventional natural gas development did not result in detectable changes in water chemistry (within the South Fork Little Red River)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The Fayetteville Shale within north central Arkansas is an area of extensive unconventional natural gas (UNG) production. Recently, the Scott Henderson Gulf Mountain Wildlife Management Area (GMWMA) was leased from the state of Arkansas for NG exploration, raising concerns about potential impacts on water resources. From November 2010 through November 2014, we monitored four reaches of the South Fork Little Red River (SFLRR), within the GMWMA, establishing baseline physico-chemical characteristics prior to UNG development and assessing trends in parameters during and after UNG development. Water samples were collected monthly during baseflow conditions and analyzed for conductivity, turbidity, ions, total organic carbon (TOC), and metals. All parameters were flow-adjusted and evaluated for monotonic changes over time. The concentrations of all constituents measured in the SFLRR were generally low (e.g., nitrate ranged from <0.005 to 0.268 mg/l across all sites and sample periods), suggesting the SFLRR is of high water quality. Flow-adjusted conductivity measurements and sodium concentrations increased at site 1, while magnesium decreased across all four sites, TOC decreased at sites 1 and 3, and iron decreased at site 1 over the duration of the study. With the exception of conductivity and sodium, the physico-chemical parameters either decreased or did not change over the 4-year duration, indicating that UNG activities within the GMWMA have had minimal or no detectable impact on water quality within the SFLRR. Our study provides essential baseline information that can be used to evaluate water quality within the SFLRR in the future should UNG activity within the GMWMA expand.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							209	10.1007/s10661-017-5904-8								WOS:000401010900006	28386869

Because of the statistical design, the results of our analyses of Secchi depths (SD) apply to a population of 45,265 lakes. We found statistically significant differences in mean Secchi depths between natural (1.57 m) and man-made lakes (1.18 m). The most important variable correlated with SD was turbidity, an optical measure related to suspended particles in the water column. For most lakes, chlorophyll a was highly correlated with both turbidity and SD, but several lakes had more turbidity and lower SD than expected based on chlorophyll a alone, indicating that non-algal suspended solids were an important factor. On an ecoregion basis, the non-algal suspended solids in the lake waters were related to the average levels of suspended solids in streams located in that ecoregion, and the non-algal suspended solids were more important in man-made than natural lakes. Phosphorus and nitrogen were directly correlated with chlorophyll a and turbidity and inversely correlated with SD. Based on diatom-inferred Secchi depths for the tops and bottoms of sediment cores from lakes in Ecoregions VIII and VII (excluding lakes in Minnesota) representing 40% of the natural lakes in the US, there has been no decrease in water transparency in that population of lakes in the past 70 or more years when the US population increased by 134%. We do not have information to determine if the other 60% of lakes have or have not changed.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							206	10.1007/s10661-017-5911-9								WOS:000401010900003	28374189					
J	Karacaoglu, D; Dalkiran, N				Karacaoglu, Didem; Dalkiran, Nurhayat			Epilithic diatom assemblages and their relationships with environmental variables in the Nilufer Stream Basin, Bursa, Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Patterns of epilithic diatom species distribution in relation to environmental variables from 12 sampling sites on the main stream and some of its tributaries in the Nilufer Stream Basin were determined using multivariate statistical techniques. The stream basin has been heavily influenced by anthropogenic effects. The upper part of the basin that is distant from pollution sources mostly has a spring water quality, while the lower part where the stream flows through the urban area and receives domestic and industrial wastewater has a quite low quality. Ordination techniques using both diatom taxa and 21 environmental variables revealed non-to slightly polluted upper basin sites and highly polluted lower basin sites along the stream. The results showed that the stream catchment is polluted gradually from upstream to downstream and that most of the downstream sites have very low water quality especially in summer months. A total of 134 epilithic diatom taxa belonging to 50 genera were recorded for 12 sample sites. Partial CCA results indicated that water temperature (T), discharge (Q), and total phosphorus (TP) were the most important variables affecting the distribution of diatom species. Unpolluted or slightly polluted upper basin sites were dominated by Achnanthidium minutissimum, Cocconeis placentula var. euglypta, Gomphonema olivaceum, and Navicula tripunctata. Highly polluted lower basin sites were characterized by high levels of organic and inorganic matters and low dissolved oxygen (DO) values. Species widespread in the highly polluted lower basin sites such as Nitzschia umbonata, Nitzschia amphibia, Nitzschia capitellata, Nitzschia palea, Nitzschia paleacea, Luticola mutica, and Stephanodiscus niagarae were mostly related to pollution indicator variables such as ammonium nitrogen (NH4(+)-N), sodium (Na+), total phosphorus (TP), and total organic matter (TOM).																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							227	10.1007/s10661-017-5929-z								WOS:000401010900024	28432510

However, previous assessments of the urban water quality were predominantly conducted by measuring physical and chemical factors rather than biological monitoring. The purpose of this study was to develop an urban stream multimetric index (USMI) based on benthic macroinvertebrates to assess the health of aquatic ecosystem in Jinan City. Two hundred and eighty-eight samples were collected during two consecutive years (2014-2015) from 48 sites located within the city. Metrics related to the benthic macroinvertebrate richness, diversity, composition and abundance, and functional feeding groups were selected by using box-plots and the Kruskal-Wallis test. The final index derived from selected metrics was divided into five river quality classes (excellent, good, moderate, poor, and bad). A validation procedure using box- plots and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test showed that the USMI was useful to assess the health of urban streams.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							205	10.1007/s10661-017-5920-8								WOS:000401010900002	28374188

Monitoring for a specific management objective: protection of shorebird foraging habitat adjacent to a waste water treatment plant	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Intertidal invertebrates are often used in environmental monitoring programs as they are good indicators of water quality and an important food source for many species of fish and birds. We present data from a monitoring program where the primary aim is to report on the condition of the potential invertebrate prey abundance, biomass and diversity for migrating shorebirds on mudflats adjacent to a waste water treatment plant in a Ramsar listed wetland in Victoria, Australia. A key threat to the foraging habitat at this site has been assessed as a reduction in potential prey items as a result of the changes to the waste water treatment processes. We use control charts, which summarise data from intertidal mudflats across the whole shoreline of the adjacent waste water treatment plant, to elicit a management response when trigger levels are reached. We then examine data from replicate discharge and control sites to determine the most appropriate management response. The monitoring program sits within an adaptive management framework where management decisions are reviewed and the data is examined at different scales to evaluate and modify our models of the likely outcomes of management actions. This study provides a demonstration of the process undertaken in a year when trigger levels were reached and a management decision was required. This highlights the importance of monitoring data from a range of scales in reducing uncertainty and improving decision making in complex systems.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2017	189	5							208	10.1007/s10661-017-5924-4								WOS:000401010900005	28386868

T.; Kumar, Arun			Estimation of environmental flow incorporating water quality and hypothetical climate change scenarios	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Environmental flows (Eflow, hereafter) are the flows to be maintained in the river for its healthy functioning and the sustenance and protection of aquatic ecosystems. Estimation of Eflow in any river stretch demands consideration of various factors such as flow regime, ecosystem, and health of river. However, most of the Eflow estimation studies have neglected the water quality factor. This study urges the need to consider water quality criterion in the estimation of Eflow and proposes a framework for estimating Eflow incorporating water quality variations under present and hypothetical future scenarios of climate change and pollution load. The proposed framework is applied on the polluted stretch of Yamuna River passing through Delhi, India. Required Eflow at various locations along the stretch are determined by considering possible variations in future water quantity and quality. Eflow values satisfying minimum quality requirements for different river water usage classes (classes A, B, C, and D as specified by the Central Pollution Control Board, India) are found to be between 700 and 800 m(3)/s. The estimated Eflow values may aid policymakers to derive upstream storagerelease policies or effluent restrictions. Generalized nature of this framework will help its implementation on any river systems.

This article provides a general overview of the previous works that have been completed in monitoring and analyzing heavy metals. The intention of this review is to introduce the historical studies to distinguish and understand the previous challenges faced by researchers in analyzing heavy metal accumulation. In addition, this review introduces a survey on the importance of time increment sampling (monthly and/or seasonally) to comprehend and determine the rate of change of different parameters on a monthly and seasonal basis. Furthermore, suggestions are made for future research to achieve more understandable figures on heavy metal accumulation by considering climate conditions. Thus, the intent of the current study is the provision of reliable models for predicting future heavy metal accumulation in water bodies in different climates and pollution conditions so that water management can be achieved using intelligent proactive strategies and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques.

The collection period was from March to July 2015 at an urban area, Jubaiha, which is located in the northern part of the capital city Amman, Jordan. The obtained results indicated the predominance of Ca2+ and SO42- ions (ratio 2.2: 1) that originated from Saharan soil dust; where the collected samples were alkaline (mean pH = 7.35) with high mineralization (429.22 mg/L) exceeding the previously reported dew values in Amman-Jordan. A relocation of NaCl and to a less extent Mg2+ from sea to land by Saharan wind is indicated by the percent sea-salt fraction calculations (over 100 and 52, respectively). The collected samples exhibited high total organic carbon (TOC) values ranging from 11.86 to 74.60 mg/L, presence of particulate settled material with turbidity ranging from 20.10 to 520.00 NTU, and presence of undesired elements like boron (mean = 1.48 mg/L) that made it different in properties from other dew water collections at clean surfaces, and exceeding the standard limits for drinking water for these parameters set by Jordanian Drinking Water standards (JS286/2015)/WHO standard. The quality of this water is more close to that for raw or agricultural water but if it is meant to be used as potable source of water, at least sand and activated charcoal filters are needed to purify it.

The aim of this pilot-scale study was to investigate current RHRW practices in American Samoa (AS) and to evaluate and compare the quality of water from common potable water sources including RHRW stored in tanks, untreated stream water, untreated municipal well water, and treated municipal tap water samples. Samples were analyzed using culture-based methods, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and 16S amplicon sequencing-based methods. Based on indicator bacteria (total coliform and Escherichia coli) concentrations, the quality of RHRW was slightly lower than well and chlorinated tap water but exceeded that of untreated stream water. Although no Giardia or Leptospira spp. were detected in any of the RHRW samples, 86% of the samples were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. All stream water samples tested positive for Cryptosporidium spp. Opportunistic pathogens (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacterium intracellulare) were also detected in the RHRW samples (71 and 21% positive samples, respectively). Several potentially pathogenic genera of bacteria were also detected in RHRW by amplicon sequencing. Each RHRW system was characterized by distinct microbial communities, 77% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected only in a single tank, and no OTU was shared by all the tanks. Risk of water-borne illness increased in the following order: chlorinated tap water/well water < RHRW< stream water. Frequent detection of opportunistic pathogens indicates that RHRW should be treated before use. Stakeholder education on RHRW system design options as well as on importance of regular cleaning and proper management techniques could improve the quality of the RHRWin AS.

This study investigated Cd loss from a soil under a winter dairy-grazed forage crop that was grazed either conventionally (24 h) or with restricted grazing (6 h). This provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that urine inputs could increase Cd concentrations in drainage. It was thought this would be a result of cow urine either (i) enhancing dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations via an increase in soil pH, resulting in the formation of soluble Cd-organic carbon complexes and, or (ii) greater inputs of chloride (Cl) via cow urine, promoting the formation of soluble Cd-Cl complexes. Cadmium concentrations in subsurface flow were generally low, with a spike above the water quality guidelines for a month after the 24-h grazing. Cadmiumfluxes were on average 0.30 g Cd ha(-1) year(-1) (0.27-0.32 g Cd ha-1 year-1), in line with previous estimates for agricultural soils. The mean Cd concentration in drainage from the 24-h grazed plots was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than 6-h plots. No increase in DOC concentrations between the treatments was found. However, Cl concentrations in drainage were significantly higher (P < 0.001) from the 24-h than the 6-h grazed treatment plots, and positively correlated with Cd concentrations, and therefore, a possible mechanism increasing Cd mobility in soil. Further study is warranted to confirm the mechanisms involved and quantities of Cd lost from other systems.

To simulate the effects of rural household livelihood transition on non-point source (NPS) pollution, a model combining an agent-based model (ABM) and an improved export coefficient model (IECM) was developed. The ABM was adopted to simulate the dynamic process of household livelihood transition, and the IECM was employed to estimate the effects of household livelihood transition on NPS pollution. The coupled model was tested in a small catchment in the Dongting Lake region, China. The simulated results reveal that the transition of household livelihood strategies occurred with the changes in the prices of rice, pig, and labor. Thus, the cropping system, land-use intensity, resident population, and number of pigs changed in the small catchment from 2000 to 2014. As a result of these changes, the total nitrogen load discharged into the river initially increased from 6841.0 kg in 2000 to 8446.3 kg in 2004 and then decreased to 6063.9 kg in 2014. Results also suggest that rural living, livestock, paddy field, and precipitation alternately became the main causes of NPS pollution in the small catchment, and the midstream region of the small catchment was the primary area for NPS pollution from 2000 to 2014. Despite some limitations, the coupled model provides an innovative way to simulate the effects of rural household livelihood transition on NPS pollution with the change of socioeconomic factors, and thereby identify the key factors influencing water pollution to provide valuable suggestions on how agricultural environmental risks can be reduced through the regulation of the behaviors of farming households in the future.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2017	24	14					12899	12917		10.1007/s11356-017-8812-0								WOS:000400765900040	28365845

The assessment was based on the dynamics and relationships between microbiological and chemical indicators of water quality throughout the major rivers of this region-Dunajec, Czarny Dunajec, Bialy Dunajec, and Bialka. Another aim was to assess the effect of land use on the quality of water in the studied rivers. The study was conducted over 1 year at 21 sampling sites distributed from the uppermost sections of rivers in the Tatra National Park through main tourist resorts until mouths of the considered rivers to the Czorsztynskie Lake. Microbiological analysis comprised the prevalence of total and fecal types of coliforms and Escherichia coli, mesophilic, and psychrophilic bacteria. Chemical assays determined the concentrations of Na+, K+, NH4+, Cl-, NO3-, and PO43-. Temperature, electrical conductivity, and pH were measured onsite. It was demonstrated that there is a significant relationship between the predominant types of land use within individual catchments, which results in evident differences in the pollution of waters between the catchments. The results showed that increased share of built up areas and arable land results in significant deterioration of water quality. Thus, waters of Czarny Dunajec were the cleanest, while Bialy Dunajec was the most heavily contaminated. Also, spatial diversity in water quality was shown-the cleanest waters were sampled in the Tatra National Park and the pollution increased with the course of rivers. Point sources of pollution such as effluents from treatment plants or discharge of untreated sewage from households proved to be more important than non-point sources, such as surface runoff. Moreover, the important role of the Czorsztynskie Lake in the purification of water was demonstrated.

This review article was constructed to report the latest research progress of groundwater quality in western China where groundwater quality is undergoing fast deterioration because of fast economic development and extensive anthropogenic activities. The opportunities brought by increasing public awareness of groundwater quality protection were also highlighted and discussed. To guide and promote further development of groundwater quality research in China, especially in western China, ten key groundwater quality research fields were proposed. The review shows that the intensification of human activities and the associated impacts on groundwater quality in China, especially in western China, has made groundwater quality research increasingly important, and has caught the attention of local, national, and international agencies and scholars. China has achieved some progress in groundwater quality research in terms of national and regional laws, regulations, and financial supports. The future of groundwater quality research in China, especially in western China, is promising reflected by the opportunities highlighted. The key research fields proposed in this article may also inform groundwater quality protection and management at the national and international level.

J	Re, V; Sacchi, E				Re, V.; Sacchi, E.			Tackling the salinity-pollution nexus in coastal aquifers from arid regions using nitrate and boron isotopes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Salinization and nitrate pollution are generally ascertained as the main issues affecting coastal aquifers worldwide. In arid zones, where agricultural activities also result in soil salinization, both phenomena tend to co-exist and synergically contribute to alter groundwater quality, with severe negative impacts on human populations and natural ecosystems' wellbeing. It becomes therefore necessary to understand if and to what extent integrated hydrogeochemical tools can help in distinguishing among possible different salinization and nitrate contamination origins, in order to provide adequate science-based support to local development and environmental protection. The alluvial plain of Bou-Areg (North Morocco) extends over about 190 km(2) and is separated from the Mediterranean Sea by the coastal Lagoon of Nador. Its surface is covered for more than 60% by agricultural activities, although the region has been recently concerned by urban population increase and tourismexpansion. All these activities mainly rely on groundwater exploitation and at the same time are the main causes of both aquifer and lagoon water quality degradation. For this reason, it was chosen as a case study representative of the typical situation of coastal aquifers in arid zones worldwide, where a clear identification of salinization and pollution sources is fundamental for the implementation of locally oriented remedies and long-term management strategies. Results of a hydrogeochemical investigation performed between 2009 and 2011 show that the Bou-Areg aquifer presents high salinity (often exceeding 100 mg/L in TDS) due to both natural and anthropogenic processes. The area is also impacted by nitrate contamination, with concentrations generally exceeding the WHO statutory limits for drinking water (50 mg/L) and reaching up to about 300 mg/L, in both the rural and urban/peri-urban areas. The isotopic composition of dissolved nitrates (delta N-15(NO3) and delta O-18(NO)) was used to constrain pollution drivers. The results indicate two main origins for human-induced pollution: (i) manure and septic effluents, especially in urban areas, and (ii) synthetic fertilizers in agricultural areas. In the latter, delta N-15-enriched values highlight a mixture of those sources, possibly related to unbalanced fertilization and agricultural return flow. Boron isotopes (delta B-11) were hence studied to further distinguish the nitrate origin in the presence of multiple sources and mixing processes. The results indicate that in the study area, the high geochemical background for B and Cl, associated to the complex waterrock interaction processes, limit the application of the coupled delta B-11 and delta N-15 isotopic systematics to the detection of sources of groundwater pollution. In fact, despite the exceedingly high nitrate contents, the depleted delta B-11 values that characterize synthetic fertilizers and sewage leakages could not be detected. Therefore, even if in saline groundwater the anthropogenic contribution has a negligible effect in terms of salinity input, with both sewage and irrigation water not very charged, the associated nitrate content fuels up water-rock interaction processes, eventually leading to a mineralization increase.

J	Le, TTH; Zeunert, S; Lorenz, M; Meon, G				Thi Thu Huyen Le; Zeunert, Stephanie; Lorenz, Malte; Meon, Guenter			Multivariate statistical assessment of a polluted river under nitrification inhibition in the tropics	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												A large complex water quality data set of a polluted river, the Tay Ninh River, was evaluated to identify its water quality problems, to assess spatial variation, to determine the main pollution sources, and to detect relationships between parameters. This river is highly polluted with organic substances, nutrients, and total iron. An important problem of the river is the inhibition of the nitrification. For the evaluation, different statistical techniques including cluster analysis (CA), discriminant analysis (DA), and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied. CA clustered 10 water quality stations into three groups corresponding to extreme, high, and moderate pollution. DA used only seven parameters to differentiate the defined clusters. The PCA resulted in four principal components. The first PC is related to conductivity, NH4-N, PO4-P, and TP and determines nutrient pollution. The second PC represents the organic pollution. The iron pollution is illustrated in the third PC having strong positive loadings for TSS and total Fe. The fourth PC explains the dependence of DO on the nitrate production. The nitrification inhibition was further investigated by PCA. The results showed a clear negative correlation between DO and NH4-N and a positive correlation between DO and NO3-N. The influence of pH on the NH4-N oxidation could not be detected by PCA because of the very low nitrification rate due to the constantly low pH of the river and because of the effect of wastewater discharge with very high NH4-N concentrations. The results are deepening the understanding of the governing water quality processes and hence to manage the river basins sustainably.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				MAY	2017	24	15					13845	13862		10.1007/s11356-017-8989-2								WOS:000401566600060	28409429					
J	Mansour, AT; Esteban, MA				Mansour, Abdallah Tageldien; Angeles Esteban, Maria			Effects of carbon sources and plant protein levels in a biofloc system on growth performance, and the immune and antioxidant status of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)	FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY												The efficacy of different biofloc treatments (BFTs) to compensate for a reduction in dietary protein level under zero-water exchange systems was studied during a 10 weeks experiment, assessing the effect on water quality, growth, immune and antioxidant status of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fingerlings. Six groups were established and fed the same plant-based feed containing 20 or 30% crude protein: two groups in clear water conditions with no added carbon source, two biofloc groups given a wheat milling by-product (WMB) as additional carbon source and two biofloc groups given rice bran (RB). The results showed that biofloc volume was higher when WMB was used as carbon source. The highest growth performance were obtained with the biofloc system and the higher dietary protein level. Fish fed 20% crude protein and stocked in WMB biofloc significantly outperformed the fish fed 30% crude protein and stocked in clear water. Significant improvements in hematocrit, white blood cells, lymphocytes, plasma proteins, and humoral (immunoglobulin, lysozyme, myeloperoxidase and ACH(50)) and cellular (phagocytosis activity and respiratory burst) immune parameters were observed in all BET fish. BFT also increased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. Moreover, the fish fed 20% dietary protein and reared in both biofloc conditions showed equal or superior levels of the immunological criteria to fish fed 30% protein in clear water conditions. In conclusion, using WMB as carbon source could make up for a reduction in dietary protein levels of 10% and improve growth performance, and the immune and antioxidant status of O. niloticus.

J	Gorostiza, S; Sauri, D				Gorostiza, Santiago; Sauri, David			Dangerous assemblages: Salts, trihalomethanes and endocrine disruptors in the water palimpsest of the Llobregat River, Catalonia	GEOFORUM												Water flows through time are connected to specific instances of socionatural and sociotechnical assemblages of human and non-human components. We propose the concept of "water palimpsest" in order to characterize the complex histories of chemical and metabolic alterations embodied in water flows, potentially disruptive for humans and other living beings. Through the concept of palimpsest we interpret the configuration of water flows as constantly evolving towards new patterns maintaining at the same time traces of past mixtures. In order to decipher water pollution by means of a political ecology approach we argue that it is necessary to characterize the historical contours under which certain substances in river waters appear, interact and become hazardous. Engaging critically with literature on assemblages but also with chemical and epidemiological scientific literature, and drawing from archival and oral sources, we provide an account of historically produced pollution in the waters of Llobregat River (Catalonia) by unravelling the assemblages that shape the water palimpsest in this river. In parallel, we narrate the advances in instrumentation and analysis which permitted to detect and measure substances beyond recognition by human senses and preceded legal regulations on pollutants, starting from milligrams and (thus far) arriving at nanoscales. Focusing on the emergence of three typologies of pollutants salts, trihalomethanes (THMs) and endocrine disruptors (EDs) we unveil how these three assemblages embody specific instances of Llobregat socioenvironmental history, pointing towards a palimpsest characterized by increasing levels of complexity and uncertainty. The concept of water palimpsest allows us to incorporate non-human agency into the analysis of water quality and to infuse political ecology with materiality and thus with a (largely missing) focus on physicochemical and biological processes.

In order to evaluate the effect on groundwater recharge, of decreasing surface-water bodies and land-use change caused by urbanization, the relevant groundwater systems and recharge pathways must be characterized in detail. To this end, water levels and water quality were monitored for 3 years regarding groundwater and adjacent surface-water bodies, at two typical suburban sites in Hanoi. Stable isotope (delta O-18, delta D of water) analysis and hydrochemical analysis showed that the water from both aquifers and aquitards, including the groundwater obtained from both the monitoring wells and the neighboring household tubewells, was largely derived from evaporation-affected surface-water bodies (e.g., ponds, irrigated farmlands) rather than from rivers. The water-level monitoring results suggested distinct local-scale flow systems for both a Holocene unconfined aquifer (HUA) and Pleistocene confined aquifer (PCA). That is, in the case of the HUA, lateral recharge through the aquifer from neighboring ponds and/or irrigated farmlands appeared to be dominant, rather than recharge by vertical rainwater infiltration. In the case of the PCA, recharge by the above-lying HUA, through areas where the aquitard separating the two aquifers was relatively thin or nonexistent, was suggested. As the decrease in the local surface-water bodies will likely reduce the groundwater recharge, maintaining and enhancing this recharge (through preservation of the surface-water bodies) is considered as essential for the sustainable use of groundwater in the area.

Surface morphology, specific surface area, chemical structure, and thermal stability of the resulting adsorbents, SiO2-TiO2, Fe3O4-TiO2, and Fe3O4-SiO2-TiO2, were determined. Adsorption of fluoride onto the three TiO2-based composites was evaluated and the results indicated that all the adsorbents effectively removed fluoride from aqueous solution with high adsorption capacities (22.4-152.2 mg/g). SiO2-TiO2 was the best among the three adsorbents, indicating SiO2 was an effective carrier for TiO2. Although the other two adsorbents showed fluoride sorption, the presence of Fe3O4 particles made the composites magnetic. Findings of this work suggested that TiO2-based composites have great potential to be used as high-efficiency adsorbents for the removal of fluoride from water.

The OLR clearly influenced both sponge pore water quality and relative flagellates and ciliates (free-swimming, carnivorous, crawling, and stalked protozoa) abundances in the retained sludge. Immediately after the OLR was increased from 1.05 to 1.97 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m(-3) day(-1), COD and NH4+-N treatment efficiencies both deteriorated, and relative flagellates and ciliates abundances then increased from 2-8 % to 51-65 % total cells in the middle-bottom part of the DHS reactor. In a continuous operation at a stable OLR (2.01 kg COD m(-3) day(-1)), effluent water quality improved, and relative flagellates and ciliates abundances decreased to 15-46 % total cells in the middle-bottom part of the DHS reactor. This result may indicate that flagellates and ciliates preferentially graze on dispersed bacteria, thus, stabilizing effluent water quality. Additionally, to investigate eukaryotic community structure, clone libraries based on the 18S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene of the retained sludge were constructed. The predominant group was Nucletmycea phylotypes, representing approximately 29-56 % total clones. Furthermore, a large proportion of the clones had < 97 % sequence identity in the NCBI database. This result indicates that phylogenetically unknown eukaryotes were present in the DHS reactor. These results provide insights into eukaryotic community shift in the DHS reactor treating domestic sewage.																	0095-3628	1432-184X				MAY	2017	73	4					801	814		10.1007/s00248-016-0871-0								WOS:000401565700005	27796418

Groundwater samples have been collected from 32 stations for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium percentage (per cent Na) and residual sodium carbonate (RSC) analysis. Evaluation of water quality for irrigation using the United States Salinity Laboratory classifications suggests that the majority of the groundwater samples are good for irrigation. The crop tolerance of irrigation water salinity, as based on EC value, showed that paddy (rice), soybeans and sweet tomatoes are suitable for agricultural cultivation, but that corn and field beans are not suitable. Results indicate that, if used for agricultural irrigation, the groundwater quality ranges from excellent to good, except for a few locations (e.g. Meureubo sub-district) which indicate signs of deterioration.																	0129-7619	1467-9493				MAY	2017	38	2					185	200		10.1111/sjtg.12197								WOS:000400936000003						
J	Abraham, J; Dowling, K; Florentine, S				Abraham, Joji; Dowling, Kim; Florentine, Singarayer			The Unquantified Risk of Post-Fire Metal Concentration in Soil: a Review	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Forest fire is a natural disturbance that occurs in many terrestrial ecosystems specifically in the semi-arid environments and is considered to be an important cause of environmental change. Though many causes of fire are identified, including lightning, volcanic eruption, power line sparks, etc., human involvement is the most significant factor. Fire events are able to alter the physical, chemical and biogeochemical properties of the soil and surface materials and are able to release major and trace metals into the environment. This may be more significant in mining-affected and industrial landscapes, where elevated concentrations of metals present in the soil. After the fire event, metals become more mobile due to the increase in soil surface exposure and the mobility associated with ash dispersal. This mobility may increase the bioavailability of the metals, which may generate water quality issues and may contribute to human and environmental health concerns. Even though, the influences of fire on many soil properties are well established, the behaviour of metals with respect to fire is not well investigated. However, a few studies report that major and trace metals include Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn and As are mobilized after fire with increased concentrations in soil and water resources and this might pose a risk to human health and ecosystems. Climate change may increase the intensity, frequency and areal extend of fire events and hence increase the metal concentrations and their potential health impacts. This paper reviews post-fire (wild fire) mobility of metals in soil common in contaminated forest ecosystems. The human and ecological health risks of these metals are also considered.

We hypothesized that the disappearance of algal blooms by dilution could be explained by flow regime, nutrient concentrations, and their interaction. This study investigated the effects of daily renewal rate (d), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration, and their interaction on the domination between Microcystis aeruginosa and Cyclotella sp. through a monoxenic culture experiment. The simulation model as functions of the N: P mass ratio and dilution rate (D) (calculated from d) was constructed, and the dominant characteristics of both species were predicted based on the model using parameters obtained in a monoculture experiment and our previous study. Results of monoxenic culture experiment revealed that M. aeruginosa dominated in all conditions (d = 5 or 15%; N = 1.0 or 2.5 or 5.0 mg-N L-1; P = 0.1 or 0.5 mg-P L-1) and the predicted cell densities were substantially correspondent to experimental data. Under various N: P ratios and D values, characteristics of domination for each species were predicted, indicating that Cyclotella sp. tended to be dominant under high P concentrations (P = 0.36 mg-P L-1) when the N: P ratio was less than 7.0, and M. aeruginosa could not form algal blooms at the N: P ratio = 7.0 (N = 0.7 mg-N L-1). It was also suggested that the dilution rate leading to the Cyclotella sp. domination required 0.20 day(-1) or higher regardless of the N: P ratios.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				MAY	2017	228	5							174	10.1007/s11270-017-3343-3								WOS:000401070100006

The methodology provides suitable information to generate strategies focusing on health problems. Giardia cysts (GC) and Cryptosporidium oocysts (CO) are considered emerging pathogens that can infect human and animals by ingesting contaminated food or water, where food and water are transport vehicles for these parasites. Studies for GC and CO have reported occurrences for these parasites in water up to 100%, and some of these studies documented a number of cases, about 403,000 people, infected worldwide. This review is focused on compiling the most relevant works assessing the risk for GC and CO and their presence in different water samples that are susceptible for direct and indirect human consumption. The annual risk infection probability for these parasites has been reported from different water sources, with a range between 1 x 10(-6) and 1, while the world standard regulation is 1 x 10(-4). The infection probability depends not only on water quality but also on water treatment implementations.

Twelve of the 15 urban lakes investigated were eutrophic, of which five were hypertrophic, while only seven of the 16 suburban lakes were eutrophic. The Trophic Index (TRIX) was the best predictive index to identify the eutrophication level of the lakes. Classification trees (CTs) were applied to study the trophic status of lakes and identify the driving variables. The results demonstrated that eutrophication in the lakes of Hanoi was driven by nutrients and organic enrichment, as well as by inappropriate management such as unplanned embankment and water uses. DIN, BOD, lake size and embankment were the key parameters controlling eutrophication in the lakes of Hanoi.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				MAY	2017	31	2					176	183		10.1111/wej.12231								WOS:000401235100005

Determination of volatilisation rate constants of trihalomethanes from heated distilled and finished tap water	WATER AND ENVIRONMENT JOURNAL												Disinfection of drinking water is one of the major responsibilities facing cities, towns and rural areas around the world. However, most disinfectants react with organic material in the water to produce a wide variety of by-products. Halogenated methane compounds (THMs) are among these by-products and have been linked to adverse health effects in humans. The human exposure pathway includes: ingestion, inhalation and dermal adsorption, and THM volatilisation plays a role in all three. This paper examines the volatilisation of four trihalomethane compounds and relates their volatilisation rate constants to temperature, concentration and solvent matrix. Volatilisation rate constants were incorporated into a first-order model that will allow resulting THM exposure concentrations to be calculated for household uses that involve heating of drinking water. Utilisation of the THM volatilisation rate constants developed in this manuscript should improve future exposure estimates.																	1747-6585	1747-6593				MAY	2017	31	2					252	261		10.1111/wej.12246								WOS:000401235100014

Field campaign on sediment transport behaviour in a pressure main from pumping station to wastewater treatment plant in Berlin	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												As part of the project KURAS, the Berliner Wasserbetriebe realized a field campaign in 2015 in order to increase the process knowledge regarding the behaviour of transported sediment in the pressure main leading from the pumpstation to the wastewater treatment plant. The field campaign was conducted because of a lack of knowledge about the general condition of the pressure main due to its bad accessibility and the suspicion of deposits caused by hydraulic underload. The practical evidence of the sediment transport performance of this part of the sewer system, dependent on different load cases, should present a basis for further analysis, for example regarding flushing measures. A positive side-effect of the investigation was the description of the amount of pollutants caused by different weather conditions in combined sewer systems and the alterations of the sewage composition due to biogenic processes during transport. The concept included the parallel sampling of the inflow at the pumpstation and the outflow at the end of the pressure main during different weather conditions. By calculating the inflow to the pressure main, as well as its outflow at different flow conditions, it was possible to draw conclusions in regard to the transport behaviour of sediment and the bioprocesses within an 8.5 km section of the pressure main. The results show clearly that the effects of sedimentation and remobilization depend on the flow conditions. The balance of the total suspended solids (TSS) load during daily variations in dry weather shows that the remobilization effect during the run-off peak is not able to compensate for the period of sedimentation happening during the low flow at night. Based on the data for dry weather, an average of 238 kg of TSS deposits in the pressure main remains per day. The remobilization of sediment occurs only due to the abruptly increased delivery rates caused by precipitation events. These high pollution loads lead to a sudden strain at the wastewater treatment plant. It was found that the sediment transport behaviour is characterized by sedimentation up to a flow velocity of 0.35 m/s, while remobilization effects occur above 0.5 m/s. The assumption of bad sediment transport performance in the pressure main was confirmed. Therefore, the results can be used as a basis for further analysis, for example regarding periodical flushing as a means of cleaning the pressure main. The findings, especially regarding the methods and processes, are transferable and can be applied to other pressure mains in combined sewer systems. Besides the outlined evaluation of the sediment transport behaviour of the pressure main, the collected data were used in the project to calibrate a sewer system model, including a water quality model for the catchment area, and as a contribution towards an early physically based sediment transport modelling in InfoWorks CS.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				MAY	2017	75	9					2025	2033		10.2166/wst.2017.044								WOS:000401150500004	28498115

Life Cycle Water Footprint Analysis for Rapeseed Derived Jet Fuel in North Dakota	ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING												Rapeseed is considered to be a promising sources for hydroprocessed ester and fatty acid (HEFA) jet fuel production as a means to address energy security and climate change mitigation. However, concerns have been raised about its impact on water, as large-scale biofuel production may place pressure on fresh water supplies and water quality. Water footprint (WF) analysis, when combined with water-focused life cycle assessment (LCA), can be an effective system analysis tool for water sustainability. This study developed a life cycle water footprint analysis informed by inputs from multiple models for rapeseed HEFA jet fuel production in North Dakota and evaluated the environmental impacts on water utilization and water quality due to large scale HEFA jet production. The biogeochemical-based EPIC model was incorporated to simulate crop growth that influences the hydrological cycle. Systematic LCA models were built in SimaPro to conduct life cycle blue WF analysis. Results using energy allocation indicate that rapeseed derived HEFA jet fuel has a WF of 131-143 m3 per GJ fuel over a rapeseed price range of $470-600, including all green, blue, and gray WF components. Discussions also indicate the importance of incorporating allocation within a life cycle approach when conducting biofuel WF analysis.																	2168-0485					MAY	2017	5	5					3845	3854		10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b02956								WOS:000400634900031

However, the use of filter-feeding aquatic animals to control eutrophic water bodies remains debatable. As such, more work is needed to understand the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on the restoration of eutrophic water bodies. In this study, we first conducted a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on water body restoration, and then applied these results in the field. We found that silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) deteriorated water quality by increasing nutrient and total suspended solid concentrations, and decreased the biomass of submerged macrophytes. However, triangle sail mussels (Hyriopsis cumingii) promoted the establishment of a clear-water state by grazing on phytoplankton and detritus, and stimulating submerged macrophyte growth. In practical ecological engineering, we suggest that silver carp can be used at low density (20 g/m(3)) as a biomanipulation tool, despite their potential to deteriorate water quality. Furthermore, stocking mussels in nets at a biomass of 150 g/m3 can be effectively used to restore eutrophicated water bodies. Finally, Hydrilla verticillata and Potamogeton malaianus, in combination with filter-feeding aquatic animals, are suitable submerged macrophyte species for the restoration of eutrophicated lakes.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												While phosphorus (P) is a vital element in freshwater systems, excessive P loads will induce eutrophication. Large inputs of various pollutants, including P, to rivers in semi-arid regions result in complex environmental problems. In this study, we investigate dissolved oxygen (DO), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), soluble reactive P (SRP) in surface water and pore water, and sediment P in the Niuwei River, within the Hai River Basin. From our results we developed and tested a theory for P release in semi-arid regions driven by DO. The results show that NH3 and CODcr can cause variations in DO in surface water. The presence of pollutants at high concentrations caused seasonal hypoxia. Hypoxic river water induced adsorption and hydrolysis of NaOH-Pi and labile organic P (L-Po), which then resulted in increased SRP concentrations in pore water and surface water. Overall, our results illustrate that NH3 and CODcr may be important for P adsorption and desorption and for management of water quality problems in rivers in semi-arid regions.

Performance of a hybrid pilot-scale constructed wetland system for treating oil sands process-affected water from the Athabasca oil sands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Mining leases in the Athabasca oil sands (AOS; near Ft. McMurray, Canada) produce large volumes of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) that contain potentially problematic constituents requiring treatment prior to surface water discharge into receiving aquatic systems. The aim of this research was to identify constituents of concern (COCs) in OSPW sourced from an AOS external tailings facility and design a hybrid pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTS) to decrease concentrations of COCs and subsequently mitigate risks. COCs were identified based on comparisons to ambient water quality thresholds for the protection of aquatic life (i.e. Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [CEQGs], Alberta Environment Water Quality Guidelines [Alberta WQGs], and United States Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Criteria [USEPA WQC]) and toxicity endpoints. Performance of the hybrid pilot-scale CWTS was evaluated by rate and extent of COC removal and change in toxicity as measured by an aquatic invertebrate Ceriodaphnia dubia. Following characterization of OSPW, specific COCs were identified as: naphthenic acids (NAs), oil and grease (O/G), metals/metalloids (Al, B, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn), chloride, and total suspended solids (TSS). A hybrid pilot-scale CWTS was designed to promote treatment processes to alter (transfer and transform) COCs using sequential reducing and oxidizing wetland reactors and a solar photocatalytic treatment reactor using fixed film titanium dioxide (TiO2). Performance criteria were achieved as the CWTS decreased concentrations of NM, O/G, and metals below protective thresholds and decreased toxicity to C. dubia. Results from this study provide proof-of-concept data to inform hybrid passive or semi-passive treatment approaches (i.e. constructed wetlands) that could be used to mitigate COCs contained in OSPWs.

It ultimately affects the water quality of large shallow lakes through sediment resuspension and nutrient diffusion. Impacts of the wind field, hence needed to be studied, especially; (1) the impacts of wind field on the vertical profile, and (2) on the generation of the reverse flow field at large shallow wind exposed lakes. The present study investigated the wind field impacts on the water flow field at different water depths in the large shallow Taihu Lake by using precise wind and velocity profile data acquired at Dongtaihu bay. The results revealed that wind speed and direction have dominant effects on water movement in the large shallow lake. High frequency of wind direction generates more frequent reverse flow field at each layer of the water column. The dominant wind directions found with a high probability of Contribution in the generation of reverse flows at the surface (42.4%), upper middle (38.4%) and bottom (51.5%) layers with large-scale shear of the flow field. Similarly, probability statistics showed that dominant wind speeds have more contributions in the generation of compensation currents at the lower middle (42.6%) layer of the vertical water profile with medium scale shear of the flow field. High wind speeds play a major role in the generation of large flows at all layers of flow profile, but long-term steady wind speeds with consistent wind direction generate stable current in the large shallow lake which reduce the diffusion and nutrient resuspension in the large shallow Taihu Lake. Results of the current study provide a novel ground to study sediment/nutrient resuspension, transport and water quality scenarios in large shallow wind exposed lakes while considering reverse flow field in shallow waters.

Effects of submerged zone, media aging, and antecedent dry period on the performance of biochar-amended biofilters in removing fecal indicators and nutrients from natural stormwater	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Biochar has demonstrated promising performance as an amendment to biofilter soil media in removing fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) from simulated stormwater. However, there is no study that investigates its efficacy in treating natural stormwater runoff. Additional information, including the effects of antecedent dry period, microbial biofilm, and presence of a saturation zone on the performance of biochar-augmented biofilters are needed to inform their field implementation. This study uses laboratory column experiments to monitor FIB (enterococci and Escherichia coli) and nutrient removal capacity of biochar-amended biofilters for 140 days using natural stormwater. Our study also investigates the effects of antecedent dry days (ADD) and the presence of a saturation zone (SZ) on the performance of lab-scale biochar-amended biofilters. The results suggest insignificant influence of the ADD and SZ on FIB removal performance, however biofilters with a SZ perform significantly better in removing nitrate-nitrogen compared to those without a SZ. In addition, it appears that the presence of biofilm augments nutrient removal capacity but reduces FIB removal capacity. Our observations indicate that biochar-amended biofilters are able to treat (to comply with recreational water quality standard for FIB) urban stormwater runoff for the duration of the experiment. Nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen removal in the biologically aged biofilters is found to be 50-60% while the total dissolved phosphorus and the organic nitrogen removal is 20-30%. Our results inform full-scale design of biochar-amended biofilters in order to meet the total maximum daily load (TMDL) and municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) permitting requirement for FIB and nutrients.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in Australian stormwater biofilters	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stormwater biofilters are important tools for managing runoff in urban watersheds. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no accounts examining the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters. This plant-fungi relationship is an important interaction in most terrestrial ecosystems, playing a role in nutrient dynamics, water cycling, and soil organic matter decomposition. The presence of mycorrhiza in biofilters could have implications for nutrient and metal uptake in plants, and thus enhance removal of target pollutants. Additionally, the establishment, growth, and survivability of plants could be enhanced when roots are colonized by mycorrhizae. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters of varying ages in three Australian cities: Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. The 32 biofilters surveyed supported 56 plant species, with dominant species belonging to the Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, Juncaceae, Onagraceae, Poaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae families. Mycorrhizal associations were identified from 4 of the 11 most dominant plant species from 9 different biofilters, but relatively low percentages of mycorrhizal colonization (3-25% colonization) were observed in biofilter plant roots. Mycorrhizal colonization was not related to biofilter age. These results demonstrate that mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant roots growing in biofilters. These findings provide useful evidence of the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in stormwater biofilters that support subsequent investigation into their roles in these systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Potential of using immobilizing agents in aided phytostabilization on simulated contamination of soil with lead	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Lead (Pb) is one of the key heavy metals which have a significant influence on the individual components of the natural environment. A glasshouse pot experiment was designed to evaluate the potential use of different amendments as immobilizing agents in the aided phytostabilization of Pb-contaminated soil, using Lolium perenne L The research aimed to determine the influence of Pb in doses of 0, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of soil, as well as diatomite, chalcedonite, dolomite, limestone, and activated carbon amendments on the content of trace elements in the above-ground parts and roots of L. perenne. The study utilised analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA). The content of trace elements in plants, pseudo-total and extracted by 0.01 M CaCl2, were determined using the method of spectrophotometry. All of the investigated element contents in the tested parts of L perenne were significantly different in the case of applying reactive amendments to the soil, as well as increasing concentrations of Pb. The greatest average above-ground biomass was observed when diatomite and chalcedonite were amended into the soil. Activated carbon, limestone and chalcedonite caused significant increases of Pb concentrations in the roots. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study presents results from one of the best-documented long-term monitoring projects in Poland, based on three periods of electrofishing: 1986-88 (TI),1996-98 (T2) and 2011-12 (T3). After decades of severe point-source pollution, water quality has been improving since the early 1990s. However, the recovery of fish assemblages was recorded with a considerable delay, i.e. not in T2 but in T3. Species richness in T3 increased by >= 50% in relation to T2. The recovery process proceeded at a different pace in the upper (section X), middle (section Y) and lower (section Z) river courses. The good status recorded in X in T3 was qualitatively different from the good status observed in TI as migratory and/or lithophilic species were less common. Section X, with relatively clean tributaries, was isolated from the rest of the Warta system by the Jeziorsko Reservoir constructed between X and Y in 1986 (without fish passage). Ichthyofauna in Y was not only in the poorest condition but was also recovering very slowly because of migration barriers and polluted tributaries, resulting in a severe shortage of sources of recolonizers. The quickest positive changes were recorded in Z because of the beneficial role played by certain less degraded tributaries and the direct connection to the recipient Odra River. Significant increases in biomass were recorded in Z for both limnophilic and rheophilic species; the former may be linked to zones of stagnant water existing between groynes and the latter to fast-flowing water near groyne heads.

Life Cycle Assessment of a Commercial-Scale Freshwater Aquaponic System	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Life cycle assessment was used to evaluate environmental impacts of simultaneous fish and plant production through the aquaculture practice of aquaponics. In aquaponics, hydroponic plant production replaces the conventional water treatment processes of microbial nitrification and water exchanges required in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) to maintain water quality. The system expansion method was used to assess potential avoided burdens from coproduction of recovered solids, plant production, and water treatment. Results indicated that electricity and feed were the main contributing factors to environmental impact. Impact assessment results were highly sensitive to changes in electricity inputs, suggesting that a small reduction in electricity could contribute to a correspondingly large change in the environmental impact. Avoided burdens associated with coproducts contributed to a moderate reduction in environmental impact compared to reducing total electricity inputs or sourcing electricity from renewable sources. Of the coproducts considered, avoided water treatment contributed greatest to reductions in environmental impact due to reductions in energy use, water use, and eutrophication potential. The large reduction in water use suggests that plant production can contribute to increased recirculation rates and further reduce water inputs associated with aquaculture. Aquaponics, similar to other RASs, essentially eliminates local ecological impacts at the cost of high energy use and the addition of industrial fish feeds. Development of sustainable land-based aquaculture will encompass many production systems, including aquaponics; however, all systems will benefit from improved energy efficiency, increased accessibility to renewable energy sources, and development of sustainable fish feeds.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				MAY	2017	34	5					299	311		10.1089/ees.2015.0510								WOS:000400894800001						
J	Alonso, A; Figueroa, R; Castro-Diez, P				Alonso, Alvaro; Figueroa, Ricardo; Castro-Diez, Pilar			Pollution Assessment of the Biobio River (Chile): Prioritization of Substances of Concern Under an Ecotoxicological Approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The water demand for human activities is rapidly increasing in developing countries. Under these circumstances, preserving aquatic ecosystems should be a priority which requires the development of quality criteria. In this study we perform a preliminary prioritization of the risky substances based on reported ecotoxicological studies and guidelines for the Biobio watershed (Central Chile). Our specific aims are (1) reviewing the scientific information on the aquatic pollution of this watershed, (2) determining the presence and concentration of potential toxic substances in water, sediment and effluents, (3) searching for quality criteria developed by other countries for the selected substances and (4) prioritizing the most risky substances by means of deterministic ecotoxicological risk assessment. We found that paper and mill industries were the main sources of point pollution, while forestry and agriculture were mostly responsible for non-point pollution. The most risky organic substances in the water column were pentachlorophenol and heptachlor, while the most relevant inorganic ones were aluminum, copper, unionized ammonia and mercury. The most risky organic and inorganic substances in the sediment were phenanthrene and mercury, respectively. Our review highlights that an important effort has been done to monitor pollution in the Biobio watershed. However there are emerging pollutants and banned compounds-especially in sediments-that require to be monitored. We suggest that site-specific water quality criteria and sediment quality criteria should be developed for the Biobio watershed, considering the toxicity of mixtures of chemicals to endemic species, and the high natural background level of aluminum in the Biobio.

Both global production of chemicals and global water withdrawal grow faster than human population. This implies increased chemical threats to water, and creates a strong driver for mitigation to protect human health, ecosystem integrity and ecosystem services. Here we connect the perspectives of the water cycle and the chemical life cycle and review possible mitigation options. We categorize mitigation options in various stages of the chemicals' life cycle, taking various sectors and environmental pathways into account. More technologically oriented versus other types of mitigation options are discerned, and their relevance on spatial and temporal scale is discussed. We review various water treatment techniques in relation to physical-chemical properties of chemicals. Finally we discuss how a mitigation database can be used to assess the effectiveness of interventions, by coupling them to regional or global hydrological models. A solution-focused and systems-oriented perspective combined with a mitigation database offers a common perspective amongst actors on the effects for water quality of possible mitigation options throughout the chemical's life cycle, in various sectors and at various places in the water system. This can stimulate coherent implementation of effective mitigation options, cross-sectoral learning and further innovations to improve water quality.				van Wezel, Annemarie/N-9758-2013	van Wezel, Annemarie/0000-0002-6875-957X; Posthuma, Leo/0000-0003-0399-5499												2053-1400	2053-1419				MAY 1	2017	3	3					403	414		10.1039/c7ew00077d								WOS:000400932400003

To address this limitation, this study provides a new transient-state operation mode for an MFC sensor, which is proved applicable for three kinds of detections with higher sensitivity. Under the transient-state mode, the sensitivity increases by 50% to 247% when testing organic matter, acidic toxicants and heavy metals, compared to that of an MFC sensor in conventional constant external resistance connected mode. The mechanism for the improvement is analyzed both experimentally and with an equivalent circuit model. To obtain a higher sensitivity, the output signal of Uon (connected to the external resistance) is more adapted for organic matter monitoring with a wider range, while the output signal of Uoff (disconnected to the external resistance) is better for toxicity monitoring.

Water quality and filter performance of nutrient-, oxidant- and media-enhanced drinking water biofilters	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Nutrient, oxidant and media enhancement strategies were applied to pilot-scale biofilters with the objective of enhancing biodegradation to improve effluent water quality (e.g., TOC, DOC, SUVA, THMfp, HAAfp) and filter performance (e.g., effluent turbidity and head loss). While some statistically significant (alpha = 0.05) differences in DOC removal and DBPfp were identified as a result of specific enhancement strategies, enhancement strategies did not result in improvements in water quality (as measured by TOC, DOC, SUVA and DBPfp) that could be considered of practical operational importance. Water quality improvements were either operationally inconsistent, small in magnitude and/or within the deviation that would be expected from the biofilters when operated under equivalent ambient (i.e., not enhanced) conditions. With respect to filter performance, enhancement strategies also occasionally resulted in a statistically significant difference in effluent turbidity and head loss. However, when identified, statistically significant mean differences in effluent turbidity were deemed not meaningful given the instrument accuracy (i.e., perpendicular to 0.02 NTU), the relatively small magnitude of the mean differences, or the magnitude of the mean difference observed between biofilters operated under equivalent ambient conditions. With respect to head loss, statistically significant mean differences in head loss that were also considered meaningful given the magnitude of the deviation between ambient biofilters and the accuracy of the pressure transmitters, were largely consistent with the literature; however, the magnitude of the mean differences that showed improvement to head loss were small (10-18 cm), and likely would not be sufficient to substantially extended filter run times to have any practical operational importance.

J	Olyaie, E; Abyaneh, HZ; Mehr, AD				Olyaie, Ehsan; Abyaneh, Hamid Zare; Mehr, Ali Danandeh			A comparative analysis among computational intelligence techniques for dissolved oxygen prediction in Delaware River	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												Most of the water quality models previously developed and used in dissolved oxygen (DO) prediction are complex. Moreover, reliable data available to develop/calibrate new DO models is scarce. Therefore, there is a need to study and develop models that can handle easily measurable parameters of a particular site, even with short length. In recent decades, computational intelligence techniques, as effective approaches for predicting complicated and significant indicator of the state of aquatic ecosystems such as DO, have created a great change in predictions. In this study, three different AI methods comprising: (1) two types of artificial neural networks (ANN) namely multi linear perceptron (MLP) and radial based function (RBF); (2) an advancement of genetic programming namely linear genetic programming (LGP); and (3) a support vector machine (SVM) technique were used for DO prediction in Delaware River located at Trenton, USA. For evaluating the performance of the proposed models, root mean square error (RMSE), Nashe-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS), mean absolute relative error (MARE) and, correlation coefficient statistics (R) were used to choose the best predictive model. The comparison of estimation accuracies of various intelligence models illustrated that the SVM was able to develop the most accurate model in DO estimation in comparison to other models. Also, it was found that the LGP model performs better than the both ANNs models. For example, the determination coefficient was 0.99 for the best SVM model, while it was 0.96, 0.91 and 0.81 for the best LGP, MLP and RBF models, respectively. In general, the results indicated that an SVM model could be employed satisfactorily in DO estimation. (C) 2016, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

Trophic transfer of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems: Identifying critical research needs	INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT												To evaluate the process of trophic transfer of microplastics, it is important to consider various abiotic and biotic factors involved in their ingestion, egestion, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification. Toward this end, a review of the literature on microplastics has been conducted to identify factors influencing their uptake and absorption; their residence times in organisms and bioaccumulation; the physical effects of their aggregation in gastrointestinal tracts; and their potential to act as vectors for the transfer of other contaminants. Limited field evidence from higher trophic level organisms in a variety of habitats suggests that trophic transfer of microplastics may be a common phenomenon and occurs concurrently with direct ingestion. Critical research needs include standardizing methods of field characterization of microplastics, quantifying uptake and depuration rates in organisms at different trophic levels, quantifying the influence that microplastics have on the uptake and/or depuration of environmental contaminants among different trophic levels, and investigating the potential for biomagnification of microplastic-associated chemicals. More integrated approaches involving computational modeling are required to fully assess trophic transfer of microplastics. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017;13:505-509.

Application of denitrifying wood chip bioreactors for management of residential non-point sources of nitrogen	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Two important and large non-point sources of nitrogen in residential areas that adversely affect water quality are stormwater runoff and effluent from on-site treatment systems. These sources are challenging to control due to their variable flow rates and nitrogen concentrations. Denitrifying bioreactors that employ a lignocellulosic wood chip medium contained within a saturated (anoxic) zone are relatively new technology that can be implemented at the local level to manage residential non-point nitrogen sources. In these systems, wood chips serve as a microbial biofilm support and provide a constant source of organic substrate required for denitrification. Denitrifying wood chip bioreactors for stormwater management include biofilters and bioretention systems modified to include an internal water storage zone; for on-site wastewater, they include upflow packed bed reactors, permeable reactive barriers, and submerged wetlands. Laboratory studies have shown that these bioreactors can achieve nitrate removal efficiencies as high as 80-100% but could provide more fundamental insight into system design and performance. For example, the type and size of the wood chips, hydraulic loading rate, and dormant period between water applications affects the hydrolysis rate of the lignocellulosic substrate, which in turn affects the amount and bioavailability of dissolved organic carbon for denitrification. Additional field studies can provide a better understanding of the effect of varying environmental conditions such as ambient temperature, precipitation rates, household water use rates, and idle periods on nitrogen removal performance. Long-term studies are also essential for understanding operations and maintenance requirements and validating mathematical models that integrate the complex physical, chemical, and biological processes occurring in these systems. Better modeling tools could assist in optimizing denitrifying wood chip bioreactors to meet nutrient reduction goals in urban and suburban watersheds.

Variable rate nitrogen management in corn: Response in two crop rotations	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Decision-making criteria to accurately predict nitrogen (N) rates in corn (Zea mays L.) would greatly benefit canopy sensor-guided variable rate N (VRN) management with positive implications for water quality. The objectives of this study were to measure corn yield response to VRN applied at the midvegetative corn growth stage and compare yield and agronomic efficiency (AE) between a one-time spring-N application (preplant or early sidedress) and two VRN management strategies, split-N (VRNS) and rescue-N (VRNR). Field sites located across Iowa received spring-N fertilizer at six application rates, with additional N potentially applied with each VRN spring-N rate and for the VRNS and VRNR strategies at the V10 growth stage based on canopy sensing. Drought conditions were evident during 2012 and 2013 in Iowa, which resulted in reduced corn yield and requirement for N fertilizer at many site-years. The VRN with 0 and 56 kg N ha-1 (50 lb N ac-1) applied in the spring was most closely aligned with calculated economic optimum N rate and AE. The VRNS and VRNR strategies applied more N than was needed, compared to spring-N only. Canopy sensors did not detect adequate to excess N, and therefore N applied prior to VRN application should be part of sensing-based algorithm criteria. Mean corn yield with the soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.)-corn rotation was not maintained with VRN when no spring-N was applied. Yield comparison showed no differences between spring-N, VRNS, and VRNR for both rotations. However, the greatest AE was achieved with spring-N and the VRNS strategy in the soybean-corn rotation. Weather events that occur during and after canopy sensing and VRN application remain an important factor for successful corn yield response to N rate and timing, and should be considered with canopy sensor VRN. Results from this study provide feedback on how to translate remote sensing data into VRN management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2017	72	3					183	190		10.2489/jswc.72.3.183								WOS:000400389700005

Cost-effectiveness of reverse auctions for watershed nutrient reductions in the presence of climate variability: An empirical approach for the Boone River watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that changes in climate patterns (higher temperatures, changes in extreme precipitation events, and higher level of humidity) will adversely impact water quality. Given the implications of climate change on water and soil quality, it is important for watershed managers, stakeholders, and policymakers to understand not only the effectiveness of different conservation practices in improving water quality, but also the cost-effectiveness of a watershed-level policy program designed for implementing conservation practices. A system of points measuring the efficiency of five conservation practices in reducing nutrient (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) runoff are estimated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in this study for the Boone River watershed (BRW) in north central Iowa. The points can be interpreted as indices of the environmental benefits associated with each conservation practice. Among the various market instruments proposed as resource and cost-revelation mechanisms, competitive biddings, also referred to as "reverse auctions" or procurement auctions, have come to the attention of researchers and policymakers. Competitive bidding mechanisms induce landowners to submit bids close to their opportunity costs, thus increasing the budgetary cost-effectiveness and revealing the true costs of adopting different conservation practices. This study considers the cost efficiency of reverse auction programs designed for improving water quality in the BRW, where the bids are constructed using the system of points.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2017	72	3					280	295		10.2489/jswc.72.3.280								WOS:000400389700015

We find that mothers breast-feed children longer in response to the campaign, especially when they have less access to uncontaminated wells, and that infants are more likely to be exclusively breast-fed.

In aquatic systems, the application of atmospheric correction aims to minimize such effects and avoid the under or overestimation of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). Accurately R-rs provides better information about the state of aquatic system, it means, establishing the concentration of aquatic compounds more precisely. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outputs from several atmospheric correction methods (Dark Object Subtraction DOS; Quick Atmospheric Correction - QUAC; Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes - FLAASH; Atmospheric Correction for OLI 'lite' - ACOLITE, and Provisional Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance Algorithm - L8SR) in order to investigate the suitability of R-rs for estimating total suspended matter concentrations (TSM) in the Barra Bonita Hydroelectrical Reservoir. To establish TSM concentrations via atmospherically corrected Operational Land Imager (OLI) scene, the TSM retrieval model was calibrated and validated with in situ data. Thereby, the achieved results from TSM retrieval model application demonstrated that L8SR is able to provide the most suitable R-rs values for green and red spectral bands, and consequently, the lowest TSM retrieval errors (Mean Absolute Percentage Error about 10% and 12%, respectively). Retrieved R-rs from near infrared band is still a challenge for all the tested algorithms. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

L.			Review: Drinking water for liquid-fed pigs	ANIMAL												Liquid feeding has the potential to provide pigs with sufficient water to remain hydrated and prevent prolonged thirst. However, lack of permanent access to fresh water prevents animals from drinking when they are thirsty. Moreover, individual differences between pigs in a pen may result in uneven distribution of the water provided by the liquid feed, leading to some pigs being unable to meet their water requirements. In this review, we look at the need for and provision of water for liquid-fed pigs in terms of their production performance, behaviour, health and welfare. We highlight factors which may lead to water ingestion above or below requirements. Increases in the need for water may be caused by numerous factors such as morbidity, ambient temperature or competition within the social group, emphasising the necessity of permanent access to water as also prescribed in EU legislation. The drinkers can be the target of redirected behaviour in response to feed restriction or in the absence of rooting materials, thereby generating water losses. The method of water provision and drinker design is critical to ensure easy access to water regardless of the pig's physiological state, and to limit the amount of water used, which does not benefit the pig.

Identification of blind geothermal resources in Surprise Valley, CA, using publicly available groundwater well water quality data	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Geothermal resource exploration is generally limited to areas with surface expressions of thermal activity (fumaroles and hot springs), or relies on expensive geophysical exploration techniques. In this study, the hidden subsurface distribution of geothermal fluids has been identified using a free and publicly available water quality dataset from agricultural and domestic water wells in Surprise Valley, northeastern California. Thermally evolved waters in Surprise Valley have element ratios that vary in response to Ca carbonate and Mg silicate mineral precipitation, and have elevated total dissolved solids (TDS). The arid climate in Surprise Valley leads to surface water evaporation in a closed basin, producing high TDS Na-Cl-CO3-SO4 brines in three ephemeral alkali lakes and in shallow groundwater under elevated soil CO2 conditions. Evaporated fluids in Surprise Valley follow a chemical divide that leads to Ca carbonate and Mg silicate mineral precipitation. Plots of dissolved element ratios can be used to distinguish groundwater affected by evaporation from water affected by thermal water-rock interaction, however it is challenging to select components for plotting that best illustrate different fluid evolution mechanisms. Here, we use a principal component analysis of centered log-ratio transformed data, coupled with geochemical models of fluid evaporation and thermal mixing pathways, to identify components to plot that distinguish between groundwater samples influenced by evaporation from those influenced by thermal processes. We find that groundwater samples with a thermal signature come from wells that define a coherent, linear geographical distribution that closely matches the location of known and inferred faults. Modification of the general approach employed here provides promise for identifying blind geothermal resources in other locations, by applying low-cost geochemical modeling and statistical techniques to areas where large groundwater quality geochemical datasets are available.

The present study evaluates for the first time the long-term performance of enhanced-ZVI to remove natural organic matter (NOM), an important water quality parameter in drinking water. Lab-scale flow-through experiments showed that averagely 7-14% dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 6-15% ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) reduction could be achieved by enhanced-ZVI in the first 10,000 bed volumes filtration when a 036 or 1.8 mins empty bed contact time (EBCT) was applied. After 10,000-bed volumes, the enhanced-ZVI bed became passivated. However, sulphuric acid was able to regenerate the passivated enhanced-ZVI bed, recover the capacity of enhanced-ZVI in removing NOM, and hence make the best use of the available ZVI. The acidic rinsing solution containing dissolved iron was suitable as a supplemental source of iron for coagulation. In addition, during the long-term experiments, the biofilters following enhanced-ZVI (1.8 min EBCT) removed more NOM than biofilters without any pre-treatment. This could be explained by the formation of biodegradable organic matter (BDOC) during the enhanced-ZVI process and the precipitation of iron in the biofilters. Based on these findings, a novel water treatment train, incorporating enhanced-ZVI with periodical regeneration, biofiltration, and coagulation, was proposed and evaluated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This keeps the advantages of an automatic irrigation system but avoiding their operational complexity. In the FEADM 's first stage, the Fuzzy Analytical Process weigh five fuzzified environmental inputs used as assessment criteria. These criteria are used by a selective assessment stage, where only the relevant criteria for each alternative are assessed. As result, the best assessments of each alternative and the best assessed alternative are obtained. In the second stage, an output membership function is assigned to every alternative for its forward aggregation and defuzzification. This process reaches a soil moisture estimate. Unlike other models, FEADM allows estimating a quantitative value from a decision making process. Furthermore, its computational cost is lower than conventional fuzzy estimation models due to the selective assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study focused on the influence of the fungus-growing termite species, Hypotermes obscuriceps, on soil properties in Southern India. This species produces soil sheetings and mounds on the ground. In contrast to other termite species, such as those belonging to the Macrotermes and Odontotermes genera, which produce mounds to live in, H. obscuriceps excavates soil above ground for constructing its chambers below ground. Using a captive colony of H. obscuriceps growing up in control conditions, we measured the soil properties (carbon content, particle size distribution, pH, electrical conductivity and concentration in soluble anions and cations) of its mound and of the sheetings it produced over the leaves of Acacia auriculiformis and on the branches of Ipomoea carnea and Lantana camara. The physical and chemical properties of H. obscuriceps mounds were very similar to those of the surrounding soil and even if rain erodes these mounds in the field, it is likely to have only a small effect on the resulting run-off water quality. In contrast, sheetings have higher clay and C contents than the surrounding soil. Their degradation by rain is likely to be associated with soil detachment and F-, Cl- and K+ export in water runoff and/or leachate. In conclusion, this study shows that this species impacts soil properties more through the construction of sheetings than mounds. This difference is explained by the ecological needs of termites. While H. obscuriceps is not dependent on soil mound properties for survival, soil sheetings' properties are essential for providing them a protective cover.

Solute transport modelling for assessing the duration of river flow to improve the groundwater quality in an intensively irrigated deltaic region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Groundwater modelling is an important management tool to study the behaviour of aquifer system under various hydrological stresses. Present study was carried out in deltaic regions of the Cauvery river, with an objective of estimating the minimum river flow required to improve the groundwater quality by numerical modelling. Cauvery river delta is the most productive agricultural plains of south India, but the agricultural activities during the last few decades have decreased due to limited flow in the river and increasing concentration of solutes in groundwater in the eastern parts. In order to understand the causes for increasing concentration, a three-layered finite-difference flow model was formulated to simulate the groundwater head and solute transport. The model was used to simulate the groundwater flow and solute transport for 5 years from July 2007 to June 2012. There was a fairly good agreement between the computed and observed groundwater heads. The chloride and nitrate ions were considered for solute transport modelling. Observed and simulated temporal variation in chloride and nitrate concentrations were comparable. The simulated solute concentrations from July 2007 to June 2012 showed an accumulation of solutes in groundwater of coastal part of the study area. The model was used to find the flow to be maintained in the river and rainfall recharge required to flush the ions into the sea. This can be achieved by maintaining minimal flow in the river and through regulation of fertilizer use as well as by creating awareness of sustainable use of groundwater in this area.

Seawater at elevated temperature (after MSF heat-exchangers) was used as a feed in this process. The pretreatment system was represented as a set of functionally-linked technological segments such as: UF filtration, backwashing, chemical-enhanced backwashing, cleaning, waste disposal, etc. The process represents the sequences of operating cycles. The cycle, in turn, consists of the following unit operations: filtration, backwashing and chemical-enhanced backwashing (CEB). Quantitative assessment was based on the following indicators: normalized permeability, transmembrane pressure, specific energy and water consumption, specific waste generation. UF pre-treatment is accompanied by the following waste streams: W1= 1.19x10 power of -2 m(3) (disposed NaOCl with 0.0044% wt.)/m(3) (filtrate); W2= 5.95x10 power of -3 m(3) (disposed H2SO4 with 0.052% wt.)/m 3 (filtrate); W3= 7.26x10 power of -2 m(3) (disposed sea water)/m(3) (filtrate). Specific energy consumption is 1.11x10 power of -1 kWh/m(3) (filtrate). The indicators evaluated over the cycles with conventional (non-chemical) backwashing were compared with the cycles accompanied by CEB. A positive impact of CEB on performance indicators was demonstrated namely: normalized UF resistance remains unchanged within the regime accompanied by CEB, whereas the lack of CEB results in 30% of its growth. Those quantitative indicators can be incorporated into the target function for solving different optimization problems. They can be used in the software for optimisation of operating regimes or in the synthesis of optimal flow-diagram. The cycle characteristics, process parameters and water quality data are attached.																	2005-8624	2092-7037				MAY	2017	8	3					279	292		10.12989/mwt.2017.8.3.279								WOS:000399419100005						
J	Mahoney, PC; Bishop, MJ				Mahoney, P. C.; Bishop, M. J.			Assessing risk of estuarine ecosystem collapse	OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT												Estuarine ecosystems are increasingly threatened by coastal development and climate change. The large number of estuaries globally necessitates risk assessment to prioritise conservation efforts. Schemes for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse have been designed around terrestrial ecosystems, often defined by a single characteristic vegetation type, with their applicability to estuaries unclear. Here we consider the causes and symptoms of estuarine ecosystem collapse and assess, using a case study of the Chesapeake Bay, the applicability of ecosystem-level risk assessments to estuarine ecosystems, typified by mosaics of habitats. Functional estuaries are characterised by habitat heterogeneity and connectivity, maintenance of constituent habitats through recruitment, and a complex trophic structure including apex predators. Additionally, primary production and biomass are dominated by benthic, as opposed to pelagic, species. Hence, homogenisation of habitat types, decreased connectivity, recruitment failure, loss of apex predators and a decreased ratio of benthic to pelagic biomass may be symptoms of a trajectory towards collapse. In terrestrial ecosystems, criteria used for assessing risk of ecosystem collapse include declining or restricted distribution of ecosystems, degradation of the abiotic environment, changes in species composition and declining ecological function. As the boundaries of estuaries are typically defined by topography, rarely do significant changes in the area of the ecosystem occur. Furthermore, because the extent of estuaries is typically small, assessments based on area of occupancy may over-inflate risk. Instead, criteria based on abiotic and biotic changes, many of which are documented through monitoring programs, may be most useful for risk assessments of estuarine ecosystems.

We investigated how average environmental niche breadths (climate, water quality and climate-water quality niches) in aquatic macrophyte communities are related to ecological gradients (latitude, longitude, altitude, species richness and lake area) among four distinct regions (Finland, Sweden and US states of Minnesota and Wisconsin) on two continents. We found that correlations between the three different measures of average niche breadths and ecological gradients varied considerably among the study regions, with average climate and average water quality niche breadth models often showing opposite trends. However, consistent patterns were also found, such as widening of average climate niche breadths and narrowing of average water quality niche breadths of aquatic macrophytes along increasing latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. This result suggests that macrophyte species are generalists in relation to temperature variations at higher latitudes and altitudes, whereas species in southern, lowland lakes are more specialised. In contrast, aquatic macrophytes growing in more southern nutrient-rich lakes were generalists in relation to water quality, while specialist species are adapted to low-productivity conditions and are found in highland lakes. Our results emphasise that species niche breadths should not be studied using only coarse-scale data of species distributions and corresponding environmental conditions, but that investigations on different kinds of niche breadths (e.g., climate vs. local niches) also require finer resolution data at broad spatial extents.

However, the comprehensive understanding of urban environmental change in China based on multi-source remote sensing data remains inadequate because current studies have mainly focused on a single aspect of the urban environment using a specific source of remote sensing data. In this study, we developed a comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) combining the remote sensing data of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration, land surface temperature (1ST) and vegetation cover (VC) to assess the urban environmental change in China at the national scale, among urban agglomerations and across the rapidly urbanized regions. We found a trend of environmental degradation in the urban areas of China between 2000 and 2012. Environmentally degraded and moderately degraded urban areas accounted for 48.14% of the total urban area in China. In particular, the expanded urban areas exhibited the most extensive environmental degradation, with 52.33% of the total expanded urban areas from 1992 to 2012 exhibiting environmental degradation or moderately environmental degradation. The increase in the PM2.5 concentration was one of the main manifestations of the environmental degradation in the expanded urban areas. We suggest that more attention should be paid to urban environmental issues during future urban development in China. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J	Nzohabonayo, E; Kassam, D; Kang'ombe, J				Nzohabonayo, Elysee; Kassam, Daud; Kang'ombe, Jeremiah			Effect of lipid levels on reproductive performance of Oreochromis karongae	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												A study was conducted at Bunda Fish Farm to evaluate the effects of dietary lipid levels on reproductive performance of Oreochromis karongae. Fish were reared in 12 hapas for 86days, with four experimental diets containing 8.28%, 10.17%, 12.09% and 14.05% levels of lipid, replicated three times. At the end of the experiment, O.karongae fed 10.17% and 12.09% lipid had the highest absolute fecundity (237.5 +/- 6.50 and 271.3 +/- 26.19, respectively) as compared with fish fed on 8.28% and 14.05% lipid levels (90.3 +/- 46.3 and 143.7 +/- 30.8 respectively). Higher number of spawns (5) were observed in fish fed on diets containing crude lipid of 10.17%. We can assume also that diets of 10.17% lipid are not costly as those of 12.09% or 14.05% lipid. It was found that the size of eggs depended on the number of eggs spawned by the female fish, as the number of eggs increased, the weight of eggs and mean egg diameter decreased. There were no significant differences (P>0.05) among treatments in terms of relative fecundity. Based on these findings, it is recommended that diets containing crude lipid of 10% should be fed to broodstock for optimum reproductive performance of O.karongae.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAY	2017	48	5					1998	2003		10.1111/are.13258								WOS:000398859900002

Two-hundred and twenty-five fish were randomly distributed into five treatments, each with three replicates and fed four isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets with graded levels of pyridoxine for 45days. Endosulfan concentration in the water was maintained at sublethal level of 1/40th of 96h LC50 (0.52ppb). Dietary pyridoxine supplementation significantly enhanced growth performance viz. weight gain (%), specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio and protein efficiency ratio of fish compared to control diet fed group. The results of this experiment revealed that the activities of digestive and metabolic enzymes were significantly improved after feeding with dietary pyridoxine supplementation in C.chanos. Significantly increased muscle and brain ascorbic acid content was observed in fish fed diets containing pyridoxine. Histological studies on liver of fish fed pyridoxine-supplemented diet showed the normal architecture of hepatocytes compared to non-pyridoxine fed group. The results obtained in this study revealed that the inclusion of pyridoxine in diet has a protective effect against endosulfan induced stress in C.chanos fingerlings through metabolic enzyme activities and vitamin C content. This study has a potential in ameliorating the toxic effect of endosulfan induced stress using dietary supplementation of pyridoxine.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAY	2017	48	5					2074	2087		10.1111/are.13042								WOS:000398859900010

Two concentrations of sucrose (0 and 75%) were added daily to the P.monodon culture systems (2.94 +/- 0.11g), which were conducted indoors in fibre-glass tanks (500L). Results showed that the final body weight and weight gain of the adding 75% sucrose group were significantly higher (P<0.05) than that of the control, as well as significantly (P<0.05) improved specific growth rates and survival rates, and reduced feed coefficient. Adding 75% sucrose promoted heterotrophic bacteria, Bacillus and phytoplankton reproduction, and significantly (P<0.05) reduced the concentration of ammonia-N (NH4-N), nitrite-N (NO2-N) and nitrate-N (NO3-N). The changes of water quality indicators in the two groups showed the similar trend at the end of the experiment, and the ammonia-N, nitrite-N, nitrate-N and phosphate-P concentrations in the 75% sucrose group were significantly (P<0.05) lower than those of the control group, Chlorophyll-a concentrations peaked at 389.12g/L in the biofloc sucrose group at 18:00h, and heterotrophic bacteria peaked 8h after sucrose was added. The addition of sucrose also reduced the pH of the water. Our research showed that adding sucrose promoted biofloc formation and shortened the formation time; increased the number of heterotrophic bacteria and algae which might play a role in improving water quality by assimilating ammonia-N and other harmful substances in the water; supplemented food for P monodon growth; and reduced the feed coefficient.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAY	2017	48	5					2316	2327		10.1111/are.13067								WOS:000398859900031

Effect of support medium, hydraulic loading rate and plant density on water quality and growth of halophytes in marine aquaponic systems	AQUACULTURE RESEARCH												The development of marine intensive land-based aquaculture systems has been limited due to the absence of methods to manage saline wastewater. Aquaponic systems, although commonly applied to freshwater aquaculture, can potentially manage nutrient wastes while providing a secondary product. The aim of this study was to evaluate both the capacity for water treatment and the production requirements of two saltwater-tolerant plant species (Sesuvium portulacastrum and Batis maritima) when grown hydroponically in a marine aquaponic system. The presence of plants was found to significantly contribute to nitrate removal, such that mean nitrate concentrations were 10.1 +/- 5.4 and 12.1 +/- 6.1mg/L NO3--N in planted and unplanted treatments respectively. The use of coconut fibre as a planting medium also significantly contributed to nitrate removal, such that mean nitrate concentrations were 9.78 +/- 5.4 and 12.4 +/- 6.0mg/L NO3--N in coconut fibre and expanded clay treatments respectively. Daily nitrogen removal was greatest in the coconut fibre/plants treatment, ranging from -18% to 67%. Hydraulic loading rate, plant species and plant density did not significantly affect water quality or plant growth. The low flow/saltwort/low density treatment had the greatest mean daily nitrogen removal, ranging from 25% to 172%. The results indicate that the main nitrogen removal mechanisms were simultaneous nitrification-denitrification in the hydroponic plant beds and nitrogen removal through plant growth. This study demonstrates that marine aquaponics could be an effective way to manage nutrient removal in marine land-based aquaculture systems.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				MAY	2017	48	5					2463	2477		10.1111/are.13083								WOS:000398859900044

We used lead-210 to date riverine sediment core from the Shima River in China. We obtained a sedimentary history of 34 years (1982-2015) for core S2, which had a length of 34 cm. The sedimentation rate of 0.304-2.04 cm y(-1) was controlled by both flood events and anthropogenic activities. The conservative element content depth profiles remained relatively constant, suggestive of a relatively stable sediment provenance; therefore, the increase in the sedimentation rate over time was mainly the result of domestic and industrial wastewater effluent and the construction of a rubber dam at the middle and lower reach of the Shima River. From 1982 to 2015, the nutrient and trace metal depth profiles could be divided in three periods based on their trends. From 1982 to 1993, the vertical profiles of nutrients (organic carbon, total phosphorus, and total nitrogen) and three trace metals (nickel, zinc, and manganese) were relatively stable; however, the gradual decrease in copper and cadmium was likely associated with a reduction in agricultural chemical application. From 1993 to 2003, a population explosion and rapid industrialization were responsible for an increase in the input of pollutants into the Shima River, which was partly attenuated by water from the Dong River, leading to a gradual increase in nutrient and trace metal contents. Finally, from 2003 to 2015, the Shima River stopped being used as a source of water due to its deteriorating water quality. The relatively lower velocity of the water flow after the recovery of its flow direction and the reconstruction of the rubber dam in 2009 provided advantageous sedimentary conditions, promoting nutrient accumulation and significant trace metal enrichment.

They are now frequently detected in aquatic ecosystems at concentrations susceptible to harm aquatic invertebrates at individual and population levels. This study intent was to document surface runoff and subsurface tile drain losses of two common neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) compared to those of companion herbicides (atrazine, glyphosate, S-metolachlor and mesotrione) at the edge of a 22.5-ha field under a corn-soybean rotation. A total of 14 surface runoff and tile drain discharge events were sampled over two years. Events and annual unit mass losses were computed using flow-weighted concentrations and total surface runoff and tile drain flow volumes. Detection frequencies close to 100% in edge-of-field surface runoff and tile drain water samples were observed for thiamethoxam and clothianidin even though only thiamethoxam had been applied in the first year. In 2014, thiamethoxam median concentrations in surface runoff and tile drain samples were respectively 0.46 and 0.16 mu g/L, while respective maximum concentrations of 2.20 and 0.44 mu g/L were measured in surface runoff and tile drain samples during the first post-seeding storm event. For dothianidin, median concentrations in surface runoff and tile drain samples were 0.02 and 0.01 mu g/L, and respective maximum concentrations were 0.07 mu g/L and 0.05 mu g/L. Surface runoff and tile drain discharge were key transport mechanisms with similar contributions of 53 and 47% of measured mass losses, respectively. Even if thiamethoxam was applied at a relatively low rate and had a low mass exportation value (0.3%), the relative toxicity was one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of the other chemicals applied in 2014 and 2015. Companion herbicides, except glyphosate in tile drains, exceeded their water quality guideline during one sampling campaign after application but rapidly resumed below these limits.

However, limited attention has so far been directed towards how plastics are regulated in a life cycle perspective and how regulatory gaps can be addressed in order to limit and prevent environmental exposure and hazards of macro- and microplastics. In this paper, we map European regulation taking outset in the life cycle perspective of plastic carrier bags: from plastic bag production to when it enters the environment. Relevant regulatory frameworks, directives and authorities along the life cycle are identified and their role in regulation of plastics is discussed. Most important regulations were identified as: the EU chemical Regulation, the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive including the amending Directive regarding regulation of the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags, the Waste Framework Directive and the Directive on the Landfill of Waste. The main gaps identified relate to lack of clear definitions of categories of polymers, unambitious recycling rates and lack of consideration of macro- and microplastics in key pieces of legislation. We recommend that polymers are categorized according to whether they are polymers with the same monomer constituents (homopolymers) or with different monomer constituents (copolymers) and that polymers are no longer exempt from registration and evaluation under REACH. Plastics should furthermore have the same high level of monitoring and reporting requirements as hazardous waste involving stricter requirements to labelling, recordkeeping, monitoring and control over the whole lifecycle. Finally, we recommend that more ambitious recycle and recovery targets are set across the EU.

Acute water quality criteria for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pesticides, plastic additives, and 4-Nonylphenol in seawater	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Probabilistic environmental quality criteria for Naphthalene (Nap), Phenanthrene (Phe), Fluoranthene (Flu), Pyrene (Pyr), Triclosan (TCS), Tributyltin (TBT), Chlorpyrifos (CPY), Diuron (DUR), gamma-Hexaclor-ocyclohexane (gamma-HCH), Bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-Nonylphenol (4-NP) were derived from acute toxicity data using saltwater species representative of marine ecosystems, including algae, mollusks, crustaceans, echinoderms and chordates. Preferably, data concerns sublethal endpoints and early life stages from bioassays conducted in our laboratory, but the data set was completed with a broad literature survey. The Water Quality Criteria (WQC) obtained for TBT (7.1.10-(3) mu g L-1) and CPY (6.6.10(-3) mu g L-1) were orders of magnitude lower than those obtained for PAHs (ranging from 3.75 to 45.2 mu g L-1), BPA (27.7 mu g L-1), TCS (8.66 mu g L-1) and 4-NP (1.52 mu g L-1). Critical values for DUR and HCH were 0.1 and 0.057 mu g L-1 respectively. Within this context, non-selective toxicants could be quantitatively defined as those showing a maximum variability in toxicity thresholds (TT) of 3 orders of magnitude across the whole range of marine diversity, and a cumulative distribution of the TT fitting to a single log-logistic curve, while for selective toxicants variability was consistently found to span 5 orders of magnitude and the TT distribution showed a bimodal pattern. For the latter, protective WQC must be derived taking into account the SSD of the sensitive taxa only. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Impacts of climate and land use changes on the water quality of a small Mediterranean catchment with intensive viticulture	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Studies that address the potential effects of climate and land use changes on surface water quality are scarce in the Mediterranean region. In the present work, the impacts of climate and land use changes on nutrient and copper exports from a humid Mediterranean catchment (Sao Lourenco) were evaluated using the SWAT model. SWAT reproduced reasonably well total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (TP) and copper (Cu) exports in Sao Lourenco, providing an adequate baseline scenario as well as a suitable model parameterization for assessing the impacts of climate and land use changes under the A1 B and B1 emission scenarios for the end of the 21st century (2071-2100). Land use changes scenarios were generated along the same storylines as climate change scenarios to assess the combined effects of the two stressors. Climate changes itself led to a decline in annual TN and TP exports under both emission scenarios mostly due to a decrease in runoff and erosion induced by a reduction in rainfall, but it hardly affected Cu exports largely due to its strong immobilization in soils. Land use changes per se resulted in an increase in streamflow, but the changes in water quality varied markedly according to the scenarios. A substantial decrease in TN, TP and Cu exports was observed under scenario A1B, due to a reduction in vineyard areas. Under scenario Bl, however, TP exports decreased much less while TN exports hardly changed, reflecting differences in the preferential transport pathways of these compounds. Cu exports also remained the same, as no changes occurred in the vineyard areas. The combination of climate and land use change scenarios revealed additive impacts on the exports of all three contaminants, emphasizing the importance of integrated approaches to define adaptive land management practices that can ensure the future sustainability of Mediterranean water resources.

Biosolids provide nutrients in the form of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and increases organic matter. It is also an economic way for a country to dispose of its municipal waste. However, biosolids may potentially contain a wide range of pathogens, and following rainfall events, may be transported in surface runoff and pose a potential risk to human health. Thus, a quantitative risk assessment model was developed to estimate potential pathogens in surface water and the environmental fate of the pathogens following dilution, residence time in a stream, die-off rate, drinking water treatment and human exposure. Surface runoff water quality data was provided by project partners. Three types of biosolids, anaerobically digested (AD), lime stabilised (LS), and thermally dried (TD)) were applied on micro plots. Rainfall was simulated at three time intervals (24, 48 and 360 h) following land application. It was assumed that this water entered a nearby stream and was directly abstracted for drinking water. Consumption data for drinking water and body weight was obtained from an Irish study and assigned distributions. Two dose response models for probability of illness were considered for total and faecal coliform exposure incorporating two different exposure scenarios (healthy populations and immuno-compromised populations). The simulated annual risk of illness for healthy populations was below the US EPA and World Health Organisation tolerable level of risk (10(-4) and 10(-6), respectively). However, immuno-compromised populations may still be at risk as levels were greater than the tolerable level of risk for that subpopulation. The sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of residence time in a stream on the bacterial die-off rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, emitter clogging is a persistent and widespread problem in drip irrigation systems when irrigating with saline water. To find a suitable lateral flushing regime for drip irrigation systems using saline groundwater, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of five different lateral flushing frequencies. The lateral flushing frequencies were at 1-, 5-, 10-, 30- and 50-day intervals using saline and fresh groundwater. The total duration of irrigation was 100 days, with a total application of 122 h for each water source. The drip irrigation system consisted of hydrocyclone separator, disc filters and screen filters with inline-labyrinth emitters and thin-wall laterals. The results of this experiment are trusted only at such conditions, and show that emitter discharge and uniformity decreased in all treatments. Flushing laterals every 5 days was adequate to control emitter clogging for drip irrigation systems applying the fresh groundwater, while the other three less flushing frequencies failed to prevent clogging. Emitters in the saline groundwater treatments clogged earlier and more severely than those in the fresh groundwater treatments. Five flushing frequencies under drip irrigation using saline groundwater failed to prevent clogging. Based on the findings above, to better control emitter clogging, freshwater is suggested to be used to flush laterals following irrigation with saline groundwater and longer flushing duration is recommended, which needs further study.																	0342-7188	1432-1319				MAY	2017	35	3					217	225		10.1007/s00271-017-0536-x								WOS:000399689100005

An evaluation of existent methods for estimation of embankment dam breach parameters	NATURAL HAZARDS												The study of dam-break analysis is considered important to predict the peak discharge during dam failure. This is essential to assess economic, social and environmental impacts downstream and to prepare the emergency response plan. Dam breach parameters such as breach width, breach height and breach formation time are the key variables to estimate the peak discharge during dam break. This study presents the evaluation of existing methods for estimation of dam breach parameters. Since all of these methods adopt regression analysis, uncertainty analysis of these methods becomes necessary to assess their performance. Uncertainty was performed using the data of more than 140 case studies of past recorded failures of dams, collected from different sources in the literature. The accuracy of the existing methods was tested, and the values of mean absolute relative error were found to be ranging from 0.39 to 1.05 for dam breach width estimation and from 0.6 to 0.8 for dam failure time estimation. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) was recommended as an alternate method for estimation of dam breach parameters. The ANN method is proposed due to its accurate prediction when it was applied to similar other cases in water resources.																	0921-030X	1573-0840				MAY	2017	87	1					545	566		10.1007/s11069-017-2764-z								WOS:000399699100026

Operating conditions such as feed gas quality and especially cooling conditions are of utmost importance. Cooling of ozone generators is absolutely necessary, since ozone destruction reactions increase exponentially with temperature. The most common way to cool an ozone generator is water flowing in close contact to the electrodes. The heat removal out of the discharge gap depends on different parameters. Electrical input power, cooling water flow conditions, electrode geometry and material properties are some of them. Simultaneously lowering cooling water temperature, applied power density and gap width, leads to a lower gas temperature in the discharge gap and thus to increased ozone production efficiency. Minimizing the temperature difference between the cooling water inlet and outlet improves the ozone production efficiency as well. This measure, however, results in high cooling water flows and requires additional cooling water chilling, resulting in higher operational costs and capital expenses. Cooling associated costs rise disproportionally with increasing cooling water flow. Simultaneously, energy consumption of ozone generators decreases as the average cooling water temperature goes down. As a result, there exists an optimum between the operational and capital expenses for the combination of ozone generator and cooling water system related expenses, offering significant cost savings for the customer.																	0191-9512	1547-6545				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					196	201		10.1080/01919512.2017.1289466								WOS:000399644600006

Currently four of the treatment plants utilize ozone as the primary disinfectant. The Metropolitan ozone contactors are over-under baffled and include 10 chambers, an afterbay, and an effluent channel. Ozone is generally added in either the first countercurrent gas/liquid flow chamber (Chamber 1) or the first and second (co-current gas/liquid flow) chambers. Disinfection credit is received from ozone residuals in Chambers 2 through 6. An ozone destruct system collects and destroys ozone off-gases from Chambers 1 through 9 and an ozone quenching system is used to minimize dissolved ozone from leaving the contactors. Severe drought in California, and resulting water supply limitations, have created significant operational issues ranging from reduced plant flows to source water changes and water quality challenges. The combination of reduced flow and different source water conditions resulted in the ozone systems being operated occasionally under unfamiliar conditions. This article discusses some of the challenges faced in operating the ozone plants at low flows and low ozone production rates. Further, water quality issues required prudent management of operations to meet regulatory requirements. From the lessons learned, several recommendations are offered in preparation for similar conditions in the future.																	0191-9512	1547-6545				MAY-JUN	2017	39	3					202	208		10.1080/01919512.2017.1289467								WOS:000399644600007

Though physically-based hydrodynamic models are the most detailed means to simulate salinity processes, they are commonly restricted by data insufficiency issues both in spatial resolution and temporal lasting. This motivates us to build a statistical model enable simulation and scenario analysis for coastal salinity change with limited observations. A Bayesian neural network (BNN) model is built hereby to simulate salinity. It offers more precise estimation compared with the conventional artificial neural network. Meanwhile, the model gives the uncertainty behaviors of the final salinity simulation which is not available for other methods. Future scenarios of salinity change are constructed and analyzed in different time periods on the basis of the validated BNN model. Results indicate that the water quality over lower Pearl River is degrading along with more significant uncertainties. Further analysis suggests that streamflow alteration has a more direct impact on salinity variations than the sea-level change does. The method allows a profound analysis of the potential influence on water quality degradation in coastal and low-lying regions in support of water management and adaptation toward global climate change.																	1436-3240	1436-3259				MAY	2017	31	4					981	991		10.1007/s00477-017-1399-7								WOS:000399692500010

Interactive Reservoir-Watershed Modeling Framework for Integrated Water Quality Management	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Eutrophication is a serious water pollution problem in many lakes and reservoirs. One method of understanding the causes of eutrophication and devising strategies to address this phenomenon is watershed modeling. An integrated model is developed in this paper for simulating and evaluating the water quality protection strategies of reservoirs based on controlling the upstream point and non-point sources of pollution and also reservoir operation. To achieve this, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is used for modeling of the surface runoff and transportation of pollutant load over the watershed area and then, the numerical model CE-Qual-W2 is used for simulating the reservoir water quality. These models are linked to simulate the transmission and distribution of water quality variables in the Seimare watershed-reservoir system, west part of Iran. After calibration of the models, different strategies for reduction of pollution over the watershed are simulated and ranked based on their efficiency in reducing the pollution load entering into the reservoir. Results show that completion and modernization of the sewage network and wastewater treatment plant of Kermanshah city as long as adopting some measures against the direct release of municipal wastewater into the Gharehsou River can reduce the pollution load by 40-50% as the best short term strategy. It is also found that in the long-term period, watershed management and decreasing local animal husbandry activities are the most effective measure for reducing the nutrient load entering Seimare reservoir, and thus need to be considered in the future watershed management policies and programs.																	0920-4741	1573-1650				MAY	2017	31	7					2105	2125		10.1007/s11269-017-1627-4								WOS:000399306200004

Local and landscape scale determinants of macroinvertebrate assemblages and their conservation value in ponds across an urban land-use gradient	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Urbanisation represents a growing threat to natural communities across the globe. Small aquatic habitats such as ponds are especially vulnerable and are often poorly protected by legislation. Many ponds are threatened by development and pollution from the surrounding landscape, yet their biodiversity and conservation value remain poorly described. Here we report the results of a survey of 30 ponds along an urban land-use gradient in the West Midlands, UK. We outline the environmental conditions of these urban ponds to identify which local and landscape scale environmental variables determine the biodiversity and conservation value of the macroinvertebrate assemblages in the ponds. Cluster analysis identified four groups of ponds with contrasting macroinvertebrate assemblages reflecting differences in macrophyte cover, nutrient status, riparian shading, the nature of the pond edge, surrounding land-use and the availability of other wetland habitats. Pond conservation status varied markedly across the sites. The richest macroinvertebrate assemblages with high conservation value were found in ponds with complex macrophyte stands and floating vegetation with low nutrient concentrations and little surrounding urban land. The most impoverished assemblages were found in highly urban ponds with hard-engineered edges, heavy shading and nutrient rich waters. A random forest classification model revealed that local factors usually had primacy over landscape scale factors in determining pond conservation value, and constitute a priority focus for management.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				MAY	2017	26	5					1065	1086		10.1007/s10531-016-1286-4								WOS:000399235300004

Influence of the Amazon Hydrological Regime on Eutrophication Indicators of a Hydroelectric Power Plant Reservoir	BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Dam constructions in the Amazon have increased exponentially in the last decades, causing several environmental impacts and serious anthropogenic impacts in certain hydroelectric power plant reservoirs in the region have been identified. The assessment of the trophic status of these reservoirs is of interest to indicate man-made changes in the environment, but must take into account the hydrological cycle of the area. This can be relevant for environmental management actions, aiding in the identification of the ecological status of water bodies. In this context, physico-chemical parameters and eutrophication indicators were determined in a hydroelectric power plant reservoir in the Brazilian Amazon to assess trophic variations during the regional hydrological regime phases on the reservoir, namely dry, filling, full and emptying stages. The local hydrological regimes were shown to significantly influence TSS and turbidity, as well as NH4, NO3, PO4, with higher values consistently observed during the filling stage of the reservoir. In addition, differences among the sampling stations regarding land use, population and anthropogenic activities were reflected in the PO4 (3-) values during the different hydrological phases.

Growth rates of all nine species, but especially Lemna gibba, Cladophora and Myriophyllum verticillatum were best in undiluted domestic sewage as opposed to a mixture of domestic sewage. Performance of species to accumulate nutrients was not only species-specific, but was also affected by both sewage treatments. Removal efficiency of nutrients was dependent on both plant species and treatment. Uptake kinetic parameters were significantly affected by both nutrient form and plant species. The maximum uptake rate (Vmax) of NH4-N was higher than NO3-N. Similarly, Km values for NH4-N were greater than NO3-N. These results could be used to identify plants for sewage treatment efficiency and enhance water quality in eco-ditch treatment systems.

At present, few studies have focused on its aquatic living resources and river ecology. In this study, the composition, abundance, and diversity of periphytic protozoa were investigated across four seasons from 2008 to 2009 to better understand their spatio-temporal patterns and relationship to the environment. Our investigation shows that periphytic protozoa in the Niyang River contained 15 genera, belonged to Tubulinea, Alveolata, Discosea and Rhizaria, Alveolata possessed most genera, up to nine, with highest share in abundance, exceeding 50%, Difflugia and Glaucoma were dominant genera. Moreover, four diversity indices of periphytic protozoa, including species richness, total abundance, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou's evenness index, displayed a significant descending trend as the seasons continued, in the order of winter, spring, summer and autumn; with a significant difference existing between winter and summer (or autumn) for Shannon-Wiener diversity index and species richness (P < 0.05). Four of these diversity indices also presented a V-shaped pattern between the upper middle course of the Niyang River and the confluence of the Niyang River and Yarlung Zangbo River, with the lowest value occurred in the middle course of the Niyang River. However, no significant variation was found through the Niyang River (P > 0.05). In addition, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) shows that the densities of Difflugia, Glaucomais, Enchelydium, Cyphoderia, and Enchelys correlate with water temperature, alkalinity, hardness, pH, and dissolved oxygen, respectively. Lastly, the relationship between periphytic protozoa diversity and the environmental factors of the Niyang River can be predicted using classification and regression trees (CART) annalysis, which suggests that the total abundance and Shannon-Wiener diversity index would be higher when the elevation is above 3 308 m. On the other hand, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou's evenness index would be lower when pH and ammoniacal nitrogen have lower or higher values. Finally yet importantly, close attention should be paid to periphytic protozoa and its environment to ensure sustainable development of the Niyang River ecosystem.																	0254-4059	1993-5005				MAY	2017	35	3					489	500		10.1007/s00343-017-5274-7								WOS:000399168400003

Coastal marshes provide flood abatement, carbon and nutrient sequestration, water quality maintenance, and habitat for fish, shellfish, and wildlife, including species of concern, such as the saltmarsh sparrow (Ammodramus caudacutus). We present a climate change adaptation strategy (CCAS) adopted by scientific, management, and policy stakeholders for managing coastal marshes and enhancing system resiliency. A common adaptive management approach previously used for restoration projects was modified to identify climate-related vulnerabilities and plan climate change adaptive actions. As an example of implementation of the CCAS, we describe the stakeholder plans and management actions the US Fish and Wildlife Service and partners developed to build coastal resiliency in the Narrow River Estuary, RI, in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. When possible, an experimental BACI (before-after, control-impact) design, described as pre- and post-sampling at the impact site and one or more control sites, was incorporated into the climate change adaptation and implementation plans. Specific climate change adaptive actions and monitoring plans are described and include shoreline stabilization, restoring marsh drainage, increasing marsh elevation, and enabling upland marsh migration. The CCAS provides a framework and methodology for successfully managing coastal systems faced with deteriorating habitat, accelerated sea level rise, and changes in precipitation and storm patterns.

Changes in shallow-reef community composition along environmental gradients on the East African coast	MARINE BIOLOGY												Abiotic determinants of community composition on shallow reefs are seldom examined at a scale transcending biogeographic regions, and knowledge for the western Indian Ocean is sparse. To address this deficit, turnover in reef community composition was quantified, using gradient forest analyses, along gradients of nine abiotic variables collected in situ or via remote sensing at 54 sites across and within three bioregions: Tropical Western Indian Ocean (Tropical WIO), Delagoa and Natal, spanning 4800 km of east African coastline (5.2-31.1 degrees S). All oceanographic variables differed significantly among bioregions. At a scale across bioregions, wave height declined northwards, while temperature increased. Values for suspended inorganic sediments, chlorophyll-a concentration [chl-a], turbidity and nutrients were all lowest in Delagoa, in association with the scarcity of rivers there. The most novel and unexpected finding was that the northwards decline in wave action was more strongly associated with changes in community composition across bioregions than any other variable. Temperature was the second-most important variable at that scale. Within bioregions, temperature and [chl-a] had strongest relationships with community composition in the Tropical WIO. By contrast, in Delagoa, reef profile, susceptibility to sand inundation and reef heterogeneity were most strongly associated with community composition; and in Natal, depth, turbidity and suspended sediment were foremost. Variables of greatest importance within bioregions distilled to (1) those influencing food/energy supply ([chl-a], turbidity, depth and suspended sediments), which were of particular importance in the Tropical WIO and Natal bioregions, and (2) those altering sand inundation and small-scale current dynamics of reefs (profile, heterogeneity and depth), which were leading factors in the Delagoa Bioregion.																	0025-3162	1432-1793				MAY	2017	164	5							101	10.1007/s00227-017-3130-0								WOS:000399218700005						
J	Hawkins, G				Hawkins, Gay			The impacts of bottled water: an analysis of bottled water markets and their interactions with tap water provision	WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER												The phenomenal recent growth of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottled water is distinctively different from previous bottled mineral water markets that have been around for centuries. Plastic bottled water (hereafter BW) has been marketed as a fast moving consumer good, as a healthy drinking choice and, increasingly, as a safer alternative to existing drinking water. BW markets emerged in response to several key factors: changes in consumer drinking practices; opportunistic strategies on the part of beverage companies to diversify into water; the development of PET bottles; the intensification of sophisticated branding techniques; and various drinking water scares ranging from state failure to water quality controversies. In many cities with safe drinking water BW has faced significant opposition. While this opposition appears to have done little to halt market growth it has prompted a whole new terrain of drinking water politics. These politics foreground the effects of representing and delivering drinking water as an individualized good versus distribution via reticulated networks in which consumers gain access to a collective service. However, activist critiques of BW can sometimes miss the subtle ways in which bottles are ontologically interfering with the political and public health values of safe tap water. These impacts are complex and highly variable according to the specific context of existing drinking water provision and hydrocultures and the ways in which bottles interact with these. Understanding these interactions could help limit the capacity of bottled water markets to undermine the ongoing commitment to safe collective water provision in the interest of the common good.

Prediction tests are completed to predict the water quality associated with the deposition of mining wastes. Static tests can quickly assess the acid-generating potential (AP) and the neutralization potential (NP). Whereas some studies recommend to take into account a mineral reactivity factor for the NP determination, the reactivity rates of acidifying minerals are not considered in the AP calculation. The aim of this study is to bring contribution to the improvement of the static test determination by adding kinetic factors in the AP determination. Eight sulfides (pyrite, Ni-pyrite, pyrrhotite, Ni-pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite, arsenopyrite) and a sulfosalt (gersdorffite) were separately submitted to kinetic tests in modified weathering cells. This test was selected for its rapidity of results and for the low amount of material used, as it is somewhat difficult to obtain pure minerals samples. Five synthetic tailings were composed by mixing pure sulfides in various proportions and submitted to the same kinetic tests. The oxidation rates of synthetic tailings were compared with the weighted combined oxidation rates of individual pure sulfides. The oxidation rates of the synthetic tailings calculated from those of pure sulfides are within the same order of magnitude than those obtained through the kinetic experiments. The AP of synthetic tailings were calculated according to standard equations of the literature and compared with the new method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Singh, UK; Kumar, B				Singh, Umesh Kumar; Kumar, Balwant			Pathways of heavy metals contamination and associated human health risk in Ajay River basin, India	CHEMOSPHERE												The sources of heavy metals and their loads in the Ajay River were investigated based on the seasonal and spatial variations. To identify variation and pathways of heavy metals, seventy-six water samples were estimated for 2 years at nineteen sampling sites. The multifaceted data were applied to evaluate statistical relation between variables and arithmetic calculation of the indices. Fickling plot suggested that the acidic pollutants do not affect the water quality because all samples lie within the neutral pH range. Further, OC showed significant relation with Fe, Mn, Ni and Co. Compositional analysis identified weathering of rocks, mobility of soil and sediment, atmospheric deposition and numerous anthropogenic inputs as major sources of heavy metals. The mean values of heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and pollution index (PI) were found above the critical index and strong loadings respectively due to higher values of Cd, Pb and Fe. Similarly, assessment of human risk revealed that the high load of Cd, Pb and Fe in water body could harm the population. Majority of the samples showed high concentration of heavy metals as compared to regulatory standard and background values, which suggests that the water is highly contaminated through numerous geogenic and anthropogenic sources.

J	Hara, RV; Marin-Morales, MA				Hara, Raquel Vaz; Marin-Morales, Maria Aparecida			In vitro and in vivo investigation of the genotoxic potential of waters from rivers under the influence of a petroleum refinery (Sao Paulo State - Brazil)	CHEMOSPHERE												In recent years concern about the chemical composition of wastewater generated by the oil refining industry has increased, even after its treatment. These wastewaters contain substances that can harm both the entire aquatic ecosystem and the health of any exposed organisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic potentials of the effluent generated by the largest Brazilian petroleum refinery, the effectiveness of the treatments used by the refinery, and whether its effluent can compromise the water quality of the river where it is discarded. Chromosomal aberration and micronucleus assays were performed in Allium cepa and micronucleus test in mammalian cell culture (CHOK1). The samples were collected in three sites at the refinery: one site on the Jaguari River and two sites on the Atibaia Rivers (upstream and downstream of the discharged effluent), under three different climatic conditions. Tests with A. cepa showed increased frequencies of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in meristematic cells for the effluent after physico-chemical treatment, but the samples after treatment biological and stabilization pond presented none of these abnormalities. It was observed that the induced damage in the meristematic cells was not observed in the F-1 cells of A. cepa roots. The micronucleus test performed with mammalian cell culture also indicated that the effluent, after physicochemical treatment, induced a significant increase in micronucleus frequencies. Plant and hamster cells exposed to the other samples collected inside the refinery and in the Jaguari and Atibaia Rivers did not present evidence of genotoxicity and mutagenicity in the tests performed. This study showed that the effluent treated carried out by the refinery (biological treatment followed by a stabilization pond) proved to be efficient for the removal of the toxic load still present after the physico-chemical treatment, since no change in the quality of the Atibaia River was observed. However, because this is an industry with a high production of effluent with toxic potential, its effluents must be constantly monitored, so that there is no compromise of the water quality of the receiving river.

J	Gora, SL; Andrews, SA				Gora, Stephanie L.; Andrews, Susan A.			Adsorption of natural organic matter and disinfection byproduct precursors from surface water onto TiO2 nanoparticles: pH effects, isotherm modelling and implications for using TiO2 for drinking water treatment	CHEMOSPHERE												Titanium dioxide is a photocatalyst that can remove organic contaminants of interest to the drinking water treatment industry, including natural organic matter (NOM) and disinfection byproduct (DBP) precursors. The photocatalytic reaction occurs in two steps: adsorption of the contaminant followed by degradation of the adsorbed contaminant upon irradiation with UV light. The second part of this process can lead to the formation of reactive intermediates and negative impacts on treated water quality, such as increased DBP formation potential (DBPfp). Adsorption alone does not result in the formation of reactive intermediates and thus may prove to be a safe way to incorporate TiO2 into drinking water treatment processes. The goal of this study was to expand on the current understanding of NOM adsorption on TiO2 and examine it in a drinking water context by observing NOM adsorption from real water sources and evaluating the effects of the resulting reductions on the DBPfp of the treated water. Bottle point isotherm tests were conducted with raw water from two Canadian water treatment plants adjusted to pH 4, pH 6 and pH 8 and dosed with TiO2 nanoparticles. The DOC results were a good fit to a modified Freundlich isotherm. DBP precursors and liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection NOM fractions associated with DBP formation were removed to some extent at all pHs, but most effectively at pH 4.

For optimization, the effect of several experimental factors such as concentration of the surfactant, scan rate, pH, accumulation time, number of cycles and supporting electrolytes were investigated. The limits of detection quite lower than the danger level suggested by world health organization (WHO), Environmental protection agency (EPA) and European water quality (EWQ) suggested the suitability of our designed sensor for monitoring metal based water toxins. Theoretical studies carried out for the calculation of interaction energy of CDT with Hg2+ and Cd2+ supported the experimental findings. The validity of the proposed method for real water sample analysis was ensured from reasonable percentage recoveries and less than 4% RSD values. Moreover, the designed sensor demonstrated excellent discrimination ability for the target analytes in the presence of interfering agents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Macrophyte beds in a subtropical reservoir shifted from a nutrient sink to a source after drying then rewetting	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Macrophytes play a key role in assimilating and storing nutrients in shallow aquatic ecosystems, but their capacity to act as a long-term nutrient sink can be affected by water level fluctuations. Water level drawdown in reservoirs followed by rewetting may mobilise a significant nutrient pool. These nutrients can be stored in the littoral zone in dead or dormant macrophytes, and in the desiccated sediments within the macrophyte beds. However, the contribution of desiccated macrophyte beds to nutrient release upon rewetting has not been well quantified. 2. Our study examined the effect of rewetting the previously desiccated waterlily Nymphoides indica (Menyanthaceae) in treatments (1) without sediments (N.i.-Sed), and (2) with sediments in N. indica beds (N.i.+Sed) on water quality. 3. We found that longer drying duration increased dissolved nutrients (nitrate/nitrite, ammonium and total dissolved organic nitrogen/phosphorus) and organic carbon release from N.i.+Sed and N.i.-Sed treatments after rewetting. In the N.i.+Sed treatment with <4 weeks of desiccation, all N. indica plants regenerated from roots after subsequent rewetting. In addition, the resulting nutrient/carbon release was not significantly different to the control treatment which did not have desiccation. A significant increase in dissolved nutrient and carbon concentrations in the water column was found in treatments with more than 10 weeks of desiccation followed by rewetting. This coincided with the sediment reaching its minimum moisture content. Furthermore, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations in the overlying water also increased with more than 10 weeks of desiccation, presumably in response to the increased nutrient availability and the removal of competition for nutrients from macrophytes. 4. On the basis of our laboratory experiments, we calculated the potential effect of desiccated and rewetted N. indica beds on water quality in a local N. indica-dominated reservoir after water level drawdown. We also separated the contribution of N. indica plants from their macrophyte beds on water quality changes. Fourteen days after rewetting, the total dissolved nutrients released from N. indica alone (N.i.-Sed) could contribute 0.5% of the total nitrogen and 29% of total phosphorus to the water column concentrations in the whole reservoir. In contrast, N. indica beds (N.i.+Sed) contributed more total dissolved nitrogen (4.3%) but less total dissolved phosphorus (0.3%) release into the water column. The higher nitrogen release for the N.i.+Sed treatment was likely due to the organic matter decomposition in the sediment in macrophyte beds. In contrast, the less dissolved phosphorus release, compared with the N. indica alone, was likely the result of phosphate adsorption by previously desiccated soil particles and/or assimilation by phytoplankton, since the phytoplankton biomass (as measured by Chl-a concentrations) was significantly higher in the N.i.+Sed treatment. 5. This study highlights the importance of managing both the duration and rate of water level drawdown in reservoirs to prevent rooted macrophytes, like N. indica, from becoming a source of nutrients, which may cause deterioration in water quality.

In-stream nitrate removal capacity may be used as a proxy for the ecosystem service of water quality regulation. It is well known that this natural function is driven by abiotic and biotic factors in running water environments. With regard to biotic drivers, most of the literature focuses on the microbial community influences, but there has been very little emphasis on the relationship with the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Since this community feeds on microbial assemblages (autotrophic and/or heterotrophic biofilms) that live on the streambed and in the hyporheic zone of the river, macroinvertebrates also have the potential to influence nitrate removal via its influences on microbiological processes. 2. The objective of this study was to examine the potential relationship between the macroinvertebrate communities and nitrate removal. A dataset of in-stream nitrate removal rates measured in nine-third-order streams was analysed. The simultaneous influences of abiotic (hydromorphological, physical and chemical characteristics) and biotic (biofilm and macroinvertebrate) drivers were examined and together explained 56% of the in-stream nitrate removal variance. An analysis of the independent contributions of each driver showed that abiotic drivers (e.g. ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, temperature and transient zone) contributed 40% of this nitrate removal variance, whereas the macroinvertebrate community contributed 39%. 3. The potential relationship between macroinvertebrates and nitrate removal was subsequently explored using trait-based approaches of the macroinvertebrate community. This method allows for the selection of trait modalities assuming a top-down control of microbial communities by macroinvertebrates, with in-stream abiotic conditions correlated with nitrate removal (assuming that environmental conditions affect macroinvertebrate community composition). 4. The main trait modalities positively correlated with nitrate removal were scraper (feeding habit), flagstones/boulders/cobbles/pebbles (substrate preference), crawler and interstitial (locomotion) and detritus (food). The main modalities negatively correlated with nitrate removal were silt and mud with microphytes (as substrate preference), and with fine sediment with microorganisms, and dead animals (as food sources). These results agreed with the hypothesis of top-down control and enhanced understanding of the influence of hydromorphological factors on nitrate removal. 5. This study highlights the involvement of the macroinvertebrate community in in-stream nitrate processing, and demonstrates the usefulness of applying a functional approach to explain relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function.				sauvage, sabine/P-1742-2015; Solimini, Angelo/C-9290-2018; Marti, Eugenia/J-9146-2012; Puig, Maria Angeles/A-4485-2013	sauvage, sabine/0000-0002-6360-1036; Marti, Eugenia/0000-0002-6910-4874; Puig, Maria Angeles/0000-0003-0997-3055; Morais, Manuela/0000-0003-0482-4309; Sabater, Francesc/0000-0001-6767-231X; COLAS, FANNY/0000-0002-5485-6715												0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2017	62	5					929	944		10.1111/fwb.12913								WOS:000398592200009

Poor water quality, floods and drought experienced in the 1930s prompted the formation of the Grand River Conservation Authority. While significant water improvements have been achieved, the Grand River faces chronic stress from the impacts of rapid population growth, land use intensification and changing climate. There is renewed commitment to address evolving water issues through integrated watershed management. This article summarizes the lessons learnt in the Grand River watershed and contends that integrated watershed management, although difficult to implement, provides a useful framework for practical application and positive results.																	0790-0627	1360-0648				MAY	2017	33	3					375	392		10.1080/07900627.2016.1217503								WOS:000396037800003

Assessing Future River Environments in the Seomjin River Basin due to Climate Change	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Environmental impacts in the Seomjin River Basin were evaluated based on watershed characteristics and climate change using Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration. Future dam and tributary inflow from 2000 to 2100 were estimated using a hydrology model. Dam safety evaluation and downstream flow duration curve analyses were performed using a hydraulic structure operation model based on hydrology model flow results. Water quality trends were analyzed through a seasonal Kendall test method using 19 years of water quality data. Dam discharge, tributary inflow, and water quality estimated by hydrology, hydraulic structure operation, and water quality model were used to analyze future influences on water quality trends. New guidelines for managing river environments and climate change issues are provided, allowing a preemptive response. The inflow increase during the flood season was smaller than that during the dry season because of climate change. Furthermore, the water stage of Seomjin or Juam Dam exceeded the designed flood level. It is therefore necessary to study the long-term effects and changes in water quality with regards to future flow rate changes.

Characterization and Land Application of Hydrodemolition and Diamond Grinding Slurries	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Hydrodemolition and grinding of highway surfaces create large volumes of a water and concrete slurry that must be safely disposed of or reused. This project evaluated the effect of applying the slurry as a liming agent to vegetated areas. Results of two controlled greenhouse studies documented that the incorporation of concrete slurry at up to twice the recommended liming rate had no detrimental effect on the soils or the germination and establishment of fescue and bahiagrass. Further, surface application of concrete slurry to small field plots at rates recommended to correct low soil pH resulted in no detrimental effect on soils or vegetation including bermudagrass. In addition, the water quality of rainfall runoff from the plots with concrete slurry application was not different than runoff from a plot with no slurry application. Thus, these results showed that the application of hydrodemolition and concrete grinding slurry at rates to correct soil pH had no detrimental effect on the soils, vegetation, or surface runoff monitored in this study.

Nutrient and Sediment Reduction through Upflow Filtration of Stormwater Retention Pond Effluent	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Wet ponds have often been installed to detain runoff with the intention of mitigating peak flow. However, significant current drivers exist to improve their ability to mitigate pollutants, and simple retrofits to existing ponds could help to meet total maximum daily load regulations. A review of past studies showed that ponds struggle to treat dissolved pollutants, which are often the most bioavailable. The present study evaluated the nutrient and sediment treatment performance of a retrofitted upflow filter (UF) attached to the drawdown orifice of an existing wet retention pond in Durham, North Carolina. The pond was studied during three periods: (1) control, where baseline pond performance was established; (2) after retrofit with floating treatment wetlands (FTWs); and (3) after retrofit with FTWs and an UF on the pond's drawdown orifice. The added UF was unable to improve the pond's retention of nitrogen. Further reduction of the TSS effluent concentrations by the UF may have been hampered by the low effluent concentrations during the FTW period (13 mg/L); however, the variability of TSS effluent concentrations was substantially reduced following UF retrofit. The UF significantly reduced mean effluent concentrations of orthophosphate (OP) to less than 0.01 mg/L. Effluent concentrations of OP and total phosphorus from the UF were similar to those from bioretention systems. Clogging of the filter media occurred in intervals of 5 to 9 months prior to breakthrough of OP. Future designs of UFs should incorporate microscale pretreatment and/or filter media cartridges that (1) are easy to remove and (2) provide a method to flush accumulated sediment from the media.

Specifically, the parameters of sedimentation and filtration effluent quality such as turbidity, color, organic matter [e.g.,dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total organic carbon (TOC)], ultraviolet absorbance at 254nm (UV254), Trihalomethane formation potentials (THMFPs), and metallic elements (e.g., Fe, Al, and Mn) were measured. The experimental results indicate that the continuous direct recycling of the CRS is a feasible method for not only reducing the required coagulant dosage but also improving the contaminant removal efficiency. The coagulant usage was reduced by up to 33.33% at 20 degrees C and 25.00% at 4 degrees C compared to control trials. Over the entire operation period, there was no significant accumulation of contaminants. The temperature exerted a significant impact on the required coagulant dosage and treatment efficiency. Additionally, this study proposes that the continuous operation periods are at the range of 10 to 12days. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A combination of regression analysis and genetic algorithm (GA) techniques are applied to develop spectral relationships between Tu-L5, TSS-T,, and each HV-TSS. The STARFM algorithm and all the developed relationship models are evaluated satisfactorily by various performance evaluation measures to develop heavy metal pollution index-based vulnerability maps at 1-km resolution in the Brahmani River in eastern India. The Monte-Carlo simulation based analysis of the developed formulations reveals that the uncertainty in estimating Zn and Cd is the minimum (1.04%) and the maximum (5.05%), respectively. Hence, the remote sensing based approach developed herein can effectively be used in many world rivers for real-time monitoring of heavy metal pollution. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This study presents a methodology to optimize manure management within a hydrologic region to minimize agricultural phosphorus (P) loss associated with winter manure application. Spatial and non-spatial data representing livestock, crop, soil, terrain and hydrography were compiled to determine manure P production rates, crop P uptake, existing manure storage capabilities, and transportation distances. Field slope, hydrologic soil group (HSG), and proximity to waterbodies were used to classify crop fields according to their runoff risk for winter-applied manure. We use these data to construct a comprehensive optimization model that identifies optimal location, size, and transportation strategy to achieve environmental and economic goals. The environmental goal was the minimization of daily hauling of manure to environmentally sensitive crop fields, i.e., those classified as high P-loss fields, whereas the economic goal was the minimization of the transportation costs across the entire study area. A case study encompassing two contiguous 10-digit hydrologic unit subwatersheds (HUC-10) in South Central Wisconsin, USA was developed to demonstrate the proposed methodology. Additionally, scenarios representing different management decisions (storage facility maximum volume, and project capital) and production conditions (increased milk production and 20-year future projection) were analyzed to determine their impact on optimal decisions.

Decision-making procedures about how to list, or delist, water bodies as impaired, or not, per Clean Water Act 303(d) differ across states. In states such as California, whether or not a particular monitoring sample suggests that water quality is impaired can be regarded as a binary outcome variable, and California's current regulatory framework invokes a version of the exact binomial test to consolidate evidence across samples and assess whether the overall water body complies with the Clean Water Act. Here, we contrast the performance of California's exact binomial test with one potential alternative, the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT). The SPRT uses a sequential testing framework, testing samples as they become available and evaluating evidence as it emerges, rather than measuring all the samples and calculating a test statistic at the end of the data collection process. Through simulations and theoretical derivations, we demonstrate that the SPRT on average requires fewer samples to be measured to have comparable Type I and Type II error rates as the current fixed-sample binomial test. Policymakers might consider efficient alternatives such as SPRT to current procedure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bioretention-Cistern-Irrigation Treatment Train to Minimize Stormwater Runoff	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT												Water quality of parking lot (similar to 1,858m(2)) stormwater runoff and corresponding bioretention-treated effluent flow (collected in a cistern) were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), electrical conductivity (EC), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). The novel system includes a standard bioretention facility underdrained to a cistern to store treated stormwater and pumped to a vegetable garden for irrigation. The site abstraction, average bioretention abstraction, and bowl volume were estimated to be 8,500, 4,378, and 895L, respectively; this indicates that rain events of more than 0.45cm are necessary to produce runoff and more than 0.75cm will produce system overflow. Cistern water concentrations averaged (+/- 1 SD) 0.17 +/- 0.04mg/L TP, 1.08 +/- 0.53mg/LTN, 0.11 +/- 0.02mS/cm EC (nonwinter), 15.7 +/- 17.6 mu g/L copper, and 12.2 +/- 6.3 mu g/L zinc. All of these concentrations were lower than measured in tap water, indicating effective treatment by the system and that the cistern represented a good-quality water source for irrigation. However, more data for winter EC are required to address EC removal effectiveness of the treatment train system.

The state of Pennsylvania has older cities and towns, ample water resources, and water quality problems that are all connected by aging, existing infrastructure for stormwater management. As older cities and towns begin to invest in new infrastructure, they have two, relatively new technology options: first, green infrastructure, and second, smart infrastructure, which adds sensors, controls, and communications. This paper examines how officials from cities and water agencies perceive these two solutions for their current stormwater management problems. Semistructured interviews were conducted with officials from the five cities and towns throughout Pennsylvania that have enacted stormwater fees to fund further infrastructure investment. Responses indicate that the officials perceive green infrastructure as performing inconsistently across its lifecycle and requiring labor-intensive maintenance. These officials hold positive views about smart infrastructure but want more information on performance and costs to reduce runoff. This study suggests research and tools that would help these officials address their stormwater management problems.

Hundreds of peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings have been written describing applications of SWMM. This review focuses on collecting information on model performance with respect to calibration and validation in the peer-reviewed literature. The major developmental history and applications of the model are also presented. The results provide utility to others looking for a quick reference to gauge the integrity of their own unique SWMM application. A gap analysis assesses the model's ability to perform water-quality simulations considering green infrastructure (GI)/low impact development (LID) designs and effectiveness. It is concluded that the level of detail underlying the conceptual model of SWMM versus its overall computational parsimony is well balancedmaking it an adequate model for large and medium-scale hydrologic applications. However, embedding a new mechanistic algorithm or providing user guidance for coupling with other models will be necessary to realistically simulate diffuse pollutant sources, their fate and transport, and the effectiveness of GI/LID implementation scenarios.

Detection of Semivolatile Organic Compounds in Permeable Pavement Infiltrate	JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE WATER IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT												The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Edison Environmental Center (EEC) has a research and demonstration permeable parking lot comprised of three different permeable systems: permeable asphalt, pervious concrete, and permeable interlocking concrete pavers. Water quality and quantity analysis has been ongoing since January 2010. This paper describes analysis of semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) to determine if hydrocarbons were in water that infiltrated through the permeable surfaces. SVOCs were analyzed in samples collected from 11 dates over a 3-year period, from February 8, 2010 to April 1, 2013. Results are broadly divided into three categories: 42 chemicals were never detected; 12 chemicals (11 chemical test) were detected at a rate of less than 10% or less; and 22 chemicals were detected at a frequency of 10% or greater (ranging from 10 to 66.5% detections). Fundamental and exploratory statistical analyses were performed on the 22 most observed chemicals. The statistical analyses were limited due to low frequency of detections and dilutions of samples, which impacted detection limits. The infiltrate data through three permeable surfaces were analyzed as nonparametric data by the Kaplan-Meier estimation method for fundamental statistics; there were some statistically observable differences in median concentration between pavement types when using Tarone-Ware comparison hypothesis test. A result was that three groups could be identified based on whether observed porous asphalt infiltrate concentration were greater than, similar to, or less than permeable interlocking concrete pavers infiltrate concentration. Identifying these three groups allowed one-way analysis on chemical attributes; the octonal water partitioning (logKOW), number of benzene rings, and molecular complexity were all significant. These 22 most observed chemicals in the infiltrate were further tested by Spearman rank order nonparametric for correlations between frequency of detection and chemical attributes; significant correlations were observed for porous asphalt frequency of detection and molecular weight (MW), Henry's constant, logKOW and molecular complexity, while both permeable concretes did not have any significant correlations between frequency of detection and chemical parameters. Conclusions from the statistical analyses on the 22 most frequently observed SVOCs in the infiltrate indicate that porous asphalt acts as a source for chemicals with low logKOW and MW and a sink for chemicals with high logKOW and MW, while no significant pattern was observed in the SVOC infiltrate concentrations of the two types of concrete.																	2379-6111					MAY	2017	3	2							04017005	10.1061/JSWBAY.0000822								WOS:000398595700002						
J	Gurkan, R; Altunay, N; Gurkan, N				Gurkan, Ramazan; Altunay, Nail; Gurkan, Nimet			Extraction, preconcentration and spectrophotometric determination of trace levels of thiosulfate in environmental waters	JOURNAL OF THE IRANIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY												In the existing study, a new vortex-assisted cloud point extraction (VA-CPE) method was developed for determination of low levels of thiosulfate in environmental waters at 632 nm by spectrophotometry. The method is selectively based on charge-transfer-sensitive ion-pair complex formation of Ag(S2O3)(2) (3-), which is produced by the reaction of thiosulfate with excess Ag+ ions with toluidine blue (3-amino-7-dimethylamino-2-methylphenazathionium chloride, TB+) and then its extraction into micellar phase of polyethylene glycol 4-tert-octylphenyl ether (Triton X-45) in presence of Na2SO4 as salting-out agent at pH 7.0. All the factors affecting complex formation and VA-CPE efficiency were optimized in detail. Under the optimized conditions, the linear calibration curves for thiosulfate were in the range of 0.2-120 and 5-180 A mu g L-1 with sensitivity improvement of 81-folds and 15-folds, respectively, as a result of efficient mass transfer obtained by CPE with and without vortex, while it changed in the range of 260-3600 A mu g L-1 without preconcentration at 642 nm. The limits of detection and quantification of the method for VA-CPE were found to be 0.05 and 0.22 A mu g L-1, respectively. The precision (expressed as the percent relative standard deviation) was in range of 2.5-4.8% (5, 10 and 25 A mu g L-1, n: 5). The method accuracy was validated by comparing the results to those of an independent 5,5'-dithiobis(2-aminobenzoic acid) (DTNB) method as well as recovery studies from spiked samples. It has been observed that the results are statistically in a good agreement with those obtained by DTNB method. Finally, the method developed was successfully applied to the preconcentration and determination of trace thiosulfate from environmental waters.																	1735-207X	1735-2428				MAY	2017	14	5					1033	1049		10.1007/s13738-017-1053-9								WOS:000396041200010

Convergent Validity and the Time Consistency of Preferences: Evidence from the Iowa Lakes Recreation Demand Project	LAND ECONOMICS												We examine the consistency of preferences over time and as implied by revealed versus stated preference (contingent behavior) data. Studies in this area are typically based upon a single site and focus on consumer response to changes in travel cost or site access. We use data from the Iowa Lakes Project, which provides information on usage patterns over several years and for 132 lakes, along with detailed water quality data. This allows us to test for convergence in how individuals respond to changing site characteristics, as well as the consistency of preferences over time and between actual versus contingent trips.

Using spatially explicit data from a Danish catchment, we uncover the trade-offs and synergies between efficient provision of the three services by multiobjective optimization. Results show that trade-offs exist between the regulating and provisioning services. Furthermore, synergies between the regulating services are significant; however, the cost of provision of one service depends on the level of provision of the other. The policy implication of this result is that significant gains can be achieved from joint implementation of ecosystem service policies.																	0023-7639	1543-8325				MAY	2017	93	2					309	327		10.3368/le.93.2.309								WOS:000398649800007

The device, as presented, integrates living cells and electrode-based sensors to monitor cell viability upon exposure to toxic chemicals. The methodology involved cultured fish cells Poeciliopsis lucidia hepatocellular carcinoma (PLHC-1) and Oncorhynchus mykiss rainbow trout gonad (RTG-2) cells, exposed to toxic chemicals (CdCl2 and pentachlorophenol (PCP)) after which the activity of a cellular enzyme, acid phosphatase (AP) was measured. Reduced AP activity was quantified electrochemically, allowing IC50 values (50% reduction in AP activity) to be determined. Fish cells are a relevant model of the toxicity risks posed by contaminated water to aquatic health. Such cells are relatively slow growing and do not require a source of CO2 for incubation, thus ensuring portability for single-use point of site applications. The 24 hour IC50 values determined for CdCl2 in the fish cell lines (16.2 +/- 0.7 and 91 +/- 11 mu M for PLHC and RTG-2, respectively) were in agreement with those found using the MTT assay (16.3 +/- 1.6 and 164 +/- 96 mu M). In the case of PCP, the IC50 value in PHLC cells (127 +/- 22 mu M) suggested enhanced sensitivity towards PCP compared with the MTT assay (IC50>160 mu M). The optimised electronic assay was transferred to a prototype integrated assay cartridge with associated fluidic and transducer elements. This device (TOXOR) monitored changes in the metabolic state of fish cells, realising high-value toxicity information as a potential early warning on-site screening system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sun, HF; Shi, BY; Yang, F; Wang, DS				Sun, Huifang; Shi, Baoyou; Yang, Fan; Wang, Dongsheng			Effects of sulfate on heavy metal release from iron corrosion scales in drinking water distribution system	WATER RESEARCH												Trace heavy metals accumulated in iron corrosion scales within a drinking water distribution system (DWDS) could potentially be released to bulk water and consequently deteriorate the tap water quality. The objective of this study was to identify and evaluate the release of trace heavy metals in DWDS under changing source water conditions. Experimental pipe loops with different iron corrosion scales were set up to simulate the actual DWDS. The effects of sulfate levels on heavy metal release were systemically investigated. Heavy metal releases of Mn, Ni, Cu, Pb, Cr and As could be rapidly triggered by sulfate addition but the releases slowly decreased over time. Heavy metal release was more severe in pipes transporting groundwater (GW) than in pipes transporting surface water (SW). There were strong positive correlations (R-2 > 0.8) between the releases of Fe and Mn, Fe and Ni, Fe and Cu, and Fe and Pb. When switching to higher sulfate water, iron corrosion scales in all pipe loops tended to be more stable (especially in pipes transporting GW), with a larger proportion of stable constituents (mainly Fe3O4) and fewer unstable compounds ((beta-FeOOH, gamma-FeOOH, FeCO3 and amorphous iron oxides). The main functional iron reducing bacteria (IRB) communities were favorable for the formation of Fe3O4. The transformation of corrosion scales and the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) accounted for the gradually reduced heavy metal release with time. The higher metal release in pipes transporting GW could be due to increased Fe-6(OH)(12)CO3 content under higher sulfate concentrations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Water quality effects of intermittent water supply in Arraijan, Panama	WATER RESEARCH												Intermittent drinking water supply is common in low- and middle-income countries throughout the world and can cause water quality to degrade in the distribution system. In this study, we characterized water quality in one study zone with continuous supply and three zones with intermittent supply in the drinking water distribution network in Arraijan, Panama. Low or zero pressures occurred in all zones, and negative pressures occurred in the continuous zone and two of the intermittent zones. Despite hydraulic conditions that created risks for backflow and contaminant intrusion, only four of 423 (0.9%) grab samples collected at random times were positive for total coliform bacteria and only one was positive for E. coli. Only nine of 496 (1.8%) samples had turbidity >1.0 NTU and all samples had >0.2 mg/L free chlorine residual. In contrast, water quality was often degraded during the first-flush period (when supply first returned after an outage). Still, routine and first-flush water quality under intermittent supply was much better in Arraijan than that reported in a previous study conducted in India. Better water quality in Arraijan could be due to better water quality leaving the treatment plant, shorter supply outages, higher supply pressures, a more consistent and higher chlorine residual, and fewer contaminant sources near pipes. The results illustrate that intermittent supply and its effects on water quality can vary greatly between and within distribution networks. The study also demonstrated that monitoring techniques designed specifically for intermittent supply, such as continuous pressure monitoring and sampling the first flush, can detect water quality threats and degradation that would not likely be detected with conventional monitoring.

Living in close proximity to the Bay improves access to these amenities and should be capitalized into local housing markets. We investigate these impacts in the largest hedonic analysis of water quality ever completed, with over 200,000 property sales across 14 Maryland counties. We use a spatially explicit water quality dataset, along with a wealth of landscape, economic, geographic, and demographic variables. These data allow a comprehensive exploration of the value of water quality, while controlling for a multitude of other influences. We also estimate several variants of the models most popular in current literature, with a focus on the temporal average of water quality. In comparing 1 year and 3 year averages, the 3 year averages generally have a larger implicit price. Overall, results indicate that water quality improvements in the Bay, such as those required by EPA's Total Maximum Daily Load, could yield significant benefits to waterfront and near-waterfront homeowners.																	0921-8009	1873-6106				MAY	2017	135						103	113		10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.12.014								WOS:000395597700010						
J	Wolf, D; Klaiber, HA				Wolf, David; Klaiber, H. Allen			Bloom and bust: Toxic algae's impact on nearby property values	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Over the past decade harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a nationwide environmental concern. HABs are likely to increase in frequency and intensity due to rising summer temperatures caused by climate change and higher nutrient enrichment from increased urbanization. Policymakers need information on the economic costs of HABs to design optimal management policies in the face of limited budgets. Using a detailed, multi lake hedonic analysis across 6 Ohio counties between 2009 and 2015 we show capitalization losses associated with near lake homes between 11% and 17% rising to above 22% for lake adjacent homes. In the case of Grand Lake Saint Marys, we find one-time capitalization losses exceeding $51 million for near lake homes which dwarfs the State of Ohio's cleanup expenditure of $26 million.

J	Shah, A; Garg, A				Shah, Arpit; Garg, Amit			Urban commons service generation, delivery, and management: A conceptual framework	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Urban commons are currently not studied holistically under the rationale used by the ecosystem cascade framework In this paper, we build on the ecosystem cascade framework to present a conceptual model that provides a comprehensive view of urban common resources and allows decision-makers to develop suitable interventions to meet objectives of sustainability and equity. The model looks at the role of and explains the linkages between urban commons' biophysical structures, user population characteristics, power dynamics, use behavior, benefits generated, and management strategies. The model adds to existing literature by focusing on direct benefits and equity and by elaborating on the role of transaction costs and management strategies in governing urban commons. Considering direct benefits allows for a complete picture of overall benefits while making governance decisions, as opposed to considering benefits received only through human effort. Focusing on power asymmetries between stakeholders highlights the inequities created in accessing benefits from urban commons. Elaborating on management strategies provides greater insight into the complexities of managing urban commons and the impacts that governance decisions can have. Finally, including transaction costs highlights the factors that influence costs of managing resources. We illustrate the use of the model with literature from urban India. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

It has been detected in various environmental media and has been shown toxic to aquatic life. The toxic effects of HBCD to aquatic organisms in Chinese freshwater ecosystems are discussed here. Experiments were conducted with nine types of acute toxicity testing and three types of chronic toxicity testing. After comparing a range of species sensitivity distribution models, the optimal model of Bull III was used to derive the safety thresholds for HBCD. The acute safety threshold and the chronic safety threshold of HBCD for Chinese freshwater organisms were found to be 2.32 mg/L and 0.128 mg/L respectively. Both values were verified by the methods of the Netherlands and the United States. HBCD was found to be less toxic compared to other widely used brominated flame retardants. The present results provide valuable information for revision of the water quality standard of HBCD in China.																	0147-6513	1090-2414				MAY	2017	139						43	49		10.1016/j.econv.2017.01.005								WOS:000396640600006	28109902

Arsenic in stream waters is bioaccumulated but neither biomagnified through food webs nor biodispersed to land	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Human activities such as mining have contributed substantially to the increase of metals in aquatic environments worldwide. These metals are bioaccumulated by aquatic organisms and can be biomagnified along trophic webs. The dispersal of contaminants from water to land has been little investigated, even though most aquatic invertebrates in streams have aerial stages. We used field and laboratory approaches to investigate the effects of arsenic pollution on stream invertebrate assemblages, and its bioaccumulation, biomagnification and trophic transfer from aquatic to terrestrial environments by emergent insects. We conducted the study in an arsenic impacted stream (40 mu g L-1 As at the most polluted site) and a reference stream (0.3 gil-As). Invertebrate abundance and richness were lowest at the most impacted site. Arsenic in biofilm and in invertebrates increased with the arsenic content in the water. The highest arsenic accumulators were bryophytes (1760 mu g mu g(-1)), followed by the biofilm (449 mu g mu g(-1)) and shredder invertebrates (313 mu g mu g(-1)); predators had the lowest arsenic concentration. Insects emerging from water and spiders along streambanks sampled from the reference and the impacted stream did not differ in their body arsenic concentrations. In the laboratory, the shredder Sericostoma vittaturn had reduced feeding rates when exposed to water from the impacted stream in comparison with the reference stream (15.6 vs. 19.0 mg leaves mg body mass(-1) day(-1); p < 0.05), but they grew faster in the polluted water (0.16 0.04% day(-1) vs. 0.05 0.01% day(-1), p < 0.05). S. vittatum exposed to contaminated stream water accumulated arsenic from food, not through contact with water. We concluded that although arsenic is bioaccumulated, mainly by food ingestion, it is not biomagnified through food webs and is not transported from the aquatic to terrestrial environment when insects leave the stream water.

The combined effect of several stressors (deterioration of habitats appropriate for reproduction and growth, invasive species and poor water quality) seems to exert considerable influence on the yellow perch population in LSP, characterized by low recruitment. To better understand possible stressor effects at the biochemical level, LSP yellow perch were compared with other sites along a gradient of increasing human influences from upstream to downstream along the St. Lawrence River. Morphometry (size, weight, circumference and Fulton's condition factor) and biomarkers associated to the peroxidation of lipids, lipophilic antioxidants (a-tocopherol and carotenoids), along with retinoids (vitamins Aland A2) and proteins were compared between sites at the larval, juvenile and adult stages. Fulton's condition factor was similar between sites for juveniles but was significantly lower in LSP adults, suggesting a weakened physiological condition. In most contaminated sites as LSP, lipid peroxidation tended to be higher in juveniles and adults whereas the lipophilic antioxidant lycopene and proteins content were lower. Retinyl esters were significantly lower for LSP fish compared to other sites, not only in larvae but also in the livers of juveniles and adults. These results are consistent with possible altered metabolism in the retinoid system of LSP yellow perch. The overall results reflect the "pressure" gradient tested, where the yellow perch from the most affected sites located downstream had impaired physiological and biochemical conditions compared to the upstream sectors.

However, the related human disturbances and natural processes reflect a great complexity, which hinders quantitative Understanding. We here consider the Zaamar Goldfield in Mongolia, one of the world's largest placer mining sites, located in the Tuul River basin (upper Lake Baikal basin). A main study aim is to investigate relations between patterns of increased sediment loads along the Tuul River and the (spatially variable) area coverage of active or recently abandoned placer mines in the river vicinity. Specifically, we compare observed loads derived from nested catchment areas with the output from spatially distributed soil erosion modelling. Results showed that riverine sediment loads in mining areas reflect soil losses both from soil erosion and direct human impacts (e.g. waste water discharge), which are two to three orders of magnitude higher than the input from natural areas dominated by soil erosion alone. Notably, the sediment load contributions from the mining areas were insensitive to changes in hydrometeorological conditions, whereas contributions from natural areas were much lower during drier periods (as expected when governed by soil erosion by water). Accordingly, the relative contribution to the total sediment load (TSL) of metal-enriched soil from mining areas is likely to be particularly pronounced (with estimated values of about 80% of TSL) under drier hydrometeorological conditions. This is consistent with observations of considerably elevated metal concentrations under low flow conditions and implies that if annual average discharge continues to decrease in the Tuul River as well as the entire Selenga River system, increased metal concentrations may be one of the consequences.

The 3D ecological model ERGOM was validated and applied in a local set-up of the Kattegat, Denmark, using the off-line Flexsem framework. The model scenarios were conducted by changing the forcing by +/- 20% of nutrient inputs (bottom-up) and mesozooplankton mortality (top-down), and both types of forcing combined. The model results showed that cascading effects operated differently depending on the forcing type. In the single-forcing bottom-up scenarios, the cascade directions were in the same direction as the forcing. For scenarios involving top-down, there was a skipped-level-transmission in the trophic responses that was either attenuated or amplified at different trophic levels. On a seasonal scale, bottom-up forcing showed strongest response during winter-spring for DIN and ChI a concentrations, whereas top down forcing had the highest cascade strength during summer for ChI a concentrations and microzooplankton biomass. On annual basis, the system was more bottom-up than top-down controlled. Microzooplankton was found to play an important role in the pelagic food web as mediator of nutrient and energy fluxes. This study demonstrated that the best scenario for improved water quality was a combined reduction in nutrient input and mesozooplankton mortality calling for the need of an integrated management of marine areas exploited by human activities.

By analyzing long-term data from 110 mountainous streams draining into German drinking water reservoirs, nitrate concentrations indeed declined in the majority of catchments. Furthermore, our meta-analysis indicates that the declining nitrate levels are linked to the release of dissolved iron to streams likely due to a reductive dissolution of iron(III) minerals in riparian wetland soils. This dissolution process mobilized adsorbed compounds, such as phosphate, dissolved organic carbon and arsenic, resulting in concentration increases in the streams and higher inputs to receiving drinking water reservoirs. Reductive mobilization was most significant in catchments with stream nitrate concentrations < 6 mg L-1. Here, nitrate, as a competing electron acceptor, was too low in concentration to inhibit microbial iron(III) reduction. Consequently, observed trends were strongest in forested catchments, where nitrate concentrations were unaffected by agricultural and urban sources and which were therefore sensitive to reductions of atmospheric nitrogen depositions. We conclude that there is strong evidence that the decline in nitrogen deposition toward pre-industrial conditions lowers the redox buffer in riparian soils, destabilizing formerly fixed problematic compounds, and results in serious implications for water quality.

In this context, vineyards are the most erosion prone lands in the Mediterranean region. The adoption of alternative soil management practices, such as the use of permanent grass, can reduce runoff and erosion. Based on an 8-years field study in Tuscany (Central Italy), this research aimed to assess the long-term consequences of permanent grass cover in vineyard plots in terms of both runoff and soil and nutrient losses, and to investigate their relationships with rainfall characteristics. The results showed that permanent grass cover reduced significantly the average yearly runoff (by about 11.7%), in particular during copious and intense rainfalls. Also, grass covered parcels lost on average 68.5% less soil than the inter-rows with harrowed soil. Up to 4.5 and 12.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N and up to 6.2 and 5 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of P were lost in grassed and harrowed parcels, respectively. Under both soil management practices, the total soil and nutrient losses caused by runoff were significantly correlated with rainfall height and rainfall erosivity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An analysis of the microbial quality of water in a milk production plant	LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												This study analysed microbiological and chemical sampling quality results of the water supply used in a milk production plant over a two-year period. Four sampling points were tested six days a week (n = 2032) and results were compiled for total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus and total bacterial counts (TBC) at 21 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C as well as total and free chlorine. A significant difference in microbiological quality was found to exist between the cooling tower and the other sampling locations (F = 45.860, P < 0.001), with post-hoc analysis indicating a particularly significant difference for TBCs at 30 degrees C (P < 0.001). The results of this study identified contamination issues associated with the cooling water in terms of the heterogeneity of both microbiological and chemical concentrations and recommended the inclusion of further sampling parameters to further identify causation factors. For the non cooled water sampling locations, homogeneity in quality suggested that reduced sampling frequency could be implemented, thus reducing cost. The results of this study propose that in-depth analysis of both microbiological and chemical sampling results within a dairy plant can facilitate in the more cost effective sampling procedures and offer valuable insight into the development of site specific protocols.

To deal with this problem, we construct a new classifier called support function machine (SFM) in this work. First, sets in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd are mapped into an infinite dimensional Banach space C(S) (whose elements are functions) via support functions, and then set-based classification in R-d is converted into function-based classification in C(S). Second, we define the hyperplane via the Riesz representation theorem in Banach space, and discuss the Hausdorff distance of hyperpalnes and maximum margin principle (MMP) in C(S). Based on MMP, we construct an optimal problem and discuss some of its properties. Thereafter, we establish an SFM to solve set-based classification. Experiments about water quality evaluation and set-valued data classifications show the superiority of SFM. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J	Perez, FF; Sweeck, L; Elskens, M; Bauwens, W				Perez, Fabricio Fiengo; Sweeck, Lieve; Elskens, Marc; Bauwens, Willy			A discontinuous finite element suspended sediment transport model for water quality assessments in river networks	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Suspended sediment plays an important role in the distribution and transport of many pollutants (such as radionuclides) in rivers. Pollutants may adsorb on fine suspended particles (e.g. clay) and spread according to the suspended sediment movement. Hence, the simulation of the suspended sediment mechanism is indispensable for realistic transport modelling. This paper presents and tests a simple mathematical model for predicting the suspended sediment transport in river networks. The model is based on the van Rijn suspended load formula and the advection-diffusion equation with a source or sink term that represents the erosion or deposition fluxes. The transport equation is solved numerically with the discontinuous finite element method. The model evaluation was performed in two steps, first by comparing model simulations with the measured suspended sediment concentrations in the Grote Nete-Molse Nete River in Belgium, and second by a model intercomparison with the sediment transport model NST MIKE 11. The simulations reflect the measurements with a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency of 0.6, while the efficiency between the proposed model and the NST MIKE 11 simulations is 0.96. Both evaluations indicate that the proposed sediment transport model, that is sufficiently simple to be practical, is providing realistic results.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				APR 30	2017	31	9					1804	1816		10.1002/hyp.11151								WOS:000400159100010

Variable nitrate concentration-discharge relationships in a forested watershed	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The relationship between solute concentrations and discharge can inform an integrated understanding of hydrological and biogeochemical processes at watershed scales. Recent work from multiple catchments has shown that there is typically little variation in concentration relative to large variations in discharge. This pattern has been described as chemostatic behavior. Pond Branch, a forested headwater catchment in Maryland, has been monitored for stream nitrate (NO3-) concentrations at weekly intervals for 14years. In the growing season and autumn of 2011 a high-frequency optical NO3- sensor was used to supplement the long-term weekly data. In this watershed, long-term weekly data show that NO3- concentrations decrease with increasing discharge whereas 6months of 15-minute sensor observed concentrations reveal a more chemostatic behavior. High-frequency NO3- concentrations from the sensor collected during different storm events reveal variable concentration-discharge patterns highlighting the importance of high resolution data and ecohydrological drivers in controlling solute export for biologically reactive solutes such as NO3-.																	0885-6087	1099-1085				APR 30	2017	31	9					1817	1824		10.1002/hyp.11136								WOS:000400159100011

A protocol for the recovery and detection of fecal pollution indicator bacteria, E. coli, using beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was developed. The developed protocol involves two main steps: sample preparation and GUS activity measurement. In the sample preparation step, syringe filters were used with a dual purpose, for the recovery and pre-concentration of E. coli from the water matrix and as mu L reactors for bacteria lysis and GUS extraction. Subsequently, GUS activity was measured using a continuous fluorometric method developed previously. The optimum GUS recovery conditions for the sample preparation step were found to be 100 mL PELB (supplemented with 1 mg mL(-1) lysozyme and 20 mM DTT) at 37 degrees C for 30 min. The protocol was evaluated on environmental samples (fresh and seawater) against an establish GUS assay method (Coliplage((R))). GUS activities corresponding to samples containing as low as 26 MPN E. coli 100 mL(-1) were detected for the seawater sample and as low as 110 MPN E. coli 100 mL(-1) for the freshwater samples. By comparison with the Coliplage r method, this protocol offered an improvement in the measured GUS activities of 3.1 fold for freshwater samples and 4.1 fold for seawater samples. Furthermore, the protocol developed here, has a time-to-result of 75 min, and successfully addresses the requirement for tests capable of rapid assessment of microbiological water quality.

Many peatlands, such as those in the British Isles, Sweden, and Canada, have undergone increased erosion, resulting in degraded water quality and depleted soil carbon stocks. It is unclear how climate change may impact future peat erosion. Here we use a physically based erosion model (Pan-European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment-PEAT), driven by seven different global climate models (GCMs), to predict fluvial blanket peat erosion in the Northern Hemisphere under 21st-century climate change. After an initial decline, total hemispheric blanket peat erosion rates are found to increase during 2070-2099 (2080s) compared with the baseline period (1961-1990) for most of the GCMs. Regional erosion variability is high with changes to baseline ranging between -1.27 and +21.63 tha(-1) yr(-1) in the 2080s. These responses are driven by effects of temperature (generally more dominant) and precipitation change on weathering processes. Low-latitude and warm blanket peatlands are at most risk to fluvial erosion under 21st-century climate change.

Comparison of Fluoride Levels in Tap and Bottled Water and Reported Use of Fluoride Supplementation in a United States-Mexico Border	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH												Background: Compared to the general United States (U.S.) population, Arizona counties along the U.S.-Mexico border have a higher prevalence of dental caries, which can be reduced with adequate fluoride exposure. Because of concern regarding local tap water quality, fluoride-free bottled water consumption is common in this region, raising concern that families are not receiving adequate fluoride to promote dental health. Objective: To evaluate the levels of fluoride in tap and bottled water as well as the use of fluoride supplements in an Arizona border community. Methods: Low-income Latino households (n = 90) who report use of bottled water as their primary source of water intake were recruited. Participants completed a questionnaire about their and their children's dental histories and use of fluoride supplements. Water samples (bottled and tap) were collected from a subset of households (n = 30) for analysis of fluoride. Results: Fluoride detection levels were significantly greater (p = 0.02, Fisher's exact test) in tap water (average = 0.49 mg/dL) than in bottled water, yet, the majority (22/30) were below the range for optimal dental health (0.7-1.2 mg/L). Concentration of fluoride in the majority (29/30) of bottled water samples was below the quantitative detection limit of 0.4 mg/L. Children were significantly less likely to have dental caries if they received fluoride varnishing treatments (p = 0.01, Fisher's exact test), lived in households that reported using fluoridated mouthwash (p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test), their parents received fluoride education (p = 0.01, Fisher's exact test), and their parents reported visiting a dentist yearly (p < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). Furthermore, none of the participants reported receiving recommendations from health-care providers about fluoride supplementation or variance in content by the type of water consumed. Conclusion: Although fluoride was significantly more likely to be detected in tap than bottled water, neither water source in this border community is likely to provide enough fluoride for optimal dental health. Low-income children in this region may benefit from regular access to fluoride varnishing treatments and/or use of fluoridated mouthwash, interventions that could be tested in future well-designed trials.																	2296-2565					APR 27	2017	5								UNSP 87	10.3389/fpubh.2017.00087								WOS:000408607400001	28497034

The UMS-Seoul incorporates 14 surface energy balance (EB) systems, 7 surface-based three-dimensional (3-D) meteorological observation systems and applied meteorological (AP) observation systems, and the existing surface-based meteorological observation network. The EB system consists of a radiation balance system, sonic anemometers, infrared CO2/H2O gas analyzers, and many sensors measuring the wind speed and direction, temperature and humidity, precipitation, and air pressure. The EB-produced radiation, meteorological, and turbulence data will be used to quantify the surface EB according to land use and to improve the boundary-layer and surface processes in meteorological models. The 3-D system, composed of a wind lidar, microwave radiometer, aerosol lidar, or ceilometer, produces the cloud height, vertical profiles of backscatter by aerosols, wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, and liquid water content. It will be used for high-resolution reanalysis data based on observations and for the improvement of the boundary-layer, radiation, and microphysics processes in meteorological models. The AP system includes road weather information, mosquito activity, water quality, and agrometeorological observation instruments. The standardized metadata for networks and stations are documented and renewed periodically to provide a detailed observation environment. The UMS-Seoul data are designed to support real-time acquisition and display and automatically quality check within 10 min from observation. After the quality check, data can be distributed to relevant potential users such as researchers and policy makers. Finally, two case studies demonstrate that the observed data have a great potential to help to understand the boundary-layer structures more deeply, improve the performance of high-resolution meteorological models, and provide useful information customized based on the user demands in the SMA.

Salting our freshwater lakes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The highest densities of lakes on Earth are in north temperate ecosystems, where increasing urbanization and associated chloride runoff can salinize freshwaters and threaten lake water quality and the many ecosystem services lakes provide. However, the extent to which lake salinity may be changing at broad spatial scales remains unknown, leading us to first identify spatial patterns and then investigate the drivers of these patterns. Significant decadal trends in lake salinization were identified using a dataset of long-term chloride concentrations from 371 North American lakes. Landscape and climate metrics calculated for each site demonstrated that impervious land cover was a strong predictor of chloride trends in Northeast and Midwest North American lakes. As little as 1% impervious land cover surrounding a lake increased the likelihood of long-term salinization. Considering that 27% of large lakes in the United States have >1% impervious land cover around their perimeters, the potential for steady and long-term salinization of these aquatic systems is high. This study predicts that many lakes will exceed the aquatic life threshold criterion for chronic chloride exposure (230 mg L-1), stipulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in the next 50 y if current trends continue.

Four probiotic PNSB (Rhodobacter sphaeroides strains SS15, S3W10, TKW17 and Afifella marina STW181) were investigated for controlling water quality using a mixed culture at a ratio of 1: 1 (roughly 1 x 10(8) cells mL(-1) for each, every week 1-7) as follows; T1 (S3W10 + SS15), T2 (S3W10 + TKW17) and T3 (S3W10 + STW181) and found that throughout 8 weeks shrimp cultivation the most effective sets to reduce NH4(+) and promote shrimp growth (based on weight and total length) were T1 and T3, respectively. Hence, PNSB strains (SS15, S3W10 and STW181) were used as a mixed culture (1: 1: 1, roughly 1 x 10(8) cells mL(-1) for each at weeks 1, 2 and 3) assessing their potential to prevent AHPND by challenge test on shrimp with a virulent strain AHPND-causing Vibrio parahaemolyticus SR2 (roughly 1 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) at day 15) during shrimp cultivation for 30 days. Inoculated PNSB sets (positive control: only PNSB inoculation, and treatment: both PNSB and SR2 inoculations) significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the levels of NH4-, NO2-, NO3- and chemical oxygen demand (COD) with significantly higher (P < 0.05) of dissolved oxygen (DO) compared to native control (no inoculation) and challenge test (only SR2 inoculation). The maximal growth performance of shrimp was observed in the positive control; while no significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed for other sets. PNSB survived and colonized in intestinal shrimp tract to prevent AHPND by increasing 11% survival rate of infected shrimp by strain SR2. The correlation coefficient between PNSB population and shrimp survival showed a positive strong correlation, but a negative strong correlation between vibrios population and shrimp survival.

The present study examined the effectiveness of periphyton for biofiltration of mariculture effluents. Marine periphyton was allowed to spontaneously develop on a plastic net substrate, in experimental bioreactors that were fed with effluents from fish mariculture ponds. Biomass development and nutrient uptake were followed over four seasons. Attention was given to the orientation and area of the net substrate, season and additional operational factors. The highest specific growth rate (SGR) of 27% day(-1) was measured during the second week of periphyton growth in the summer. Mean daily periphyton production rates in the spring and autumn were 2.4 and 1.8 g (ash-free dry weight) m(-2) day(-1), respectively. The vertical orientation of the net substrate was overall advantageous over the horizontal orientation. Increasing the substrate area of vertically oriented nets in the biofilter increased the removal efficiency of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) up to 80%, and allowed more biomass production in the biofilter. Multiple polynomial regression models suggest strong effect of biomass weight and effluent retention time on the removal efficiency of TAN and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The removal rates of TAN and DIN in these experiments were between 0.11 and 1.2 g Nm(-2) (substrate area) day(-1) for periphyton at the age of 7 and 42 days, respectively. Marine periphyton seems to be a simple, low cost and sustainable component, which can performbiofiltration/rehabilitation of water quality and potentially serve as feed for fish and shrimp.

With fringing and patch reefs at varying distances from the coast the Spermonde Archipelago in southern Sulawesi, Indonesia offers ideal conditions to study the effects of coastal eutrophication along a spatially defined gradient. The present study investigated bacterial community composition of three coral reef habitats: the water column, sediments, and mucus of the hard coral genus Fungia, along that cross shelf environmental and water quality gradient. The main research questions were: (1) How do water quality and bacterial community composition change along a coastal shelf gradient? (2) Which water quality parameters influence bacterial community composition? (3) Is there a difference in bacterial community composition among the investigated habitats? For this purpose, a range of key water parameters were measured at eight stations in distances from 2 to 55 km from urban Makassar. This was supplemented by sampling of bacterial communities of important microbial habitats using 454 pyrosequencing. Findings revealed that the population center Makassar had a strong effect on the concentrations of Chlorophyll a, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), which were all significantly elevated at the inshore compared the other seven sites. Shifts in the bacterial communities were specific to each sampled habitat. Two OTUs, belonging to the genera Escherichia/Shigella (Gammaproteobacteria) and Raistonia (Betaproteobacteria), respectively, both dominated the bacterial community composition of the both size fractions of the water column and coral mucus. The sampled reef sediments were more diverse, and no single OTUs was dominant. There was no gradual shift in bacterial classes or OTUs within the sampled habitats. In addition, we observed very distinct communities between the investigated habitats. Our data show strong changes in the bacterial community composition at the inshore site for water column and sediment samples. Alarmingly, there was generally a high prevalence of potentially pathogenic bacteria across the entire gradient.

J	Coats, ER; Wilson, PI				Coats, Erik R.; Wilson, Patrick I.			Toward Nucleating the Concept of the Water Resource Recovery Facility (WRRF): Perspective from the Principal Actors	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Wastewater resource recovery has been advocated for decades; necessary structural pathways were long-ago articulated, and established and emerging technologies exist. Nevertheless, broad wastewater valorization remains elusive. In considering implementation barriers, the argument is made that decision-makers focus on avoiding permit violations and negative publicity by embracing a conservative/safe approach seemingly ignoring research on economic/environmental benefits. Conversely positing that economics is a primary barrier, we investigated, characterized, and described nontechnical socio-political barriers to realizing wastewater resource recovery. Principal actors in the Pacific NW region of the U.S. (representing a progressive populace facing stringent water quality regulations) were interviewed. Results revealed that economics were, indeed, the primary barrier to implementation/expansion of the WRRF concept. Consistent throughout interviews was a prevalent sense that the "cost of doing something (different)" was a principal consideration in resource recovery actions/policies. Moreover, "economics drives decisions," and "95% the bottom line is money. Show return on investment, it will get people's attention." Who pays was also a concern: "Government isn't going to pay. The states and Federal government won't give any grants, and we can't raise rates." Applying business case evaluations was seen as a pathway to actualizing resource recovery. Most encouragingly, the consensus was that resource recovery is a necessary future paradigm, and that real barriers are surmountable.

We investigated the short-term (2 days) vertical and diel variations in bacterial community structure and microbially derived secondary metabolites during a cyanobacterial bloom that emerged in a highly urbanized tropical reservoir. The waterbody was largely dominated by the cyanobacteria Planktothricoides spp., together with the Synechococcus, Pseudanabaena, Prochlorothrix, and Limnothrix. Spatial differences. (i.e., water depth) rather than temporal differences (i.e., day versus night) better-explained the short-term variability in water quality parameters and bacterial community composition. Difference in bacterial structure suggested a resource-driven distribution pattern for the community. We found that the freshwater bacterial community associated with cyanobacterial blooms is largely conserved at the phylum level, with Proteobacteria (beta-proteobateria), Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria as the main taxa despite the cyanobacterial species present and geographical (Asia, Europe, Australia, and North America) or climatic distinctions. Through multivariate statistical analyses of the bacterial community, environmental parameters, and secondary metabolite concentrations, we observed positive relationships between the occurrences of cyanobacterial groups and off-flavor compounds (2-methyisoborneol and beta-ionone), suggesting a cyanobacterial origin. This study demonstrates the potential of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing as a supporting tool in algal bloom monitoring or water-resource management.

In order to increase sediment P retention, we injected dissolved aluminum into the anoxic sediment of a eutrophic semienclosed bay in the Baltic Sea, thereby inhibiting P recycling and further eutrophication (B). The P concentration in the bay remained at half, as did phytoplankton biomass (C), compared to pretreatment conditions and compared to the reference bay. Four years after treatment the water column transparency was increased, allowing submerged vegetation to penetrate deeper, and the habitat suitable for fish and benthic fauna had expanded (D). The lowered P concentration in the bay decreased the P export to the surrounding archipelago. This is the first full-scale marine remediation project using a geo-engineering method that demonstrates a quick recovery. For successful remediation in coastal areas, permanent binding of mobile P in anoxic sediments may be needed together with measures in the catchment area to obtain faster recovery of eutrophicated marine ecosystems.																	0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 18	2017	51	8					4559	4566		10.1021/acs.est.6b06187								WOS:000399859700046	28350961

Two sampling campaigns were carried out in similar hydrological conditions (wet period, low flow) along a river continuum, characterized by two opposite density gradients of animals (cattle and wild animals) and human populations. While the abundance of E. coli slightly increased along the river continuum, the abundance of both human and ruminant-associated Bacteroidales markers, as well as the number of E. coli multi-resistant to antibiotics, evidenced a fecal contamination originating from animals at upstream rural sites, and from humans at downstream urban sites. A strong spatial modification of the structure of the E. coli population was observed. At the upstream site close to a forest, a higher abundance of the B2 phylogroup and Escherichia clade strains were observed. At the pasture upstream site, a greater proportion of both E and B1 phylogroups was detected, therefore suggesting a fecal contamination of mainly bovine origin. Conversely, in downstream urban sites, A, D, and F phylogroups were more abundant. To assess the occurrence of intestinal pathogenic strains, virulence factors [afaD, stx1, stx2, eltB (LT), estA (ST), ipaH, bfpA, eae, aaiC and aatA] were screened among 651 E. coli isolates. Intestinal pathogenic strains STEC O174: H21 (stx2) and EHEC O26: H11 (eae, stx1) were isolated in water and sediments close to the pasture site. In contrast, in the downstream urban site aEPEC/EAEC and DAEC of human origin, as well as extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli belonging to clonal group A of D phylogroup, were sampled. Even if the estimated input of STEC (Shiga toxin-producing E. coli) released in water at the upstream pasture site - at the downstream site was low, we show that STEC could persist in sediment. These results show that, the run-off of small cattle farms contributed, as much as the wastewater effluent, in the dissemination of pathogenic E. coli in both water and sediments, even if the microbiological quality of the water was good or to average quality according to the French water index.																	1664-302X					APR 18	2017	8								UNSP 609	10.3389/fmicb.2017.00609								WOS:000399373500001	28458656

W.; Cetinic, Ivona			From toes to top-of-atmosphere: Fowler's Sneaker Depth index of water clarity for the Chesapeake Bay	OPTICS EXPRESS												Fowler's Sneaker Depth (FSD), analogous to the well known Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)), is a visually discerned citizen scientist metric used to assess water clarity in the Patuxent River estuary. In this study, a simple remote sensing algorithm was developed to derive FSD from space-borne spectroradiometric imagery. An empirical model was formed that estimates FSD from red-end remote sensing reflectances at 645 nm, R-rs(645). The model is based on a hyperbolic function relating water clarity to Rrs(645) that was established using radiative transfer modeling and fine tuned using in-water FSD measurements and coincident Rrs(645) data observed by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Aqua spacecraft (MODISA). The resultant FSD algorithm was applied to Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager data to derive a short time-series for the Patuxent River estuary from January 2015 to June 2016. Satellite-derived FSD had an inverse, statistically significant relationship (p<0.005) with total suspended sediment concentration (TSS). Further, a distinct negative relationship between FSD and chlorophyll concentration was discerned during periods of high biomass (> 4 mu g L-1). The complex nature of water quality in the mid-toupper Chesapeake Bay was captured using a MODISA-based FSD time series (2002-2016). This study demonstrates how a citizen scientist-conceived observation can be coupled with remote sensing. With further refinement and validation, the FSD may be a useful tool for delivering scientifically relevant results and for informing and engaging local stakeholders and policy makers.

In this way we can evaluate how these control actions can be combined in order to achieve a global positive effect on the plant operation. Also, this paper proposes an integral indicator for performance evaluation, which takes into account all three indicators mentioned for plant assessment. This indicator has been defined in a manner which tries to capture the overall performance of the plant, without relying on the subjectivity in granting different weights to the constituent elements of the evaluation criteria. The control of nitrate in the second anoxic tank using internal recirculation flow rate and control of the suspended solids concentration in the fifth tank using wastage flow rate offers the best compromise on the three elements considered for performance evaluation of a wastewater treatment plant: water quality, operational cost and CO2 emissions.

Coral assemblages are structured along a turbidity gradient on the Southwestern Gulf of Mexico, Veracruz	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Corals on the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico have evolved on a terrigenous shallow continental shelf under the influence of several natural river systems. As a result, water turbidity on these reefs can be high, with visibility as low as < 1 m, depending on reef location and season. Using a presence-absence species database from field surveys, literature search, and satellite data on sea surface temperature, turbidity and chlorophyll-a, the coral species composition and environmental variables were analyzed for the three main reef systems of the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. Completeness of the data set was assessed using species accumulation curves and non-parametric estimators of species richness. Differences in coral assemblages' composition between the reef systems were investigated using univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate (nMDS, ANOSIM, SIMPER) analyses and the relationship between the assemblages and environmental data was assessed.using a forward selection process in canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to eliminate non-significant environmental variables. The northern and central Veracruz reef systems share a similar number of coral species (p=0.78 mult. comp.) and both showed higher species richness than the southern system (p < 0.001 mult. comp.). In terms of the assemblages' structure, significant differences were found (ANOSIM R=0.3, p=0.001) with larger average dissimilitude between north-south (75.4% SIMPER) and central-south (74.2%) than north-central (27%) comparisons. Only environmental variables related to water turbidity and productivity were significant on the final CCA configuration, which showed a gradient of increasing turbidity from north to south. Reef geomorphology and the effect of turbidity help explain differences in coral assemblages' composition. More studies are necessary to establish if turbidity could function as a refuge for future environmental stress. Each Veracruz reef system is at the same time unique and shares a pool of coral species. To protect these ecosystems it is necessary to effectively manage water quality and consider coral diversity on the reef corridor of the southwestern Gulf of Mexico.																	0278-4343	1873-6955				APR 15	2017	138						32	40		10.1016/j.csr.2017.03.002								WOS:000401202000003

With the Gamtoos Estuary experiencing regular high flow conditions, a key difference between the two systems is the propensity for natural flushing events to occur; a mechanism largely eliminated from the highly-regulated Sundays Catchment. Phytoplankton blooms (>20 Chl-alpha mu g l(-1)) were persistent and seasonal in the Sundays, inducing summer bottom-water hypoxia (<2 mg l(-1)), whilst those in the Gamtoos were episodic and flow-dependent. Of concern in the Sundays Estuary, was the magnitude (>550 mu g l(-1)) and recurrent nature of two harmful algal bloom (HAB) species. This study provides the first account of HAB persistence and seasonal hypoxia in a South African estuary, demonstrating the possible consequences of shifting an ecosystem into a new stable state.

No effects were observed at any sediment concentrations when applied alone. All corals in the lowest light treatments lost chlorophyll a and discoloured (bleached) after a week. Coral mortality only occurred in the two lowest light treatments and was higher when simultaneously exposed to elevated SSCs. Compared to water quality data collected during large dredging programs and natural resuspension events (and in the absence of sediment deposition as a cause-effect pathway) these data suggest the light reduction associated with turbidity poses a proportionally greater risk than effects of elevated SSCs alone.

The current study investigated the use of a new method for measuring valve behaviour responses in mussels (Mytilus edulis) exposed to dispersed crude oil (DCO). Results confirmed that valve gape is a sensitive parameter; at the high DCO concentration (0.25 mg L-1) the mean valve gape was reduced from 49 to 31%, and mussels increased shell movement (measured as distance travelled) or spent more time closed to avoid contact with the oil. At the low DCO concentration (0.015 mg L-1) the distance travelled parameter was the most sensitive endpoint. Results also demonstrated that valve gape behaviour is a valid endpoint when monitoring mussels for exposure to DCO. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These stressors impact the environmental quality of the Baltic Sea. Each Baltic Sea country contributes to the stressors and, at the same time, is affected by their negative impacts on water quality. Knowledge about benefits from improvements in coastal and marine waters is key to assessing public support for policies aimed at achieving such changes. We propose a new approach to account for variability in benefits related to differences in Socio-demographics of respondents, by using a structural model of discrete choice. Our method allows to incorporate a wide range of socio-demographics as explanatory variables in conditional multinomial logit models Without the risk of collinearity; the model is estimated jointly and hence more statistically efficient than the alternative, typically used approaches. We apply this new technique to a study of the preferences of Latvian citizens towards improvements of the coastal and marine environment quality. We find that overall, Latvians are willing to pay for reducing losses of biodiversity, for improving water quality for recreation by reduced eutrophication, and for reducing new occurrences of invasive alien species. However a significant group within the sample seems not to value environmental improvements in the Baltic Sea, and, thus, is unwilling to support costly measures for achieving such improvements. The structural model of discrete choice reveals substantial heterogeneity among Latvians towards changes in the quality of coastal and marine waters of Latvia. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Due to plan for obtaining drinking water from the Karacaoren-1 Dam Lake for Antalya Province, this study has great importance. In this study, physical and chemical analyses of water samples taken from 21 locations (in October 2011 and May 2012, two periods) through flow path of the river were investigated. The analysis results were compared with maximum permissible limit values recommended by World Health Organization and Turkish drinking water standards. The water quality for drinking purpose was evaluated using the water quality index (WQI) method. The computed WQI values are between 35.6133 and 337.5198 in the study. The prepared WQI map shows that Karacaoren-1 Dam Lake generally has good water quality. However, Water quality is poor and very poor in the north and south of the river basin. The effects of punctual and diffuse pollutants dominate the water quality in these regions. Furthermore, the most effective water quality parameters are COD and Mg on the determination of WQI for the present study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Nunes, JP; Jacinto, R; Keizer, JJ				Nunes, Joao Pedro; Jacinto, Rita; Keizer, Jan Jacob			Combined impacts of climate and socio-economic scenarios on irrigation water availability for a dry Mediterranean reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The impacts of climate and associated socio-economic changes on water availability, including supply and demand, quality, and storage volume, were evaluated for the Vale do Gaio reservoir in southern Portugal, located in a dry Mediterranean climate and already under drought stress. The SWAT model was applied with 6 scenarios for 2071-2100, involving two storylines (A1B and B1) with individual changes in climate (9% rainfall, increasing in winter by +28 to +30%), socio-economic conditions (an increase in irrigation demand by 11%, and a replacement of cereals and pastures by sunflower), and a combination of both. Most future scenarios resulted in lower water availability, due to lower supply (19 to 27%) combined with higher irrigation demand (+3 to + 21%). This resulted in more years with limited irrigation supplies (presently: 28%; scenarios: 37 to 43%), although limitations were mitigated by lower losses to excess discharge. Land-use changes also decreased quality by increasing P concentrations (+29 to +93%). Impacts were more severe in scenario A1B than in Bl, and in combined changes than in climate or socio-economic changes only. Water availability was resilient to climate change, as impacts led only to a moderate aggravation Of present-day conditions. Lower future water availability could be addressed by supply and demand management strategies and, in the most extreme scenario, by water transfers from regional water reserves; water quality issues could be addressed through land-use policies. Results also highlighted the importance of taking the characteristics of water supply systems into account when designing adaptation measures for future changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Whilst existing research has examined the factors influencing ambient air pollutant concentrations, previous studies have failed to adequately explore the determinants of such concentrations from either a source or diffusion perspective. This study addressed both source (specifically, anthropogenic emissions) and diffusion (namely, meteorological conditions) indicators, in order to detect their respective impacts on the spatial variations seen in the distribution of air pollution. Spatial panel data for 113 major cities in China Was processed using a range of global regression models the ordinary least square model, the spatial lag model, and the spatial error model as well as a local, geographic weighted regression (GWR) model. Results from the study suggest that in 2014, average SO2 concentrations exceeded China's first-level target. The most polluted cities were found to be predominantly located in northern China, while less polluted cities were located in southern China. Global regression results indicated that precipitation exerts a significant effect on SO2 reduction (p < 0.001) and that a regional increase of 1 mm in precipitation can reduce SO2 concentrations by 0.026 mu g/m(3). Both emission and temperature factors were found to aggravate SO2 concentrations, although ho such significant correlation was found in relation to wind speed. GWR results suggest that the association between SO2 and its factors varied over space. Increased emissions were found to be able to produce more pollution in the northwest than in other parts of the country. Higher wind speeds and temperatures in northwestern areas were shown to reinforce SO2 pollution, while in southern regions, they had the opposite effect. Further, increased precipitation was found to exert a greater inhibitory effect on SO2 pollution in the country's northeast than that in other areas. Our findings could provide a detailed reference for formulating regionally specific emission reduction policies in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Most of this expansion has occurred over low-intensity pasture and is considered sustainable because it does not involve deforestation of natural vegetation. However, the impacts on the water quality of headwater streams are poorly understood, especially with regard to the influence of land use patterns in the watershed. In this study, we investigated the effects of land-use conversion on the water quality of streams draining sugarcane fields and examined whether the preservation of forested areas at the top of the headwaters would help mitigate the negative impacts of intensive agriculture. Water samples were collected in two paired catchments in southeastern Brazil, which is one of the largest sugarcane production regions in the world. Our results show significant differences in the water quality of streams predominantly draining the pasture or the sugarcane field. SeVeral parameters commonly used to indicate water quality, such as the concentrations of nitrate and suspended solids, were significantly higher in the sugarcane than in the pasture stream. Differences in water quality between the streams draining predominantly pasture or sugarcane fields were accentuated during the wet season. The preservation of forests surrounding the headwater streams was associated with overall better water quality conditions, such as lower nitrate concentrations and temperature of the stream water. We concluded that forest conservation in the headwater agricultural catchments is an important factor preventing water quality degradation in tropical streams. Therefore, we strongly recommend the preservation of robust riparian forests in the headwaters of tropical watersheds with intensive agriculture. More studies on the effects of best agricultural practices in bioenergy crops can greatly improve our capacity to prevent the degradation of water quality in the tropical waterways as intensive agriculture continues to expand in this region of the world.

An Imhoff tank was followed by three stages of CWs (two 1.5m(2) vertical subsurface flow (VF) beds alternating feed-rest cycles, a 2-m(2) horizontal (HF) and a 2-m2 free water surface (FWS) wetland in series). A fraction of the final effluent was recycled back to the Imhoff tank with a recirculation rate of 50% (hydraulic loading rate = 0.37 m d(-1)). The system's performance varied throughout the study. In Period I (summer) consistently high load removal efficiencies of TN (89 +/- 5%) and a removal rate of 6.6 +/- 1.4 g TN m(-2) d(-1) were exhibited. In Period II (fall), the poor performance of the FWS during the senescence of macrophytes caused a large increase in organic matter, solids and nutrient concentrations, drastically deteriorating water quality. The determination of PPCPs was conducted during this period. Recalcitrant compounds, namely sulfamethoxazole, carbamazapine, TCEP and sucralose were negligibly removed in all CWs. However, noteworthy was the;approximate to 30%removal of sucralose in the VF wetland. Caffeine (80%) and fluoxetine (27%) showed similar elimination rates in both VF and HF units, whereas trimethoprim and DEET were significantly better removed in the VF than in the HF. The concentration of the four latter compounds showed a severe increase in the FWS, indicating possible desorption from the sediment/biomass during adverse conditions. Harvesting of the aboveground biomass in this unit returned the system 's performance back to normality (Period III), achieving 77 +/- 7% TN removal despite the winter season, proving effluent recirculation as an effective strategy for TN removal in hybrid CW systems when stringent restrictions are in place.

Long-term assessment at field scale of Floating Treatment Wetlands for improvement of water quality and provision of ecosystem services in a eutrophic urban pond	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Pollution of urban water bodies requires stringent control measures and the development of low-cost and highly efficient alternative technologies. In contrast to Constructed Wetlands, Floating Treatment Wetlands (FTWs) have the advantage of not requiring large surface of land since they operate in situ. However, there is limited information about their long-term evaluation while operating at field scale. The aim of this work was to assess the performance of FTWs using a combination of Pontederia sagittata and Cyperus papyrus for the improvement of the water quality and provision of ecosystem services of a eutrophic urban pond. The FTWs were built with low-cost material easy to acquire and to ensemble. Two FTWs (175 m(2) and 33 m(2)) located in Pond 1 within a complex of 4 urban artificial ponds were evaluated for two years. They promoted an increase in the dissolved oxygen (DD.) within a range of 15 to 67%, a removal of fecal coliforms in the range of 9 to 86% and a nitrate removal in the range of 9 to 76%. The plant productivity reached a maximum of 363 g(dm) m(-2) d(-1) in the FTWI and 536 g(dm) m(-2) d(-1) in the FTW2 during the period March-June 2016. The TKN and the TP content in the plant were in the range of 183 to 28.1 and of 0.05 to 0.196 g kg(-1) city matter, respectively. In conclusion, the tested FTWs have proved to be a very beneficial low-cost technology for the improvement of water quality and provision of ecosystem services. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, studies on phytoplankton growth in tropical lotic systems are still limited. Citizen science approaches use trained volunteers to collect environmental data. We combined data on urban streams collected by volunteers with data obtained by professional scientists to identify potential drivers of phytoplankton community and determine thresholds for Cyanobacteria development. We combined datasets (n = 117) on water quality and environmental observations in 64 Brazilian urban streams with paired data on phytoplankton. Sampling activities encompassed dry (July 2013 and July 2015) and warm (February and November 2014) seasons. Volunteers quantified phosphate (PO43-), nitrate (NO3-) and turbidity in each stream using colorimetric and optical methods and recorded environmental conditions in the immediate surroundings of the sites through visual observations. We used non-parametric statistics to identify correlations among nutrients, turbidity and phytoplankton. We also looked for thresholds with respect to high Cyanobacteria abundance (>50,000 cells/mL). The streams were characterized by relatively high nutrient concentrations (PO43- : 0.11 mg/L; NO3-: 2.6 mg/L) and turbidity (49 NTU). Phytoplanlcton densities reached 189,000 cells/mL, mainly potentially toxic Cyanobacteria species. Moderate but significant (p < 0.05) correlations were observed between phytoplankton density and turbidity (rho = 0.338, Spearman) and PO43- (rho = 0292), but not with NO3-. Other important variables (river flow, temperature and light) were not assessed. Volunteers' observations covaried with phytoplankton density (p < 0.05, Krusl<alWallis), positively with increasing number of pollution sources and negatively with presence of vegetation in the riparian zone. Our results indicate that thresholds for PO43- (0.11 mg/L) can be used to separate systems with high Cyanobacteria density. The number of pollution sources provided a good indicator of waterbodies with potential cyanobacteria problems. Our findings reinforced the need for nutrient abatement and restoration of local streams and highlighted the benefits of volunteer-based monitoring to support decision-making. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, there is only limited information to evaluate the spatial and temporal changes to the Huangpu River and its many tributaries. In the present study, 400 citizen scientists were trained to monitor water quality and environmental conditions on a monthly basis over three years in the lower (high urbanized) Huangpu River catchment. Their data were integrated with high resolution land cover data using GIS techniques to characterize water quality dynamics of the Huangpu River system with respect to main environmental drivers. Environmental driver analysis indicated that up-catchment conditions dominate river dynamics while typical urban impacts (first flush, impermeable land cover...) have only limited influence. According to these results, the city's investments to improve wastewater treatment and mitigate lower river impacts need to be extended throughout the catchment to reduce nutrient concentrations that are near or above thresholds for rivers and streams. The positive impact of in-stream vegetatibn pointed to the possibilities that local scale ecological remediation activities to reduce runoff could be viable approaches to improve river conditions throughout the catchment.

We present a comprehensive dataset of arsenic concentrations from drinking water wells in rural Burkina Faso (n = 1498), of which 14.6% are above 10 mu g/L. Included in this dataset are 269 new samples from regions where no published water quality data existed. We used multivariate logistic regression with arsenic measurements as calibration data and maps of geology and mineral deposits as independent predictor variables to create arsenic prediction models at concentration thresholds of 5,10 and 50 mu/L. These hazard maps delineate areas vulnerable to groundwater arsenic contamination in Burkina Faso. Bedrock composed of schists and volcanic rocks of the Birimian formation, potentially harbouring arsenic-containing sulphide minerals, has the highest probability of yielding groundwater arsenic concentrations >10 mu g/L. Combined with population density estimates, the arsenic prediction models indicate that -560,000 people are potentially exposed to arsenic-contaminated groundwater in Burkina Faso. The same arsenic-bearing geological formations that are positive predictors for elevated arsenic concentrations in Burkina Faso also exist in neighbouring countries such as Mali, Ghana and Ivory Coast. This study's results are thus of transboundary relevance and can act as a trigger for targeted water quality surveys and mitigation efforts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis as a dissolved organic monitoring tool to assess treatment performance in drinking water trains	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Fluorescence excitation emission matrix (FEEM) spectroscopy was used to evaluate its applicability as a tool to track dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) that incorporates a conventional line (consisting in ozonation and GAC filtration) and a membrane-based line (consisting in ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis and mineralization) Working in parallel. Seven sampling points within the different process stages were characterized monthly during 2014. A global Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) was used to pull out underlying organic fractions from the fluorescence spectra. Accordingly a five components model was selected to describe the system and the pros and cons of the model were discussed by analysis of the residuals. Among the five fluorescent components, those associated to humic-like matter (C1, C3 and C4) showed a similar season variability in the river water feeding the DWTP (which resembled that of UV254 and TOC), whereas the two components associated to protein-like matter (C2 and C5) exhibited a different behavior. The maximum fluorescence intensity values (Fmax) were used to quantify DOM removals across the plant. Compared to the conventional line, water from the UF/RO membrane-based line showed between 6 and 14 times lower fluorescence intensity signal for the humic-like components and between 1 and 3 for the protein-like components as compared to the conventional line. The differences in DOM composition due to seasonal variations and along the treatment trains point out the suitability of using fluorescence measurements over other parameters such as UV254 as a monitoring tool to help optimize operation conditions of each treatment stage and improve produced water quality in a DWFP.

Prioritising local action for water quality improvement using citizen science; a study across three major metropolitan areas of China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Streams in urban areas are prone to degradation. While urbanization-induced poor water quality is a widely observed and well documented phenomenon, the mechanism to pinpoint local drivers of urban stream degradation, and their relative influence on water quality, is still lacking. Utilizing data from the citizen science project FreshWater Watch, we use a machine learning approach to identify key indicators, potential drivers, and potential controls to water quality across the metropolitan areas of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Partial dependencies were examined to establish the direction of relationships between predictors and water quality. A random forest classification model indicated that predictors of stream water colour (drivers related to artificial land coverage and agricultural land use coverage) and potential controls related to the presence of bankside vegetation were found to be important in identifying basins with degraded water quality conditions, based on individual measurements of turbidity and nutrient (N-NO3 and P-PO4) concentrations.

However, little is known about the abundance or temporal variation of major ions in urban runoff. This study explores the spatio-temporal variation of major dissolved ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, NO3, and SO4) and total dissolved solids (TDS) in cold climate urban stormwater. Three watersheds with varying degrees of urban land use intensity and imperviousness (from 36% to 66%) in Helsinki, Finland, were continuously monitored for 5 years using an automated sampling procedure to obtain stormwater discharge and ion concentrations and, thus, loadings. High-resolution datasets, including long-term continuous discharge, both measured and simulated (using Storm Water Management Model), and automatic water quality sampling enabled the accurate calculation of loads of ions and TDS. Water quality was related to explanatory watershed characteristics (e.g., watershed physiography and sampling time) using hierarchical clustering, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and hierarchical partitioning methods. Urban land use contributed to increased ion concentrations and loads year-round. This study highlights how stormwater ion concentrations are elevated across seasons, indicating chronic pollution phenomena. The greatest loads occurred during summer (except for Na and Cl), while the highest variation in loads was observed in autumn. Significant clusters among ions were found in the hierarchical cluster analysis, suggesting similar temporal patterns and sources for the ions in each cluster. The importance of land use was evident, though in the most urbanized watershed, concentrations were not linked to any of the investigated watershed characteristics. Based on our results, only Na and Cl are manageable by alternative winter road antiskid practices, whereas other ions resulted from diffuse pollution sources, being therefore more difficult to control. Finally, this study contributes to an increased understanding of the temporal and spatial patterns of ions in stormwater and highlights the need for consistent time series data for ion monitoring under cold climatic conditions in order to enable reliable estimates of their loads to adjacent water bodies. Finally, year-round stormwater treatment is highly recommended.

Effects of reservoir stratification and watershed hydrology on manganese and iron in a dam-regulated river	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The presence of metals, including manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe), adversely impacts water quality. In seasonally stratified reservoirs, Mn and Fe can accumulate in the water column due to reducing conditions in sediments and be released to downstream rivers through dam discharge. In addition to reservoir stratification influences, the release of metals downstream is influenced by hydrologic conditions in the river. We examined the seasonal and spatial variability of Mn and Fe concentrations in a eutrophic, hydropower reservoir and the downstream river over a two-year period. Overall, we found that reservoir stratification was a strong predictor of tailrace Mn and Fe concentrations but that tailrace Fe concentrations were also influenced by dam discharge. Downgradient of the tailrace, river discharge and suspended sediment were the dominant predictors of both Mn and Fe concentrations. Using our data, we develop a conceptual model of seasonal and hydrologic drivers of metal concentrations. The model can be modified for other systems aiding drinking water utilities and other water users in forecasting under what seasonal and hydrologic conditions that Mn and Fe concentrations in river systems are likely to be elevated.

Loss of ecosystem services due to chronic pollution of forests and surface waters in the Adirondack region (USA)	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Sustaining recent progress in mitigating acid pollution could require lower emissions caps that will give rise to real or perceived tradeoffs between healthy ecosystems and inexpensive energy. Because most impacts of acid rain affect ecosystem functions that are poorly understood by policy-makers and the public, an ecosystem services (ES) framework can help to measure how pollution affects human wellbeing. Focused on the Adirondack region (USA), a global 'hot-spot' of acid pollution, we measured how the chronic acidification of the region's forests, lakes, and streams has affected the potential economic and cultural benefits they provide to society. We estimated that acid-impaired hardwood forests provide roughly half of the potential benefits of forests on moderate to well-buffered soils an estimated loss of $10,000 ha(-1) in net present value of wood products, maple syrup, carbon sequestration, and visual quality. Acidic deposition has had only nominal impact relative to the effects of surficial geology and till depth on the capacity of Adirondack lakes and streams to provide water suitable for drinking. However, as pH declines in lakes, the estimated value of recreational fishing decreases significantly due to loss of desirable fish such as trout. Hatchery stocking programs have partially offset the pollution-mediated losses of fishery value, most effectively in the pH range 4.8-5.5, but are costly and limited in scope. Although any estimates of the monetary 'damages' of acid rain have significant uncertainties, our findings highlight some of the more tangible economic and cultural benefits of pollution mitigation efforts, which continue to face litigation and political opposition.

A macroalgae-based biotechnology for water remediation: Simultaneous removal of Cd, Pb and Hg by living Ulva lactuca	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Metal uptake from contaminated waters by living Ulva lactuca was studied during 6 days, under different relevant contamination scenarios. In mono-metallic solutions, with concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mu g L-1 for Hg, 10-200 mu g L-1 for Cd, and 50-1000 mu g L-1 for Pb, macroalgae (500 mg L-1, d.w.) were able to remove, in most cases 93-99% of metal, allowing to achieve water quality criteria regarding both surface and drinking waters. In multi-metallic solutions, comprising simultaneously the three metals, living macroalgae still performed well, with Hg removal (c.a. 99%) not being significantly affected by the presence of Cd and Pb, even when those metals were in higher concentrations. Removal efficiencies for Cd and Pb varied between 57 and 96%, and 34-97%, respectively, revealing an affinity of U. lactuca toward metals: Hg > Cd > Pb. Chemical quantification in macroalgae, after bioaccumulation assays demonstrated that all Cd and Hg removed from solution was really bound in macroalgae biomass, while only half of Pb showed to be sorbed on the biomass. Overall, U. lactuca accumulated up to 209 mu g g(-1) of Hg, up to 347 mu g g(-1) of Cd and up to 1641 mu g g(-1) of Pb, which correspond to bioconcentration factors ranging from 500 to 2200, in a dose-dependent accumulation. Pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and Elovich models showed a good performance in describing the kinetics of bioaccumulation, in the whole period of time. In the range of experimental conditions used, no mortality was observed and U. lactuca relative growth rate was not significantly affected by the presence of metals.

Synthetic waters were prepared using realistic ranges of F, IC and HA for carbonaceous waters found for example in the fluoride rich waters in Tanzania. These waters were filtered using NF270 and BW30 membranes to determine retention mechanisms. IC changes speciation with pH. The dominant species at pH < 6, 6-10 and > 10 are H2CO3, HCO3 and CO32- respectively. This results in changes in charge and size of the hydrated ion radius. The mechanism for IC retention by the NF270 and BW30 membranes are charge repulsion and size exclusion, respectively. F retention increases with pH. IC influenced F retention at pH > 10 where IC exists as divalent CO32- and is retained more easily than the monovalent F. HA enhances the retention of F by NF/RO membranes under certain conditions. The enhancement effect is more pronounced at neutral than at acidic pH and basic pH. The mechanism for the enhancement is attributed to the change in surface charge of the membranes by adsorption of HA. At high HA concentration the F retention enhancement is annulled by deposit formation on the membrane. The results obtained in this study indicate the complexity of retention in real surface- and ground waters that can alter significantly in pH as well as IC and HA content. The research is situated in the context of developing membrane technologies for autonomous systems in remote locations where water quality is variable and mechanisms of membrane performance are poorly understood.

J	Kenari, SLD; Barbeau, B				Kenari, Seyedeh Laleh Dashtban; Barbeau, Benoit			Integrated pyrolucite fluidized bed-membrane hybrid process for improved iron and manganese control in drinking water	WATER RESEARCH												Newly developed ceramic membrane technologies offer numerous advantages over the conventional polymeric membranes. This work proposes a new configuration, an integrated pyrolucite fluidized bed (PFB)-ceramic MOH hybrid process, for improved iron and manganese control in drinking water. A pilot-scale study was undertaken to evaluate the performance of this process with respect to iron and manganese control as well as membrane fouling. In addition, the fouling of commercially available ceramic membranes in conventional preoxidation-MF/UF process was compared with the hybrid process configuration. In this regard, a series of experiments were conducted under different influent water quality and operating conditions. Fouling mechanisms and reversibility were analyzed using blocking law and resistance-in-series models. The results evidenced that the flux rate and the concentration of calcium and humic acids in the feed water have a substantial impact on the filtration behavior of both membranes. The model for constant flux compressible cake formation well described the rise in trans membrane pressure. The compressibility of the filter cake substantially increased in the presence of 2 mg/L humic acids. The presence of calcium ions caused significant aggregation of manganese dioxide and humic acid which severely impacted the extent of membrane fouling. The PFB pretreatment properly alleviated membrane fouling by removing more than 75% and 95% of iron and manganese, respectively. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Keupers, I; Willems, P				Keupers, Ingrid; Willems, Patrick			Development and testing of a fast conceptual river water quality model	WATER RESEARCH												Modern, model based river quality management strongly relies on river water quality models to simulate the temporal and spatial evolution of pollutant concentrations in the water body. Such models are typically constructed by extending detailed hydrodynamic models with a component describing the advection-diffusion and water quality transformation processes in a detailed, physically based way. This approach is too computational time demanding, especially when simulating long time periods that are needed for statistical analysis of the results or when model sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation require a large number of model runs. To overcome this problem, a structure identification method to set up a conceptual river water quality model has been developed. Instead of calculating the water quality concentrations at each water level and discharge node, the river branch is divided into conceptual reservoirs based on user information such as location of interest and boundary inputs. These reservoirs are modelled as Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) and Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) to describe advection and diffusion processes. The same water quality transformation processes as in the detailed models are considered but with adjusted residence times based on the hydrodynamic simulation results and calibrated to the detailed water quality simulation results. The developed approach allows for a much faster calculation time (factor 10(5)) without significant loss of accuracy, making it feasible to perform time demanding scenario runs.

Effect of advanced oxidation on N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation and microbial ecology during pilot-scale biological activated carbon filtration	WATER RESEARCH												Water treatment combining advanced oxidative processes with subsequent exposure to biological activated carbon (BAC) holds promise for the attenuation of recalcitrant pollutants. Here we contrast oxidation and subsequent biofiltration of treated wastewater effluent employing either ozone or UV/ H202 followed by BAC during pilot-scale implementation. Both treatment trains largely met target water quality goals by facilitating the removal of a suite of trace organics and bulk water parameters. Nnitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation was observed in ozone fed BAC columns during biofiltration and to a lesser extent in UV/H2O2 fed columns and was most pronounced at 20 min of empty bed contact time (EBCT) when compared to shorter EBCTs evaluated. While microbial populations were highly similar in the upper reaches, deeper samples revealed a divergence within and between BAC filtration systems where EBCT was identified to be a significant environmental predictor for shifts in microbial populations. The abundance of Nitrospira in the top samples of both columns provides an explanation for the oxidation of nitrite and corresponding increases in nitrate concentrations during BAC transit and support interplay between nitrogen cycling with nitrosamine formation. The results of this study demonstrate that pretreatments using ozone versus UV/H2O2 impart modest differences to the overall BAC microbial population structural and functional attributes, and further highlight the need to evaluate NDMA formation prior to full-scale implementation of BAC in potable reuse applications.

Flow cytometric bacterial cell counts challenge conventional heterotrophic plate counts for routine microbiological drinking water monitoring	WATER RESEARCH												Drinking water utilities and researchers continue to rely on the century-old heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) method for routine assessment of general microbiological water quality. Bacterial cell counting with flow cytometry (FCM) is one of a number of alternative methods that challenge this status quo and provide an opportunity for improved water quality monitoring. After more than a decade of application in drinking water research, FCM methodology is optimised and established for routine application, supported by a considerable amount of data from multiple full-scale studies. Bacterial cell concentrations obtained by FCM enable quantification of the entire bacterial community instead of the minute fraction of cultivable bacteria detected with HPC (typically < 1% of all bacteria). FCM measurements are reproducible with relative standard deviations below 3% and can be available within 15 min of samples arriving in the laboratory. High throughput sample processing and complete automation are feasible and FCM analysis is arguably less expensive than HPC when measuring more than 15 water samples per day, depending on the laboratory and selected staining procedure(s). Moreover, many studies have shown FCM total (TCC) and intact (ICC) cell concentrations to be reliable and robust process variables, responsive to changes in the bacterial abundance and relevant for characterising and monitoring drinking water treatment and distribution systems. The purpose of this critical review is to initiate a constructive discussion on whether FCM could replace HPC in routine water quality monitoring. We argue that FCM provides a faster, more descriptive and more representative quantification of bacterial abundance in drinking water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tang, SY; Zhang, ZH; Zhang, XH				Tang, Shengyin; Zhang, Zhenghua; Zhang, Xihui			New insight into the effect of mixed liquor properties changed by pre-ozonation on ceramic UF membrane fouling in wastewater treatment	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												The effect of mixed liquor properties changed by ozonation especially with high dosages on membrane fouling is very complex and remains unclear. In this study, the effect of mixed liquor properties changed by ozonation especially with high dosages on ceramic ultrafiltration (UF) membrane fouling in wastewater treatment and the corresponding mechanism were systematically studied by characterization of the mixed liquor properties, hydraulic performance, the fouling layers and modeling at different ozone dosages (0, 2, 5, 10 mg/L). The membrane filterability of the mixed liquor after pre-ozonation (<= 5 mg/ L) was enhanced and the corresponding membrane fouling was mitigated. After pre-ozonation, activated sludge had the better settleability and larger floc size. Meanwhile, there was a remarkable reduction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soluble microbial products (SMP) and extractable extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS) after pre-ozonation and the removed organics were mainly belonged to the high molecular weight (MW) (1-10 kDa) and very high MW (10-200 kDa) substances. Intermediate blocking was the main membrane fouling during the mixed liquor filtration process and the best fouling mitigation performance was achieved for the sample with an intermediate ozone dosage of 5 mg/L (1.7 mg-ozone/g-mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)). Meanwhile, the water quality of permeate was even better after pre-ozonation (<= 5 mg/L) with the lower DOC and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations. Severe cell lysis occurred with the significant increase of the released organics in the mixed liquor and the activated sludge had smaller floc size and worse settleability when the pre-ozonation dosage was above 10 mg/L, which in turn resulted in the deteriorated membrane fouling control performance.

However, there is a paucity of research that couples functional measures with assessments of ecosystem structure. In mid-sized and large rivers, effects of restoration on key ecosystem processes, such as ecosystem metabolism, have rarely been addressed and remain poorly understood. We compared three reaches of the third-order, gravel-bed river Ruhr in Germany: two reaches restored with moderate (R1) and substantial effort (R2) and one upstream degraded reach (D). Hydromorphology, habitat composition, and hydrodynamics were assessed. We estimated gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) using the one-station open-channel diel dissolved oxygen change method over a 50-day period at the end of each reach. Moreover, we estimated metabolic rates of the combined restored reaches (R1 + R2) using the two-station open-channel method. Values for hydromorphological variables increased with restoration intensity (D < R1 < R2). Restored reaches had lower current velocity, higher longitudinal dispersion and larger transient storage zones. However, fractions of median travel time due to transient storage were highest in R1 and lowest in R2, with intermediate values in D. The share of macrophyte cover of total wetted area was highest in R2 and lowest in R1, with intermediate values in D. Station R2 had higher average GPP and ER than R1 and D. The combined restored reaches R1 C R2 also exhibited higher GPP and ER than the degraded upstream river (station D). Restoration increased river autotrophy, as indicated by elevated GPP : ER, and net ecosystem production (NEP) of restored reaches. Temporal patterns of ER closely mirrored those of GPP, pointing to the importance of autochthonous production for ecosystem functioning. In conclusion, high reach-scale restoration effort had considerable effects on river hydrodynamics and ecosystem functioning, which were mainly related to massive stands of macrophytes. High rates of metabolism and the occurrence of dense macrophyte stands may increase the assimilation of dissolved nutrients and the sedimentation of particulate nutrients, thereby positively affecting water quality.

Microbial quality of agricultural water in Central Florida	PLOS ONE												The microbial quality of water that comes into the edible portion of produce is believed to directly relate to the safety of produce, and metrics describing indicator organisms are commonly used to ensure safety. The US FDA Produce Safety Rule (PSR) sets very specific microbiological water quality metrics for agricultural water that contacts the harvestable portion of produce. Validation of these metrics for agricultural water is essential for produce safety. Water samples (500 mL) from six agricultural ponds were collected during the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 growing seasons (46 and 44 samples respectively, 540 from all ponds). Microbial indicator populations (total coliforms, generic Escherichia coli, and enterococci) were enumerated, environmental variables (temperature, pH, conductivity, redox potential, and turbidity) measured, and pathogen presence evaluated by PCR. Salmonella isolates were serotyped and analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Following rain events, coliforms increased up to 4.2 log MPN/100 mL. Populations of coliforms and enterococci ranged from 2 to 8 and 1 to 5 log MPN/100 mL, respectively. Microbial indicators did not correlate with environmental variables, except pH (P < 0.0001). The invA gene (Salmonella) was detected in 26/540 (4.8%) samples, in all ponds and growing seasons, and 14 serotypes detected. Six STEC genes were detected in samples: hly (83.3%), fliC (51.8%), eaeA (17.4%), rfbE (17.4%), stx-I (32.6%), stx-II (9.4%). While all ponds met the PSR requirements, at least one virulence gene from Salmonella (invA-4.8%) or STEC (stx-I-32.6%, stx-II-9.4%) was detected in each pond. Water quality for tested agricultural ponds, below recommended standards, did not guarantee the absence of pathogens. Investigating the relationships among physicochemical attributes, environmental factors, indicator microorganisms, and pathogen presence allows researchers to have a greater understanding of contamination risks from agricultural surface waters in the field.

J	Frolich, L; Vaizel-Ohayon, D; Fishbain, B				Frolich, Levi; Vaizel-Ohayon, Dalit; Fishbain, Barak			Prediction of Bacterial Contamination Outbursts in Water Wells through Sparse Coding	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Maintaining water quality is critical for any water distribution company. One of the major concerns in water quality assurance, is bacterial contamination in water sources. To date, bacteria growth models cannot predict with sufficient accuracy when a bacteria outburst will occur in a water well. This is partly due to the natural sparsity of the bacteria count time series, which hinders the observation of deviations from normal behavior. This precludes the application of mathematical models nor statistical quality control methods for the detection of high bacteria counts before contamination occurs. As a result, currently a future outbreak prediction is a subjective process. This research developed a new cost-effective method that capitalizes on the sparsity of the bacteria count time series. The presented method first transforms the data into its spectral representation, where it is no longer sparse. Capitalizing on the spectral representation the dimensions of the problem are reduced. Machine learning methods are then applied on the reduced representations for predicting bacteria outbursts from the bacterial counts history of a well. The results show that these tools can be implemented by the water quality engineering community to create objective, more robust, quality control techniques to ensure safer water distribution.

Benthic Diatom Based Indices for Water Quality Assessment in Two Subtropical Streams	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Benthic diatoms have been universally used as indicators to assess water quality in lotic ecosystems. However, most diatom-based indices developed in Europe have not been widely used or tested in other continents such as Asia or Oceania. This study compared the performance of 14 widely-applied diatom indices in assessing ecological conditions in subtropical streams in South East Queensland (SEQ) in Australia and in the upper Han River in China. Most water quality variables in the upper Han River including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) had strong relationships with at least one diatom index, with the exception of IDAP (Index Diatom Artois-Picardie), and TDI (Trophic Diatom Index). However, in SEQ, most of the environmental variables including DOC, ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), TN, SRP, and electrical conductivity (EC) showed no significant relationships with diatom indices, and the DI-CH (Swiss Diatom Index) and WAT (Watanabe's Index) were unrelated to any of the variables examined. Only pH and nitrite or nitrate nitrogen (NOX-N) were significant predictors of several diatom indices in SEQ, especially TID ( Rott trophic index). In the upper Han River, much of the spatial variation in most diatom indices was explained by proximate determinants alone, including EC, DOC, dissolved oxygen (DO) or SRP, or a combination of ultimate (canopy, forest) and proximate factors (R-2 in most models > 0.75). Most diatom indices performed as predicted in the upper Han River where nutrient and organic matter pollution was relatively high, and variation in pH low. However, the indices performed poorly in SEQ where the water quality gradient was low and instead most responded to spatial variation in pH. This finding serves as a caution to the application of diatom indices in river basins that fall outside of the range of water quality values of the systems in which they originally developed.

Reservoirs are suspected to be particularly vulnerable to microplastic pollution. However, very limited information is currently available on pollution characteristics of microplastics in reservoir ecosystems. This work studied the distribution and characteristics of micro plastics in the backwater area of Xiangxi River, a typical tributary of the Three Gorges Reservoir. Microplastics were detected in both surface water and sediment with concentrations ranging from 0.55 X 10(5) to 342 X 10(5) items km(-2) and 80 to 864 items m(-2), respectively. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene were identified in surface water, whereas polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate, and pigments were observed in sediment. In addition, microplastics were also detected in the digestion tracts of 25.7% of fish samples, and polyethylene and nylon were identified. Redundancy analysis indicates a weak correlation between microplastics and water quality variables but a negative correlation with water level of the reservoir and Secchi depth. Results from this study confirm the presence of high abundance microplastics in reservoir impacted tributaries, and suggest that water level regulated hydrodynamic condition and input of nonpoint sources are important regulators for microplastic accumulation and distribution in the backwater area of reservoir tributaries.

Extreme hypoxic conditions along the coast, leading to what are often referred to as "dead zones," are known primarily from temperate regions. However, little is known about the potential threat of hypoxia in the tropics, even though the known risk factors, including eutrophication and elevated temperatures, are common. Here we document an unprecedented hypoxic event on the Caribbean coast of Panama and assess the risk of dead zones to coral reefs worldwide. The event caused coral bleaching and massive mortality of corals and other reef-associated organisms, but observed shifts in community structure combined with laboratory experiments revealed that not all coral species are equally sensitive to hypoxia. Analyses of global databases showed that coral reefs are associated with more than half of the known tropical dead zones worldwide, with >10% of all coral reefs at elevated risk for hypoxia based on local and global risk factors. Hypoxic events in the tropics and associated mortality events have likely been underreported, perhaps by an order of magnitude, because of the lack of local scientific capacity for their detection. Monitoring and management plans for coral reef resilience should incorporate the growing threat of coastal hypoxia and include support for increased detection and research capacity.

In 2015, two city canal swimming events took place, in Utrecht (Utrecht Singel Swim, USS) and in Amsterdam (Amsterdam City Swim, ACS). This prospective study characterizes the health risks associated with swimming in urban waters. Online questionnaires were sent to 160 (USS) and 2,692 (ACS) participants, with relatives of participants who did not swim completing the questionnaire as a control. Swimming water specimens and stool specimens of diarrheic participants in the ACS group were analysed. A total of 49% of USS and 51% of ACS swimmers returned their questionnaires. Nine percent of USS swimmers and 4% of non-swimmers reported gastrointestinal complaints (aRR 2.1; 95% CI: 0.3-16), while a total of 31% of ACS swimmers and 5% of non-swimmers reported gastrointestinal complaints (aRR 6.3; 95% CI: 4.1-9.5). AGI risk among ACS participants was directly related to increasing number of mouthfuls of water swallowed. Various norovirus genotypes were detected in five out of seven stool specimens taken from ACS participants and in all three tested ACS water samples. We conclude that the AGI risk among open-water swimmers in urban areas depends on the circumstances around the event. The epidemiological curve, the statistical association between swimming and AGI, and the microbiological evidence for norovirus in stool and water specimens suggest that AGI outbreak after the ACS event was due to water contamination by multiple norovirus strains, which is possibly linked to sewage overflow due to prior heavy rainfall.

In order to understand advection and dispersion of pollutants in the area, a coastal hydrodynamic model of Batu Ferringhi beach was developed in this study by taking into consideration its wind, tide, coastal current and riverine runoff. The model was calibrated and validated through observations from adjacent coastal monitoring stations. Simulation was then carried out to investigate scenario of the constituent water quality which originates from the three rivers in the vicinity. Results showed high concentrations of water quality parameters observed near the headland towards the northeast of the study area, with intermittent patchy escape which may retain more than one-third the initial concentrations, weighted by the river discharge. Even more worrying is that localised trapping of up to three-quarter the initial weighted concentrations also occurs at the beach, owing to the interactions between river flow and longshore current.																	0128-7680					APR	2017	25				SI		103	114										WOS:000426364200011

The issue of mosquito breeding in rainwater storage tanks often occurs that caused dengue problem. This issue occurs due to improper rainwater harvesting system. Majority people in rural areas do not apply a proper rainwater harvesting system. A proper rainwater harvesting system should be installed with the filtering system. Filtration should be used for maintaining water quality and to prevent the mosquitoes larvae from entering the storage tanks. In this study, samples are collected from four (4) different rainwater ha rvesting method. Four (4) parameters; water temperature, pH, turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) are tested to evaluate the performance of water quality after the filtration then compared with Drinking Water Quality Standard (DWQS), World Health Organization (WHO) and National Water Quality Standard. The results show that the water quality improved and fulfill the water quality standard after the filtration process. Non-woven geotextile fabrics that used as a filter has proven as medium for mosquitoes larvae filtering system. The result shows that the quality of rainwater is acceptable and the uses of filter in rainwater harvesting system is crucial to get a good quality of rainwater.																	1823-4690					APR	2017	12				SI		181	191										WOS:000419689700017

Among 32 identified tintinnid species, the agglomerated genera Tintinnopsis (20 sp), dominated the community (similar to 62%) followed by Tintinnidium (2 sp), Leprotintinnus (2 sp), Codonellopsis, Stenosemella, Helicostomella, Favella, Eutintinnus, Metacylis, Dadayiellaand Wangiella (each comprising single species). A wide range of seasonal variations in tintinnid abundance was recorded maximum (2067 +/- 893 ind. l(-1)) for Tintinnopsis beroidea and minimum (11 +/- 4 ind. l(-1)) for Metacylis sp. during the investigation period. The biomass and daily production rate of tintinnid ranged from 0.004-2.764 mu g C l(-1) and 0.04-3.54 mu g C l(-1) day(-1) respectively. An overall dominance and diversity of the small-sized tintinnid (lorica length < 76 mu m) belonging to the genera Tintinnopsis sp., Tintinnidium sp., Codonellopsis sp., Wangiella sp., Eutintinnus sp., Metacylis sp. and Helicostomella sp. was pronounced, accounting similar to 66% of the total tintinnid abundance. K-dominance curves were plotted against log rank k, showed species dominance over the investigated sites. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates (CAP) highlighting a significantly different spatial distribution of tintinnid. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) map showed clustering of core species with chl a and nitrate and could be considered as the crucial factors controlling the distribution and seasonal patterns of tintinnid. Biota-environment (BIOENV) analyses also reveal that these two parameters were the significant causative factors, suggesting that tintinnid may be used as a bioindicator for discriminating water quality in this estuarine system. The study provided detailed information of microzooplankton which enhances our understanding regarding its crucial role in marine ecosystem and complex biotic interactions for maintaining the ecological and economic stability.

MACEDONIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES												Biochemical and histopathological analysis for the assessment of the exposure of the aquatic organisms towards the environmental pollution has found a great use in biomonitoring studies of aquatic ecosystems. Biochemical markers, concretely, the liver enzymes of the first phase of transformation of xenobiotics-cytochrome P450 (CYP450), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and the histological markers, concretely, histopathological changes in the liver parenchyma were used in this study to assess the aquatic environmental pollution of the locations of the river Vardar in the Republic of Macedonia. The selected locations of this river were Vardar river near Vrtok - control station (L1), Vardar river in Jegunovce (L2), Vardar river on the outskirts of Skopje (L3) and Vardar river on the outskirts of Veles (L4). As an indicator species was selected Barbus peloponnesius V. High levels of catalytic activity of EROD in the liver of this fish was highlighted in the Vardar river in Jegunovce (141.71 +/- 7.59 pmol min(-1) mg-1 protein), in the Vardar river on the outskirts of Skopje (132.43 +/- 7.16 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein) and in the Vardar river on the outskirts of Velesit (104.34 +/- 8.86 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein), compared to the catalytic level of EROD in the liver of this fish of the control group (2.41 +/- 0.23 pmol min(-1) mg(-1) protein). From the histopathological analysis of the fragments analyzed in the liver parenchyma of these fish which were collected in the bottom flows of the river Vardar were ascertained many histopathological changes. The results of this study authenticate the pollution in localities along the downstream of the river Vardar. The results show that the use of chemical and histological markers for assessing water quality is an appropriate method that can fit with the classical methods of monitoring the pollutants.																	2224-4980					APR	2017	7	2					235	244										WOS:000417182700006						
J	Jorgji, F; Kupe, L				Jorgji, Fiorentina; Kupe, Lirika			POTENTIAL OF TOURISM DEVELOPMENT TO PRESPA NATIONAL PARK	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES												Research has shown that the Prespa Lakes basin's greatest tourism strengths lie in its nature and heritage and that it has a developing ecotourism product. Facilities to foster nature-based and heritage-based tourism exist but the area is suffering from a lack of profile and declining market interest, and the very important domestic market in each country is increasingly holidaying elsewhere. There have been many tourism-related support initiatives in the area in the past, but their sustainability is mostly questionable. There is a need for projects to be more strongly embedded in local institutions which take responsibility for continuing them. The accommodation base in Albania is weak, with some developments in community-based tourism. Solid waste issues undermine tourism potential in Albania especially. National Parks are the area's strongest tourism asset at present and sustainable tourism capacity is strongest within some of these organizations. Seasonality is a major challenge not only in Albania but in all three countries and products and events have not been developed to address this. There is an expanding tourist information Centre (TIC) network that can be built upon. There is no real trans-boundary tourism on offer at present and there are very few private sector tour operations in the area, although some small activity tour operators are developing actually.																	2224-4980					APR	2017	7	2					327	330										WOS:000417182700019

Their aim is to provide a small but comprehensive set of monitoring variables that would give a balanced picture of the development of biodiversity and the reaching of international and national biodiversity targets. Globally, GEO BON (Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network) has suggested 22 candidate EBVs to be monitored. In this article we regard EBVs as a conceptual tool that may help in making national scale biodiversity monitoring more robust by pointing out where to focus further development resources. We look at one country-Finland-with a relatively advanced biodiversity monitoring scheme and study how well Finland's current biodiversity state indicators correspond with EBVs. In particular, we look at how national biodiversity monitoring could be improved by using available remote sensing (RS) applications. Rapidly emerging new technologies from drones to airborne laser scanning and new satellite sensors providing imagery with very high resolution (VHR) open a whole new world of opportunities for monitoring the state of biodiversity and ecosystems at low cost. In Finland, several RS applications already exist that could be expanded into national indicators. These include the monitoring of shore habitats and water quality parameters, among others. We hope that our analysis and examples help other countries with similar challenges. Along with RS opportunities, our analysis revealed also some needs to develop the EBV framework itself.

An attempt, using geo-statistical modeling by ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) procedures, was also made. The results represented that the GWR model with higher S 2, lower residuals without spatial autocorrelation effect and lower RMSE is an optimized geo-statistical model for rainfall modeling of Iran based on ECMWF gridded database. This model can explain spatio-temporal rainfall distribution in Iran in a diversified topographical and geographical background. This model revealed that two high mountain ranges of Zagros and Alborz in west and north, respectively, strikingly affect the temporal and spatial patterns of rainfall. Therefore, the statistical correlation matrix revealed that Iranian rainfall data is dominantly depended on geographical latitude and topographical altitude/slope with 0.56 and 0.32 correlation coefficients, respectively.																	2366-3286	2366-3294				APR	2017	25	2					219	227		10.1007/s41324-017-0097-3								WOS:000413301000006

Accordingly, there is constant necessity for treatment technologies and processes to make likely residue to be launched of aquatic system without changing water quality. The use of anaerobic sequential batch reactor (ASBR) for AMD treatment has shown to be a viable alternative, as sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) reduce sulfate ions to sulfide that may precipitate metals presents in solution or oxidize sulfide produced to elemental sulfur. An ASBR with 7 L was operated at 30 degrees C for the treatment of synthetic AMD containing SO4 2-1500 mg/L, with ratio COD/Sulfate equal 1 and ethanol as carbon source for 270 days with 6 phases containing different concentrations of metals (100-400 mg L-1 of Fe2+, 20-40 mg L-1 of Zn2+, 5-10 mg L-1 of Cu2+), based on values with potential toxicity to SRB. During the operation phases the concentration of metals gave an increase in removal SO42-. COD removal ranged from 68.4 to 94.4% and sulfate from 39.1 to 72.8%. The Fe2+ removals were above 99.2%, Zn2+-100% and Cu2+ above 93.3%. Given the high removal metals and SO42-, ASBR characterized a form suitable for the AMD treatment.

Numerical modeling of simultaneous tracer release and piscicide treatment for invasive species control in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Chicago, Illinois	ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS												In December 2009, during a piscicide treatment targeting the invasive Asian carp in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Rhodamine WT dye was released to track and document the transport and dispersion of the piscicide. In this study, two modeling approaches are presented to reproduce the advection and dispersion of the dye tracer (and piscicide), a one-dimensional analytical solution and a three-dimensional numerical model. The two approaches were compared with field measurements of concentration and their applicability is discussed. Acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements were used to estimate the longitudinal dispersion coefficients at ten cross sections, which were taken as reference for calibrating the longitudinal dispersion coefficient in the one-dimensional analytical solution. While the analytical solution is fast, relatively simple, and can fairly accurately predict the core of the observed concentration time series at points downstream, it does not capture the tail of the breakthrough curves. These tails are well reproduced by the three-dimensional model, because it accounts for the effects of dead zones and a power plant which withdraws nearly 80 % of the water from the canal for cooling purposes before returning it back to the canal.

J	Choi, IK; Park, Y; Yu, JY				Choi, In-Kyu; Park, Youngyun; Yu, Jae-Young			Evaluation for reliability of groundwater quality in Korea	JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA												A few nationwide groundwater databases have been operated in Korea, but they have insufficient and lack-of-credibility water quality data. An appropriate groundwater management requires well equipped databases with reliable water quality data set. This study proposes theoretical and statistical criteria to test the reliability of water quality data. The theoretical criteria are prepared from the scientific reasoning, especially based on geochemical theories. The statistical criteria were set by the threshold values calculated from the Tukey box plot. Application of the criteria reveals that some of the data would be rejected and some others should be reevaluated. Approximately 24,000 dataset was extracted from http://www.groundwater.or.kr and used for the test. The water quality data within the threshold boundaries occupy 60.0 similar to 97.7% of the whole. The confidence range of the pH, ORP, EC, and TDS is 11.0 similar to 21.7 degrees C, 5.1 similar to 8.6, -121 similar to 218 mV (some correction needs), 0.5 similar to 565 mu S/cm, and 0.3 similar to 301 mg/L, respectively. The abnormal values outside threshold limits need to check if there is any determinated error in measurement. The main reasons for having abnormal values are probably incorrect input of the values malfunctioning of the equipments, and lack of the corresponding knowledge. To improve reliability of the dataset, it is necessary to follow verified instructions and guides to practice approach groundwater quality measurement and management, to provide regular training for the minimization of significant errors, to develop a database system being able to automatically screen abnormal values out.																	0435-4036	2288-7377				APR	2017	53	2					303	312		10.14770/jgsk.2017.53.2.303								WOS:000410116900006

We evaluated the statistical distribution and temporal trends of water quality parameters, their relationships with precipitation, the types of groundwater compositions, and the correlation between water qualities and land use. The results showed that nitrate-nitrogen had a statistically-significant positive correlation with precipitation, suggesting that anthropogenic contaminants above the ground surface would infiltrate into groundwater during precipitation. The groundwater at the study areas were mainly classified into Ca-(Cl+NO3) and Ca-HCO3 types. When the nitrate-nitrogen contamination was closely examined in view of land use, it was found to have a stronger correlation with precipitation in residential-agricultural areas than in forest areas. Notably, the concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen, ammonium-nitrogen, and chloride showed no obvious trends along the distance from burial areas to groundwater wells. All of the above results indicate that such environmental variables as land use may have a more prevailing impact on the water qualities around carcass burial areas. This study can be useful in designing the management plan and preparing environmental investigation manuals for the groundwater contamination that is suspected to result from carcass burial.

In Situ Bioremediation Using Sediment Microbial Fuel Cell	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS TOXIC AND RADIOACTIVE WASTE												Contamination of water and sediment in water bodies is caused by the runoff from agriculture fields, and release of untreated/partially treated domestic and industrial wastewaters. Polluted water can affect the health of humans and aquatic organisms, and nutrient discharge can lead to algal blooms. A sustainable solution is required to treat these pollutants to protect future populations from environmental hazards. Sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) is a new technology that has the potential to remediate sediment and water from sluggish water bodies and ponds, and generate some electricity as a byproduct.

J	Schachtschneider, K; Chamier, J; Somerset, V				Schachtschneider, Klaudia; Chamier, Jessica; Somerset, Vernon			Phytostabilization of metals by indigenous riparian vegetation	WATER SA												Given the increasing pressure of man-made activities on riparian zones, the capacity of the riparian vegetation along the Upper Olifants River, South Africa, to phytoextract and phytostabilize aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) from the soil was investigated. The aim of the study was to gain better understanding of the capacity of indigenous vegetation in riparian zones to immobilize metals in the soil, thereby improving river water quality and ecosystem services. Seven commonly-occurring pollution-tolerant riparian plant species were evaluated to establish their potential as bioaccumulators for Fe, Al and Mn. Species included: Cyperus haspan, Schoenoplectus corymbosus, Typha capensis, Phragmites australis, Cynodon dactylon, Cyperus marginatus and Juncus effusus, which were sampled in five riparian areas in the Upper Olifants catchment. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) for Mn was > 1 for all species investigated with a maximum of 5 for Typha capensis, which also showed the highest accumulation of Al (10.26) and Fe (7.03). The remaining species presented with Al and Fe BCF between 0.11 and 2.00, with minimal transfer from root to shoot. When measured against an ideal hypothetical buffer zone, the buffer zones under investigation varied between intact and severely compromised. Intact riparian zones showed elevated metal concentrations in the soil, yet significantly lower concentrations in the river water compared to areas with insufficient vegetative cover. A polluted riparian area overgrown by P. australis effectively phytoextracted 204 960 g/m(2) Al, 204 400 g/m(2) Fe and 27 887 g/m(2) Mn. The two indigenous Cyperus spp. were not ideal for metal immobilization with low bioaccumulation and transfer factors as well as low biomass. High biomass and Al, Fe and Mn phytostabilizing species: P. australis, T. capensis, S. corymbosus and J. effusus, should be considered in the rehabilitation of South African buffer areas.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				APR	2017	43	2					177	185		10.4314/wsa.v43i2.01								WOS:000408428800001						
J	Utete, B; Tsamba, J				Utete, Beaven; Tsamba, Joshua			Trophic state categorisation and assessment of water quality in Manjirenji Dam, Zimbabwe, a shallow reservoir with designated multi-purpose water uses	WATER SA												Intermittent, dire droughts and water abstraction pressures impact shallow man-made reservoirs with multiple designated water uses, often leading to water quality deterioration, and loss of biological integrity and utility value of a lake, threatening the livelihoods of lake shore communities. Thus, water quality information is crucial in setting up guidelines for freshwater resources management. In this study we investigated the water quality, determined the trophic state and assessed the influence of lake zones on the physical-chemical parameters of the Manjirenji Dam, Zimbabwe. Furthermore, we tested the applicability of two customary temperate water quality indices, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment ( CCME) Water Quality Index and the Carlson Trophic State Index, for a tropical lake system. Ten littoral and seven pelagic sites were sampled monthly over 9 months for the following water parameters: pH, conductivity, turbidity, total dissolved solids, suspended solids, chlorophyll a, temperature, dissolved oxygen, water transparency, ammonia, nitrogen, nitrates, total and reactive phosphorus. Despite slight fluctuations/variations, water quality in the Manjirenji Dam was generally fair, with a CCME value averaging 78.1, and the Carlson Trophic State Index reflecting oligotrophy. Non-significant differences in water quality parameters between pelagic and littoral sites in the Manjirenji Dam reflect the high connectivity of different spatial zones in a shallow lentic system. Index scores of the adapted temperate water indices detect similar water quality conditions for the Manjirenji Dam, thus perhaps indicating their potential applicability. The current water quality data set for the Manjirenji Dam is vital for formulating prudent management strategies to formulate/ensure adequate multi-purpose water usage and service for this aquatic ecosystem.																	0378-4738	1816-7950				APR	2017	43	2					192	199		10.4314/wsa.v43i2.03								WOS:000408428800003

Tests were conducted to assess the sensitivity of the mussel Anodonta woodiana, installed on the Mosselmonitor, to seven contaminants and evaluate the usefulness of these sensors for detecting pollution events in the Po River (Italy). Mussels were exposed for 30 min to increasing concentrations of chromium (range 0.01-5 mg/L); arsenic (range 0.05-2.5 mg/L); sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS (range 0.25-50 mg/L); phenol (range 0.1-100 mg/L); oxadiazon (range 0.001-5 mg/L); trichloroethylene (range 0.01-100 mg/L); and crude oil (range 0.5-50 mg/L). Treatment with the highest concentration of SDS elicited two types of alarm response. In a second set of tests, the bivalves were exposed for 6 h to a selected concentration of each chemical. Only SDS led to a dramatic alteration of valve opening, resulting in alarms. This system would have limited applications for monitoring drinking water influent.

J	Fitchett, A				Fitchett, Anne			SuDS for managing surface water in Diepsloot informal settlement, Johannesburg, South Africa	WATER SA												Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) imitate natural water management processes in catchments that have been degraded due to urbanisation. The aim is to reduce the quantity of stormwater runoff and improve water quality. Management of rainwater in the informal settlement of Diepsloot in Johannesburg is compounded by domestic wastewater discharged into the informal lanes. These lanes fall outside the mandate of the City of Johannesburg's stormwater management system; hence residents need to rely on their own initiatives to address surface-water problems. This preliminary study investigated the introduction of SuDS to enhance existing surface-water interventions, as a low-cost flexible approach. Using action research methods, small-scale interventions were designed, constructed and refined by residents and researchers at two sites close to the Jukskei River. While the primary intention of the research was to reduce standing water in the public areas, water quality testing indicates that the SuDS reduced some pollutants. Nitrate and phosphate concentrations were slightly lowered through the introduction of permeable channels and soakaways, while these interventions had a moderate effect on chemical oxygen demand. The involvement of residents at the two sites was markedly different, reflecting divergent priorities and social dynamics. Spontaneous continuation of the SuDS system at one of the sites indicates successful knowledge and skills exchange. This study was of limited duration with only two sets of water quality tests; therefore, longer term monitoring is strongly advised to be able to give more robust assessment of this type of intervention.

The electronic voltammetric tongue consists of a set of four noble electrodes (iridium, rhodium, platinum and gold) housed inside a stainless steel cylinder. These noble metals have high durability and are low maintenance-demanding, as required for developing future automated equipment. A pulse voltammetry study was conducted in 35 wastewater samples to determine ammonia (NH4+-N), nitrates (NO3--N), total phosphate (tot-P), soluble chemical oxygen demand (CODs) and conductivity. These parameters were also determined in these samples by routine analytical methods in the WWTP laboratory. A partial least squares (PLS) analysis was run to obtain a model to predict each parameter. Twenty-five samples were included in the calibration set and 10 in the validation set. Calibration and validation sets were selected randomly, except for the extreme values of each parameter, which were included in the calibration set. Variable selection was performed on the voltammetric data using Genetic Algorithms in the calibration data set for each parameter. The electronic tongue showed good predictive power to determine the concentrations of NH4+-N, NO3--N and tot-P and CODs.

Using an improvised ballast water treatment system, large concentrations of (OH)-O-center dot were produced and subsequently dissolved in ballast waters of different salinities which are high salinity seawater (HS) and low salinity seawater (LS) in order to eliminate the microalgae. The results show that the outcome of the treatment system fully meets the requirements of G8. At total residual oxidant (TRO) concentrations of 0.41 mg/L and 0.93 mg/L, the maximum concentration of killed algae was observed as 0.5x10(3) cells/mL and 1x10(4) cells/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the (OH)-O-center dot efficiently decomposed most organic matter, resulting in an improvement of the ship's ballast water quality. These results conform to the D-2 ballast water discharge standard of IMO and validate the (OH)-O-center dot as an effective, rapid way of killing algae in the course of conveying the ship's ballast water.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				APR	2017	46	4					725	734										WOS:000406894400010

Multivariate statistical analysis to assess groundwater quality in Namakkal district, Tamil Nadu, India	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Seventy three groundwater samples were collected covering all the blocks of the district except structural hills during premonsoon season of the year 2007. Samples were tested for the parameters "EC, Turbidity, pH, Total Hardness, Iron, Chlorides, Total Dissolved Solids, Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium Manganese, Sulphate, Nitrate, Nitrite and Total Alkalinity. Hydrochemical facies were studied using Piper's trilinear diagram and the groundwater type was found to be mixed type. Hydrochemical parameters are further studied using statistical tools such as descriptive, correlation and cluster analyses. Parameter TDS had shown its dominance in all the analyses. The concentration of TDS, its correlations with major cations and anions and grouping of other parameters have shown that the concentration TDS has influenced the categorization of groundwater of the study area as mixed type.																	0379-5136	0975-1033				APR	2017	46	4					830	836										WOS:000406894400026

Broiler-Housing Conditions Affect the Performance	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF POULTRY SCIENCE												In the last decades animal production has considerably increased worldwide to sustain an ever-growing human population. Among animal reared for consumption purposes, chickens are undoubtedly one of the most successful, mainly due to their rapid growth rate. The development of broiler farming has been accompanied in recent years by a substantial attention to animal welfare. This study is aimed at assessing the effects of different housing conditions on both feed conversion ratio and mortality of male broiler flocks through a largescale study (more than 100 million birds) involving 977 farms belonging to one major producer. For this, we evaluated nine features of the housing system using a linear model with random effect. The features were: roofing, floor, drinkers, feeders, water source, color curtain color, management, light and ventilation. A total of 3516 poultry flocks were assessed. Positive ventilation, metal and clay roof, dirt floor and owner management were shown to reduced mortality. Concrete floor, negative ventilation, blue curtains, fluorescent lightening, owner management, tap water and well water significantly improved FCR. We discuss our findings in relation with economic constraints and provide advices to encourage farmers using simple devices that will improve both production and chicken survival.																	1516-635X	1806-9061				APR-JUN	2017	19	2					263	272		10.1590/1806-9061-2016-0346								WOS:000406295200012						
J	Mustapha, MK				Mustapha, Moshood Keke			Dynamics of Hexavalent Chromium in Four Types of Aquaculture Ponds and Its Effects on the Morphology and Behavior of Cultured Clarias gariepinus (Burchell 1822)	TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Hexavalent chromium is a bio accumulative toxic metal in water and fish. It enters aquaculture ponds mainly through anthropogenic sources. Hexavalent chromium concentrations and its effects on the morphology and behavior of Clarias gariepinus were investigated from four aquaculture ponds for 12 weeks. Chromium was measured using diphenyl carbohdrazide method; alkalinity and hardness were measured using colometric method and analyzed with Bench Photometer. Temperature and pH were measured using pH/EC/TDS/Temp combined tester. Temporal and spatial replications of samples were done with triplicates morphological and behavioural effects of the metal on fish were observed visually. Chromium ranged from no detection to 0.05 mg/L, alkalinity 105 to 245 mg/L, hardness 80 to 165 mg/L, pH 6.35 to 8.03 and temperature 29.1 to 35.9 degrees C. Trend in the chromium concentrations in the ponds is natural > earthen > concrete > collapsible. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in chromium, alkalinity, water hardness, pH and temperature among the four ponds. Significant positive correlation also existed between alkalinity, water hardness, pH, with chromium. Morphological and behavioural changes observed in the fish include irregular swimming, frequent coming to the surface, dark body colouration, mucous secretion on the body, erosion of gill epithelium, fin disintegration, abdominal distension and lethargy. High chromium concentration in natural pond was due to anthropogenic run-off of materials in to the pond. Acidic pH, low alkalinity, low water hardness also contributed to the high chromium concentration. Morphological and behavioural changes observed were attributed to the high concentrations, toxicity and bio accumulative effect of the metal. Toxicity of chromium to fish in aquaculture could threaten food security. Watershed best management practices and remediation could be adopted to reduce the effects of toxicity of chromium on pond water quality, fish flesh quality and fish welfare.																	1976-8257	2234-2753				APR	2017	33	2					119	124		10.5487/TR.2017.33.2.119								WOS:000406834600004	28503260

The impacts of mining on livelihoods in the Andes: A critical overview	EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES AND SOCIETY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												This review article synthesizes research findings which demonstrate that mining in the Andes is transforming local livelihoods by changing water quality and quantity and land tenure practices upon which traditional livelihoods depend, as well as by generating new employment opportunities in mining communities. I argue that research on livelihood change in Andean mining communities would be enriched by 1) a deeper attendance to the gendered, raced, and classed nature of these changes and 2) the disaggregation of different mining management regimes (e.g. state-run, privately-run, cooperative-run) to allow for comparisons of the livelihood impacts between them.

Spatiotemporal Changes in the Ecological Status of Water Bodies on the Mining Territories of the Syunik Province (Republic of Armenia)	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												We discuss the changes in hydrological characteristics of water bodies caused by freshwater withdrawals to meet the interests of various users on the territory of the Syunik Province of the Republic of Armenia. An analysis is made of the possibilities of combining the water withdrawal for mining enterprises and for agriculture. The problems with water supply of settlements located on this territory are highlighted. The temporal dynamics of water withdrawals is presented for separate rivers as well as its relationship with the minimum and ecological flow. It is found that the anthropogenic load on water bodies is more clearly pronounced in the case of a degradation of the quality of water resources as a result of the industrial waste water diversion, and wash-out of pollutants from the territory of enterprises during floods and in the case of emergency input of wastes from tailings pools, rock spoil heaps and waste storage areas. Results of these authors' observations, data of routine observations and material from published sources were used in analyzing the water quality in the rivers of the Syunik Province. We calculated the coefficients of ecological quality and determined the river water quality classes according to physicochemical and biological indicators. Assessments of the river water quality class were made in accordance with the methodology of Directive 2000/60/EC. We identified the main pollutants that are responsible for the water quality class, and the factors of impact on natural waters governing the ecological status of water bodies. A comprehensive analysis is made of the intensity of anthropogenic impact on surface waters. The ecological status of water bodies is determined. Spatial changes in the quality indicators of the water of the region's main rivers are demonstrated. Special emphasis is placed on the need to implement immediate measures to improve technological processes and bring the operation of enterprises into compliance with ecological normative standards.																	1875-3728	1875-371X				APR	2017	38	2					204	210		10.1134/S1875372817020123								WOS:000405859600012

Groundwater in a karst aquifer near a selected dam site is deemed to be impacted greatly by the dam. This study uses the Kangir Reservoir of Iran as an example to illustrate the interrelationships of karst-groundwater condition, lithology of the dam reservoir, future climate changes, and overexploitation of water resources in the area. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of water balance, groundwater flow, hydrochemistry, characteristics of geologic formations with respect to the quantity and quality of water, distribution of karst and evaporative formations in the catchment, and tectonic setting to highlight the importance of hydrogeological conditions on the water quality and quantity of the Kangir Reservoir. The main findings include, first, a major part of the highland karst aquifer in the Asmari Formation within the dam catchment does not drain into the dam reservoir. Instead, it leaks into the downstream Siahgel Region of the dam mainly along the Zarneh-Siahgel fault zone through the karstic Asmari Formation. Second, selecting the dam site on evaporative Gachsaran Formation causes degradation of water quality in the reservoir. The results of this study demonstrate that considering karst hydrogeological conditions is indispensable for dam site selection from the point of view of groundwater quantity and quality impacted by the dam.

Interconnectivity oxbow lakes emerge after complex regulating works for the protection of the shores and bottom of the lakes. Research has analyzed the influence of the hydraulic connectivity of three lakes located in northern Poland on the structure of associated bottom invertebrates - elements that monitor the conditions in habitats. The structure and functioning of ecosystems in wetlands, including in oxbow lakes, are direct or indirect in connection to fluctuations in water levels during floods or flow pulsations. Hydrological processes cause changes in the chemical composition of the water in oxbow lakes and sediment dispersion due to the exchange between water and sediments. In the lentic habitats (disconnected from the main river), the retention time is longer than in the semi-and lotic oxbow lakes whereas the productivity of the ecosystem is only internal and limited. The use of macrozoobenthos as bioindicators in re-connected oxbow lakes in small river valleys indicates that, on the long-term period (5 years), it does not have as a result the improvement of the environmental conditions of those habitats. This is shown by the monitoring indicators. The main reason seems to be the loss of the full connectivity between the oxbow lakes and the main river channel within 3 to 4 years, having as a result only systems of semi-lotic oxbow lakes and rivers. This hampers the free exchange of waters between ecosystems, the washing out of nutrients accumulated in sediments, the removal of bottom sediments, as well as the migration of hydrobionts. Therefore, the improvement of the ecological condition of the oxbow lake habitats and the permanence of those changes depend on the possibility of keeping the full hydrological connectivity to the river.

Thus, one of the proposed measures for the next 5 years is encouraging the wastes exploitation for energy recovery. In this context, the main goal of our study was to evaluate the level of pollution considering 5 closed municipal waste dump sites from the North-East region of Romania over the period 2013-2015,having in mind at a first glance, the possibility of methane emissions valorization in the form of biogas. Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix and Leopold's Matrix were used for the environmental impact assessment. The results of the environmental impact assessment showed that the impact on environmental quality was very high for Vaslui and Iasi counties, due to pollution migration from North to South of the studied region, and from one environmental component to another (e.g. from soil to ground water). On the other side, the results obtained by monitoring the emissions generated by the waste dump sites from Botosani County revealed there is a major impact an air quality. The overall impact, quantified by two conventional methods shows that at regional level, heavy metals are the most contributing pollutants to environmental impact, thus it is necessary to implement measures to remediate and protect soil and ground water quality. The results of this study revealed that there are no major negative impacts or fire risks directly generated by waste dump sites, and biogas is not valuable for energy recovery goals.																	1582-9596	1843-3707				APR	2017	16	4					1017	1026										WOS:000405831300027

This manuscript advocates the physicochemical, bacteriological characteristics and heavy metal pollution in the creek system. In the present investigation, the pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), bio-chemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), chlorophyll, cyanide, oil and grease, total phosphate, phenol, Kjeldahl nitrogen and total organic carbon (TOC) values were recorded from 36 sampling sites during 6 field surveys conducted in 2011-2013. The creek water samples were also analyzed for their heavy metal contents (As, Cd, Cr, Pb, Ni and Zn). The bacteriological parameters included in the study were total coliform count (TCC), total fecal coliform count (TFC), and total fecal streptococci (TFS). These parameters were determined as per methods described in reference [ 12]. Salinity of water samples ranged between 15 and 32 parts per thousand while pH ranged from 7.2 to 7.6. High salinity values indicated the progression of seawater into the creek system. The mean DO was low with a range of 4.2-5.7 mg/L. Low DO concentration was due to high BOD5 (range 10-78 mg/L) while COD ranged from 320 to 1,334 mg/L. High BOD5 load is mainly due to organic pollution coming from nearby human settlements. The mean chlorophyll-a content was 0.114 mg/L. Interestingly, higher chlorophyll-a concentration was observed near the mangroves area. The mean cyanide concentration was high, though the source of cyanide could not be traced that needs further study. Oil and grease content of water was also substantial, mainly originated from faulty boats operated in the area. Excessive concentration of oil and grease could be deleterious to marine life forms. The concentration of phosphate ranged between 2.1 and 4.6 mg/L mainly attributed to the agriculture runoff. Phenol concentration was not high (0.01-0.08 mg/L) and, therefore, could not be responsible for adverse environmental implications. The mean concentrations of total Kjeldahl nitrogen and TOC were 59.27 and 4.97 mg/L, respectively. The concentrations of heavy metals in the samples were found to be in the order Zn > Ni > Pb > As > Cr > Cd. The bacterial load was exceptionally higher in all the samples in terms of organisms of public health importance that is mainly attributed to domestic wastewater originated from nearby squatter settlements. In essence, the present study disclosed that the creeks of Indus delta are likely to be polluted mainly because of anthropogenic sources. The continuous accumulation of pollutants in the creek area may have severe ecological and health implications.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	70						95	105		10.5004/dwt.2017.20466								WOS:000404544200009

Characterization of raw water resources in northern and central Taiwan	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Water quality standards of raw water resources are getting more stringent in Taiwan. This is due to the higher number of potential contaminants released to the water bodies leading to the potential risks to the human health. Raw water resources, including one river and three reservoirs representative of the major raw water resources in northern and central Taiwan, at four locations were selected to measure turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), oxidation and reduction potential (ORP), pH, alkalinity, total organic compounds (TOC), zeta potential, particle size, Al, Fe and heavy metal contents. Natural organic matter (NOM) was also examined using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography to distinguish the different molecular weight distribution of organic compounds, such as humic acids, that might affect the subsequent raw water treatment. TOC is highly related to NOM, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand, and the influent standard is 4 mg/L in Taiwan. EC, ORP, pH, alkalinity, TOC and zeta potential had values of 231.68-350.60 mu S/cm, 210.5-271.55 mV, 8.17-8.58, 65.65-86.25 mg/L, 1.54-2.73 mg/L and -16.58 to -22.60 mV, respectively. However, average turbidity (128.24 NTU) and average particle size at the Daiji River (5,067.56 nm) were higher than those at the Shimen, Yongheshan and Liyutan Reservoirs (2.20-6.39 NTU and 1,105.12-1,627.26 nm, respectively). These measured data and metal contents (the latest three years' data, at least two seasons including summer and autumn) met the regulatory standards in Taiwan. Water quality index (WQI) containing dissolved oxygen solubility, faecal coliforms, pH, BOD5, nitrates, total phosphates, temperature deviation, turbidity and total solids indicated good conditions for three reservoirs and medium condition for Daiji River. NOM, which might produce potential disinfectant by-products, had similar patterns and contained humic acids and low molecular weight acids (LMWs), with the intensity order of Yongheshan Reservoir > Shimen Reservoir > Liyutan Reservoir > Daiji River. The Carlson trophic state index and field-emission scanning electron microscope plot of filtered solid of raw water showed the potential risk of algae to drinking water safety.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	70						106	116		10.5004/dwt.2017.20488								WOS:000404544200010

Potassium permanganate (KMnO4) has been widely used to remove organic pollutants from wastewater. The oxidative degradation of 5-FU and Ara-C in aqueous solution by KMnO4 has not been reported. In this study, the oxidative degradation of 5-FU and Ara-C with KMnO4 in aqueous solution was investigated. 5-FU was oxidized rapidly by KMnO4 due to the olefinic group in the central heterocyclic ring. The degradation kinetics of 5-FU was well described by the equation of -d[5-FU]/dt = k(app)[5-FU](0.77)[KMnO4](0.86). The degradation kinetics of Ara-C followed a generalized second-order rate law. The apparent rate constant (kapp) of these two target compounds was strongly depended on the reaction temperature, pH, humic acid (HA) and water quality. The apparent activation energies (E-a) of 5-FU and Ara-C were 32 and 40 kJ.mol(-1), respectively, indicating that 5-FU was more easily decomposed by KMnO4 as compared with Ara-C. The maximum values of kapp for 5-FU and Ara-C were 1.73 x 10(-4) mu M-0.63.s(-1) at pH 7.4 and 1.52 M-1.s(-1) at pH 3.5, respectively. The oxidative degradation of 5-FU was inhibited by HA, while the oxidation of Ara-C was enhanced by HA. Reaction of both 5-FU and Ara-C was influenced by water quality. Thus, this study provides new insights into the degradation of antineoplastic drugs.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	70						339	346		10.5004/dwt.2017.20240								WOS:000404544200039

In order to justify public action, they needed to objectify a situation which was either poorly known or informed by heterogeneous criteria. We show that political considerations are embedded in the indicators and the monitoring network of both inventories. They pertain to the type of realism which allows comparisons, shapes the frontiers of public policy, legitimates uses of water, and defines the sharing of restoration's financial burden. We compare the controversies that rose during both inventories' construction to conclude on their political meaning.																	1772-9971					APR	2017	8	1								10.4000/developpementdurable.11580								WOS:000404837600008

Factors controlling the ripening of manganese removal filters in conventional aeration-filtration groundwater treatment	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												Relatively long operational time is required to achieve effective manganese removal in conventional aeration-filtration groundwater treatment with virgin filter media. Ripening period depends on water quality, operational parameters, and the filter media used. This study assessed the role of filter media type, backwashing and iron loading on the time required to achieve very effective manganese removal. Filter runs were conducted with two set-ups each with six pilot filters with virgin sand or anthracite, and different types of manganese oxide coated sand/anthracite (MOCS/MOCA). Pre-treated groundwater (aeration-rapid sand filtration), either directly, or after an additional pre-treatment (ultrafiltration-UF), was used as feed water. UF pre-treatment eliminated head loss development in pilot filters and backwashing was consequently not required. Filters that received feed water without UF pre-treatment required backwashing after 14 d of continuous operation. Use of virgin sand and anthracite resulted in comparable ripening time (25 d and 14 d for feed water without and with UF pre-treatment, respectively). Use of fresh MOCS/MOCA directly taken from operational filters, eliminated the need for ripening of virgin filter media, while dried MOCS was less effective than fresh one, while the total period required to achieve highly effective manganese removal (>= 95%) was not shortened.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	72						22	29		10.5004/dwt.2017.0306								WOS:000404374300003

Therefore Kizilirmak river basin is under pressure from a diverse range of human activities. Six stations were sampled along the Kizilirmak river located in Nevsehir city during 2013-2014 seasonally. The physico-chemical parameters (water temperature, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, nitrite (NO3), ammonium (NH4), ammonia (NH3), phosphate (PO4), sulfate (SO4) and some metal concentrations (Zn, Cu, B, Cr, Ni, Pb, Hg, As, Se, Sb, Mn, Cd and Al) were measured in the water samples to determine the water quality of the Kizilirmak river. When the water quality classes were examined in terms of the measured physico-chemical parameters, it was detected that the river is IV. class for nitrite, III. class for BOD, phosphate and pH, II. class for NH4-N. The results showed that the heavy metal concentrations in water of the Kizilirmak river were within the quality class I. limits of the EPA and WPCR.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	72						328	334		10.5004/dwt.2017.20437								WOS:000404374300038

Although there is a need for automation in these applications, various developments in image processing and analysis methodology supporting these tasks have not become widespread in diatom-based analyses. We have addressed this issue by combining our automated diatom image analysis software SHERPA with a commercial slide-scanning microscope. The resulting workflow enables mass-analyses of a broad range of morphometric features from individual frustules mounted on permanent slides. Extensive automation and internal quality control of the results helps to minimize user intervention, but care was taken to allow the user to stay in control of the most critical steps (exact segmentation of valve outlines and selection of objects of interest) using interactive functions for reviewing and revising results. In this contribution, we describe our workflow and give an overview of factors critical for success, ranging from preparation and mounting through slide scanning and autofocus finding to final morphometric data extraction. To demonstrate the usability of our methods we finally provide an example application by analysing Fragilariopsis kerguelensis valves originating from a sediment core, which substantially extends the size range reported in the literature.

J	Akomeah, E; Lindenschmidt, KE				Akomeah, Eric; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Seasonal Variation in Sediment Oxygen Demand in a Northern Chained River-Lake System	WATER												Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) contributes immensely to hypolimnetic oxygen depletion. SOD rates thus play a key role in aquatic ecosystems' health predictions. These rates, however, can be very expensive to sample. Moreover, determination of SOD rates by sediment diagenesis modeling may require very large datasets, or may not be easily adapted to complex aquatic systems. Water quality modeling for northern aquatic systems is emerging and little is known about the seasonal trends of SOD rates for complex aquatic systems. In this study, the seasonal trend of SOD rates for a northern chained river-lake system has been assessed through the calibration of a water quality model. Model calibration and validation showed good agreement with field measurements. Results of the study show that, in the riverine section, SOD20 rates decreased from 1.9 to 0.79 g/m(2)/day as urban effluent traveled along the river while a SOD20 rate of 2.2 g/m(2)/day was observed in the lakes. Seasonally, the SOD20 rates in summer were three times higher than those in winter for both river and lakes. The results of the study provide insights to the seasonal trend of SOD rates especially for northern rivers and lakes and can, thus, be useful for more complex water quality modeling studies in the region.

In this study, the Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code (EFDC) was applied in the Famosa Slough, a small tidal marsh system in urban San Diego County, California, to analyze multiple management scenarios focusing on different aspects of controlling processes: watershed load reduction, macroalgae harvesting, dredging, and the combination of different options. In order to evaluate these management scenarios, a previous EFDC model was enhanced through modifying the model code to allow simulations of both benthic and floating macroalgae as separate state variables, and configuring a sediment diagenesis model to predictively represent the dynamic interactions between the watershed load and benthic nutrient flux. The model was calibrated and verified by comparing model predictions with the observed data of hydrodynamic and water quality parameters throughout 2008. The calibrated model was then applied to simulate the water quality response to various management scenarios. The simulated results showed that combining watershed nutrient load reductions and harvesting floating macroalgae can produce significant water quality benefits. The results provide useful information for hydrological ecosystem protection and can be used for determining cost-effective implementation actions in the future.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							277	10.3390/w9040277								WOS:000404556400047

However, studies of water quality dynamics during flood events are not often reported in literature, probably due to difficult conditions for sampling during flood events. Water quality parameters in open water (canals, rivers, and lakes), flood water on roads and water in sewers have been monitored during the extreme fluvial flood event on 7 October 2013 in the city of Can Tho, Vietnam. This is the pioneering study of urban flood water pollution in real time in Vietnam. The results showed that water quality is very dynamic during flooding, especially at the beginning of the event. In addition, it was observed that the pathogen and contaminant levels in the flood water are almost as high as in sewers. The findings show that population exposed to flood water runs a health risk that is nearly equal to that of being in contact with sewer water. Therefore, the people of Can Tho not only face physical risk due to flooding, but are also exposed to health risks.

This study investigated and analyzed the characteristics of non-point source pollution in Baoding City. A simulation model for non-point source pollution was developed based on the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM), and, the process of non-point source pollution was simulated for Baoding City. The data was calibrated using data from two observed rainfall events (25.6 and 25.4 mm, the total rainfall on 31 July 2008 (07312008) was 25.6 mm, the total rainfall amount on 21 August 2008 (08212008) was 25.4 mm) and validated using data from an observed rainfall event (92.6 mm, the total rainfall on 08102008 was 92.6 mm) (Our monitoring data is limited by the lack of long-term monitoring, but it can meet the requests of model calibration and validation basically). In order to analyze the effects of non-point source pollution on Baiyangdian Lake, the characteristics and development trends of water pollution were determined using a one-dimensional water quality model for Baoding City. The results showed that the pollutant loads for Pb, Zn, TN (Total Nitrogen), and TP (Total Phosphorus) accounted for about 30% of the total amount of pollutant load. Finally, applicable control measures for non-point source pollution especially for Baoding were suggested, including urban rainwater and flood resources utilization and Best Management Practices (BMPs) for urban non-point source pollution control.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							249	10.3390/w9040249								WOS:000404556400019						
J	Logsdon, SD; Sauer, P				Logsdon, Sally D.; Sauer, Patricia			Improved or Unimproved Urban Areas Effect on Soil and Water Quality	WATER												Construction in urban areas usually results in compacted soil, which restricts plant growth and infiltration. Nutrients may be lost in storm runoff water and sediment. The purpose of this study was to determine if existing lawns benefit from aeration and surface compost additions without the negative impact of nutrient loss in runoff. Four sets of lawns were compared, with or without compost plus aeration, as a paired comparison. Surface bulk density was significantly reduced in the treated lawns (1.32 versus 1.42 Mg.m(-3)). Visual evaluation of soil structure showed improvement in the treated lawns. Of fifteen measurement dates over four years, four dates showed significantly higher surface soil water contents in the treated lawns compared with the untreated lawns. When compared over time, three of the four treated lawns had significantly higher soil water content than the untreated lawns. Nutrient concentrations in rainfall simulator runoff were not significantly different between treated and control lawns, which showed that compost did not negatively impact water quality. Compost and aeration helped restore soil quality for urban soils of recent construction.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							247	10.3390/w9040247								WOS:000404556400017

Manual boreholes are increasingly advocated as a safe and cost-effective substitute to mechanized drilling, as well as to traditional excavation methods. This research banks on the assumption that field and remote sensing data can be integrated within a geospatial database in order to map the viability of manual boreholes based on factors such as rock type, water table depth, landforms, or water quality. The approach presents three main novelties in relation to methodological precedents: (1) outcomes are not only expressed in terms of technical feasibility, but also as a function of drilling time and cost; (2) maps refer to a specific drilling technique; and (3) results take into account borehole diameter, as this constrains both drilling time and cost. The method provides univocal outcomes that can be immediately useful for non-experts, donors, planners, or practitioners and that can be readily exported to other catchment-scale settings. Results were validated against geophysical data.					martinez-santos, pedro/0000-0003-2014-4063												2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							262	10.3390/w9040262								WOS:000404556400032

Samples were taken from hot and cold water supplies from guest rooms' faucets in 12 hotels in Hanoi city, Vietnam, and 13 hotels in Japan for comparison. A simple water quality measurement and determination of Legionella was carried out. The results showed that residual effective chlorine-which guarantees bactericidal properties-was not detected in tap water supplied in hotel rooms in Vietnam, and nitrite (an indicator of water pollution) was detected in 40% of buildings. In the hotels in Japan, the prescribed residual chlorine concentration met the prescribed levels, and nitrite was not detected. Additionally, while there was no Legionella detected in the Japanese cases, it was detected in most of the Vietnamese hotels, which were found to manage the hot water storage tank at low temperatures of 40-50 degrees C. It was found that there were deficiencies in cold and hot water supply quality, and that there was no effective system in place for building operation maintenance and management.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							251	10.3390/w9040251								WOS:000404556400021						
J	Wang, TX; Xu, SG; Liu, JW				Wang, Tianxiang; Xu, Shiguo; Liu, Jianwei			Dynamic Assessment of Comprehensive Water Quality Considering the Release of Sediment Pollution	WATER												Comprehensive assessment of water quality is an important technological measure for water environmental management and protection. Previous assessment methods tend to ignore the influences of sediment pollutant release and dynamic change of the water boundary. In view of this, this paper explores a new method for comprehensive water quality assessment. Laboratory simulation experiments are conducted to analyze the influences of sediment pollutant release on water quality, and the results are taken as increments, coupled with original samples, to constitute a new set of evaluation samples. Dynamic and comprehensive water quality assessment methods are created based on a principal component analysis (PCA)/analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-variable fuzzy pattern recognition (VFPR) model and adopted to evaluate water quality. A geographic information system (GIS) is applied to visually display the results of water quality assessment and the change of the water boundary. This study takes Biliuhe Reservoir as an engineering example. The results show the change process of the water boundary, during which the water level is reduced from 63.10 m to 54.15 m. The reservoir water quality is fine, of which the water quality level (GB3838-2002) is between level 2 and level 3, and closer to level 2 taking no account of sediment pollutant release. The water quality of Biliuhe Reservoir, overall, is worse in summer and better in winter during the monitoring period. Meanwhile, the water quality shows the tendency of being better from upstream to downstream, and the water quality in the surface layer is better than that in the bottom layer. However, water quality is much closer, or even inferior, to level 3 when considering the release of nitrogen and phosphorus in sediments, and up to 42.7% of the original assessment results of the samples undergo changes. It is concluded that the proposed method is comparatively reasonable as it avoids neglecting sediment pollutant release in the water quality assessment, and the presentation of the evaluation results and change of the water boundary is intuitive with the application of GIS.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							275	10.3390/w9040275								WOS:000404556400045						
J	Yuan, Q; Guerra, HB; Kim, Y				Yuan, Qingke; Guerra, Heidi B.; Kim, Youngchul			An Investigation of the Relationships between Rainfall Conditions and Pollutant Wash-Off from the Paved Road	WATER												Stormwater runoff monitoring was carried out from 2011 to 2015 to investigate the relationships between rainfall conditions (antecedent dry days (ADDs), rainfall intensity, depth and duration), and water quality parameters of stormwater from a paved road in Korea. Factor analysis suggested that the effect of rainfall conditions on the concentrations of selected pollutants varied depending on the pollutant. As total COD (total chemical oxygen demand) concentration increased, the level of heavy metals increased and resulted in a decrease of BOD5 (biochemical oxygen demand) because of their toxicity. In addition, ADDs had a significant impact on the wash-off of solids from paved road. The predominant particles in stormwater were 30 mu m and smaller, and increased in concentration as ADDs increased. Thus, the initial load of accumulated particles became a major factor in the wash-off process. The mass of particle-related pollutants was also subject to the effect of ADDs due to the affinity between pollutants and predominant particles (< 30 mu m). However, the effect of ADDs on the mass of organic matter and nitrogen was relatively weak. ADDs contributed to the decrease of some pollutants by photo-oxidation, volatilization and natural decay over dry days, as well as desorption from solids during rainfall.																	2073-4441					APR	2017	9	4							232	10.3390/w9040232								WOS:000404556400002

Characterization results show that both kinds of biopolymers are of similar molecular weight. Longer than one year water quality monitoring results show that the C/N ratio in the secondary effluent biopolymers was relatively constant at around 4.8, while that in the surface water macromolecules fluctuated at around 6.9. Under a similar mass load, the investigated secondary effluent biopolymers lead to hydraulic resistance slightly higher than that caused by filtering surface water macromolecules; however, the correspondingly formed fouling is significantly less reversible by hydraulic backwashing. The quantity of the nitrogenous biopolymers in the secondary effluent demonstrated a strong correlation with the extent of the irreversible fouling in ultrafiltration (UF), while that from the surface water did not. In membrane fouling cleaning tests, certain detergent demonstrated high efficiency in removing the irreversible fouling after UF of the secondary effluent, but presented no effect in eliminating fouling caused by the surface water foulants. In-line coagulation using FeCl3 prior to UF was shown as an effective fouling control method, but the effect depends heavily on the type of feed water.

Integrated approach for brackish water desalination and distribution: which desalination technology to choose?	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												In the southern part of Tunisia, brackish water is desalinated and blended with raw water to be delivered to the consumer. The desalination technique used is reverse osmosis (RO). However, it is an energy intensive process compared to other water treatment technologies such as nanofiltration (NF). The latter technique is capable of retaining polyvalent ions and could provide the same distributed water quality with much lower energy consumption. In this work, simulations were conducted in order to compare reverse osmosis and nanofiltration performances in brackish water desalination process within arid regions and to determine the best technique for desalting brackish water for lower energy and water consumptions. For a given distributed water quality, specific energy consumption could be reduced by 40% when nanofiltration is used instead of reverse osmosis. Water consumption when NF is applied is reduced as well. The distributed water quality is not significantly affected by applying NF instead of RO. Besides, these environmental aspects, scaling assessment favored NF as well.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	73						121	126		10.5004/dwt.2017.20861								WOS:000404376700013						
J	Leon, FA; Ramos, A				Leon, F. A.; Ramos, A.			Analysis of high efficiency membrane pilot testing for membrane design optimisation	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The construction of the new seawater intake at reverse osmosis desalination plant located in Almeria (Spain) finished on May 2011. From this moment, the water catchment was located at 35 m depth instead of the 14 m depth of the former intake. The most significant outcome has been a new thermal scenario with lower maximum temperatures and more stable in time. Because of the lower maximum temperatures while the minimum temperatures remain the same, the pressure for water quality requirements accomplishment at high temperatures have decreased. Therefore new design and operation development opportunities have appeared. Taking into account that membrane replacement and retrofit projects are about to come at this desalination plant, and under this new thermal scenario, a pilot test has been developed. On the one hand, the purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the different membranes manufacturers and on the other hand, to determine the optimal membrane configuration and operation conditions able to achieve water quality and quantity needs under the new thermal intake conditions by the design of a pilot test. The best option has been determined taking into account investment versus operation (energy) costs.																	1944-3994	1944-3986				APR	2017	73						208	214		10.5004/dwt.2017.20573								WOS:000404376700022

Prescribed Burning and Erosion Potential in Mixed Hardwood Forests of Southern Illinois	FORESTS												Prescribed fire has several benefits for managing forest ecosystems including reduction of fuel loading and invasive species and enhanced regeneration of desirable tree species. Along with these benefits there are some limitations like nutrient and sediment loss which have not been studied extensively in mixed hardwood forests. The objective of our research was to quantify the amount of sediment movement occurring on a watershed scale due to prescribed fire in a southern Illinois mixed hardwood ecosystem. The research site was located at Trail of Tears State Forest in western Union county, IL, USA and included five watershed pairs. One watershed in each pair was randomly assigned the prescribed burn treatment and the other remained as control (i.e., unburned). The prescribed burn treatment significantly reduced the litter depth with 12.6%-31.5% litter remaining in the prescribed burn treatment watersheds. When data were combined across all watersheds, no significant differences were obtained between burn treatment and control watershed for total suspended solids and sediment concentrations or loads. The annual sediment losses varied from 1.41 to 90.54 kg .ha(-1) .year(-1) in the four prescribed burn watersheds and 0.81 to 2.54 kg .ha(-1). year(-1) in the four control watersheds. Prescribed burn watershed 7 showed an average soil sediment loss of 4.2 mm, whereas control watershed 8 showed an average accumulation of sediments (9.9 mm), possibly due to steeper slopes. Prescribed burning did not cause a significant increase in soil erosion and sediment loss and can be considered acceptable in managing mixed hardwood forests of Ozark uplands and the Shawnee Hills physiographic regions of southern Illinois.

The transportation lasted 11 hours at densities of 40, 55, and 70 juveniles (2.1 +/- 0.6 g weight) per bag containing 8 L of water. The different densities did not affect the water quality parameters and the survival rate immediately after transportation was 100% for all treatments. However, after 24 and 48 hours, higher mortality was found for juveniles transported at the greatest density. Transportation for 11 hours can be undertaken using a density of up to 55 juvenile pacama individuals/transportation bag.																	1806-2563	1807-8664				APR-JUN	2017	39	2					211	214		10.4025/actascitechnol.v39i2.30616								WOS:000404298000011

Such neonicotinoid use may pose a risk to non-target insects, including pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests, and ecosystems. This study assessed neonicotinoid residues in groundwater, surface runoff water, soil, and native plants adjacent to corn and soybean crop fields with a history of being planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds from 2008 to 2013. Data from six sites with the same crop management history, three with and three without in-field prairie strips, were collected in 2015-2016, 2-3 years after neonicotinoid (clothianidin and imidacloprid) seed treatments were last used. Three of the six neonicotinoids analyzed were detected in at least one environmental matrix: the two applied as seed coatings on the fields (clothianidin and imidacloprid) and another widely used neonicotinoid (thiamethoxam). Sites with prairie strips generally had lower concentrations of neonicotinoids: groundwater and footslope soil neonicotinoid concentrations were significantly lower in the sites with prairie strips than in those without; mean concentrations for groundwater were 11 and 20 ng/L (p = 0.048) and <1 and 6 ng/g (p = 0.0004) for soil, respectively. Surface runoff water concentrations were not significantly (p = 0.38) different for control sites (44 ng/L) or sites with prairie strips (140 ng/L). Consistent with the decreased inputs of neonicotinoids, concentrations tended to decrease over the sampling timeframe. Two sites recorded concentration increases, however, potentially due to disturbance of previous applications or influence from nearby fields where use of seed treatments continued. There were no detections (limit of detection: 1 ng/g) of neonicotinoids in the foliage or roots of plants comprising prairie strips, indicating a low likelihood of exposure to pollinators and other insects visiting these plants following the cessation of seed coating use. Offsite transport of neonicotinoids to aquatic systems through the groundwater and surface water were furthermore reduced with prairie strips. This study demonstrates the potential for prairie strips comprising 10% of an agricultural catchment to mitigate the non-target impacts of neonicotinoids.

It consists of a sensor module and a system module, which includes communication and power modules. We have focused on pH, turbidity and chlorophyll a concentration as the criteria for qualifying lake water quality. These parameters will be detected by a microfluidic device based sensor module embedded in the wireless sensor network system. In order to detect the turbidity and the chlorophyll a concentration simultaneously, we propose a simple optical measurement method using LED and photodiode in this paper. Before integrating a turbidity and chlorophyll a concentration sensor into the microfluidic device based pH sensor, we performed feasibility studies such as confirmation of the working principle and experiments using environmental water samples. As a result, we successfully verified our simultaneous sensing method by using a simple optical setup of the turbidity and the chlorophyll a concentration.																	2072-666X					APR	2017	8	4							112	10.3390/mi8040112								WOS:000404117100019

Sembilang River becomes the meeting point of the water flow of pollution from households and batik home industries, later ending at Kaliprau Beach, Pemalang. Method: Water was collected from the water flow of Sembilangan River in Juli 2016. The water sample for the BOD-COD examination was taken from four places with a distance of 50 meters and examined in 3 repetitions. The BOD-COD examination used the titration method. For the examination of Cu and Pb, the samples were taken from 10 different fishponds in the drainage basin of Sembilangan River, Kaliprau Village. The test of the heavy metal used the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (AAS) with three times repetition. Results: Sembilangan River and ten fishponds were classified into Group II in the criteria of water quality standard. The average of COD level was 0.134 ppm (>the tolerance limit of 25 ppm), and BOD level was 3.574 ppm (<NAB). Of 10 test locations, the content of the heavy metal of Cu and Pb was above the tolerant limit (Cu > 0.020 ppm and Pb > 0.030 ppm). The highest level of Cu was 2.325 ppm, and the lowest one was 0.497 ppm. The highest level of Pb was 1.480 ppm, and the lowest one was 0.430 ppm. Conclusion: Sembilangan River was the waste estuary from households and textile home industries and contains the level of BOD, Cu, and Pb above the tolerance limit (Cu > 0.020 ppm and Pb > 0.030 ppm).																	1936-6612	1936-7317				APR	2017	23	4					3534	3536		10.1166/asl.2017.9159								WOS:000403973600227

How seasonality and anthropogenic impacts can modulate the structure of aquatic benthic invertebrate assemblages	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												We studied a benthic invertebrate assemblage of a stream that passes through pristine, rural, suburban and urban areas of a municipality located in southeastern Brazil to investigate a possible relationship between this assemblage structure and urbanization. The environmental variables and fauna structure were analyzed in a spatial and temporal scale, sampling the four sites in a dry and wet season. We found a clear spatial pattern, with higher similarity between sites from rural and suburban area that presented intermediate environmental characteristics. The pristine site showed in both seasons the lowest values of alkalinity and fecal coliform. On the other hand, the site located in the urban area showed the lowest concentration of dissolved oxygen and higher of suspended solids, ammonia and fecal coliform. The extreme values of these three variables occurred in the wet season, probably related to the high rainfall values. The benthic invertebrate fauna structure followed the same longitudinal and seasonal pattern found for the environmental variables. The site in urban area showed the lowest richness, diversity and evenness, with a dominance of two groups resistant to adverse environmental conditions (Oligochaeta and Orthocladiinae) and absence of more sensitive groups (Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera). The increase drag of the substrate and associated invertebrates can be responsible for the lower abundance and richness observed in the wet season. The environmental variables that best defined the differentiation between sites (dissolved oxygen, organic suspended solids and fecal coliform) related directly to urbanization effects, like dump effluents and removal of riparian vegetation.																	1585-8553	1588-2756				APR	2017	18	1					47	55		10.1556/168.2017.18.1.6								WOS:000403545100006

We show the influence of high rainfall levels on the water quality, composition and seasonal succession of Cyanobacteria in the Sumarice reservoir, Serbia (44 degrees 01' 49 '' N, 20 52' 28 '' E). The changes in physical and chemical parameters of water, Chl-a, Cyanobacteria biomass, abundance of phytoplankton and Cyanobacteria along a temporal gradient are visualized using a self-organizing map (SOM). Data was collected monthly during 2013 and 2014. During 2013, the reservoir was characterized as mesotrophic and eutrophic, with a low level of nutrients (the maximum value of total phosphorus was 0.068 mg L-1 and total nitrogen was 0.764 mg L-1 in August), while the maximum values of Cyanobacteria biomass (12.7 mg L-1) and abundance (1.36 x 10(6) ind L-1) were in September, when Cyanobacteria represented 21% of the whole phytoplankton. In the following year (2014), after the extreme precipitation (227L m(-2) in May and 138 L m(-2) in July), the concentration of nutrients in the reservoir increased. In September, the maximum value of total phosphorus was 0.310 mg L-1, and the maximum value of total nitrogen was 6.828 mg L-1. In October, the maximum values of Cyanobacteria biomass (1567.28 mg L-1) and abundance (2.36 x 10(8) ind L-1) were recorded when the bloom of Aphanizomenonflos-aquae was observed, representing 98 % of the whole phytoplankton. This blooming is strongly positively correlated with the increase of total phosphorus and nitrogen. The extreme and long-term precipitation was significant enough to change the state of the reservoir from eutrophic to hypereutrophic.

Revisiting Killarney Provincial Park lakes (Ontario, Canada)	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Previous paleolimnological assessments have shown that many poorly buffered Canadian Shield lakes in the Sudbury (Ontario) region, including George and Lumsden lakes in Killarney Provincial Park (similar to 60 km southwest of Sudbury), acidified as a result of metal mining and smelting activities since the 1880s. In this paper, we revisit George and Lumsden lakes to conduct a paleolimnological re-assessment of these sites 25 years after the original sediment cores were collected. This updated study represents a period of chemical recovery from acidification, as well as the acceleration of regional climate warming. In agreement with the earlier paleolimnological study, our results also show that diatoms responded to acidification beginning 1920/30s, characterized by an increase in the relative abundance of acidobiontic Asterionella ralfsii. Although the most recent diatom assemblages (past 30 years) suggest that pH has likely returned to pre-acidification levels, the arrival and increases in diatom taxa absent in earlier sedimentary intervals (such as Asterionella formosa, Eunotia exigua, Frustulia magaliesmontana, and Kobayasiella subtilissima) signify the onset of new environmental conditions. The marked difference in composition between recent and pre-acidification diatom assemblages suggests a response to multiple environmental stressors, particularly regional warming, that has likely affected the trajectory of biological recovery. In these oli-gotrophic lakes, the recent increase in the relative abundance of Asterionella formosa, a rise in whole lake primary production, and a higher chrysophyte scale : diatom valve index suggest that regional warming has influenced the observed algal re-organization. Our paleolimnological investigation shows that, much like what had been reported for the Cladocera, the algal communities of these lakes have crossed climate-related limnological thresholds and are not returning to pre-acidification assemblages.

Surveillance and Molecular Identification of Acanthamoeba and Naegleria Species in Two Swimming Pools in Alexandria University, Egypt	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												Background: Swimming in contaminated water was reported to be associated with Acanthamoeba and N. fowleri human infections. The present study was carried out with the aim of isolation and identification of the different species of Acanthamoeba and Naegleria from two swimming pools in Alexandria University. Methods: Samples were collected from the swimming pools of Alexandria University Stadium and Faculty of Agriculture-Alexandria University during the period from May 2012 to April 2013. Results: Free- living amoebae were prevalent in the collected samples. Molecular characterization confirmed the identity of ten Acanthamoeba isolates and seven Naegleria isolates. Acanthamoeba T3, T4, T5, T11 and T15 genotypes were identified. Acanthamoeba T4 was the most prevalent genotype. Conclusion: The relatively high prevalence of Acanthamoeba, especially genotype T4, indicates the presence of a health hazard to swimmers particularly those wearing contact lenses. Naegleria fowleri was not found during the present study.

Preferences for policy attributes and willingness to pay for water quality improvements under uncertainty	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												When exploring environmental policy options, sometimes neither the current state of the environmental good being analyzed nor the effectiveness of the proposed policy is known with certainty. This is the case with privately owned, residential, onsite wastewater treatment systems (septic systems)-there is ample evidence that they can contribute to water quality impairment, but their contribution is generally stochastic in nature and the efficacy of technological solutions is uncertain. Furthermore, the benefits of ameliorating water quality impairments are public in nature. Septic system owners are legally responsible for maintaining their systems, but requiring them to upgrade otherwise properly functioning tanks is outside the scope of water quality regulations. An incentive structure is necessary to induce private homeowners to invest in septic upgrades that deliver both private benefits in addition to the positive externality for the wider public and environment. The question for policy makers is how these private incentives should be financed, and whether public support can be garnered. Results of a choice experiment in Gwinnett County, Georgia, accounting for both sources of uncertainty-the current state of water quality and the efficacy of the intervention-in the design of water quality policy are presented. We find baseline water quality conditions and policy efficacy significantly affect public support for a policy transferring public funds to private homeowners, in terms of both sentiment and willingness to pay. The manner in which costs are shared across stakeholders also affects the selection of a policy option, but not willingness to pay for it.

Biofuel as an Integrated Farm Drainage Management crop: A bioeconomic analysis	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Irrigated agricultural lands in arid regions often suffer from soil salinization and lack of drainage, which affect environmental quality and productivity. Integrated Farm Drainage Management (IFDM) systems, where drainage water generated from higher-valued crops grown on high quality soils are used to irrigate salt-tolerant crops grown on marginal soils, is one possible strategy for managing salinity and drainage problems. If the IFDM crop were a biofuel crop, both environmental and private benefits may be generated; however, little is known about this possibility. As such, we develop a bioeconomic programming model of irrigated agricultural production to examine the role salt-tolerant biofuel crops might play within an IFDM system. Our results, generated by optimizing profits over land, water, and crop choice decisions subject to resource constraints, suggest that based on the private profits alone, biofuel crops can be a competitive alternative to the common practices of land retirement and nonbiofuel crop production under both low to high drainage water salinity. Yet IFDM biofuel crop production generates 30-35% fewer GHG emissions than the other strategies. The private market competitiveness coupled with the public good benefits may justify policy changes encouraging the growth of IFDM biofuel crops in arid agricultural areas globally.

The CPs were determined by five tests and their significance was examined by two tests. Furthermore, trends were tested by three tests and their magnitudes were quantified by two tests. Novelty of the study lies in investigating significance of trends sequentially over years by applying Mann-Kendall (M-K) test. The identified CPs were similar for standard normal homogeneity test and cumulative deviations test at most stations. In contrast, Pettitt and Bayesian tests detected CP in years 2002 and 2005 at six and three stations, respectively, and their significance was verified. Results of sequential M-K test did not match with other tests' results. The mean annual rainfall after CP (350-627 mm) increased by 14-80% of the amount before CP (306-444 mm) with 7-42% reduction in coefficient of variation. The box-whisker plots supported these findings. Results of trend tests indicated statistically significant trends at Anjar, Bhachau, Mandvi and Rapar. Trend magnitudes by linear regression prior to CP (-6.2 to 7.1 mm year(-1)) showed an overall increase after CP (4.7-40.8 mm year(-1)) with negative trend at one station. Sen's slope test, showing good harmony with linear regression, revealed that trend magnitudes after CP were 2-10 times higher than that for 34-year period at six stations. Results of M-K test applied for sequential periods emphasized that rainfall trends are becoming stronger over time. This finding suggests that significance level of increasing rainfall trends may further increase in future. Finally, findings of this study are useful for planners and decision makers for developing policies to meet the challenges of the heightened rainfall in study area. Also, the approach used here may be adopted in other parts of the globe.

Results showed that the performance of both models can 'satisfactorily' predict NO3-N concentration. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), ratio of the root mean squared error to the standard deviation (RSR), and percent bias (PBIAS) for DRAINMOD-N II were 0.87, 0.36, and -2%, respectively, in simulating NO3-N concentration; and 0.84, 0.39, and -9%, respectively, in simulating NO3-N loss. By contrast, NSE, RSR, and PBIAS for RZWQM2 were 0.76, 0.49, and -3%, respectively, in simulating NO3-N concentration; and 0.64, 0.6, and -16%, respectively, in simulating NO3-N loss. This study indicated that both models can be used to simulate NO3-N loss and concentration in drainage flow at different N application rates. However, DRAINMOD-N II demonstrated slightly better performance than RZWQM2. In terms of the maximum contaminant level, the threshold N rates predicted by RZWQM2 and DRAINMOD-N II did not differ significantly from those in observations and can be used for agricultural production. This study highlights the advantages of DRAINMOD-N II in assessing the effects of nitrogen management practices.

VERTICAL ELECTRICAL SOUNDING (VES) FOR SALINITY ASSESSMENT OF WATER-BEARING FORMATIONS	IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE												Electrical resistivity surveys (1-D) were carried out at selected sites in the region between the confluent rivers (Ravi and Jhelum) of Punjab, Pakistan, to audit tubewell placement and depth in order to minimize the amount of salt applied to the soil through irrigation. The Schlumberger electrode configuration was employed to collect the resistivity data and the resultant resistivity vs depth models for each site were estimated. From the interpretation of vertical electrical sounding (VES) data, the sites had one to three aquifer layers of different salinity levels and fitness for irrigation (FFI) classes ranging from good groundwater quality (FFI1) to highly saline up to 6.4 dS m(-1) (FFI3). Twenty-one tubewells were investigated and it was found that not only were most wells theoretically suboptimally placed (57%) with respect to the best water quality available but also 33% were sunk at too deep a level, bypassing aquifer layers of better water quality [FFI1]. From the cost-benefit analysis, it was estimated that a total of 64 000 Pakistan rupees could have been saved on five wells through installation costs due to suboptimal depths. It is concluded that VES is an effective method for the evaluation of existing wells and aquifer systems.

The results showed that 16.7% and 15.0% of samples were positive for Cryptosporidium oocyst and Giardia cysts, respectively, with a mean concentration of 0.30 oocysts/10 L and 0.27 cysts/10 L. The oocysts and cysts were found to have higher rates of occurrence in August than in May. Genotyping confirmed the presence of Cryptosporidium hominis, C. parvum, and Giardia assemblages A and B, all of which were associated with human infections. The predominant species/assemblages were C. hominis and Giardia assemblage A. Analyses of the relationships between parasite oocysts/cysts, indicator bacteria, and physical-chemical parameters revealed that there was no correlation between 2 parasites and fecal bacterial indicators, whilst there was a significant correlation between protozoa and urea concentration, which indicates that urea concentration rather than fecal bacterial indicators might be an appropriate index for chlorine-resistant protozoa in swimming pools.

Turbidity in Apalachicola Bay, Florida from Landsat 5 TM and Field Data: Seasonal Patterns and Response to Extreme Events	REMOTE SENSING												Synoptic monitoring of estuaries, some of the most bio-diverse and productive environments on Earth, is essential to study small-scale water dynamics and its role on spatiotemporal variation in water quality important to indigenous marine species and surrounding human settlements. We present a detailed study of turbidity, an optical index of water quality, in Apalachicola Bay, Florida (USA) using historical in situ measurements and Landsat 5 TM data archive acquired from 2004 to 2011. Data mining techniques such as time-series decomposition, principal component analysis, and classification tree-based models were utilized to decipher time-series for examining variations in physical forcings, and their effects on diurnal and seasonal variability in turbidity in Apalachicola Bay. Statistical analysis showed that the bay is highly dynamic in nature, both diurnally and seasonally, and its water quality (e.g., turbidity) is largely driven by interactions of different physical forcings such as river discharge, wind speed, tides, and precipitation. River discharge and wind speed are the most influential forcings on the eastern side of river mouth, whereas all physical forcings were relatively important to the western side close to the major inlet, the West Pass. A bootstrap-optimized and atmospheric-corrected single-band empirical relationship (Turbidity (NTU) = 6568.23 x (Reflectance (Band 3))(1.95); R-2 = 0.77 +/- 0.06, range = 0.50-0.91, N = 50) is proposed with seasonal thresholds for its application in various seasons. The validation of this relationship yielded R-2 = 0.70 +/- 0.15 (range = 0.96-0.97; N = 38; RMSE = 7.78 +/- 2.59 NTU; Bias (%) = 8.70 +/- 11.48). Complex interactions of physical forcings and their effects on water dynamics have been discussed in detail using Landsat 5 TM-based turbidity maps during major events between 2004 and 2011. Promising results of the single-band turbidity algorithm with Landsat 8 OLI imagery suggest its potential for long-term monitoring of water turbidity in a shallow water estuary such as Apalachicola Bay.

As a key driver of coastal zone dynamics, suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is difficult to monitor with adequate spatial and temporal resolutions both in the field and using remote sensing. In particular, the spatial resolutions of currently available remote sensing data generated by satellite sensors designed for ocean color retrieval, such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) or SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor), are too coarse to capture the dimension and geomorphological heterogeneity of most estuaries and lagoons. In the present study, we explore the use of hyperspectral (Hyperion) and multispectral data, i.e., the Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus), ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), and ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite), to estimate SSC through semi-analytical and empirical approaches in the Venice lagoon (Italy). Key parameters of the retrieval models are calibrated and cross-validated by matching the remote sensing estimates of SSC with in situ data from a network of water quality sensors. Our analysis shows that, despite the higher spectral resolution, hyperspectral data provide limited advantages over the use of multispectral data, mainly due to information redundancy and cross-band correlation. Meanwhile, the limited historical archive of hyperspectral data (usually acquired on demand) severely reduces the chance of observing high turbidity events, which are relatively rare but critical in controlling the coastal sediment and geomorphological dynamics. On the contrary, retrievals using available multispectral data can encompass a much wider range of SSC values due to their frequent acquisitions and longer historical archive. For the retrieval methods considered in this study, we find that the semi-analytical method outperforms empirical approaches, when applied to both the hyperspectral and multispectral dataset. Interestingly, the improved performance emerges more clearly when the data used for testing are kept separated from those used in the calibration, suggesting a greater ability of semi-analytical models to "generalize" beyond the specific data set used for model calibration.

We also estimated the self-purification capability of TN and TP in Dianshan Lake. The results showed that interannual variability of the average concentration of TN in Dianshan Lake changed significantly, showing a characteristic increase before a decline, and the average concentration of TN showed an obvious downward trend, especially after 2007. Interannual variability of the average concentration of TP in Dianshan Lake fluctuated, and the average concentration of TP showed a downward trend after 2007. The seasonal variations of TN and TP in Dianshan Lake were similar. Higher TN concentration occurred in winter and spring, while higher TP concentration appeared in summer, autumn, and winter. The spatial distribution of TN and TP in Dianshan Lake were similar, showing a characteristic which decreased from north to south and west to east. The highest TN and TP values were mainly distributed in the inlet monitoring sites, while the lowest TP values were distributed in the outlet monitoring sites. The self-purification capability of TN and TP were about 2289.97 t/yr and 112.16 t/yr, which suggested a deterioration of natural water quality. Our research showed that Dianshan Lake was highly eutrophic and that water quality showed a substantial improvement from 1996 to 2015.																	2071-1050					APR	2017	9	4							500	10.3390/su9040500								WOS:000402090300023

Sustainable Ecosystem Services Framework for Tropical Catchment Management: A Review	SUSTAINABILITY												The monsoon season is a natural phenomenon that occurs over the Asian continent, bringing extra precipitation which causes significant impact on most tropical watersheds. The tropical region's countries are rich with natural rainforests and the economies of the countries situated within the region are mainly driven by the agricultural industry. In order to fulfill the agricultural demand, land clearing has worsened the situation by degrading the land surface areas. Rampant land use activities have led to land degradation and soil erosion, resulting in implications on water quality and sedimentation of the river networks. This affects the ecosystem services, especially the hydrological cycles. Intensification of the sedimentation process has resulted in shallower river systems, thus increasing their vulnerability to natural hazards (i.e., climate change, floods). Tropical forests which are essential in servicing their benefits have been depleted due to the increase in human exploitation. This paper provides an overview of the impact of land erosion caused by land use activities within tropical rainforest catchments, which lead to massive sedimentation in tropical rivers, as well as the effects of monsoon on fragile watersheds which can result in catastrophic floods. Forest ecosystems are very important in giving services to regional biogeochemical processes. Balanced ecosystems therefore, play a significant role in servicing humanity and ultimately, may create a new way of environmental management in a cost-effective manner. Essentially, such an understanding will help stakeholders to come up with better strategies in restoring the ecosystem services of tropical watersheds.

Ten districts in rural areas of Beijing, China were selected to study the effects of urbanization on drinking water quality. The relation between the urbanization index and drinking water quality indicators were explored. The influence of the urbanization process on drinking water quality showed that housing construction, population urbanization, energy consumption, and industrialization during urban development were closely related to drinking water quality. The paired t-test showed the total electricity consumption, living electricity consumption, tertiary industry, and the GDP growth rate had boundary (p = 0.06) or significantly positive (p < 0.05) relations with the qualified rate of rural drinking water. The grey correlation analysis showed that the growth rates of the value-added of housing construction areas were the most important factor affecting comprehensive water quality of Beijing rural areas, followed by the growth rates of the value-added by secondary industry and total electricity consumption, and then the growth rates of the value-added by the tertiary industry and GDP. Urbanization had a significant impact on individual water quality indicators. The results of this study provided some supports for drinking water security in the face of urbanization.																	2071-1050					APR	2017	9	4							461	10.3390/su9040461								WOS:000402090300002

Identification and Quantification of Nitrogen in a Reservoir, Jiaodong Peninsula, China	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Identification of nitrogen (N) sources is important in water quality control and management. Nitrogen pollution can lead to eutrophication of waterbodies and high concentrations of nitrate in drinking water can pose potential health problems. The N-15 isotope and nitrogen fluxes budget approach is useful for determining the source of NO3- to surface waters. In this study, mass balance and N-15 isotope approaches and nitrogen flux budgets were applied to identify total nitrogen (TN) sources and nitrogen transformation processes in the Menlou Reservoir (MR), Jiaodong Peninsula, China. The different fractions of nitrogen and their N-15 isotope signatures were analyzed in the reservoir water, river water, groundwater, soil, and atmospheric precipitation. The results indicate that surface runoff pollution (e.g., fertilizer and animal manure) is the main source of NO3- in MR. High concentrations of TN in MR are caused by low nitrogen self-purification (denitrification) rate, low sediment adsorption capacity, and the influx of NO3- rich groundwater.

Planning for the Future of Urban Biodiversity: A Global Review of City-Scale Initiatives	BIOSCIENCE												Cities represent considerable opportunities for forwarding global biodiversity and sustainability goals. We developed key attributes for conserving biodiversity and for ecosystem services that should be included in urban-planning documents and reviewed 135 plans from 40 cities globally. The most common attributes in city plans were goals for habitat conservation, air and water quality, cultural ecosystem services, and ecological connectivity. Few plans included quantitative targets. This lack of measurable targets may render plans unsuccessful for an actionable approach to local biodiversity conservation. Although most cities include both biodiversity and ecosystem services, each city tends to focus on one or the other. Comprehensive planning for biodiversity should include the full range of attributes identified, but few cities do this, and the majority that do are mandated by local, regional, or federal governments to plan specifically for biodiversity conservation. This research provides planning recommendations for protecting urban biodiversity based on ecological knowledge.

Optimization of Apparent Peak Viscosity in Carboxymethyl Cellulose Fracturing Fluid: Interactions of High Total Dissolved Solids, pH Value, and Crosslinker Concentration	SPE JOURNAL												It has been common practice to use a freshwater source (either ground water or surface water) as the base fluid for hydraulic fracturing with crosslinked-gel fluids. Currently, oil and gas operators are beginning to reuse and recycle the main byproduct of oil extraction, which is produced water. However, because of the high variability of produced-water quality (temporal and spatial), and the high content of total dissolved solids (TDS), the viscosity targets for the fluid can be difficult to achieve. The research described in this paper examines the sensitivity of higher-salinity waters to several variables related to the gel-formation process. The polymer used for the gel fluid was a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) derivative, and zirconium (Zr) was used as the crosslinking metal. Rheology experiments were conducted at different pH values, polymer loading, and crosslinker concentrations. The outcome of this research is presented in 3D contour-peak-viscosity maps that can be used by oil and gas operators and service companies to optimize the chemicals that are applied, thus reducing costs.																	1086-055X	1930-0220				APR	2017	22	2					615	621		10.2118/184396-PA								WOS:000401982200017

There has been a recent increase in the necessity of combining methods and tools to create interdisciplinary evaluations of water ecosystem services, especially in developing countries where there is a lack of systematized and updated socioenvironmental information. We propose a framework for the assessment of water supply ecosystem services that includes environmental, social and economic dimensions. We describe and develop each of these dimensions with a particular focus on identifying the key variables that are needed to answer them. First, we performed research of the literature regarding the evaluation methods that are sufficiently flexible to apply them to local scales in countries where information is limited. Then, we chose the Magdalena River Watershed to apply this perspective because it is an illustrative area of vital importance to Mexico City's ecosystem services. We believe that this proposal has outlined basic guidelines to help decision makers improve water management and may provide an opportunity to change public policies on peri-urban ecosystems.

J	Venturi, LAB; Capozzoli, CR				Bittar Venturi, Luis Antonio; Capozzoli, Caluan Rodrigues			Changes in the water quantity and quality of the Euphrates river are associated with natural aspects of the landscape	WATER POLICY												It has been argued that dam construction and irrigation projects in Turkey and Syria would diminish the flow of the Euphrates River and increase salinity levels. However, previous studies have not systematically defined the baseline changes in the quantity and quality of the river water. In this study, we associate variations in flow quantity and quality of water with natural aspects. We analysed flow data from 1970 to 2010 for the river at the Turkish-Syrian border to assess the effect of upstream dam construction, correlating these data with precipitation variation in Syria in the same period. In addition, we compared flow data between Syria and Iraq in a period with no dam construction in those countries (2000 to 2010). Regarding water quality, we collected samples from the Turkish-Syrian and Syrian-Iraqi borders to identify levels of salinity through laboratorial analysis. We complemented the data analysis with fieldwork along the river basin, and with evidence from the literature. We conclude that the slight diminishing of flow as well as the increasing salinity towards downstream are both associated with natural aspects of the landscape, more than human actions.																	1366-7017					APR	2017	19	2					233	256		10.2166/wp.2017.077								WOS:000401815400003

Reduced Phytoplankton and Zooplankton Diversity Associated with Increased Cyanobacteria in Lake Champlain, USA	JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY WATER RESEARCH & EDUCATION												Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients threaten water quality around the world, causing eutrophication and altering phytoplankton communities. In freshwater systems, certain physiochemical conditions, including high TP, low TN:TP, and warm temperatures, can lead to problematic cyanobacteria blooms. Cyanobacteria can decrease phytoplankton diversity and phytoplankton diversity has been positively linked to zooplankton diversity, suggesting that cyanobacteria may have indirect negative effects on zooplankton diversity. Using monitoring data from Lake Champlain, we tested three hypotheses: (1) cyanobacteria density and phytoplankton diversity are inversely related; (2) phytoplankton diversity and zooplankton diversity are positively related; and by extension (3) cyanobacteria density and zooplankton diversity are inversely related. Relationships were investigated separately at shallow (4-15 m) and deep (25-100 m) sites using several diversity metrics. At deep sites, cyanobacteria density was only related (positively) to zooplankton Shannon diversity. At shallow sites, all three hypotheses were supported by three of four diversity metrics; low phytoplankton richness appears to be the link between high cyanobacteria density and low zooplankton diversity. Our results suggest that cyanobacteria may indirectly reduce zooplankton diversity by decreasing resource heterogeneity, although our results based on observational data were also consistent with well-known direct pathways. Because low biodiversity can alter ecosystem processes and impair functioning, our results suggest that shallow systems may be more responsive to global change than deeper systems.																	1936-704X					APR	2017	160	1					100	118		10.1111/j.1936-704X.2017.03243.x								WOS:000401529000008

Isotherms were generated at pH=4.7 and 7.6 and the results were best fitted by the Freundlich isotherm model; good As(V) adsorption capacity was achieved for the Fe3O4 adsorbent at both pH values. Furthermore, pH effects were evaluated; the optimal pH value for adsorption was 8.27 with the adsorption capacity and the removal efficiency being 18.55 mg/g and 93.69%, respectively. Based on the measurements of the zeta potential and particle size of the adsorbent, we proposed that the overall pH dependence was a result of the combined effects of the zeta potential, particle size of the adsorbent, and existing form of As(V). From kinetics studies, the As(V) adsorption by Fe3O4 adsorbent followed the pseudo-second-order model and could be described by a two stage mechanism. When initial As(V) concentration was 1 ppm, 73% of the As(V) was adsorbed within the first 2.5 minutes and an overall removal efficiency of 82.5% was achieved in 2 hours. Increased removal efficiency is expected at higher adsorbent loading, thus allowing the post-treatment water to meet drinking water quality standards.																	1936-704X					APR	2017	160	1					132	143		10.1111/j.1936-704X.2017.03245.x								WOS:000401529000010

They play a key role in alleviating floods and filtering polluted water and also provide habitats for many plants and animals. Wetlands also interact with climate change. Over the past 50 years, wetlands have been polluted and declined dramatically as land cover has changed in some regions. Remote sensing has been the most useful tool to acquire spatial and temporal information about wetlands. In this paper, seven types of sensors were reviewed: aerial photos coarse-resolution, medium-resolution, high-resolution, hyperspectral imagery, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. This study also discusses the advantage of each sensor for wetland research. Wetland research themes reviewed in this paper include wetland classification, habitat or biodiversity, biomass estimation, plant leaf chemistry, water quality, mangrove forest, and sea level rise. This study also gives an overview of the methods used in wetland research such as supervised and unsupervised classification and decision tree and object-based classification. Finally, this paper provides some advice on future wetland remote sensing. To our knowledge, this paper is the most comprehensive and detailed review of wetland remote sensing and it will be a good reference for wetland researchers.

Water quality at points-of-use in the Galapagos Islands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Piped drinking water is often considered a gold standard for protecting public health but research is needed to explicitly evaluate the effect of centralized treatment systems on water quality in developing world settings. This study examined the effect of a new drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) on microbial drinking water quality at the point-of-use on San Cristobal Island, Galapagos using fecal indicator bacteria total coliforms and Escherichia coli. Samples were collected during six collection periods before and after operation of the DWTP began from the freshwater sources (n =4), the finished water (n = 6), and 50 sites throughout the distribution system (n = 287). This study found that there was a significant decrease in contamination by total coliforms (two orders of magnitude) and E. coli (one order of magnitude) after DWTP operation began (p < 0.001). However, during at least one post-construction collection cycle, total coliforms and E. coli were still found at 66% and 28% of points-of-use (n = 50), respectively. During the final collection period, conventional methods were augmented with human-specific Bacteroides assays - validated herein - with the goal of elucidating possible microbial contamination sources. Results show that E. coli contamination was not predictive of contamination by human wastes and suggests that observed indicator bacteria contamination may have environmental origins. Together these findings highlight the necessity of a holistic approach to drinking water infrastructure improvements in order to deliver high quality water through to the point-of-use.

Thus, monitoring of freshwater ecosystems and species is crucial to guide policy actions and dragonflies are generally considered to be good indicators for these systems. The aquatic life stage of the Odonata is inherently more susceptible to changes in water quality than the imago and therefore exuviae give better insights into site-specific effects. However, utilizing exuviae for monitoring purposes introduces a number of problems. For example, they often do not persist long in the environment. Some of these problems have been addressed. However, there are no published data that distinguish the influence of sampling frequency and total sampling effort on the faunal completeness. Also the number of exuviae necessary to define local assemblages has not been investigated. These questions were addressed by analyzing the data on exuviae collected in seven sites and we found that for any given total amount of time invested, it was always preferable to conduct more short surveys, rather than fewer surveys lasting longer. The study also showed that a sample size of 300 exuviae allowed us to reliably estimate the similarity of two assemblages from different sites. However, when collecting 40 exuviae or less, the reliability was low. Based on our findings we recommend sampling exuviae for a minimum of 5 days, evenly spread out over the entire season during which Odonata emerge, to sample each time for approximately 60 min and aim to collect not less than 300 exuviae in total.																	1366-638X	1572-9753				APR	2017	21	2					207	218		10.1007/s10841-017-9969-z								WOS:000401556400003

Effects of industrial plantations on ecosystem services and livelihoods: Perspectives of rural communities in China	LAND USE POLICY												This paper addresses the current research void on local community views of changes in ecosystem services associated with rapid land use transformation in the context of plantation-based forestry. This interview-based study, conducted in southern China, aims at assessing the perspectives of local communities of: 1) the effects of Eucalyptus industrial plantations on selected ecosystem services and on local development; and 2) opportunities for future community livelihood development, based on the relations with the government and with forest industry operating locally. We analysed data from semi-structured interviews with 70 villagers for their views on changes in ecosystem services after the establishment of plantations, and their future expectations on the local livelihood development. Most interviewees mentioned some negative development on environmental quality after the establishment of the industrial plantations, especially on soil and water. Furthermore, the reduced productivity of cropland surrounding industrial plantations, coupled with other financial drivers, induced several villagers to switch from agricultural crops to household plantations. In the absence of destructive typhoons, household plantations can provide owners more free time, higher income, while industrial plantations provided some employment opportunities. Interviewees' expectations for the future included receiving financial support and capacity building for household plantations and crops, support to local roads and schools, and higher employment opportunities. Some interviewees suggested that solutions should be implemented for improving degraded water quality, while others suggested reducing forestry operations. Even though being highly context-specific, our findings open up the discussion about the further community development opportunities in the context of plantation forestry. In particular, the potential of value sharing mechanisms between the private sector and the local communities should be further studied. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Rolfe, J; Whitten, S; Windle, J				Rolfe, John; Whitten, Stuart; Windle, Jill			The Australian experience in using tenders for conservation	LAND USE POLICY												Over the past 15 years Australia has been trialling conservation tenders and other market based instrument approaches to generate environmental outcomes, particularly on private lands. The best known of these is the BushTender auction for vegetation protection in Victoria, begun in the early 2000s. Subsequently, nearly 100 other tenders for biodiversity protection have been run in Australia with substantial variations in application and methodology generated by a mix of both intended design and case study differences. The number of separate conservation tenders that have been performed, and the variations in environmental targets, state jurisdictions, case study circumstances, design and implementation, provides a rich data base of projects for analysis - unique at the international level. The review section of the paper covers three broad areas. The first aim is to provide an overview of the various tenders and their history and design in different settings. The second is to review their application, particularly in relation to auction design, metric design and contract design aspects, while the third is to identify the extent to which tenders provided more cost-effective outcomes than alternatives such a fixed rate grants. An additional goal is to explain why, after so many trials, conservation tenders are not more widely used in Australia. Key conclusions are that the multiple trials show that tenders are robust, relatively simple to apply and deliver more cost-effective allocations of public funding than other grant mechanisms. The reasons for their limited use can be related more to political and bureaucratic forces and inertia rather than to economic and design limitations. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This embryo will develop into a mature organism capable of producing gametes again. This colloquial statement comprehends however the most complex mechanisms in biology, namely, cell differentiation and cell reprogramming. Epigenetic modifications are major actors in this process, both during gametogenesis and embryo development. The epigenetic concept is resulting from the growing scientific understanding of embryology and genetics, and it is made operational by generic molecular mechanisms, namely DNA methylation, histone tails modifications, and non-coding RNAs. Epigenetic modifications associated with gamete differentiation and early embryo development are quite well described in mammals, but increasing research is developed in fish today, either in model or in aquaculture species. Because fish are living organisms thoroughly exposed to temperature and to water quality, environment is likely to influence the epigenetic pattern of the gametes, embryo, or adult organisms. Reproductive biotechnologies are also at risk to modify gametes and embryo epigenetics. This review is aimed towards giving the basic knowledge on the molecular actors of epigenetics, highlighting the developing knowledge in mammals which can be useful to fish research and proposing the possible area where epigenetics can enrich research on fish gametes and reproductive technologies.

Carbonate buffering and metabolic controls on carbon dioxide in rivers	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Multiple processes support the significant efflux of carbon dioxide (CO2) from rivers and streams. Attribution of CO2 oversaturation will lead to better quantification of the freshwater carbon cycle and provide insights into the net cycling of nutrients and pollutants. CO2 production is closely related to O-2 consumption because of the metabolic linkage of these gases. However, this relationship can be weakened due to dissolved inorganic carbon inputs from groundwater, carbonate buffering, calcification, and anaerobic metabolism. CO2 and O-2 concentrations and other water quality parameters were analyzed in two data sets: a synoptic field study and nationwide water quality monitoring data. CO2 and O-2 concentrations were strongly negatively correlated in both data sets (rho = -0.67 and rho = -0.63, respectively), although the correlations were weaker in high-alkalinity environments. In nearly all samples, the molar oversaturation of CO2 was a larger magnitude than molar O-2 undersaturation. We used a dynamically coupled O-2-CO2 model to show that lags in CO2 air-water equilibration are a likely cause of this phenomenon. Lags in CO2 equilibration also impart landscape-scale differences in the behavior of CO2 between high- and low-alkalinity watersheds. Although the concept of carbonate buffering and how it creates lags in CO2 equilibration with the atmosphere is well understood, it has not been sufficiently integrated into our understanding of CO2 dynamics in freshwaters. We argue that the consideration of carbonate equilibria and its effects on CO2 dynamics are primary steps in understanding the sources and magnitude of CO2 oversaturation in rivers and streams. Plain Language Summary Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from streams and rivers is known to be large. The source of CO2 in these systems is of high interest to researchers because it provides important clues about the carbon cycle and the overall biogeochemical functioning of freshwaters. The scientific questions surrounding CO2 emissions from freshwaters have focused on whether CO2 is produced within the aquatic environment through the decomposition of organic material or whether CO2 is produced mostly in soil and groundwater and then delivered to freshwater environments where it is passively emitted to the atmosphere. Both explanations have a basis in reality, and yet neither fully explains the magnitude of estimated CO2 emissions. We examined how CO2 interacts with the rest of the carbonate buffering system to structure CO2 emission to the atmosphere. We found that daily cycles in photosynthesis and decomposition can create continuous CO2 oversaturation because of lags created through carbonate buffering. At the landscape scale, differences were evident in CO2 excess between watersheds having high versus low carbonate buffering. Our conclusions highlight that carbonate buffering is the primary control on CO2 concentration in surface waters and needs to be considered to understand the observations of CO2 excess in freshwaters.

Triplicate water samples were taken monthly. Analysis was done for 18 water quality variables including nitrate-nitrogen (NO3- L-N) and ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N), orthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) and total-phosphorus (T-P), potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, aluminum, boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese, zinc (Zn), pH, total alkalinity (T-Alk), electrical conductivity (EC), and sodium. Additionally, 15 RCBs from 10 nurseries in Alabama (AL), Louisiana (LA), and MS were sampled in 2014 and 2016. Most prevalent correlations (P = 0.01) were between macronutrients, EC, B, Fe, and Zn, but none were prevalent across a majority of RCBs. Water quality parameter values were mostly present at low to preferred levels in all 25 waterways. Macronutrient levels were highest for a RCB that receives fertility from fertigation derived runoff. Water pH ranged from acidic to alkaline (> 8). Results of this study show water quality in RCBs can be suitable for promoting plant health in ornamental plant nurseries, but also shows levels will vary between individual RCBs, therefore demonstrates need to verify water quality from individual water sources.																	0018-5345	2327-9834				APR	2017	52	4					641	648		10.21273/HORTSCI11647-16								WOS:000401247200023

Particle Size of Volcanic Tuff Improves Shoot Growth and Flower Quality of Asiatic Hybrid Lily Using Soilless Culture	HORTTECHNOLOGY												Soilless substrates enhance growing environment, nutrient content, and water quality in the growing medium. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of substrate particle size on growth and flower quality (flower number and length per plant) of two asiatic hybrid lily (Lilium x elegans) cultivars Fangio and Ercolano. Plants were grown in 12-L pot under greenhouse conditions. Five grades of particle-size substrate, consisting of granulated volcanic material (tuff) were used as treatments. These sizes were 0 to 2, 0 to 4, 0 to 8, 2 to 4, and 4 to 8 mm. Fertigation was applied daily. Plant morphology, physiology, and flower quality were determined during flowering stage. Treatments of 2 to 4-and 4 to 8-mm tuff had lower water holding capacity (WHC), bulk density, electrical conductivity (EC), and pH compared with 0 to 2-and 0 to 4-mm tuff. In addition, plant height, leaf area, and flower quality of ` Fangio' were higher compared with 'Ercolano'. Chlorophyll content and fluorescence were similar among all treatments. Leaf fresh weight, leaf area, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, and flower quality were higher in sizes of 0 to 4-, 2 to 4-, and 4 to 8-mm than 0 to 2-mm tuff, especially those from 'Fangio'. The 0 to 4-mm substrate had an optimal and consistent flower quality results in both cultivars when compared with other tuff sizes. Overall, the results presented here suggest that using 0 to 4-mm tuff substrate holds promise for improving growth and flower quality of asiatic hybrid lily grown under soilless culture.

Pure, tap and spring water were tested, and water quality was found to have a distinct effect on the main compounds extracted. Pure water, which was weakly acidic and low in dissolved ions, achieved the highest catechin content, whereas caffeine and theanine, and amino acids, were higher in infusions made with spring and tap water, respectively. Sensory evaluation was performed to evaluate infusion colour, taste and aroma, and sensory quality was similarly influenced by water type, due primarily to differences in dissolved ions. Pure water was more suitable for brewing white tea with superior colour, aroma and taste.																	0022-1155	0975-8402				APR	2017	54	5					1206	1211		10.1007/s13197-017-2571-2								WOS:000401448300019	28416871

Seven coastal villages of Vizianagaram district of Andhra Pradesh were selected for the present study. Various physicochemical parameters such as pH, EC, TDS, THW, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, F, nitrite were analyzed for the samples collected. From such data WQI values were computed and it was concluded that the ground water of the villages under study was rated as "poor" in its quality. Artificial Neural networks tool in MATLAB was adopted and the feedback propagation and TRAINGLM program was used to predict the water quality of the ground water using WQI. The ANN predicted WQI values were found to be well in accordance with the experimentally computed values. A relative error of 0.15% between the predicted and experimentally computed values was observed. The regression coefficient values for testing and validation of the program was well within the prescribed limits.																	0019-4522					APR	2017	94	4					441	448										WOS:000401309500011

Fishing removes nutrients from the water ecosystem, and the size of the fish stock also influences eutrophication through food web effects and other mechanisms. We show that fisheries have a role to play in cost-efficient water quality management in combination with external load reductions. Our numerical application considers phosphorus driven eutrophication, agricultural phosphorus abatement and fisheries targeted on cyprinids on a coastal bay in the Baltic Sea. The socially and privately optimal intensity of fishing efforts, phosphorus abatement and the resulting water quality are influenced by damages, revenues and costs. Furthermore, we show that the link between cyprinid fish stock and water quality, and the form of the fishing industry - sole owner or open access - have joint dynamics that lead to very different outcomes. A weak link between cyprinid stock and water quality is associated with socially optimal stock close to its maximum sustainable yield. This maximizes phosphorus removal. With a strong link, socially optimal stock and phosphorus removal are low. Coincidentally, open-access fishing sometimes yields socially desirable outcome automatically - a market failure in industry structure may counteract eutrophication.

This crisis led to different forms of grassroots activism demanding political accountability, transparency, and redress. However, residents' experiences and their needs and demands in response to the crisis have been largely ignored. This article explores the mechanisms of suppression at work in obscuring these needs and demands. Specifically, it sheds light on the role of the public sector, the media, and the academic institutions in reproducing these mechanisms of suppression. The article situates the struggles over political accountability within the neoliberalization of public administration and government through emergency management. Capital accumulation can continue and intensifies, whereas emergency management further contributes to suppressing public dissent in the times of crisis via the erosion of political accountability. By illuminating institutionalized mechanisms of suppression of residents' needs and demands, we argue that the Flint water crisis should also be seen as a crisis of government, journalism, and academia.

This study identified key factors influencing consumers' perception of water quality in a highly urbanized coastal city, experiencing chronic water shortages, overexploitation of groundwater, and accelerated saltwater intrusion. Household surveys were administered to residents to capture views and perceptions of consumed water. Concomitantly, groundwater and tap water samples were collected and analyzed at each residence for comparison with perceptions. People's rating of groundwater quality was found to correlate to the measured water quality both in the dry and wet seasons. In contrast, perceptions regarding the water quality of the public water supply network did not show any correlation with the measured tap water quality indicators. Logistic regression models developed to predict perception based on salient variables indicated that age, apartment ownership, and levels of total dissolved solids play a significant role in shaping perceptions regarding groundwater quality. Perceptions concerning the water quality of the public water supply network appeared to be independent of the measured total dissolved solids levels at the tap but correlated to those measured in the wells. The study highlights misconceptions that can arise as a result of uncontrolled cross-connections of groundwater to the public supply network water and the development of misaligned perceptions based on prior consumption patterns, water shortages, and a rapidly salinizing groundwater aquifer.

As a result, the realism of objectives and the attainment of related ecological standards are under doubt. This paper gets to the bottom of a river basin management plan of a eutrophic lake in Finland and presents the ecological and economic impacts of environmental and societal drivers and planned management measures. For these purposes, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation of a diffuse nutrient load, lake water quality and cost-benefit models. Simulations were integrated into a Bayesian influence diagram that revealed the basic uncertainties. It turned out that the attainment of good ecological status as qualified in the Water Framework Directive of the European Union is unlikely within given socio-economic constraints. Therefore, management objectives and ecological and economic standards need to be reassessed and reset to provide a realistic goal setting for management. More effort should be put into the evaluation of the total monetary benefits and on the monitoring of lake phosphorus balances to reduce the uncertainties, and the resulting margin of safety and costs and risks of planned management measures.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				APR	2017	59	4					584	593		10.1007/s00267-016-0806-z								WOS:000400444400005	27981355

A Bayesian spatial durbin probit model is used to survey data collected from farmers in the Waikato region of New Zealand. The results show that farmers located near each other exhibit similar choice behaviour, indicating the importance of farmer interactions in adoption decisions. The results also address that information acquisition is the most important determinant of farmers' adoption of best management practices. Financial problems are considered a significant barrier to adopting best management practices. Overall, the existence of distance decay effect and spatial dependence in farmers' adoption decisions highlights the importance of accounting for spatial effects in farmers' decision-making, which emerges as crucial to the formulation of sustainable agriculture policy.

Characterizing the Effects of Stormwater Mitigation on Nutrient Export and Stream Concentrations	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Urbanization increases nutrient loading and lowers residence times for processing of reactive solutes, including nitrate, total dissolved nitrogen, orthophosphate, and dissolved organic carbon), which leads to increased stream concentrations and mass export. Stormwater control measures mitigate the impacts of urbanization, and have the potential to improve stream water quality, however the net effect instream is not well understood. We monitored two urban and two suburban watersheds in Charlotte, NC to determine if mitigation controlled the fraction of total mass export during storm, if development classification as either urban or suburban (defined by the age, density and distribution of urban development) controlled storm nutrient and carbon dynamics, and if stormwater control measures were able to change stream water chemistry. While average concentrations during stormflow were generally greater than baseflow, indicating that storms are important times of solute export, the fraction of storm-derived export was unrelated to mitigation by stormwater control measures. Development classification was generally not an important control on export of N and dissolved organic carbon. However, event mean concentrations of orthophosphate were higher at the suburban sites, possibly from greater fertilizer application. Stormwater control measures influenced instream water chemistry at only one site, which also had the greatest mitigated area, but differences between stormwater control measure outflow and stream water suggest the potential for water quality improvements. Together, results suggest stormwater control measures have the potential to decrease solute concentrations from urban runoff, but the type, location, and extent of urban development in the watershed may influence the magnitude of this effect.

Mowing Submerged Macrophytes in Shallow Lakes with Alternative Stable States: Battling the Good Guys?	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Submerged macrophytes play an important role in maintaining good water quality in shallow lakes. Yet extensive stands easily interfere with various services provided by these lakes, and harvesting is increasingly applied as a management measure. Because shallow lakes may possess alternative stable states over a wide range of environmental conditions, designing a successful mowing strategy is challenging, given the important role of macrophytes in stabilizing the clear water state. In this study, the integrated ecosystem model PCLake is used to explore the consequences of mowing, in terms of reducing nuisance and ecosystem stability, for a wide range of external nutrient loadings, mowing intensities and timings. Elodea is used as a model species. Additionally, we use PCLake to estimate how much phosphorus is removed with the harvested biomass, and evaluate the long-term effect of harvesting. Our model indicates that mowing can temporarily reduce nuisance caused by submerged plants in the first weeks after cutting, particularly when external nutrient loading is fairly low. The risk of instigating a regime shift can be tempered by mowing halfway the growing season when the resilience of the system is highest, as our model showed. Up to half of the phosphorus entering the system can potentially be removed along with the harvested biomass. As a result, prolonged mowing can prevent an oligo-to mesotrophic lake from becoming eutrophic to a certain extent, as our model shows that the critical nutrient loading, where the lake shifts to the turbid phytoplankton-dominated state, can be slightly increased.

We hypothesized that the physical and chemical features of end-pit lakes reduce critical littoral habitat and thus reduce invertebrate diversity, thereby limiting the potential for these lakes to be naturalized. We used a multivariate approach using principle component analysis and redundancy analysis to study relationships between invertebrate community structure, habitat features, and water quality in five end-pit lakes and five natural lakes in the Rocky Mountain foothills of west-central Alberta, Canada. Results show a significantly different invertebrate community structure was present in end-pit lakes as compared with reference lakes in the same region, which could be accounted for by water hardness, conductivity, slope of the littoral zone, and phosphorus concentrations. Habitat diversity in end-pit lakes was also limited, cover provided by macrophytes was scarce, and basin slopes were significantly steeper in pit lakes. Although water chemistry is currently the strongest influencing factor on the invertebrate community, physical challenges of habitat homogeneity and steep slopes in the littoral zones were identified as major drivers of invertebrate community structure. The addition of floating wetlands to the littoral zone of existing pit lakes can add habitat complexity without the need for large-scale alterations to basing morphology, while impermeable capping of waste-rock and the inclusion of littoral habitat in the planning process of new pit lakes can improve the success of integrating new pit lakes into the landscape.

The resulting eutrophication promotes phytoplankton blooms, in many cases of toxic cyanobacteria. Ecological models can simulate the main processes driving algal blooms. They help to understand how phytoplankton responds to different forcing. Another major use of models is as predictive tool supporting the management of water resources. Yuqiao Reservoir is the main drinking water source for Tianjin, the fifth most populated city in China. During the last decade, drinking water production has been impaired by recurrent cyanobacteria blooms. The water quality management of the reservoir, conducted by the Hai River Water Conservancy Commission, requires an early warning system in order to anticipate the cyanobacteria blooms and to adapt the treatment process. Therefore, within the framework of a French-Chinese project on Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) of the catchment of the Hai river, a modelling approach of cyanobacteria growth, which could be later embedded in an early warning system, was proposed. In this study, we calibrated a one-dimensional vertical, physical-ecological model aimed at forecasting cyanobacteria blooms in the Yuqiao Reservoir. We first introduce the study site and its ecological status. Then we describe the model and the input data set. The calibration and validation results are presented for water temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration at the measurement dates. The short-term forecast modelling is performed for temperature and cyanobacteria over a 5-day ahead period. Two weather scenarios are considered: one favourable for cyanobacteria and one disfavourable.

DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A PHYSICALLY BASED MODEL OF STREAMBANK EROSION FOR COUPLING WITH A BASIN-SCALE HYDROLOGIC MODEL SWAT	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												A comprehensive streambank erosion model based on excess shear stress has been developed and incorporated in the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). It takes into account processes such as weathering, vegetative cover, and channel meanders to adjust critical and effective stresses while estimating bank erosion. The streambank erosion model was tested for performance in the Cedar Creek watershed in north-central Texas where streambank erosion rates are high. A Rapid Geomorphic field assessment (RAP-M) of the Cedar Creek watershed was done adopting techniques developed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the stream segments were categorized into various severity classes. Based on the RAP-M field assessment, erosion pin sites were established at seven locations within the severely eroding streambanks of the watershed. A Monte Carlo simulation was carried out to assess the sensitivity of different parameters that control streambank erosion such as critical shear stress, erodibility, weathering depth, and weathering duration. The sensitive parameters were adjusted and the model was calibrated based on the bank erosion severity category identified by the RAP-M field assessment. The average observed erosion rates were in the range 25367 mm year(-1). The SWAT model was able to reasonably predict the bank erosion rates within the range of variability observed in the field (R-2 = 0.90; E = 0.78).

EFFECTS OF SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PRAIRIE VEGETATION IN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE ON CURVE NUMBER VALUES	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The curve number (CN) method is used to calculate runoff in many hydrologic models, including the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The CN method does not account for the spatial distribution of land cover types, an important factor controlling runoff patterns. The objective of this study was to empirically derive CN values that reflect the strategic placement of native prairie vegetation (NPV) within row crop agricultural landscapes. CNs were derived using precipitation and runoff data from a seven-year period for 14 small watersheds in Iowa. The watersheds were planted with varying amounts of NPV located in different watershed positions. The least squares and asymptotic least squares methods (LSM) were used to derive CNs using an initial abstraction coefficient (lambda) of 0.2 and 0.05. The CNs were verified using leave-one-out cross-validation and adjustment for antecedent moisture conditions (AMC) was tested. The asymptotic method produced CN values for watersheds with NPV treatment that were 8.9 and 14.7% lower than watersheds with 100% row crop at lambda = 0.2 and lambda = 0.05, respectively. The derived CNs produced Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values ranging from 0.4 to 0.7 during validation. Our analyses show the CNs verified best for the asymptotic LSM, when using lambda of 0.05 and adjusting for AMC. Further, comparison of derived CNs against an area weighted CN indicated that the placement of vegetation does impact the CN value.

EFFECTS OF IMPERVIOUS AREA AND BMP IMPLEMENTATION AND DESIGN ON STORM RUNOFF AND WATER QUALITY IN EIGHT SMALL WATERSHEDS	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												The effects of increases in effective impervious area (EIA) and the implementation of water quality protection designed detention pond best management practices (BMPs) on storm runoff and stormwater quality were assessed in Gwinnett County, Georgia, for the period 2001-2008. Trends among eight small watersheds were compared, using a time trend study design. Significant trends were detected in three storm hydrologic metrics and in five water quality constituents that were adjusted for variability in storm characteristics and climate. Trends in EIA ranged from 0.10 to 1.35, and changes in EIA treated by BMPs ranged from 0.19 to 1.32; both expressed in units of percentage of drainage area per year. Trend relations indicated that for every 1% increase in watershed EIA, about 2.6, 1.1, and 1.5% increases in EIA treated by BMPs would be required to counteract the effects of EIA added to the watersheds on peak streamflow, stormwater yield, and storm streamflow runoff, respectively. Relations between trends in EIA, BMP implementation, and water quality were counterintuitive. This may be the result of (1) changes in constituent inputs in the watersheds, especially downstream of areas treated by BMPs; (2) BMPs may have increased the duration of stormflow that results in downstream channel erosion; and/or (3) spurious relationships between increases in EIA, BMP implementation, and constituent inputs with development rates.

In order to ascertain the groundwater quality a detailed survey was carried-out and a total 88 numbers of groundwater samples were collected from different locations of the Durg district. Various physicochemical parameters of collected groundwater samples were analyzed for the periods of 5-years from 2007 to 2011 during premonsoon period. Six criteria viz. pH, calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), chloride (Cl-), nitrate (NO- (3)) and fluoride (F-) were used for the determination of groundwater quality index. The analytical hierarchical process (AHP) used to determine the weight of various parameters and their classes for identifying the groundwater quality index.

Surface velocity divergence model of air/water interfacial gas transfer in open-channel flows	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS												Air/water interfacial gas transfer through a free surface plays a significant role in preserving and restoring water quality in creeks and rivers. However, direct measurements of the gas transfer velocity and reaeration coefficient are still difficult, and therefore a reliable prediction model needs to be developed. Varying systematically the bulk-mean velocity and water depth, laboratory flume experiments were conducted and we measured surface velocities and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in open-channel flows to reveal the relationship between DO transfer velocity and surface divergence (SD). Horizontal particle image velocimetry measurements provide the time-variations of surface velocity divergence. Positive and negative regions of surface velocity divergence are transferred downstream in time, as occurs in boil phenomenon on natural river free-surfaces. The result implies that interfacial gas transfer is related to bottom-situated turbulence motion and vertical mass transfer. The original SD model focuses mainly on small-scale viscous motion, and this model strongly depends on the water depth. Therefore, we modify the SD model theoretically to accommodate the effects of the water depth on gas transfer, introducing a non-dimensional parameter that includes contributions of depth-scale large-vortex motion, such as secondary currents, to surface renewal events related to DO transport. The modified SD model proved effective and reasonable without any dependence on the bulk mean velocity and water depth, and has a larger coefficient of determination than the original SD model. Furthermore, modeling of friction velocity with the Reynolds number improves the practicality of a new formula that is expected to be used in studies of natural rivers.

Cleaner technology is, on the one side a goal pursued at international, european and national level, and on the other hand is a concept that covers many aspects of both the actual economic activities and of the environmental protection. This paper aims is on the one hand, to show how a tehnological process should be analyzed by highlighting the relationships between elements of the industrial process, according to some scheme, precisely in order to obtain so-called clean technologies and on the other hand in the specific case of chemical pollution, to present most used evolutionary models on a chemical production forecast.																	0034-7752					APR	2017	68	4					772	775										WOS:000400732400030

Rainfall effects on inflow and infiltration in wastewater treatment systems in a coastal plain region	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Aging wastewater collection and treatment systems have not received as much attention as other forms of infrastructure, even though they are vital to public health, economic growth, and environmental quality. Inflow and infiltration (I&I) are among potentially widespread problems facing central sewage collection and treatment systems, posing risks of sanitary system overflows (SSOs),system degradation, and water quality impairment, but remain poorly quantified. Whole-system analyses of I& I were conducted by regression analyses of system flow responses to rainfall and temperature for 93 wastewater treatment plants in 23 counties in eastern North Carolina, USA, a coastal plain region with high water tables and generally higher rainfalls than the continental interior. Statistically significant flow responses to rainfall were found in 92% of these systems, with 2-year average I& I values exceeding 10% of rainless system flow in over 40% of them. The effects of rainfall, which can be intense in this coastal region, have region-wide implications for sewer system performance and environmental management. The positive association between rainfall and excessive I& I parallels the effects of storm water runoff on water quality, in that excessive I& I can also drive SSOs, thus confounding water quality protection efforts.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				APR	2017	75	8					1909	1921		10.2166/wst.2017.072								WOS:000400374700017	28452783

This paper attempts to investigate various factors and their influence on magnitude and extent of subsidence. The study was conducted in the Jharia coalfields, India where extraction of thick seams at shallow depths has damaged the ground surface in the form of subsidence. For precise pre- estimation of subsidence, it is therefore necessary to know the contribution of each factor to the occurrence of subsidence. In order to achieve the objectives of this study, several multivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis (FA), principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) have been used. Two factors were extracted using FA. Factor 1 and factor 2 account for 42.327% and 24.661% of the variability respectively. Factor 1 represents "natural factor" whereas factor 2 represents "subsidence coefficient". Spatial variations in regarding susceptibility to the subsidence were determined from hierarchical CA using the linkage distance. Further, the findings of this study would be helpful for prediction of magnitude of subsidence empirically.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	8							191	10.1007/s12517-017-2985-1								WOS:000400266200007

Youth-focused citizen science: Examining the role of environmental science learning and agency for conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Citizen science by youth is rapidly expanding, but very little research has addressed the ways programs meet the dual goals of rigorous conservation science and environmental science education. We examined case studies of youth-focused community and citizen science (CCS) and analyzed the learning processes and outcomes, and stewardship activities for youth, as well as contributions to site and species management, each as conservation outcomes. Examining two programs (one coastal and one water quality monitoring) across multiple sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, CA, in-and out-of-school settings, we qualitatively analyzed in-depth observations and pre- and post-program interviews with youth and educators. First, we examined evidence from the programs' impacts on conservation in the form of contribution to site and species management. We found that youth work informed regional resource management and local habitat improvement. Second, we examined the youth participants' environmental science agency (ESA). ESA combines not only understanding of environmental science and inquiry practices, but also the youths' identification with those practices and their developing belief that the ecosystem is something on which they act. We found that youth developed different aspects of environmental science agency in each context. We identify three key CCS processes through which many of the youth developed ESA: ensuring rigorous data collection, disseminating scientific findings to authentic external audiences, and investigating complex social-ecological systems. Our findings suggest that when CCS programs for youth support these processes, they can foster youth participation in current conservation actions, and build their capacity for future conservation actions.

J	Dudek, M; Kancir, E; Oye, G				Dudek, Marcin; Kancir, Eugenie; Oye, Gisle			Influence of the Crude Oil and Water Compositions on the Quality of Synthetic Produced Water	ENERGY & FUELS												Produced water originates from crude oil production. It is a mixture of organic and inorganic compounds, and its composition is highly oilfield-dependent. The present study was carried out to increase the understanding of the effects of the relationships between the crude oil properties and the composition of the aqueous phase on the quality of the produced water. Brines with different compositions and pH levels were mixed with five crude oils. Initially, the physicochemical properties and compositions of the crude oils were determined, and the qualities of samples of synthetic produced water were described by parameters such as the total oil concentration, total organic carbon content, pH, drop size distribution, and Sauter mean diameter. Analysis of the characterization data revealed that the crude oils fell into two categories: light and heavier oils. Most parameters such as density, viscosity, total acid number (TAN), and composition reflected this division. A similar pattern was sustained for the water-quality analyses. Water produced with heavier crude oils generally contained higher concentrations of emulsified oil with the largest and most polydisperse droplets. Light oils had a tendency to create water-in-oil emulsions between the oil and water phases, which impeded the phase separation, resulting in less free water. The Sauter mean drop diameters were found to increase with the pH of the water phase. However, the presence of calcium at the highest pH decreased the droplet size and the amount of free water, compared to the results obtained using brine without divalent ions, in agreement with the interfacial role of naphthenic acids in crude oil emulsions. The results showed the significance of both the water and oil compositions on the quality of the produced water, which can lead to an improved fundamental understanding of the process for treating produced water.																	0887-0624	1520-5029				APR	2017	31	4					3708	3716		10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b03297								WOS:000400039800037						
J	Batabyal, AK				Batabyal, Asit Kumar			Hydrogeochemical processes and contaminants enrichment with special emphasis on fluoride in groundwater of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The hydrogeochemistry of groundwater in rural parts of Birbhum district, West Bengal, India, has been studied to understand the contaminants and prime processes involved in their enrichment with a focus on F- concentration. The lithological units consist of Quaternary alluviums with underlying Rajmahal basaltic rocks of Middle Jurassic age. Groundwater occurs in the alluviums, weathered residuum and fracture zone of Rajmahal rocks. Studies show elevated concentration of Cl-, SiO2, Fe and F-; excess Cl- is attributed to anthropogenic inputs, SiO2 is ascribed to high degree of weathering of silica rich host rocks, and high Fe is due to the interaction of water with Fe-rich sediments under reducing condition. The F- concentration is found high (>1.20 mg/L) mainly in water from Rajmahal rocks revealing a lithological control on F- enrichment. The weathering of silicates and ion exchange are the leading controlling processes for major ions in groundwater. The F- enrichment is due to the dissolution of F--bearing minerals and perhaps also through anion exchange (OH- for F-) on clay minerals at high alkaline conditions; precipitation of CaCO3 favours CaF2 dissolution leading to elevated F- concentration. CaHCO3, the dominant water type, contains low F- while NaHCO3 and NaCl types exhibit high F- concentrations. Among the three spatial associations, Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 are CaHCO3 type; Cluster-3 shows NaHCO3 and NaCl waters with low Ca2+ and Mg2+ and high Na+ contents. Cluster-1 and Cluster-2 waters are, in general, drinkable barring the elevated Fe content, while Cluster-3 water is unsafe for drinking due to the high F- concentration.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							285	10.1007/s12665-017-6584-y								WOS:000399674700022

Serpentine geology links to water quality and heavy metals in sediments of a stream system in central Queensland, Australia	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Serpentinite soils, common throughout the world, are characterized by low calcium-to-magnesium ratios, low nutrient levels and elevated levels of heavy metals. Yet the water quality and heavy metal concentrations in sediments of streams draining serpentine geology have been little studied. The aim of this work was to collect baseline data on the water quality (for both wet and dry seasons) and metals in sediments at 11 sites on the Marlborough Creek system, which drains serpentine soils in coastal central Queensland, Australia. Water quality of the system was characterized by extremely hard waters (555-698 mg/L as CaCO3), high dissolved salts (684-1285 mg/L), pH (8.3-9.1) and dissolved oxygen (often >110% saturation). Cationic dominance was Mg > Na > Ca > K and for anions HCO3 > Cl > SO4. Al, Cu and Zn in stream waters were naturally high and exceeded Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council guidelines. Conductivity displayed the highest seasonal variability, decreasing significantly after wet season flows. There was little seasonal variation in pH, which often exceeded regional guidelines. Stream sediments were enriched with concentrations of Ni, Cr, Co and Zn up to 35, 21, 10 and 2 times the world average for shallow sediments, respectively. Concentrations for Ni and Cr were up to 60 and 16 times those of the relevant Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines Low Trigger Values, respectively. The distinctive nature of the water and sediment data suggests that it would be appropriate to establish more localized water quality and sediment guidelines for the creek system for the water quality parameters conductivity, Cu and Zn (and possibly Cr and Cd also), and for sediment concentrations of Cd, Cr and Ni.

Thermal groundwater contributions of arsenic and other trace elements to the middle Provo River, Utah, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Groundwater inputs can impact river water quality but are difficult to disentangle from agricultural, urban, and storm runoff. To better understand the multiple processes affecting water quality, we used major solute and trace element concentrations with continuous measurements of flow rates and specific conductance to track temporal and spatial changes in surface water and groundwater solute inputs into the middle Provo River, located in northern Utah, USA. Thermal groundwater was the most important source of major solutes and trace elements to the middle Provo River, with concentrations of As, B, Cs, Li, Sr, and Rb increasing dramatically (twofold to tenfold) downstream of thermal water inputs in the Snake Creek tributary. Snake Creek accounted for only 20% of the flow to the Provo River but increased the As concentrations similar to four-fold. Diffuse groundwater inputs, including thermal water, along the Provo River also contributed a measureable increase in solute concentrations. Mixing calculations indicate that groundwater contributed up to 10% of the total streamflow to the middle Provo River, causing an increase in thermal groundwater- derived trace element concentrations. In addition to natural groundwater inputs, water quality was impacted by anthropogenic trace and major element inputs from surface water tributaries. Nitrate, Ba, and V concentrations increased substantially downstream of agricultural/urban inputs. Specific conductance data showed that tributaries added solutes to the Provo River during runoff events, likely from the washoff of road salts. With evidence of both natural and anthropogenic inputs of trace and major elements to the middle Provo River, our study has implications for understanding water quality in complex coupled human-natural systems and demonstrates the influence of thermal groundwater inputs on water quality where such systems discharge.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							268	10.1007/s12665-017-6594-9								WOS:000399674700006

In order to prevent the expert judgments of the parameters weight that occurs when the Water Quality Index (WQI) method is used, the entropy method was used. Entropy and its weight were calculated, and parameters spatial autocorrelation was then determined. The spatial autocorrelation assessment confirmed the entropy theory results. The maximum spatial autocorrelation, minimum entropy and therefore the highest effectiveness rate on groundwater quality of Azarshahr Plain were found to be associated with bicarbonate. Using the entropy weighted WQI, the groundwater quality was classified into five categories: excellent, good, moderate, poor and extremely poor. According to the entropy weighted WQI, the groundwater quality of study area can be classified into "good'' to "poor'' domains.

SWAT simulates hydrological processes at sub-basin level by deriving HRUs by thresholding areas of soil type, land use, and slope combinations. This may ignore some important areas, which may have great impact on hydrological processes in the watershed. In this study, a hierarchical HRU approach was developed in order to increase model performance and reduce computational complexity simultaneously. For hierarchical optimization, HRUs are first divided into two-HRU types and are optimized with respect to some relevant influence parameters. Then, each HRU is further divided into two. Each child HRU inherits the optimum parameter values of the parent HRU as its initial value. This approach decreases the total calibration time while obtaining a better result. The performance of the hierarchical methodology is demonstrated on two basins, namely Sarisu-Eylikler and Namazgah Dam Lake Basins in Turkey. In Sarisu-Eylikler, we obtained good results by a combination of curve number (CN2), soil hydraulic conductivity, and slope for generating HRUs, while in Namazgah use of only CN2 gave better results.

J	Salameh, E; Tarawneh, A				Salameh, Elias; Tarawneh, Arwa			Assessing the impacts of uncontrolled artesian flows on the management of groundwater resources in the Jordan Valley	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The deep wells drilled along the eastern escarpment of the Jordan Valley penetrate confined aquifers that produce thermal and mineralized artesian water. Uncontrolled flows from poorly constructed and uncapped artesian wells over the last 30 years have caused the deterioration of the quality of shallow groundwater and surface water. They also have been accelerating the discharge of saline water from deep aquifers and have caused the loss of shallow fresh groundwater resources through the downward percolation of fresh water to replace the extracted deep salty groundwater. A lack of adequate controls on the construction and maintenance of artesian wells is leading to widespread water quality problems in the region, which limits the ability of future generations to access high-quality water, a clear breach of the principle of intergenerational equity.																	1866-6280	1866-6299				APR	2017	76	7							291	10.1007/s12665-017-6610-0								WOS:000399674700028

Anoxia stimulates microbially catalyzed metal release from Animas River sediments	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												The Gold King Mine spill in August 2015 released 11 million liters of metal-rich mine waste to the Animas River watershed, an area that has been previously exposed to historical mining activity spanning more than a century. Although adsorption onto fluvial sediments was responsible for rapid immobilization of a significant fraction of the spill-associated metals, patterns of longer-term mobility are poorly constrained. Metals associated with river sediments collected downstream of the Gold King Mine in August 2015 exhibited distinct presence and abundance patterns linked to location and mineralogy. Simulating riverbed burial and development of anoxic conditions, sediment microcosm experiments amended with Animas River dissolved organic carbon revealed the release of specific metal pools coupled to microbial Fe-and SO42--reduction. Results suggest that future sedimentation and burial of riverbed materials may drive longer-term changes in patterns of metal remobilization linked to anaerobic microbial metabolism, potentially driving decreases in downstream water quality. Such patterns emphasize the need for long-term water monitoring efforts in metal-impacted watersheds.

Continuous Organic Characterization for Biological and Membrane Filter Performance Monitoring	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION												Continuous organic characterization at a full-scale drinking water treatment plant was achieved using fluorescence spectroscopy. The feasibility of this method was demonstrated through monitoring the performance of biological activated carbon contactors (BACCs), which serve as pretreatment for fouling control of ultrafiltration (UF) membranes. Fluorescence monitoring was applied successfully to identify the preferential removal of select fluorescence components and addition of another microbial humic-like component by the biological filters. Spikes in BACC influent organic matter and fouling development on the downstream UF membranes highlighted the importance of preozonation. To demonstrate possible use of the short-term continuous fluorescence data, neural networks were used to predict fouling development on downstream UF on the basis of BACC effluent water quality. Short-term fluctuations in fouling development were well predicted by incorporation of continuous fluorescence characterization data. Continuous organic characterization shows promise for the application of fluorescence spectroscopy for real-time process optimization and control in drinking water treatment systems.																	2164-4535					APR	2017	109	4					E86	E98		10.5942/jawwa.2017.109.0031								WOS:000400052300003

Accordingly, we conducted surveys of nutrient concentrations in ditchwater and sediment in the hilly area of the central Sichuan Basin to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of nutrient concentrations and to promote the restoration of ditches for ecological functions. The results showed that the mean total nitrogen, particulate nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and total phosphorus values in ditchwater were 4.80, 1.09, 0.94, 1.09, and 0.18 mg/L, respectively. The mean concentrations of total nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and total phosphorus in ditch sediment were 1.58 g/kg, 2.62 mg/kg, 1.54 mg/kg, and 6.95 g/kg, respectively. Higher total nitrogen concentrations in ditchwater occurred in western areas, while higher total phosphorus concentrations occurred in central areas. Seasonally, we measured higher nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in ditchwater close to agricultural areas during the rainy season, while the opposite effect was true for residential areas. Although nutrient concentrations in ditchwater could be affected by both surrounding land uses and ditch water levels, land use was critical. Moreover, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were significantly higher in the ditchwater near residential areas when compared to paddy or sloping cropland ditches. However, we found no significant differences between the nutrient contents of sediments in ditches surrounded by different land uses. Our results indicate that water pollution control initiatives in residential areas would be the most critical factor in combating ditchwater and sediment pollution in this region. Therefore, efforts to restore the ecological functions of drainage ditches should take into account rural township sewage management, fertilizer reduction, and especially ditch vegetation restoration.

J	Garner, G; Hannah, DM; Watts, G				Garner, Grace; Hannah, David M.; Watts, Glenn			Climate change and water in the UK: Recent scientific evidence for past and future change	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												A changing climate is anticipated to alter hydroclimatological and hydroecological processes across the UK and around the world. This paper builds on a series of reports commissioned in 2012 (Water Climate Change Impacts Report Card [WCCRC], 2012) and published in a special issue of Progress in Physical Geography in 2015 that interpreted and synthesised the relevant, peer-reviewed scientific literature of climate change impacts on the UK's water environment. It aims to provide reliable, clear information about the potential impacts of climate change on hydrology and the water environment. We review new evidence since 2012 for historical and potential future changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration, river flows and groundwater levels, river and groundwater temperature/quality and, finally, aquatic ecosystems. Some new evidence exists for change in most of these hydrological components, typically in support of the spatial and temporal trends reported in WCCRC 2012. However, it remains the case that more research has been conducted on rainfall and river flows than evapotranspiration, groundwater levels, river and groundwater temperature, water quality or freshwater ecosystems. Consequently, there remains a clear disparity of robust evidence for historical and potential future change between the top and bottom of the hydroclimatological-hydroecological process chain. As was the case in WCCRC 2012, this remains a significant barrier to informed climate change adaptation in these components of the water environment.																	0309-1333	1477-0296				APR	2017	41	2					154	170		10.1177/0309133316679082								WOS:000400100500002

In this context, this study aimed to evaluate the emergence, growth and production of sesame, cultivar CNPA G3, irrigated with saline water and fertilized with N of different carrier proportions by the ratio of nitrate and ammonium (NO3--N and NH4(+)-N) in an experiment conducted in lysimeters arranged in a greenhouse in the municipality of Campina Grande-PB, Brazil. The treatments were distributed into randomized blocks using a 5 x 5 factorial scheme relative to levels of irrigation water salinity (ECw; 0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0 dS m(-1)) and five proportions of NO3--N/NH4+-N (200/0; 150/50; 100/100; 50/150 and 0/200 mg of N kg(-1)), with three replicates. The increase in ECw compromised the emergence, growth and production of sesame, cultivar CNPA G3, and the production components were the most sensitive variables. The highest growth in diameter was obtained with the proportion of 200/0 mg kg- 1 of NO3--N/NH4+-N. An ECw level of 3.0 dS m(-1) and fertilization with 0/200 mg kg(-1) of NO3--N/NH4+-N promoted deleterious effects on the total mass of sesame fruits and mass of seeds. The interaction between water salinity levels and NO3-/NH4+ proportions significantly affected the number of leaves (at 50 and 70 days after sowing), the total mass of fruits and the mass of seeds.																	0100-316X	1983-2125				APR-JUN	2017	30	2					458	467		10.1590/1983-21252017v30n221rc								WOS:000400161400021

Nitrate nitrogen is one of major pollutants in waste water. The standard ultraviolet spectrophotometry used to determinate the concentration of nitrate nitrogen in water is firstly to determinate the absorbances at wavelength 220 and 275 nm, which is used to calibrate the former, followed by the plotting of standard curve. While the linear equation described by Lambert-Beer's law and the linearity in the superposition of absorbances of various substance, on which the standard ultraviolet spectrophotometry based, are not fitted well anymore with the increase of concentration. In addition, it was found to be difficult to construct absorption model of nitrate solution at wavelength 220 nm in experiment. To overcome the disadvantages in single-wavelength or double-wavalengths spectrophotometry, the absorbances at the wavelength that covered by the absorption peak are introduced into the construction of the model and to avoid the increase of the model complexification resulted by the introduction of more wavelengths, we run the principal components analysis on the original absorbances data. The data with dimensions compressed from 107 down to 4 after process construct the absorbance model using locally weighted linear regression. Good performance were achieved in both training samples set and test samples set using this model and it was able to deal with the non-linear relation between the absorbance and concentration thus raised the upper range limit concentrations of nitrate nitrogen up to hundreds mg . L-1 from 4 mg . L-1 defined in the standard method. Meanwhile the principle and procedure of this analytical method are suitable for the absorbance model construction of other solutions.																	1000-0593					APR	2017	37	4					1179	1182		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2017)04-1179-04								WOS:000400041300035						
J	Li, YP; Wang, SR; Zhao, HC; Zhang, L; Zhang, R				Li Yan-Ping; Wang Sheng-Rui; Zhao Hai-Chao; Zhang Li; Zhang Rui			The Composition, Structure and Bioavailability of Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON) in the Water-Land Interface from Erhai Lake : A Case Study in Yongan Revier	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												The composition, structure and bioavailability characteristics of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in the water-land interface of Erhai Lake were studied by using fluorescence and UV-vis absorbance. Moreover, the effect on water quality was also discussed. Results showed that: (1) The DON concentration of the water-land interface from Erhai Lake via Yongan River was between 0. 25 and 1. 39 mg . L-1 and the DON concentration were relatively high by summer and autumn from the inflow river input into the Erhai Lake. The loading of DON into the Erhai Lake by Yongan River between 0. 48 and 2. 34 t, and it was relatively high in summer, suggesting that the potential risk for impact on the water quality of Erhai Lake was relatively large by the inflow river into the Erhai Lake, especially in the summer. (2) The DON mainly comprised humic-like substances in the water-land interface from the Yongan river flow into the Erhai Lake, showing the decrease by the microbial degradation with 15. 27%, however, aromatic proteins-like and dissolved metabolites of the microorganisms were accumulated by 42. 00% and 20. 68% respectively to some extent. In addition, the humification degree of DON was gradually decreased by 14. 97% via Yongan River into Erhai Lake. Moreover, the substitution groups in the aromatic rings of DON showed that the transformation of mainly contained aliphatic chains to carbonyl, carboxyl, hydroxyl and esters from inflow river into Erhai Lake, particularly in the summer; (3) The composition characteristic parameters of DON (P-(III+v,P-n /P-(I+II,P- n), A(253) /A(203)) was positively correlated with the contents of the different nitrogen (N) forms (R-2=0. 64 similar to 0. 74, P<0. 1, p<0. 05) in the water-land interface from Erhai Lake via Yongan river, that was, the structure affect their bioavailability; the different structural characteristic parameters of DON in the water -land interface from Erhai Lake had a significant positive correlation with water quality(R=0. 82 similar to 0. 96, p< 0. 05, p<0.01), indicating that the composition, structure and bioavailability of DON had contributed to the water pollution in the water -land interface from the Yongan river input into the Erhai lake, especially being greatly affected by the terrestrial pollution such as human activity in summer. Therefore, the change of composition and structure of DON ( such as Pca+v,, P(I+ II ) A(253) /A(203)) in the water -land interface from the Yongan river into lake could reflect the condition of the water quality of Erhai Lake to some extent.																	1000-0593					APR	2017	37	4					1189	1197		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2017)04-1189-09								WOS:000400041300037

The Mann-Kendall trend test is also applied to the same data, and the results are discussed. According to the Mann-Kendall test, a significantly decreasing trend is found for the Sefaatli and Salur Bridge stations while there is no trend in the Kuylus and Bulakbasi stations at a significant level of 95%. Different trends are found for the low, medium and high streamflows of each station in view of the Sen trend test. As a result, it can be said that the proposed new method of Sen can identify the trends of low, medium, and high streamflows.

Impact of Shrub Willow (Salix spp.) as a Potential Bioenergy Feedstock on Water Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The development of shrub willow as a bioenergy feedstock contributes to renewable energy portfolios in many countries with temperate climates and marginal croplands. As willow is developed commercially in the US Northeast, there is a need to better understand its impact on water quality and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to alternative land uses (e.g., corn, hay). We measured the impact of cultivated willow of various ages (2 and 5 years) and management strategies (fertilized vs. unfertilized) compared to corn and hay on water table depth, soil water NO3- and PO43- concentrations, and (NO)-O-2, CH4, and CO2 fluxes at the soil-atmosphere interface during a drier than normal year in heavy clay soils with marginal agricultural value in upstate New York, USA. Soil water concentrations resulted in higher PO43- in willow and higher NO3- in corn and hay, although willow is unlikely to negatively impact water quality with respect to phosphorus due to shorter periods of hydrologic connectivity in willow and hay than in corn. Gas fluxes varied spatially and temporally with hot moments of CH4 and N2O in corn and hay and seasonally variable CO2 in willow. While CH4 did not vary between fields, N2O was higher in corn and hay, and CO2 in willow, resulting in no net difference between CO2 equivalent (CH4, CO2, and N2O) emissions between fields. Converting marginal cropland on clay soils from corn or hay to willow left overall GHG emissions unaffected, slightly increased PO43-, and decreased NO3- concentrations in soil water.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	2017	228	4							170	10.1007/s11270-017-3350-4								WOS:000399872600049

A Mechanistic Model for Secchi Disk Depth, Driven by Light Scattering Constituents	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												An optics theory-based mechanistic model for Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) is advanced, tested, and applied for Cayuga Lake, NY. Robust data sets supported the initiative, including for (1) Z(SD), (2) multiple light attenuation metrics, most importantly the beam attenuation (c) and particulate scattering (b(p)) coefficients, and (3) measures of constituents responsible for contributions to b(p) by phytoplankton (b(o)) and minerogenic particles (b(m)). The model features two serially connected links. The first link supports predictions of b(p) from those for b(o) and b(m). The second link provides predictions of Z(SD) based on those for b(p), utilizing an earlier optical theory radiative transfer equation. Recent advancements in mechanistically strong estimates of b(m), empirical estimates of b(o), and more widely available bulk measurements of c and b(p) have enabled a transformation from a theory-based conceptual to this implementable Z(SD) model for lacustrine waters. The successfully tested model was applied to quantify the contributions of phytoplankton biomass, and minerogenic particle groups, such as terrigenous clay minerals and autochthonously produced calcite, to recent b(p) and Z(SD) levels and dynamics. Moreover, it has utility for integration as a submodel into larger water quality models to upgrade their predictive capabilities for Z(SD).

Water Use and Treatment in Container-Grown Specialty Crop Production: A Review	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												While governments and individuals strive to maintain the availability of high-quality water resources, many factors can "change the landscape" of water availability and quality, including drought, climate change, saltwater intrusion, aquifer depletion, population increases, and policy changes. Specialty crop producers, including nursery and greenhouse container operations, rely heavily on available high-quality water from surface and groundwater sources for crop production. Ideally, these growers should focus on increasing water application efficiency through proper construction and maintenance of irrigation systems, and timing of irrigation to minimize water and sediment runoff, which serve as the transport mechanism for agrichemical inputs and pathogens. Rainfall and irrigation runoff from specialty crop operations can contribute to impairment of groundwater and surface water resources both on-farm and into the surrounding environment. This review focuses on multiple facets of water use, reuse, and runoff in nursery and greenhouse production including current and future regulations, typical water contaminants in production runoff and available remediation technologies, and minimizing water loss and runoff (both on-site and off-site). Water filtration and treatment for the removal of sediment, pathogens, and agrichemicals are discussed, highlighting not only existing understanding but also knowledge gaps. Container-grown crop producers can either adopt research-based best management practices proactively to minimize the economic and environmental risk of limited access to high-quality water, be required to change by external factors such as regulations and fines, or adapt production practices over time as a result of changing climate conditions.

FIB levels were up to 1000 times higher in sand underneath the pier than that collected from adjacent to the pier, with the highest concentrations under the pier in spring and fall. Escherichia coli (EC) and enterococci (ENT) under the pier were significantly positively correlated with moisture (rho = 0.61, p < 0.001, n = 59; rho = 0.43, p < 0.001, n = 59, respectively), and ENT levels measured by qPCR (qENT) were much higher than those measured by membrane filtration (cENT). Microcosm experiments tested the ability of EC, qENT, cENT, and general Bacteroidales (GenBac) to persist under in situ moisture conditions (10 and 0.1%). Decay rates of qENT, cENT, and GenBac were not significantly different from zero at either moisture level, while decay rates for EC were relatively rapid during the microcosm at 10% moisture (k = 0.7 days(-1)). Gull/pelican marker was detected at 8 of 12 sites and no human-associated markers (TaqHF183 and HumM2) were detected at any site during a 1-day site survey. Results from this study indicate that the high levels of FIB observed likely stem from environmental sources combined with high persistence of FIB under the pier.																	0049-6979	1573-2932				APR	2017	228	4							124	10.1007/s11270-017-3291-y								WOS:000399872600003

Two plants which had higher removal efficiency (Canna generalis L. and Echinodorus cordifolius L.) were selected for further study in different light intensities and substrates. The effects of different light intensities were significantly different (P < 0.05), and Canna generalis L. and Echinodorus cordifolius L. had efficiencies of removal of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate of 44.9-91.2, 90.8-99.3 and 55.7-98.5 %, respectively. In experiments using different densities of plants, Echinodorus cordifolius L. had a higher efficiency of removal of nitrogenous waste than Canna generalis L. for a given biomass under shaded conditions (92.5-185 A mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1) PAR) compared with high light conditions (185-740 A mu mol photon m(-2) s(-1) PAR). A red hybrid tilapia fish pond-planted pond dual-tank experimental setup modeled an aquacultural recirculating system. Planting densities of 3-12 plants m(-2) all improved water quality (P > 0.05), but higher planting densities were counterproductive in terms of both water quality and fish survival. Flow rates of > 100 % day(-1) were needed for efficient nitrogenous waste removal. Red hybrid tilapia in the optimal setup (50 fish m(-2), 12 plants m(-2), 100 % water turnover per day) had weight gains of 629 %, a survival rate of 82.7 %, a feed conversion ratio of 0.72, and a specific growth rate of 4.7 % day(-1) over a 6-week experimental period.																	0967-6120	1573-143X				APR	2017	25	2					619	633		10.1007/s10499-016-0060-7								WOS:000398926100009

High rates of larval mortalities associated with bacterial diseases in hatcheries are one of the major obstacles to the growth of Scylla aquaculture. Currently, antibiotics are used extensively in Scylla larval culture to improve survival rate, but its use poses numerous risks. The aim of this study was to determine the culture performance of Scylla paramamosain larvae with the use of a probiotic, namely a multispecies Bacillus, at various concentrations. In this study, the effects of Bacillus spp. were tested in three trials. There were higher average larval survivals in treatments with a multispecies Bacillus probiotics added compared with the control, especially at concentrations of 1.00 x 10(4) (12.33-18.33 +/- 1.76-3.76 % compared to 1.67-3.67 +/- 1.67-1.76 %; P < 0.05) and 2.00 x 10(4) cfu/ml. This was significantly lower than the control (1.33 +/- 1.33 cfu/ml compared to 32.67 +/- 11.05 cfu/ml) during the later days post-hatching. Green colonies Vibrios are known to be pathogenic to Scylla larvae, and thus lower numbers are desirable in culture. The recommended concentration of the multispecies Bacillus to be added into S. paramamosain larvae was therefore 1.00 x 10(4) and 2.00 x 10(4) cfu/ml (0.50 and 1.00 g/50 l, respectively). The use of Bacillus as a probiotic is an ideal alternative to antibiotics in Scylla hatcheries to provide a consistent, commercially feasible production of seedlings.

Watershed-scale simulation models can provide useful and convenient tools for this evaluation, but simulated conservation practice effectiveness should be responsive to parameter values used to represent the practices in the modeling. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the impacts of a set of conservation practices on hydrology and water quality of a watershed and (2) evaluate the sensitivity of Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling outputs and simulated conservation practice effectiveness to parameters. The modeling study was conducted in an agricultural watershed, the subwatershed K (16.9 km(2)) of the Little River Experimental watershed located in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA. Sensitivity analysis showed that hydrologic response unit (HRU) and watershed-scale simulations for water quality were most sensitive to CN and FILTERW parameters. Load reduction rates as a function of increased aerial coverage of the conservation practices were greatest for total phosphorus (TP), followed by sediment and total nitrogen (TN). The results indicated that conservation practices would have a limited impact on stream flow volume but could have a significant impact on sediment and TP loads within this region. Watershed-scale TN and TP loads were also sensitive to an in-stream nutrient transformation process represented using the QUAL2E algorithm in SWAT. The study clearly demonstrated the most sensitive model parameters and the optimal conservation practices for this watershed.

The bacterial community dynamics of two drinking water supply systems (traditional and advanced treatment processes) in this plant were studied from the source to the product water. Analysis by 454 pyrosequencing was conducted to characterize the bacterial diversity in each step of the treatment processes. The bacterial communities in these two treatment processes were highly diverse. Proteobacteria, which mainly consisted of beta-proteobacteria, was the dominant phylum. The two treatment processes used in the plant could effectively remove organic pollutants and microbial polution, especially the advanced treatment process. Significant differences in the detection of the major groups were observed in the product water samples in the treatment processes. The treatment processes, particularly the biological pretreatment and O-3-biological activated carbon in the advanced treatment process, highly influenced the microbial community composition and the water quality. Some opportunistic pathogens were found in the water. Nitrogen-relative microorganisms found in the biofilm of filters may perform an important function on the microbial community composition and water quality improvement.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	10					8924	8932		10.1007/s11356-015-5116-0								WOS:000399239800005	26250817

However, more than one billion people worldwide currently lack access to safe drinking water, and a diversity of waterborne outbreaks caused by pathogens is reported in nations at all levels of economic development. Spatio-temporal distribution of conventional pollutants and five pathogenic microorganisms were discussed for the Haihe River Basin. Land use and socio-economic assessments were coupled with comprehensive water quality monitoring. Physical, chemical, and biological parameters were measured at 20 different sites in the watershed for 1 year, including pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, ammonia-N, total and fecal coliforms, E. coli, and Enterococcus. The results highlighted the high spatio-temporal variability in pathogen distribution at watershed scale: high concentration of somatic coliphages and fecal indicator bacteria in March and December and their very low concentration in June and September. All pathogens were positively correlated to urban/rural residential/industrial land and negatively correlated to other four land use types. Microbial pollution was greatly correlated with population density, urbanization rate, and percentage of the tertiary industry in the gross domestic product. In the future, river microbial risk control strategy should focus more on the effective management of secondary effluent of wastewater treatment plant and land around rivers.

Influence of livestock activities on residue antibiotic levels of rivers in Hong Kong	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Occurrence of 10 antibiotics in the Yuen Long (YLR), Kam Tin (KTR), and Shing Mun (SMR) rivers of Hong Kong and possible influence of livestock activities on the concentrations of antibiotics were investigated. Tetracycline (30-497 ng/L), sulfadiazine (2-80 ng/L), sulfamethoxazole (2-152 ng/L), ofloxacin (5-227 ng/L), and erythromycin (1-315 ng/L) were detected in all the three rivers; chlortetracycline (23-227 ng/L), oxytetracycline (7-104 ng/L), ciprofloxacin (12-68 ng/L), and roxithromycin (1-105 ng/L) were detected in YLR and KTR, whereas norfloxacin (3-34 ng/L) was detected in KTR only. Significant correlation between livestock population and antibiotic contamination was observed in YLR only, indicating the influences of other sources in KTR and SMR. Among the antibiotics, significant correlation was observed between tetracyclines and sulfonamides indicating the major influence of livestock farms, whereas tetracyclines/sulfonamides were negatively correlated with fluoroquinolones/macrolides implying the differential origin of the latter class of antibiotics. Water quality of KTR and YLR were highly influenced by the non-point source pollutions, while of SMR was relatively good. Particularly, Escherichia coli populations of the YLR and KTR were 3-4 logs higher than those of the SMR indicating the involvement of livestock farms and sewerages. Good correlation between tetracyclines (TCs)/sulfonamides (SAs) and number of livestock farms and a negative correlation between TCs/SAs and fluoroquinolones (FQs)/macrolides (MLs) could be used as an indicator to trace the possible source of pollution.

Toxicological endpoints such as survival rates of P. major embryos or larvae and the rates of hatching and of malformation (oedema, condensed blood, spinal curvatures or eye abnormalities) were noted and described within 48 h of exposure. The LC50, EC50, no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) and lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC) were calculated, based on the dose-response relationship. The results showed that exposures to all of the selected organic pollutants except for methyl parathion produced acute toxic effects on P. major embryos and larvae, at different levels of exposure. The levels of acute toxicity of the eight typical organic pollutants for P. major embryos and larvae showed the following trend: benzo(a) pyrene > malathion > PCB 126 > pyrene > nonylphenol > phenanthrene > monocrotophos > methyl parathion. However, the larvae were more sensitive to these pollutants than embryos, according to the calculated LC50, EC50, NOEC and LOEC. This increased sensitivity of larvae could have resulted from losing the natural barrier function of the egg shell membrane. Benzo(a) pyrene, malathion, nonylphenol and monocrotophos delayed the development of P. major for both embryos and larvae, and decreased the hatching rate of the embryos. These results implied that the development of fish embryos and larvae could serve as potential biomarkers for evaluating organic contamination in the aquatic environment. The marine economic fish P. major was more sensitive to PAHs than the model fish, marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma). The estimated safe concentrations (SCs) for marine economic fish, as determined in our research, could provide a reference for the formulation of water quality criteria.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	10					9067	9078		10.1007/s11356-016-6282-4								WOS:000399239800018	27130341

Microchem J 85(1):65-71, 2007). The paper deals with quality evaluation of waters with special focus on the water chemistry parameters as defined in the Water Framework Directive and pertaining legal regulations. The purpose of this paper is to devise a quantitative type of water quality assessment method which could provide rapid, accurate, and reliable information on the quality of the surface waters by using water chemistry parameters. Quality classes have been defined for every water chemistry parameter in light of the legal limit values of the water parameters. In addition to this, weight indices were calculated on the basis of the outcome of the paired comparison of water chemistry parameters and normalized matrix. This was followed by the parametric level analysis of the water chemistry parameters, and finally, the aquatic environment index (AEI) was calculated, which provided general information on the quality of water regarding the water chemistry parameters. The method was illustrated on Lake Balaton, Hungary in which case water samples taken from Balatonfured City lake area were analyzed and evaluated with the method devised.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	12					11126	11140		10.1007/s11356-016-7941-1								WOS:000399399700024	27796974					
J	Dollinger, J; Dages, C; Voltz, M				Dollinger, Jeanne; Dages, Cecile; Voltz, Marc			Using fluorescent dyes as proxies to study herbicide removal by sorption in buffer zones	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The performance of buffer zones for removing pesticides from runoff water varies greatly according to landscape settings, hydraulic regime, and system design. Evaluating the performance of buffers for a range of pesticides and environmental conditions can be very expensive. Recent studies suggested that the fluorescent dyes uranine and sulforhodamine B could be used as cost-effective surrogates of herbicides to evaluate buffer performance. However, while transformation mechanisms in buffers have been extensively documented, sorption processes of both dyes have rarely been investigated. In this study, we measured the adsorption, desorption, and kinetic sorption coefficients of uranine and sulforhodamine B for a diverse range of buffer zone materials (soils, litters, plants) and compared the adsorption coefficients (Kd) to those of selected herbicides. We also compared the global sorption capacity of 6 ditches, characterized by varying proportions of the aforementioned materials, between both dyes and a set of four herbicides using the sorption-induced pesticide retention indicator (SPRI). We found that both the individual Kd of uranine for the diverse buffer materials and the global sorption capacity of the ditches are equivalent to those of the herbicides diuron, isoproturon, and metolachlor. The Kd of sulforhodamine B on plants and soils are equivalent to those of glyphosate, and the global sorption capacities of the ditches are equivalent for both molecules. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time that uranine can be used as a proxy of moderately hydrophobic herbicides to evaluate the performance of buffer systems, whereas sulforhodamine B can serve as a proxy for more strongly sorbing herbicides.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	12					11752	11763		10.1007/s11356-017-8703-4								WOS:000399399700078	28337625

Jmaiff; Wang, Wei; Vemula, Sai; Jaeger, Benjamin T.; Li, Xing-Fang			Sweetened Swimming Pools and Hot Tubs	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												Nitrogenous organics in urine can react with chlorine in swimming pools to form volatile and irritating N-Cl-amines. A urinary marker is desirable for the control of pool water quality. The widespread consumption of acesulfame-K (ACE), a stable synthetic sweetener, and its complete excretion in urine, makes it an ideal urinary marker. Here we report the occurrence of ACE and its potential application in swimming pools and hot tubs. First, we developed a new method for achieving high-throughput analysis of ACE without preconcentration or large-volume injection. Analysis of more than 250 samples from 31 pools and tubs from two Canadian cities showed ACE in all samples. Concentrations ranged from 30 to 7110 ng/L, up to 570-fold greater than in the input tap water. The level of dissolved organic carbon was significantly greater in all pools and tubs than in the input water. Finally, we determined the levels of ACE over 3 weeks in two pools (110000 and 220000 U.S. gallons) and used the average ACE level to estimate the urine contribution as 30 and 75 L. This study clearly shows the human impact in pools and tubs. This work is useful for future studies of the human contribution to DBP formation, epidemiological assessment of exposure, and adverse health effects in recreational facilities.

Nutrient enrichment of water bodies has intensified eutrophication which degrades water quality and ecosystem health. In this study, we carried out a trend analysis of total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads in the South Saskatchewan River (SSR) catchment using a novel approach to analyse nutrient time series. Seasonal analysis of trends at each of the water quality stations was performed to determine the relationships between annual flow regimes and nutrient loads in the catchment, in particular, the influence of the high spring runoff on nutrient export. Decadal analysis was also performed to determine the long-term relationships of nutrients with anthropogenic changes in the catchment. Although it was found that seasonal and historical variability of nutrient load trends is mainly determined by streamflow regime changes, there is evidence that increases in nitrogen concentration can also be attributed to anthropogenic changes.

Effect of seasonal flushing on nutrient export characteristics of an urbanizing, remote, ungauged coastal catchment	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												Urbanization is a primary driver of nutrient export in coastal catchments; however, estimating the rate of export from urbanizing, remote and ungauged communities with episodic rainfall characteristics has rarely been reported in tropical and subtropical areas. In this study, the coastal catchment of Roebuck Bay near Broome, northwestern Australia, was instrumented to elucidate the effect of seasonal flushing on nutrient export. A cost-effective framework involving temporary gauging and community participation led to a quantitative estimate of surface hydrology and nutrient dynamics from this urbanizing, remote and ungauged catchment. The contribution of nutrient export was larger from the older Broome town site sub-catchments compared to sub-catchments that have been progressively urbanized since 2000. A distinctive seasonal first flush phenomenon, with an initial 30% of runoff volume containing 40-70% of the nutrient load was a key feature. This indicates there are opportunities for storm-water management to minimize impacts through adopting water-sensitive urban design principles.

In addition, it may promote the development of movable/portable containerized MBRs for a diverse range of wastewater treatment applications. Applications may include the provision of municipal/industrial wastewater treatment in remote areas without sewerage, and the provision of sanitation services under challenging site-specific conditions such as after the occurrence of a human-made or a natural disaster. The reduction of the footprint requirements of MBRs is constrained by the maximum amount of biomass that can be accommodated in the aerobic basin. The biomass concentration is mainly limited by the extremely low oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) experienced by conventional aeration bubble diffuser systems at mixed liquor total suspended solids (MLSS) concentrations higher than 20 g L-1. Another potential limitation for the operation of MBRs at such high MISS concentrations is the reduction on the membrane permeability due to excessive fouling. A pilot MBR with a treatment capacity of one m(3) d(-1) was installed at the research hall facilities at the Harnaschpolder wastewater treatment plant in Delft, The Netherlands. The MBR was operated at MISS concentrations of up to 28 g L-1 at sludge retention times (SRT)s ranging from 30 to 35 days. The MBR was provided with a Speece cone concentrated oxygen delivery system to overcome the oxygen transfer limitations of conventional bubble diffuser aeration systems at high MLSS concentrations. The MBR performance was evaluated by monitoring the influent and effluent water quality, the membrane permeability, the sludge filterability, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and the oxygen uptake rate (OUR). The Speece cone proved to be effective in delivering enough oxygen to maintain DO concentrations in the MBR of approximately 2 mg L-1 at MISS concentrations of up to 22 g L-1. OUR values above 200 mg L-1 h(-1) were observed at 14 g L-1 MISS and higher than 300 mg L-1 h(-1) at 22 g L-1 MISS. The MBR exhibited chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies of up to 99% even at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) as low as 3.7 h. A reduction in permeability from 33 to 11 lmh bar(-1) was observed when the MISS concentrations increased from 18.7 to 27.8 g L-1. Sludge filterability values expressed as the added resistance (Delta R-20) fell in the range of "poor filterability" for all the evaluated operational conditions; however, a lower filtration resistance in the range of "moderate filterability" at approximately 23 g L-1 MLSS was noticed. The experimental results suggest that at the evaluated experimental conditions the existent limitations on poor oxygen transfer and low permeability when operating a MBR at high MLSS concentrations can be overcome; therefore, the footprint requirements of MBR systems may be further reduced.

Soil aquifer treatment for wastewater treatment and reuse	INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION												Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is a managed aquifer recharge system in which the quality of the feed water (stormwater or wastewater treatment plant effluent) is further improved during soil passage. This paper provides an overview of SAT systems for wastewater treatment and reuse, and summarises design, removal efficiencies and pre- and post-treatment options as well as cost aspects of SAT using infiltration basins. SAT is an environment-friendly and robust multi-contaminant removal system which is effective in removing pathogens, nitrogen, bulk organic matter and the majority of organic micropollutants. The contaminant removal efficiency of SAT system, however, depends on several factors including source water quality, local hydrogeological conditions and process conditions applied. The performance of SAT system can be further improved by proper site selection and appropriate design of its components including pre- and post-treatment. SAT serves as an environmental and psychological barrier for water reuse applications. It is equally attractive for developed as well as developing countries and flexible enough to allow adaptation to local requirements by combining it with conventional (above the ground) natural or engineered water and wastewater treatment technologies.

Stream-aquifer and in-stream processes affecting nitrogen along a major river and contributing tributary	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												This study assesses the spatio-temporal patterns of water and nutrient mass exchange in a stream-riparian system of a major river and a contributing tributary in an irrigated semi-arid region. Field monitoring is performed along reaches of the Arkansas River (4.7 km) and Timpas Creek (2.0 km) in southeastern Colorado during the 2014 growing season, with water quantity and water quality data collected using a network of in-stream sampling sites and groundwater monitoring wells. Mass balance approaches were used to identify temporal and spatial trends in flow, nitrogen (N), and salinity in stream-aquifer exchange. In the Arkansas River, percent decrease of N concentration along the study reach averaged 36% over the period, with results from a stochastic mass balance simulation indicating a 90% probability that 44% to 50% of NO3-N mass in the study reach (109-124 kg/day/km) was removed by in-stream processes between 1 September and 8 November. Results suggest that contact with organic-rich river bed sediments has a strong impact on N removal. A greater decrease in concentrations of NO3-N along the reach during the low flow period suggests the effect of both in-stream processes and dilution by inflowing groundwater that undergoes denitrification as it flows through the riparian and hyporheic zones into the river. In contrast, N concentration decreases in the smaller Timpas Creek were negligible. Results for the Arkansas River also are in contrast with other large agriculturally-influenced rivers, which have not exhibited capacity to remove N at significant rates. Results provide important insights across spatial and temporal scales and point to the need for investigating nutrient dynamics in large streams draining agriculturally-dominated watersheds.

Between nine and 15 of the 23 selected sites along the river were sampled fortnightly over three rounds. In all, 307 E. coli were typed using the PhP typing method and were grouped into common (C) or single (S) biochemical phenotypes (BPTs). A representative from each of the 31 identified C-BPTs was tested for 58 virulence genes (VGs) associated with intestinal and extra-intestinal E. coli, resistance to 22 antibiotics, production of biofilm and cytotoxicity to Vero cells. The number of E. coli in the first sampling round was significantly (P< 0.01) higher than subsequent rounds, whereas the number of VGs was significantly (P< 0.05) higher in isolates from the last sampling round when compared to previous rounds. Comparison of the C-BPTs with an existing database from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the same catchment showed that 40.6% of the river isolates were identical to the WWTP isolates.

Rapid molecular identification of fecal origin-colonies growing on Enterococcus spp.-specific culture methods	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The mEI, Chromocult (R) enterococci, and m-Enterococcus culture-based methods used to assess water quality by the detection of Enterococcus spp. were first compared in terms of sensitivity using (1) 41 different type strains of Enterococcus spp. and (2) environmental colonies identified by 16S rRNA sequencing. Then, two specific-rtPCR assays targeting Enterococcus spp. and Enterococcus faecalis/faecium were tested for their ability to confirm the identity of putative enterococcal colonies. The mEI, Chromocult (R) enterococci, and m-Enterococcus methods detected beta-glucosidase activity for 28 (68.3%), 32 (78.0%), and 12 (29.3%) of the 41 reference enterococcal strains tested, respectively. Analysis with environmental colonies showed that mEI and Chromocult (R) enterococci media had false positive rates of 4.3% and 5.0%, respectively. Finally, the two rtPCR assays showed a specificity of 100%. Only two (2/19) colonies of E. faecium isolated from mEI agar were not detected by the Enterococcus faecium rtPCR assay, for a sensitivity of 89.5%. Our results showed that Chromocult (R) enterococci medium recovered more E. faecalis/faecium cells than the two other methods. Thus, the use of Chromocult (R) enterococci combined with the Enterococcus faecalis/faecium rtPCR assay showed the best combination to decrease the high false-positive rate obtained when the entire Enterococcus genus is targeted.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					239	250		10.2166/wh.2016.199								WOS:000399317700007	28362305

In order to study the hydrochemical characteristics and trace element contents of the natural waters of this region, 62 water samples were collected from Lan'gao area in the NDM. The hydrochemical composition was principally characterized by Ca center dot Mg-HCO3 center dot SO4. F and As concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 0.67 mg/L and from 0.33 to 6.29 mu g/L, respectively, lower than Chinese national standard and international guidelines for drinking water quality. One year of monitoring proved that F and As in natural water were not the sources of the local fluorosis and arseniasis in the NDM. The average Se concentration in fissure water was 5.20 mu g/L. The average Se content of river water was 2.82 mu g/L, 14 times that of the world's surface level (0.2 mu g/L). The Se content in eight samples reached the Chinese national standards for mineral drinking water quality (> 10 mu g/L). Contrasting the water samples of May, July, and September in 2015 shows that the Se content is relatively stable and the increase of humidity might be beneficial to increase the content of selenium and strontium in water.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					273	287		10.2166/wh.2016.132								WOS:000399317700010	28362308

Updating national standards for drinking-water: a Philippine experience	JOURNAL OF WATER AND HEALTH												The latest version of the Philippine National Standards for Drinking-Water (PNSDW) was issued in 2007 by the Department of Health (DOH). Due to several issues and concerns, the DOH decided to make an update which is relevant and necessary to meet the needs of the stakeholders. As an output, the water quality parameters are now categorized into mandatory, primary, and secondary. The ten mandatory parameters are core parameters which all water service providers nationwide are obligated to test. These include thermotolerant coliforms or Escherichia coli, arsenic, cadmium, lead, nitrate, color, turbidity, pH, total dissolved solids, and disinfectant residual. The 55 primary parameters are site-specific and can be adopted as enforceable parameters when developing new water sources or when the existing source is at high risk of contamination. The 11 secondary parameters include operational parameters and those that affect the esthetic quality of drinking-water. In addition, the updated PNSDW include new sections: (1) reporting and interpretation of results and corrective actions; (2) emergency drinking-water parameters; (3) proposed Sustainable Development Goal parameters; and (4) standards for other drinking-water sources. The lessons learned and insights gained from the updating of standards are likewise incorporated in this paper.																	1477-8920					APR	2017	15	2					288	295		10.2166/wh.2016.177								WOS:000399317700011	28362309

Cross-Comparison of Human Wastewater-Associated Molecular Markers in Relation to Fecal Indicator Bacteria and Enteric Viruses in Recreational Beach Waters	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Detection of human wastewater contamination in recreational waters is of critical importance to regulators due to the risks posed to public health. To identify such risks, human wastewater-associated microbial source tracking (MST) markers have been developed. At present, however, a greater understanding of the suitability of these markers for the detection of diluted human wastewater in environmental waters is necessary to predict risk. Here, we compared the process limit of detection (PLOD) and process limit of quantification (PLOQ) of six human wastewater-associated MST markers (Bacteroides HF183 [HF183], Escherichia coli H8 [EC H8], Methanobrevibacter smithii nifH, human adenovirus [HAdV], human polyomavirus [HPyV], and pepper mild mottle virus [PMMoV]) in relation to a fecal indicator bacterium (FIB), Enterococcus sp. 23S rRNA (ENT 23S), and three enteric viruses (human adenovirus serotypes 40/41 [HAdV 40/41], human norovirus [HNoV], and human enterovirus [EV]) in beach water samples seeded with raw and secondary-treated wastewater. Among the six MST markers tested, HF183 was the most sensitive measure of human fecal pollution and was quantifiable up to dilutions of 10(-6) and 10(-4) for beach water samples seeded with raw and secondary-treated wastewater, respectively. Other markers and enteric viruses were detected at various dilutions (10(-1) to 10(-5)). These MST markers, FIB, and enteric viruses were then quantified in beach water (n = 12) and sand samples (n = 12) from South East Queensland (SEQ), Australia, to estimate the levels of human fecal pollution. Of the 12 sites examined, beach water and sand samples from several sites had quantifiable concentrations of HF183 and PMMoV markers. Overall, our results indicate that while HF183 is the most sensitive measure of human fecal pollution, it should be used in conjunction with a conferring viral marker to avoid overestimating the risk of gastrointestinal illness. IMPORTANCE MST is an effective tool to help utilities and regulators improve recreational water quality around the globe. Human fecal pollution poses significant public health risks compared to animal fecal pollution. Several human wastewater-associated markers have been developed and used for MST field studies. However, a head-to-head comparison in terms of their performance to detect diluted human fecal pollution in recreational water is lacking. In this study, we cross-compared the performance of six human wastewater-associated markers in relation to FIB and enteric viruses in beach water samples seeded with raw and secondary-treated wastewater. The results of this study will provide guidance to regulators and utilities on the appropriate application of MST markers for tracking the sources of human fecal pollution in environmental waters and confer human health risks.

In this study, the antimicrobial activity, skin irritation, elution behavior, and mechanical properties of nanostructured ZnO films on stainless steel were evaluated. ZnO nanoparticle (NP) and ZnO nanowall (NW) structures were prepared with different surface roughnesses, wettability, and concentrations using an RF magnetron sputtering system. The thicknesses of ZnO NP and ZnO NW were approximately 300 and 620 nm, respectively, and ZnO NW had two diffraction directions of [0002] and [01-10] based on high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The ZnO NW structure demonstrated 99.9% antimicrobial inhibition against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Penicillium funiculosum, and no skin irritation was detected using experimental rabbits. Approximately 27.2 +/- 3.0 mu g L-1 Zn ions were eluted from the ZnO NW film at 100 A degrees C for 24 h, which satisfies the WHO guidelines for drinking water quality. Furthermore, the Vickers hardness and fracture toughness of ZnO NW films on stainless steel were enhanced by 11 and 14% compared to those of the parent stainless steel. Based on these results, ZnO NW films on STS316L sheets are useful for household supplies, such as water pipes, faucets, and stainless steel containers.																	0175-7598	1432-0614				APR	2017	101	7					2801	2809		10.1007/s00253-017-8099-6								WOS:000398705100012	28064368

Evaluation of groundwater quality in an untreated wastewater irrigated region and mapping-a case study of Avaniyapuram sewage farm, Madurai	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The present study focused on evaluation of groundwater quality in Avaniyapuram Sewage Farm, Madurai. Totally, 45 groundwater samples were collected with different zones during pre-monsoon (PRM) and post-monsoon (POM) seasons, respectively. All the samples were analyzed as well as the various physical and chemical parameters like pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolved solids, total hardness, total alkalinity, and major cations such as, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, major anions such as NO3(-), SO42-, F-, and Cl-, and were compared with the standard guideline limits by WHO, ICMR, and BIS. Results indicated that the pH, EC, TDS, hardness as CaCO3, alkalinity as CaCO3, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and Cl-, level in groundwater samples were above critical limits and it was found to be very high in the first 1-3-km range with epicenter of ASF. Box plot illustrates that seasonal effect slightly changes the order of abundance of both cation and anion. Hydrogeochemistry is studied to determine the ionic interaction for evaluating the hydrochemical processes. The correlation coefficient results illustrate that Cl- is strongly correlated with major cations and anions cause salinity. The geochemical data was interpreted using WQI in relation to drinking water quality proved that all the water samples were found to be poor and 60% of the samples are not suitable for drinking purposes and SAR, % Na, and MH shows that 50-60% of the groundwater samples were found suitable for irrigation. The results concluded that groundwater quality is 60% suitable for irrigation and poor for drinking; this may due to longterm use of wastewater irrigation.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	7							159	10.1007/s12517-017-2900-9								WOS:000399161100003

Assessment of spatial relationship between groundwater pollution vulnerability and quality indices in Kano, Nigeria	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Safeguarding groundwater from pollution is largely a global political decision. These decisions are basically supported by DRASTIC (D=Depth to water, R=Recharge, A=Aquifer media, S=Soil media, T=Topography, I=Impact of vadose zone, C=Hydraulic conductivity) analysis. Furthermore, water quality index (WQI) is an effective tool for groundwater quality evaluation and management. This study identifies the relationship between these two indices [i.e., pollution vulnerability index (PVI) andWQI]. The DRASTIC index of the study area was found to be from 60.4 to 178 characterized by very low, low, medium high, and very high vulnerability constituting of 12.88, 24.38, 34.11, 21.99, and 6.63% of the study area, respectively. In addition, the WQI of the area according to the analyzed parameters is between 10.19 and 55.63. It was established that a good correlation (61%) was found to exist between the two indices; which may be an indication that most pollutants present in the groundwater are likely due to anthropogenic activities on the land surface.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	7							168	10.1007/s12517-017-2897-0								WOS:000399161100012

Precipitation controlled spatial variations in groundwater quality indices-suitability for drinking and irrigation purposes in the basalts of South India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Regional study on the impact of variations in input rainfall over groundwater quality and its suitability for utilitarian purposes is essential for its extraction and management. Water chemistry from 456 observations wells for 2007-2011 period in hard rock Basaltic terrain of Upper Godavari basin is supported with 8 field samples (in 2014) in this analysis. Based on mean annual rainfall (MAR), four narrow climatic zones are identified in the basin, defined as "humid" (MAR > 1600 mm), "sub-humid" (1600-1000 mm), "semi-arid" (1000-600 mm), and "arid" (MAR < 600 mm). NICB ratio (<+/- 10%), and anionic percentages demarcated the polluted areas from rest "good data", composing of 1818 samples. Hydrochemical facies are studied using Piper diagram, secondary alkalinity exceeded 50% and not one cation-anion pair exceeded 50%, and silicate-carbonate plot, arid zone nearer to silicate pole indicated the dominance of SiO2 in Ca/Na vs Mg/Na plot. These geochemical variations emphasize a detailed study on role of climatic gradient on groundwater suitability for different purposes, for groundwater extraction, and its management. Suitability of groundwater for drinking based on water quality indices (WQI) indicated 98% of the samples as suitable (WQI < 50%). TDS in humid zone is 150-500 and 500-1000 mg/L in rest of the zones with similar to 68% in permissible range, 15% as hard water (TDS > 600 mg/L) and not acceptable for drinking. Suitability of groundwater for irrigation is studied using sodium percentage (Na %), Wilcox diagram, sodium absorption ratio (SAR), US salinity diagram, residual sodium carbonate (RSC), permeability index (PI), Kelly's ratio (KR), ancd magnesium absorption ratio (MgAR). Na % in four zones is < 60% and permissible for irrigation. Very few water samples fall in "doubtful to unsuitable" and "unsuitable" category of Wilcox diagram. Region is observed to have SAR < 6, indicating that water would not cause any problem to the soil and crop. Humid and sub-humid zones belonged to C1S1 and C2S1 categories (low and medium sodium), while semi-arid extended to C3S1 category (salinity hazard zone) in US salinity plot. RSC for all the three zones ranged from 1 to 1.5 meq/L, with 90-95% of the area safe for irrigation. Out of 1818 samples, 1129 belonged to class 2 of PI classification (PI ranging from 25 to 75%) while rest 689 samples had PI > 75% (class 1). KR varied from 0.05 to 12.81, with 70-80% of the area having KR < 1. MgAR ratio ranged from 67% to 96%, with sub-humid, humid zones having higher Mg concentrations (increased salinity). Thus, 90% of the samples indicated non-alkaline water with 1% of normal alkalinity. Hence, the current study systematically analyzed the effect of precipitation and geology on groundwater quality and on its usability for various purposes. This stepwise procedure categorized the regions, and the same can be adopted for any regional hydrogeochemical studies.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	7							171	10.1007/s12517-017-2887-2								WOS:000399161100015

It serves to discharge treated waste-water of different types. In this work, the variations of the water quality of Wadi El Bey were studied and evaluated, during 2 years (2012-2013), using multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). In addition, the similarities or dissimilarities among the sampling points were as well analyzed to identify spatial and temporal variations. The results obtained based on the cluster analysis, led to identify three similar water quality zones: relatively polluted (LP), moderately polluted (MP), and highly polluted (HP). The inorganic and organic parameters, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand, salmonella, and enterococcus, seemed to be the most significant parameters of water quality. Three factors were identified as responsible for the data structure, explaining 60.95% of the total variance. The first factor is the physical and non-organic chemical parameters explaining 23.48% of the total variance. The second and third factors are, respectively, the microbiological (21.26%) and organic-nutrient (16.2%). This study shows that multivariate statistical methods can help the water managers to understand the factors affecting the water quality.																	1866-7511	1866-7538				APR	2017	10	7							181	10.1007/s12517-017-2898-z								WOS:000399161100025

Toxicity of Chromium (VI) to Two Mussels and an Amphipod in Water-Only Exposures With or Without a Co-stressor of Elevated Temperature, Zinc, or Nitrate	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The objectives of the present study were to develop methods for propagating western pearlshell (Margaritifera falcata) for laboratory toxicity testing and evaluate acute and chronic toxicity of chromium VI [Cr(VI)] to the pearlshell and a commonly tested mussel (fatmucket, Lampsilis siliquoidea at 20 A degrees C or in association with a co-stressor of elevated temperature (27 A degrees C), zinc (50 A mu g Zn/L), or nitrate (35 mg NO3/L). A commonly tested invertebrate (amphipod, Hyalella azteca) also was tested in chronic exposures. Newly transformed pearlshell (similar to 1 week old) were successfully cultured and tested in acute 96 h Cr exposures (control survival 100%). However, the grow-out of juveniles in culture for chronic toxicity testing was less successful and chronic 28-day Cr toxicity tests started with 4 month-old pearlshell failed due to low control survival (39-68%). Acute median effect concentration (EC50) for the pearlshell (919 A mu g Cr/L) and fatmucket (456 A mu g Cr/L) tested at 20 A degrees C without a co-stressor decreased by a factor of > 2 at elevated temperature but did not decrease at elevated Zn or elevated NO3. Chronic 28-day Cr tests were completed successfully with the fatmucket and amphipod (control survival 83-98%). Chronic maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) for fatmucket at 20 A degrees C (26 A mu g Cr/L) decreased by a factor of 2 at elevated temperature or NO3 but did not decrease at elevated Zn. However, chronic MATC for amphipod at 20 A degrees C (13 A mu g Cr/L) did not decrease at elevated temperature, Zn, or NO3. Acute EC50s for both mussels tested with or without a co-stressor were above the final acute value used to derive United States Environmental Protection Agency acute water quality criterion (WQC) for Cr(VI); however, chronic MATCs for fatmucket at elevated temperature or NO3 and chronic MATCs for the amphipod at 20 A degrees C with or without elevated Zn or NO3 were about equal to the chronic WQC. The results indicate that (1) the elevated temperature increased the acute Cr toxicity to both mussel species, (2) fatmucket was acutely more sensitive to Cr than the pearlshell, (3) elevated temperature or NO3 increased chronic Cr toxicity to fatmucket, and (4) acute WQC are protective of tested mussels with or without a co-stressor; however, the chronic WQC might not protect fatmucket at elevated temperature or NO3 and might not protect the amphipod at 20 A degrees C with or without elevated Zn or NO3.																	0090-4341	1432-0703				APR	2017	72	3					449	460		10.1007/s00244-017-0377-x								WOS:000398698400011	28238046

On the other hand, rivers are regarded as one of the main and accessible resources that provide the human needs, that in addition to the water quantity, water quality is also one of the important determinative parameters. This study deals with spatial monitoring of chemical parameters of Sistan River water in the dry and wet years in order to follow the variations in the water chemical quality, determine the most suitable sites to extract potable water and irrigation, and optimize management of water resources in Sistan Plain. For this purpose, climate variables including monthly precipitations (1981-2010) were used to determine the index years of dry and wet together with the results of chemical decomposition of Sistan River water. First, mapping of the parameters of TDS, SAR, EC, Na, Ca, Mg, Cl, SO4 and HCO3 was done in GIS using Geostatistical methods, and then maps were classified according to international standards Wilcox and Schoeller. Finally, using the overlapping method, the river's water quality was determined to extract potable water and irrigation during the wet and dry years. The Wilcox standard results indicated that the quality of the Sistan River's water for irrigation during the drought period lies within the five classes of C3S2, C4S1, C2S2, C3S1and C4S2, and in the wet year period, it lies in the classes of C2S1 and C1S1. The Schoeller diagram results revealed that in the wet year period, the river's water quality is in the range of good and acceptable for drinking purposes. On the other hand, during the drought period, it is in the status of acceptable, moderate, unfavorable, and absolutely unfavorable, acceptable status, the highest percentage is allocated.

These management challenges require a re-balancing of surface and groundwater monitoring objectives and approaches in the country. This article presents the current status of the groundwater monitoring and management in Pakistan. A compelling case is presented for optimization of material resources in improving groundwater level and quality data by proposing to use farmer organizations as a source of crowd sourced groundwater information. The authors showcase new methods to collect groundwater data and demonstrate use of automatic recording instruments for groundwater monitoring in a tertiary canal command area in the Pakistan's Punjab. The results suggest that the potential for broader impact by engaging farmer organization and expanding monitoring networks is attractive. A common concern about long term deployment of automatic instruments is that the observation wells are not purged before extracting water quality samples. The authors address this concern through a field experiment by utilizing capabilities of automatic recording instruments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(2016) recently developed a water quality index (WQI) for assessing water quality of five typical reservoirs. Despite all the merits of the practical WQI, it suffers from lack of uncertainty consideration; a fact that motivated the present discussion focusing on mitigation of uncertainty in water quality assessment. In this regard, superiority of employing fuzzy WQI (FWQI) rather than crisp WQI is emphasized. Due to robustness of FWQI in handling uncertainties surrounding data acquisition, employment of fuzzy concept can improve water quality assessment and monitoring to generate results which are more consistent with real world conditions.

J	Antonelli, M; Wetzel, CE; Ector, L; Teuling, AJ; Pfister, L				Antonelli, Marta; Wetzel, Carlos E.; Ector, Luc; Teuling, Adriaan J.; Pfister, Laurent			On the potential for terrestrial diatom communities and diatom indices to identify anthropic disturbance in soils	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												A large amount of studies focuses on aquatic diatoms' ecology and their use in the assessment of water quality. Little is known about terrestrial diatoms' ecological behaviour and sensitivity to environmental factors. We hypothesise that terrestrial diatom communities can serve as a proxy of anthropic disturbance levels in terrestrial sites. To test our hypothesis, we apply an aquatic index to soil communities that is to deliver new information on the physiographic controls on soil diatoms. Diatom and soil samples were collected in the Attert River basin in Luxembourg during three seasons, in sites characterised by different combinations of geological, soil (schist, marl and sandstone) and land use (forest, grassland and agriculture) features. We found an effect of seasonality on soil diatom communities, reflected by different species dominance and abundances in samples during the three seasons. Soil pH and land use (which translates in a different amount of total carbon and nitrogen in soil) were identified as the variables having the largest impact in structuring the communities and as among the features with the highest importance in defining the ecological status of the sites (i.e. disturbed farmlands having higher pH and lower carbon and nitrogen content). However, the lack of information about the sensitivity of some of the most abundant terrestrial species in our study area caused some discrepancies between the expected (i.e. forested areas with low anthropic disturbance) and the obtained results, with several forested sites classified as having high anthropic disturbance. These results suggest that soil communities are likely to contain information about soil ecological status and highlight the importance of a better characterisation of terrestrial diatom species for developing a quality index based on soil communities.

Automatic identification of rainfall in acoustic recordings	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The rainfall regime is one of the main abiotic components that can cause modifications in the breeding activity of animal species. It has a direct effect on the environmental conditions, and acts as a modifier of the landscape and soundscape. Variations in water quality and acidity, flooding, erosion, and sound distortion are usually related with the presence of rain. Thereby, ecological studies in populations and communities would benefit from improvements in the estimation of rainfall patterns throughout space and time. In this paper, a method for automatic detection of rainfall in forests by using acoustic recordings is proposed. This approach is based on the estimation of the mean value and signal to noise ratio of the power spectral density in the frequency band in which the sound of the raindrops falling over the vegetation layers of the forest is more prominent (i.e. 600-1200 Hz). The results of this method were compared with human auditory identification and data provided by a pluviometer. We achieved a correlation of 95.23% between the data provided by the pluviometer and the predictions of a regression model. Furthermore, we attained a general accuracy between 92.90% and 99.98% when identifying different intensity levels of rainfall on recordings. Nowadays, passive monitoring recorders have been extensively used to study of acoustic-based breeding processes of several animal species. Our method uses the signals acquired by these recorders in order to identify and quantify rainfall events in short and long time spans. The proposed approach will automatically provide information about the rainfall patterns experienced by target species based on audio recordings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, macrophyte overgrowth in shallow lakes may lead to deterioration and a consequent necessity for restoration treatments. We assumed that a major threat to the increased trophic level in the Jankovac flow-through system arises from the sediment, where the accumulation of deciduous leaf litter and decayed macrophyte fragments could generate anoxic conditions. The integrated Water Quality Model (WQM) and the Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Model (SAVM) were combined in the Jankovac Model (JanM) and applied during the vegetated season in 2008 and 2014, with the aim to offer a possible approach to the maintenance of good water quality. The impacts of flow velocity and epiphyton growth on submerged macrophyte coverage and biomass were simulated. Biocenotic analyses suggested that epiphyton growth was more extensive in 2014 in comparison to 2008. The results of JanM indicated that increased flow velocities enhanced macrophyte growth and dissolved oxygen concentrations concurrently with the decline of epiphyton biomass. Furthermore, results suggested that epiphyton growth rate of 0.4 d(-1) maintained macrophyte coverage and biomass at a satisfactory level of 70% reservoir coverage. Considering the proposed scenarios hydraulic treatment could be applied to regulate submerged macrophytes in shallow reservoirs, as an efficient and less invasive approach than sediment removal, especially in sensitive karst areas.

To efficiently prevent water quality (WQ) deterioration, the relationships among the C-DIN in JZB with anthropogenic pressure indicators (APIs) and coastal carrying indicators (CCIs) were identified using long-term series data (1962-2012). First, the control indicators (CIs) were obtained by the application of a conceptual model analysis, and potential sources were identified by a factor analysis. Second, the key Cls were identified by a regression analysis. Finally, the effects of the key CIs on WQ were quantitatively assessed by numerical model experiments. The results showed that the CIs for the C-DIN variation contained both APIs, including terrigenous total nitrogen flux (F-TN) discharged into JZB, river runoff, sea area of reclamation, and the CCIs, including the water area of JZB (S-JZB), chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity and seawater temperature. The APIs on WQ variation were greater than the CCIs. The FTN and Sin were identified as the key CIs responsible for the variation in the C-DIN. The WQ simulation results showed that the increasing trend of the C-DIN was caused by the increase in the F-TN and the decrease in the Sin, and the combined effects induced by the two key CIs on the C-DIN variation was as high as 79%, higher their separate effects, indicating a synergistic interaction of the two key CIs on the WQ of JZB during the last 50 years. These results illustrated that both terrigenous nitrogen pollutant load control systems and a scientific plan for coastline utilization should be implemented to effectively improve the WQ of JZB.

Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process to identify parameter weights for developing a water quality index	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												One of the most common approaches used to evaluate the state of water quality in a water body is through the use of water quality indices (WQIs). This paper presents one of the most important steps in the development of a WQI, which is that of establishing the weights of the water quality parameters. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to calculate weights based on 13 selected parameters from within 7 water quality groupings for rivers in West Java, Indonesia. Thus, two AHP models were employed in this study, the first had 13 pairwise questionnaires to be compared (individual form) and the second model had 7 comparisons (group form). A pool of respondents from related stakeholders with different backgrounds in West Java was surveyed to obtain their judgement independently. In the first AHP model, both chemical oxygen demand (weights in the range 0.102-0.185) and dissolved oxygen (weights in the range 0.103-0.164) consistently received relatively high weights, compared to other water quality parameters. Meanwhile, in the second model, oxygen depletion (weights in the range 0.160-0.233) and microbiology (weights in the range 0.098-0.249) had high weights. Thus, both models estimated relatively high weights for COD, DO and FC. However, considering that the second AHP model. can provide individual weights as well as weights of parameter groupings, this model was preferred in this study. Therefore the results of the second AHP model will be used for the remaining steps in the development of the West Java WQI in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Variations in macroalgae abundances and functional diversity were compared with older data to test the hypothesis that their diversity decreases following anthropogenic stress that negatively impact environmental characteristics. Four field sampling excursions were undertaken at two different sites from December/2012 to May/2014. Destructive sampling per effort used six box cores (25 x 25 cm) distributed randomly along a shallow sublittoral rocky shore. Biomass was used to quantify macroalgae assemblages identified to the species level. Multivariate analyses demonstrated decreases in total biomass at both sites as well as changes in community physiognomies. The predominant corticated algae found were classified as Ecological Status Group IIA, characteristic of sites in the process of degradation and indicating that anthropogenic stress had negatively affected the macroalgae communities as evaluated by the Ecological Evaluation Index.

In the present study, an attempt was made to investigate the concurrent conditions of corrosion scales and the drinking water quality in selected water supply schemes (WSS) in districts Chitral, Peshawar, and Abbottabad, northern Pakistan. Characterization analyses of the corrosion by-products revealed the presence of alpha-FeOOH, gamma-FeOOH, Fe3O4, and SiO2 as major constituents with different proportions. The constituents of all the representative XRD peaks of Peshawar WSS were found insignificant as compared to other WSS, and the reason could be the variation of source water quality. Well-crystallized particles in SEM images indicated the formation of dense oxide layer on corrosion by-products. A wider asymmetric vibration peak of SiO2 appeared only in Chitral and Abbottabad WSS, which demonstrated higher siltation in the water source. One-way ANOVA analysis showed significant variations in pH, turbidity, TDS, K, Mg, PO4, Cl, and SO4 values, which revealed that these parameters differently contributed to the source water quality. Findings from this study suggested the implementation of proper corrosion prevention measures and the establishment of international collaboration for best corrosion practices, expertise, and developing standards.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							194	10.1007/s10661-017-5907-5								WOS:000398714200060	28357720

Macrophytes can be efficient in the treatment of this wastewater due to the removal of the main pollutants. The genotoxicity of sewage-polluted water discharging into La Choza stream was evaluated by testing with Allium cepa. Also, a phytoremediation assay with continuous recirculation of the residual water was conducted for 12 days. Three treatments were carried out. One treatment (Hr) was performed with a macrophyte (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides), and two treatments were conducted without macrophytes: with lighting (Ai) and without lighting (Ao). The wastewater was toxic according to all the evaluated indexes (mitotic index, frequency of chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus). High concentrations of ammonium, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), total (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP) and indicators of faecal contamination were determined in the wastewater. The ammonium, DIN, SRP and TP loads at the end of the assay were significantly lower in the treatments with light (Hr and Ai). So, the nutrient removal was due to their absorption and adsorption by the periphyton and H. ranunculoides. Our results lead us to recommend the maintenance and planting of macrophytes in lowland streams subject to sewage pollution.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							182	10.1007/s10661-017-5892-8								WOS:000398714200048	28342050

Pesticide and nitrate transport in an agriculturally influenced stream in Indiana	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Agrochemicals can be transported from agricultural fields into streams where they might have adverse effects on water quality and ecosystems. Three enrichment experiments were conducted in a central Indiana stream to quantify pesticide and nitrogen transport dynamics. In an enrichment experiment, a compound solution is added at a constant rate into a stream to increase compound background concentration. A conservative tracer (e.g., bromide) is added to determine discharge. Water and sediment samples are taken at several locations downstream to measure uptake metrics. We assessed transport of nitrate, atrazine, metolachlor, and carbaryl through direct measurement of uptake length (S-w), uptake velocity (V-f), and areal uptake (U). S-w measures the distance traveled by a nutrient along the stream reach. V-f measures the velocity a nutrient moves from the water column to immobilization sites. U represents the amount of nutrient immobilized in an area of streambed per unit of time. S-w varied less than one order of magnitude across pesticides. The highest S-w for atrazine suggests greater transport to downstream ecosystems. Across compounds, pesticide S-w was longest in August relative to October and July. V-f varied less than one order of magnitude across pesticides with the highest V-f for metolachlor. U varied three orders of magnitude across pesticides with the highest U associate with sedimentbound carbaryl. Increasing nitrate S-w suggests a lower nitrate demand of biota in this stream. Overall, pesticide transport was best predicted by compound solubility which can complement and improve models of pesticide abundance used by water quality programs and risk assessments.

However, they are losing their vigor at alarming rate due to unwise management. Hence, there is an urgent need to monitor and assess these resources so as to identify the major drivers of its degradation and to provide information for management decisions. In this context, we aimed to assess the effects of human activities on macroinvertebrate assemblages of wetlands in Lake Tana Watershed. Biotic and abiotic data were collected from 46 sampling sites located in eight wetlands. A total of 2568 macroinvertebrates belonging to 46 families were recorded. Macroinvertebrate metrics such as Biological Monitoring Working Party score, Shannon diversity index, Ephemeroptera and odonata family richness, and total family richness portrayed a clear pattern of decreasing with increasing in human disturbances, whereas Family biotic index score, which is an indicator of organic pollution, increased with increasing in human disturbances. The regression analysis also revealed that livestock grazing, leather tanning, and eucalyptus plantation were important predictors of macroinvertebrate metrics (p < 0.05). In conclusion, human activities in and around the wetlands such as farming, leather tanning, solid waste dumping, and effluent discharges were contributed to the degradation of water quality and decreasing in the macroinvertebrate richness and diversity. These alterations could also reduce the availability of wetland products (sedges, craft materials, etc.) and the related ecosystem services. This in turn has an adverse effect on food security and poverty alleviation with considerable impact on communities who heavily depend on wetland products for their livelihood. Therefore, it is essential to formulate wetland policy for achieving wise use goals and necessary legal and institutional backup for sustainable wetland management in Ethiopia.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							152	10.1007/s10661-017-5853-2								WOS:000398714200018	28275984

Seasonal distribution of phytoplankton and its association with physico-chemical parameters in coastal waters of Malvan, west coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Malvan coast is one of the Marine Protected Area (MPA) of Maharashtra because of its rich coral reef and biodiversity. The study investigated on phytoplankton assemblage and their diversity with respect to physico-chemical parameters covering protected and unprotected area of Malvan coast. Physico-chemical parameters such as salinity, nitrite, nitrate, and ammonia did not display seasonality due to inadequate fresh water influx and allochthonous nutrient input. Positive correlation of phosphate (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001) and silicate (r = 0.91, p < 0.0001) with Total Suspended Solids (TSS) confirmed their autochthonous origin as a result of resuspension of bottom sediments during monsoon. A total of 57 phytoplankton species were identified mostly dominated by Bascillariophyceae (40 species), followed by Dinophyceae (9 species), Chlorophyceae (5 species), Cyanophyceae (2 species), and Dictyochophyceae (1 species) from Malvan coast. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that water temperature and TSS were the most significant parameters influencing the distribution and seasonal shift in phytoplankton species such as Skeletonema costatum and Chaetoceros sp. during pre-monsoon and Psedo-nitzschia sp., Streptotheca thamensis, Eucampia zodiacus, and Lithodesmium undulatum during post-monsoon. Silicate and phosphate had minor influence on phytoplankton distribution. Shannon-Wiener diversity index as a pollution index suggested that the study area was incipiently polluted except at bay stations. Despite of various human interventions the water quality and phytoplankton assemblage of this area has not reached to an alarming situation. The current study provides a valuable baseline data on phytoplankton assemblage from Malvan coast.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							151	10.1007/s10661-017-5835-4								WOS:000398714200017	28275985

Land use impacts on river health of Uma Oya, Sri Lanka: implications of spatial scales	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Human actions on landscapes are a principal threat to the ecological integrity of river ecosystems worldwide. Tropical landscapes have been poorly investigated in terms of the impact of catchment land cover alteration on water quality and biotic indices in comparison to temperate landscapes. Effects of land cover in the catchment at two spatial scales (catchment and site) on stream physical habitat quality, water quality, macroinvertebrate indices and community composition were evaluated for Uma Oya catchment in the upper Mahaweli watershed, Sri Lanka. The relationship between spatial arrangement of land cover in the catchment and water quality, macroinvertebrate indices and community composition was examined using univariate and multivariate approaches. Results indicate that chemical water quality variables such as conductivity and total dissolved solids are mostly governed by the land cover at broader spatial scales such as catchment scale. Shannon diversity index was also affected by catchment scale forest cover. In stream habitat features, nutrients such as N-NO3-, macroinvertebrate family richness, %shredders and macroinvertebrate community assemblages were predominantly influenced by the extent of land cover at 200 m site scale suggesting that local riparian forest cover is important in structuring macroinvertebrate communities. Thus, this study emphasizes the importance of services provided by forest cover at catchment and site scale in enhancing resilience of stream ecosystems to natural forces and human actions. Findings suggest that land cover disturbance effects on stream ecosystem health could be predicted when appropriate spatial arrangement of land cover is considered and has widespread application in the management of tropical river catchments.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							192	10.1007/s10661-017-5863-0								WOS:000398714200058	28357718

In this paper, multivariate techniques, such as factor analysis (FA) and cluster analysis (CA), were applied to analyze the water quality datasets for 19 rivers in Liangjiang New Area (LJNA), China, collected in April (dry season) and September (wet season) of 2014 and 2015. In most sampling rivers, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and fecal coliform exceeded the Class V guideline (GB3838-2002), which could thereby threaten the water quality in Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. FA clearly identified the five groups of water quality variables, which explain majority of the experimental data. Nutritious pollution, seasonal changes, and construction activities were three key factors influencing rivers' water quality in LJNA. CA grouped 19 sampling sites into two clusters, which located at sub-catchments with high-and low-level urbanization, respectively. One-way ANOVA showed the nutrients (total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, and nitrite), fecal coliform, and conductivity in cluster 1 were significantly greater than in cluster 2. Thus, catchment urbanization degraded rivers' water quality in Liangjiang New Area. Identifying effective buffer zones at riparian scale to weaken the negative impacts of catchment urbanization was recommended.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							174	10.1007/s10661-017-5884-8								WOS:000398714200040	28324277

An assessment of subsurface contamination of an urban coastal aquifer due to oil spill	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Incidences of leakages of chemicals from underground oil storage tanks or oil-carrying pipelines have posed huge threat to the coastal aquifers around the world. One such leak was recently identified and notified by the people of Tondiarpet, Chennai, India. The assessment of the contamination level was done by obtaining electrical resistivity maps of the subsurface, drilling of 20 new borewells for soil and water analysis, and testing the water quality of 30 existing borewells. Samples were collected from the borewells, and observations were made that included parameters such as odor, moisture, contamination characteristics, lithology, groundwater level, thickness of the free product that are used to demarcate the extent of soil, and water contamination. Furthermore, a multigas detector was used to detect hydrocarbon presence as soil vapor. Moreover, to capture the transport of dissolved hydrocarbons, 10 samples were collected in the periphery of the study area and were analyzed for the presence of petroleum hydrocarbon and polyaromatic hydrocarbon. Analysis of the data indicated the presence of free-phase hydrocarbon in soil and groundwater close to the junction of Thiruvottiyur high (TH) road (TH) and Varadaja Perumal Koil (VPK) street. Although the contaminant plume is confined to a limited area, it has spread more to the southern and eastern side of the pipeline possibly due to continuous abstraction of groundwater by residential apartments. After cutting a trench along the VPK street and plotting of the plume delineation map, observations indicated that the source of the hydrocarbon leak is present in VPK street close to TH road. A multipronged strategy was suggested targeting the remediation of oil in various phases.

Various physico-chemical parameters like pH, EC, TS, TSS, TDS, TH, cations (Na1+, K1+, Li1+, Ca2+, Mg2+), anions (Cl1-, F1-, HCO31-, NO31-, SO42-), and heavy metals (Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd) were determined. The data indicated wide ranges of variation in all the parameters. Concentration of physico-chemical properties such as EC, TS, TSS, TH, Li1+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and HCO31- and heavy metals (Cr, Fe, Cu, and Cd) exceeded WHO permissible limits. The distribution of heavy metals in two sampling areas followed the increasing order as Fe > Cr > Cd > Cu > Pb > Zn. The Piper diagram showed that water in the region was of alkaline type. Strong positive correlations were observed among most of the parameters; however, pH was negatively correlated with most of the parameters. According to principle component analysis, parameters causing variations in water quality were mainly EC, TDS, TS, TSS, TH, Na1+, K1+, Ca2+, Mg2+, F1-, NO31- , SO42-, Cr, Fe, Cu, and Zn. Linear regression analysis revealed that heavy metals like Cr, Fe, and Cu concentrations were strongly correlated having an R-2 value of 0.92 at P <= 0.001 with pH. Overall, the results suggested that irrigation water of the area was not fit for irrigation purposes and might cause serious threats for safe, healthy food and feed production. Proper monitoring of water of the said area should be carried out, and quality of irrigation water should be checked from time to time.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				APR	2017	189	4							156	10.1007/s10661-017-5868-8								WOS:000398714200022	28284001

Once the optimization of grey water pre-treatment system has been determined, the filtration system was operated at different hydraulic loading rate and media filter proportions in order to assess the suitability of treated grey water for irrigational purpose according to salinity hazard, sodium hazard, magnesium hazard, permeability index, water infiltration rate, and widely used graphical methods. Suitability of the treated grey water for industrial purpose was evaluated in terms of foaming, corrosion, and scaling. Under optimal operational conditions, results reveals that treated grey water samples with an upflow-downflow siliceous sand/marble waste filtration system may be considered as a good and an excellent water quality suitable for irrigation purpose. However, treated grey water was found not appropriate for industrial purpose due to high concentrations of calcium and sodium that can generate foaming and scaling harm to boilers. These results suggest that treated grey water with an upflowdownflow siliceous sand/marble waste filtration system would support production when used as irrigation water.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	11					9870	9885		10.1007/s11356-016-7471-x								WOS:000399401700005	27566157

The study was performed in water, sediment, and barbel (Barbus peloponnesius), collected in two seasons, from two suspected polluted and one reference zones. The water analyses revealed higher mean values in polluted sites for most of the examined physicochemical parameters. Metal concentrations (Zn, Cu, Cd, Mn, Pb, and Fe) in water were more or less constant, whereas in sediment, they were higher at the two polluted locations. Condition factor (CF), as a general health indicator, revealed better overall condition in barbel from the reference site. In general, blood parameters revealed higher values in the polluted localities. Irrespective of sex and/or season, the frequency of micronuclei (MN) and vacuolated nuclei (VN) were with higher rates in polluted sites. Similarly, the frequencies of the leucocytes (Le), binuclei (BN), and irregularly shaped nuclei (ISN) were also significantly increased in the polluted localities, but they seemed prone to be influenced by sex and/or season. However, strong positive correlations between blood biomarkers and most water physicochemical parameters and metal in sediment were estimated. Our data support that the River Bregalnica's lower course receives significant genotoxic pollution, likely via metal industry effluents, agricultural runoff, and domestic sewage, and reinforced the utility of MN and other nuclear abnormalities as sensitive and suitable biomarkers for genotoxicity when used in monitoring studies.

This study evaluated the water quality of Juara Lagoon (ES, Brazil) based on physical and chemical variables, cytogenetic responses in Allium cepa and phytoplankton dynamics. Three sampling sites were defined and water samples were collected during two sampling periods. Analyses such as determination of photic zone, conductivity, and concentrations of nutrients and metals were conducted as well as cytotoxic, mutagenic, and genotoxic potentials using A. cepa test. The main attributes of phytoplankton community, such as total richness, total density, density by class, dominance, and diversity, were also evaluated. Results have revealed that Juara Lagoon has signs of artificial eutrophication at two sampling sites due to high levels of total phosphorus and ammonia nitrogen. Cytotoxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic potentials were detected as well as high concentrations of Fe and Mn. Furthermore, 165 phytoplankton taxa were recorded, with highest richness in Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae classes. In addition, Cyanophyceae presented as the highest density class. A. cepa test and phytoplankton community evaluation indicated that the ecological quality of Juara Lagoon is compromised.																	0944-1344	1614-7499				APR	2017	24	11					10855	10868		10.1007/s11356-017-8721-2								WOS:000399401700089	28293825

A large outbreak of gastrointestinal illness at an open-water swimming event in the River Thames, London	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION												Open-water swimming is increasingly popular, often in water not considered safe for bathing. Limited evidence exists on the associated health risks. We investigated gastrointestinal illness in 1100 swimmers in a River Thames event in London, UK, to describe the outbreak and identify risk factors. We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Our case definition was swimmers with any: diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal cramps lasting >= 48 h, nausea lasting >= 48 h, with onset within 9 days after the event. We used an online survey to collect information on symptoms, demographics, pre- and post-swim behaviours and open-water experience. We tested associations using robust Poisson regression. We followed up case microbiological results. Survey response was 61%, and attack rate 53% (338 cases). Median incubation period was 34 h and median symptom duration 4 days. Five cases had confirmed microbiological diagnoses (four Giardia, one Cryptosporidium). Wearing a wetsuit [adjusted relative risk (aRR) 6 . 96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-46.72] and swallowing water (aRR 1.42, 95% CI 1.03-1.97) were risk factors. Recent river-swimming (aRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.92) and age > 40 years (aRR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70-0.98) were protective. Action to reduce risk of illness in future events is recommended, including clarification of oversight arrangements for future swims to ensure appropriate risk assessment and advice is provided.

The system is assumed to have state time delay and the system matrices have uncertainties. The proposed sliding hyper-surface is a fractional Ito process which is proven to be attainable almost surely in finite time by applying the fractional Ito formula. The trajectories of the system will be kept within a time-varying region around the sliding hyper-surface. The stochastic asymptotic stability of the closed-loop dynamics at sliding mode is guaranteed by the feasibility of some linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The usefulness of the theoretical findings is demonstrated by providing a case study on the problem of stream water quality standards regulation. In addition, to show the effectiveness and superiority of the method a numerical example is presented.																	0018-9286	1558-2523				APR	2017	62	4					1742	1751		10.1109/TAC.2016.2594261								WOS:000399033000014

The current paper examines the feasibility of using an alternative approach in which observed streamflow time series are disaggregated into baseflow, point source, and nonpoint source time series, which are then used as forcing functions to generate point and nonpoint source pollution load predictions. The potential utility of the approach is examined by comparing the results of four different watershed simulations against results obtained from the traditional approach using an Loading Simulation Program C (LSPC) model with standard statistical tests for both calibration and validation analyses.

Solute transport characterization in karst aquifers by tracer injection tests for a sustainable water resource management	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Protection of water resources is a major challenge today, given that territory occupation and land use are continuously increasing. In the case of karst aquifers, its dynamic complexity requires the use of specific methodologies that allow establishing local and regional flow and transport patterns. This information is particularly necessary when springs and wells harnessed for water supply are concerned. In view of the present state of the art, this work shows a new approach based on the use of a LiCl based tracer injection test through a borehole for transport characterization from a local to a regional scale. Thus a long term tracer injection test was conducted in a particularly sensitive sector of the Egino karst massif (Basque Country, Spain). The initial displacement of tracer in the vicinity of the injection was monitored in a second borehole at a radial distance of 10.24 m. This first information, assessed by a radial divergent model, allows obtaining transport characteristic parameters in this immediate vicinity during injection. At a larger (regional) scale, the tracer reaches a highly transmissive network with mean traveling velocities to the main springs being from 4.3 to 13.7 m/h. The responses obtained, particularly clear in the main spring used for water supply, and the persistence of part of the tracer in the injection zone, pose reconsidering the need for their protection. Thus, although the test allows establishing the 24-h isochrone, which is the ceiling value in present European vulnerability approaches, the results obtained" advise widening the zone to protect in order to guarantee water quality in the springs. Overall, this stimulus-response test allows furthering the knowledge on the dynamics of solute transport in karst aquifers and is a particularly useful tool in studies related to source vulnerability and protection in such a complex medium.

J	Zhang, Q; Ball, WP				Zhang, Qian; Ball, William P.			Improving riverine constituent concentration and flux estimation by accounting for antecedent discharge conditions	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Regression-based approaches are often employed to estimate riverine constituent concentrations and fluxes based on typically sparse concentration observations. One such approach is the recently developed WRTDS ("Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season") method, which has been shown to provide more accurate estimates than prior approaches in a wide range of applications. Centered on WRTDS, this work was aimed at developing improved models for constituent concentration and flux estimation by accounting for antecedent discharge conditions. Twelve modified models were developed and tested, each of which contains one additional flow variable to represent antecedent conditions and which can be directly derived from the daily discharge record. High-resolution (daily) data at nine diverse monitoring sites were used to evaluate the relative merits of the models for estimation of six constituents chloride (Cl), nitrate-plus-nitrite (NOx), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and suspended sediment (SS). For each site-constituent combination, 30 concentration subsets were generated from the original data through Monte Carlo subsampling and then used to evaluate model performance. For the subsampling, three sampling strategies were adopted: (A) 1 random sample each month (12/year), (B) 12 random monthly samples plus additional 8 random samples per year (20/year), and (C) flow-stratified sampling with 12 regular (non-storm) and 8 storm samples per year (20/year). Results reveal that estimation performance varies with both model choice and sampling strategy. In terms of model choice, the modified models show general improvement over the original model under all three sampling strategies. Major improvements were achieved for NO. by the long-term flow -anomaly model and for Cl by the ADF (average discounted flow) model and the short-term flow -anomaly model. Moderate improvements were achieved for SS, TP, and TKN by the ADF model. By contrast, no such achievement was achieved for SRP by any proposed model. In terms of sampling strategy, performance of all models (including the original) was generally best using strategy C and worst using strategy A, and especially so for SS, TP, and SRP, confirming the value of routinely collecting stormflow samples. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive set of statistical evidence for supporting the incorporation of antecedent discharge conditions into the WRTDS model for estimation of constituent concentration and flux, thereby combining the advantages of two recent developments in water quality modeling.

J	De Caro, M; Crosta, GB; Frattini, P				De Caro, Mattia; Crosta, Giovanni B.; Frattini, Paolo			Hydrogeochemical characterization and Natural Background Levels in urbanized areas: Milan Metropolitan area (Northern Italy)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Although aquifers in densely populated and industrialized areas are extremely valuable and sensitive to contamination, an estimate of the groundwater quality status relative to baseline conditions is lacking for many of them. This paper provides a hydrogeochemical characterization of the groundwater in the Milan metropolitan area, one of the most densely populated areas in Europe. First, a conceptual model of the study area based on the analysis of the spatial distribution of natural chemical species and indicator contaminants is presented. The hydrochemical facies of the study area depend on the lithology of catchments drained by the main contributing rivers and on the aquifer settings. The anthropogenic influence on the groundwater quality of superficial aquifers is studied by means of probability plots, concentration versus depth plots and spatial-temporal plots for nitrate, sulfate and chloride. These allow differentiation of contaminated superficial aquifers from deep confined aquifers with baseline water quality. Natural Background Levels (NBL) of selected species (Cl, Na, NH4, SO4, NO3, As, Fe, Mn and Zn) are estimated by means of the pre-selection (PS) and the component separation (CS) statistical approaches. The NBLs depend on hydrogeological settings of the study area; sodium, chloride, sulfate and zinc NBL values never exceed the environmental water quality standards. NBL values of ammonium, iron, arsenic and manganese exceed the environmental water quality standards in the anaerobic portion of the aquifers. On the basis of observations, a set of criteria and precautions are suggested for adoption with both PS and CS methods in the aquifer characterization of highly urbanized areas.

J	Kovacs, K; West, G; Xu, Y				Kovacs, Kent; West, Grant; Xu, Ying			The use of efficiency frontiers to evaluate the optimal land cover and irrigation practices for economic returns and ecosystem services	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Efficiency frontiers are a useful tool for governmental agencies that balance the protection of ecosystem services with the economic returns from an agricultural landscape because the tool illustrates that a compromise of objectives generates greater value to society than optimizing a sole objective. Policy makers facing the problem of groundwater overdraft on an agricultural landscape want to know if regulations or irrigation technology adoption will enhance both economic and ecosystem service benefits. Conjunctive water management with on-farm reservoirs and tail water recovery system is frequently suggested to alleviate groundwater and surface water quality problems in the Lower Mississippi River Basin of the United States, and this study evaluates the consequence of the adoption of this technology for the balance of ecosystem service and economic objectives. A compromise of objectives that maximizes the value to society provides 76% more value to society without reservoirs and 66% more value to society with reservoirs than the sole objective of economic returns. The reservoirs help an agricultural landscape maximizing economic returns to align more closely with a landscape maximizing the value to society, although there are still significant gains possible from finding a landscape that directly compromises on the objectives.

J	Hagemann, M; Park, MH				Hagemann, Mark; Park, Mi-Hyun			Capacity of semi-parametric regression models to predict extreme-event water quality in the Northeastern US	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This study assessed the capacity of semi-parametric regression models to predict riverine solute concentrations during extreme high-flow hydrologic events, when such events are absent from the models' calibration data. Using a large dataset from 459 monitoring stations across the US Northeast, the models showed a tendency to overpredict extreme-event concentrations, with increasing bias and variance for increasingly extreme hydrologic conditions. The validation framework in this study effectively compared model performance across disparate hydrologic regimes and constituents, yet can be used to estimate individual model performance under an unobserved extreme-flow condition, regardless of whether any extreme-flow data are available for that model. The validation procedure can further be generalized to explore model performance in an arbitrarily defined extreme condition for a broad range of model types. Despite an overall increase in uncertainty for extreme-event concentration estimates, estimates under extreme hydrologic conditions could be improved by taking into account the observed bias in the aggregated regional database.

Sediment transport in steep forested catchments - An assessment of scale and disturbance	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Stream sediment loads (both bedload and suspended sediment) are problematic to measure due to the time and equipment needed. There is a dearth of such data sets globally let alone for Australia. However, such data are needed to quantify sediment transport type and rates, landscape evolution, effect of human disturbance as well as patterns and temporal response. Here we present the findings from 8 steepslope forested catchments dominated by headwater streams (size range 15-100 ha) in southeastern Australia where both bedload and suspended load have been measured over multiple years. The results demonstrate that suspended load is the dominant component and there is no consistent suspended to bedload ratio for the catchments. The suspended sediment to bedload ratio appears to be catchment specific. There was no relationship between total load (or bedload/suspended load) and average catchment slope, stream length, shape or any geomorphic descriptor. However catchment total load was found to be significantly related to catchment area. Of the 8 catchments examined here, 6 had been harvested for timber in previous decades (with large areas of forest removed) while 2 catchments had minimal disturbance (Control catchments). There was no difference in sediment loads from the harvested and Control catchments. The results demonstrate that although land disturbance had previously occurred the management practices employed in each catchment were effective in the long term. This provides confidence that the forest harvesting and subsequent management do not produce detrimental effects in the medium to long term. An assessment of erosion rates and likely soil production rates suggests that the catchments are eroding soil at the rate it is being produced.

The efficient and optimal decision-making on loading reduction is generally based on water quality modeling and the quantitative identification of nutrient sources at the watershed scale. The modeling process is influenced inevitably by inherent uncertainties, especially by uncertain parameters due to equifinality. Therefore, the emerging question is: if there is parameter uncertainty, how to ensure the robustness of the optimal decisions? Based on simulation-optimization models, an integrated approach of pattern identification and analysis of robustness was proposed in this study that focuses on the impact of parameter uncertainty in water quality modeling. Here the pattern represents the discernable regularity of solutions for load reduction under multiple parameter sets. Pattern identification is achieved by using a hybrid clustering analysis (i.e., Ward-Hierarchical and K-means), which was flexible and efficient in analyzing Lake Bali near the Yangtze River in China. The results demonstrated that urban domestic nutrient load is the most potential source that should be reduced, and there are two patterns for Total Nitrogen (TN) reduction and three patterns for Total Phosphorus (TP) reduction. The patterns indicated different total reduction of nutrient loads, which reflect diverse decision preferences. The robust solution was identified by the highest accomplishment with the water quality at monitoring stations that were improved uniformly with this solution. We conducted a process analysis of robust decision-making that was based on pattern identification and uncertainty, which provides effective support for decision making with preference under uncertainty.

Oyster populations and the reefs they form have suffered chronic long-term decline throughout the species' range, including in northwest Florida's Pensacola Bay estuary system (PBS). To guide efforts to rebuild oyster populations in the PBS, connectivity patterns were evaluated among historic and extant reef locations using an integrated biophysical numerical model. Water quality parameters and oyster recruitment were monitored in May 2007 and then monthly from July 2007 through July 2008. Resultant salinity data were used to calibrate an Estuarine Coastal Ocean Model-based numerical circulation model of Pensacola Bay, which was then coupled to an existing, individual-based, oyster larvae routine to predict ontogenetic larval distribution. Three-dimensional Lagrangian transport algorithms were used to simulate transport of modeled larvae during four 20-day time periods during those summer and autumn months when oyster recruitment was empirically recorded in the bay. Based on outcomes from contemporaneous sampling of oyster larvae, the model was shown to represent the salient features of oyster larval distribution in Pensacola Bay. There were, however, instances of incongruity between modeled and sampled outcomes, indicating that model outcomes not validated with field data must be interpreted with caution. Larval supply was highly variable and spatially complex, but potentially limiting to successful recruitment and reef replenishment. Larval transfer rates within and among previously identified oyster reefs in Pensacola Bay were determined and were used to predict optimal oyster reef restoration or rehabilitation sites. Finally, larval exports from the bay were estimated and considered within the context of larval exchange among north Florida estuaries and potential repercussions to the long-term health of the Gulf of Mexico oyster metapopulation.

A numerical framework for modelling sediment and chemical constituents transport in the Lower Athabasca River	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												The transport of fine sediments and associated chemical constituents originating from potential anthropogenic and natural sources is becoming an issue of increasing importance in the Lower Athabasca River (LAR) ecosystem in northern Alberta, Canada. This study aims to (1) establish an integrated numerical modelling framework to investigate the transport of fine cohesive sediments and associated chemical constituents during both ice-covered and open-water periods and (2) apply the modelling framework to investigate the state and temporal/spatial variation in sediment and selected chemical constituents within the LAR. One-dimensional hydrodynamic and transport models, combined with a river ice model, are used to predict the flow characteristics, transport of sediments and a selection of three metals and three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) within a similar to 200 km reach of the LAR, both in open-water and ice-covered conditions. The models are validated using available field measurements and are applied to investigate the state and variation of sediment and chemicals for a baseline period as well as to assess the effect of various hypothetical pollution scenarios. The model simulations successfully reproduce the hydrodynamics and sediment transport patterns as well as the state and variation of selected metal and PAH constituents. The results generally show that the concentration of chemical constituents in the bed sediment is the major factor in determining the state and variation of their concentration in the water column, and the high-flow season is the critical period for the transport of sediment and chemicals in the system. The scenario simulation results indicate that increases in the concentrations of chemical constituents in tributary streams have to be orders of magnitude higher to have a noticeable effect on their corresponding water column concentration in the LAR. Those effects are also found to be higher only within the immediate vicinity of the tributary confluences and gradually diminish with distance downstream of the confluences. The numerical modelling framework developed in this study provides a tool for investigation and understanding of the state and temporal/spatial variation of sediment and associated chemical constituents within cold region rivers such as the LAR. By conducting additional scenario-based studies (such as future climate and chemicals loading), the models can be used to identify possible future states of sediment and water quality constituents in the LAR ecosystem.

Disinfectants are common agents applied to drinking water controlling microbial propagation, yet the underlying mechanisms of how disinfectants function to regulate microbial activity and thereby biofilm development remains elusive. We experimentally studied the effects of chlorination on extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) production, and its impacts on early-stage biofilm formation in a model drinking water system. Results showed that low-level chlorine (<= 1.0 mg/L) stimulated microbial EPS (especially of proteins) excretion that favored early-stage biofilm formation. Microbes experiencing higher chlorination (>1.0 mg/L) exhibited clearly suppressed growth associated with reduced EPS release, consequently yielding less biofilm formation. Removal of cell-attached proteins and polysaccharides diminished biofilm formation, which highlighted the critical role of EPS (especially protein components) in biofilm development. A negative correlation between chlorination-mediated microbial protein production and cell surface charge suggested that chlorine disinfection may modify cell surface properties through regulation of microbial EPS excretion and thereby mediate biofilm formation. With these quantitative estimations, this study provides novel insights into how chlorination-mediated EPS excretion shapes early-stage biofilm formation, which is essential for practical functioning of drinking water systems.

Palustriella commutata is the more frequent species. Other species are locally frequent, as e.g. Eucladium verticillatum, Hymetzosodium recurvirostrum, Boum pseudotriquetrum. From a floristic perspective, bryoliths of the Isere lower valley are typical of temperate Europe. The communities are complex and structured by a small number of bryophyte species that mostly respond to water availability. This type of vegetation is referred to a European priority habitat named 7220 Sources petriflantes avec formation de tuf (Cratoneurion). From a morphological point of view, two main types of bryoliths systems coexist: cascades and dams. The bryoliths of the Isere lower valley, like others from southem France, are characterized by multiple-equilibria, which make them sensitive ecosystems: hydrochemical equilibrium linked to water quality; biological equilibrium due to encrusting bryophytes occurrence and growth; hydrological equilibrium due to type of water input. Water supply accounts for floristic, bryocoenotic and functional richness. All carbonate precipitation processes rely heavily on water supply abundance and quality. Studied bryoliths, as they are disconnected from the general hydrological functioning, are strictly dependant of the Molassic aquifers they are fed by. Hence bryoliths of Isere lower valley are oligotrophic systems within an overall eutrophic valley. All bryoliths are threatened by strong anthropic pressure. Trampling, forestry, but mostly water extraction, are worrying threats. Many bryoliths were exploited for building stone in the past. Today, Holocene bryoliths are settled over ancient travertine systems which have a great paleogeographical value.																	0249-7395					APR-JUN	2017	72	2					116	133										WOS:000398985600002

Accessing safe drinking water in sub-Saharan Africa: Issues and challenges in South West Nigeria	SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY												Termination of the Millennium Development Goals gave birth to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with which Target 6 is to provide unhindered access to safe and economical drinking water and sanitation for all. The survey in this research adopted stratified sampling technique that captured 400 households, in which 700 well-structured questionnaire consisting of open and closed-ended questions were distributed. The questions were in line with Water and Sanitation Hygiene (WaSH) recommendations on drinking water and sanitation for household surveys. It examined the access to safe water regarding accessibility, availability, affordability and acceptability in Ado-Odo Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. Personal interviews were conducted to capture the emotional discretion of respondents towards the subject matter. Cross-tabulation and Multinomial logit model were used to analyze the relationship of the variables on water access. The results obtained showed that the water access within the study area is mostly limited to the private sources because of the level of quality and accessibility. The study reveals that the fate placed on government water facilities has dwindled drastically. Furthermore, the study highlighted the need to revisit government policies, with the inclusion of subsidy, cost recovery and rainwater harvesting as effective tools in improving and encouraging equity in water access.

A GIS-based tool for integrated management of clogging risk and nitrogen fertilization in drip irrigation	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												Precipitation of insoluble compounds poses a relevant concern in the management of drip irrigation. This risk is controlled by acidification of irrigation water. The main objective of this work was the development of a GIS-based tool to control drip clogging risk in drip irrigation by nitric acid injection in irrigation water. The study was performed in the province of Jaen (south Spain) focused on the irrigation of olive orchards. The GIS-based model was developed incorporating climate and water data in order to identify zones with different risks of drip clogging which require different rates of acid injection in the irrigation water. Volume of nitric acid injected increased with irrigation frequency and acid injection time. The model provided information on the total amount of N supplied with acidulated irrigation water; e.g. with 30 min injection time in daily irrigations, more than 10 kg N ha(-1) were applied in 47% of land potentially irrigated with surface water, meanwhile this percentage was around 60% of that potentially irrigated with underground water. This means that N supply with acid injections to reduce clogging risk may account for a relevant portion of N fertilization requirements in olive orchards. Consequently, this supply should be integrated in fertilization programs to avoid agronomic and environmental constraints. The GIS-based tool proposed was able to provide complementary technical solutions to the clogging problem in drip irrigation. For each alternative released, a precise estimation of N supply to be considered in accurate N fertilizer management was provided. The tool also supplied graphical visualization of information and functionality of handling geographic data with an easy update. All this is necessary in planning and decision making at regional scale with changing properties in irrigation water. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, incorrect management of manure may cause environmental problems due to sediments and nutrients losses associated to runoff. The aims of this work were to: (i) evaluate the time effect of post-liquid dairy manure (LDM) application on runoff, sediment and nutrient losses; (ii) compare the effect of conventional tillage and no-till systems on runoff, sediment and nutrients losses after LDM application. A rainfall simulation experiment was conducted on intact soil blocks collected from fields that had been under conventional tillage and no-till systems. Rainfall was applied 24 h or 7 days after LDM application. Conventional tillage without manure application resulted on higher runoff, sediment and nutrient losses (mainly the particulate fraction) than no-till without manure. The greatest runoff, sediment and nutrients losses occurred in the treatments where simulated rainfall was performed 24 h after LDM application independent of the tillage system. An interval of 7 days between manure application and the rainfall event reduced sediment, particulate P, and particulate N losses in both conventional and no-till systems. In practical terms, we would recommend a minimum of 7 days between LDM application and rainfall-runoff event to provide agronomic benefits minimizing the potential risk of water pollution.

Winter rye as a cover crop reduces nitrate loss to subsurface drainage as simulated by HERMES	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												HERMES is a widely used agricultural system model; however, it has never been tested for simulating N loss to subsurface drainage. Here, we integrated a simple drain flbw component into HERMES. We then compared the predictions to four years of data (2002-2005) from central Iowa fields in corn-oybean with winter rye as a cover crop (CC) and without winter rye (NCC). We also compared the HERMES predictions to the more complex Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM) predictions for the same dataset. The average annual observed and simulated N loss to drain flow were 43.8 and 44.4 kg N/ha (NCC) and 17.6 and 18.9 kg N/ha (CC). The slightly over predicted N loss for CC was because of over predicted nitrate concentration, which may be partly caused by slightly under predicted average annual rye shoot N (observed and simulated values were 47.8 and 46.0 kg N/ha). Also, recent research from the site suggests that the soil field capacity may be greater in CC while we used the same soil parameters for both treatments. A local sensitivity analysis suggests that increased field capacity affects HERMES simulations, which includes reduced drain flow nitrate concentrations, increased denitrification, and reduced drain flow volume. HERMES-simulated cumulative monthly drain flow and annual drain flow were reasonable compared to field data and HERMES performance was comparable to other published drainage model tests. Unlike the RZWQM simulations, however, the modified HERMES did riot accurately simulate the year to year variability in nitrate concentration difference between NCC and CC, possibly due in part to the lack of partial mixing and displacement of the soil solution. The results suggest that 1) the relatively simple model HERMES is a promising tool to estimate annual N loss to drain flow under corn-soybean rotations with winter rye as a cover crop and 2) soil field capacity is a critical parameter to investigate to more thoroughly understand and appropriately model denitrification and N losses to subsurface drainage.

J	Osman, OA; Beier, S; Grabherr, M; Bertilsson, S				Osman, Omneya Ahmed; Beier, Sara; Grabherr, Manfred; Bertilsson, Stefan			Interactions of Freshwater Cyanobacteria with Bacterial Antagonists	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Cyanobacterial and algal mass development, or blooms, have severe effects on freshwater and marine systems around the world. Many of these phototrophs produce a variety of potent toxins, contribute to oxygen depletion, and affect water quality in several ways. Coexisting antagonists, such as cyanolytic bacteria, hold the potential to suppress, or even terminate, such blooms, yet the nature of this interaction is not well studied. We isolated 31 cyanolytic bacteria affiliated with the genera Pseudomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter, and Delftia from three eutrophic freshwater lakes in Sweden and selected four phylogenetically diverse bacterial strains with strong-to-moderate lytic activity. To characterize their functional responses to the presence of cyanobacteria, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments on coculture incubations, with an initial predator-prey ratio of 1: 1. Genes involved in central cellular pathways, stress-related heat or cold shock proteins, and antitoxin genes were highly expressed in both heterotrophs and cyanobacteria. Heterotrophs in coculture expressed genes involved in cell motility, signal transduction, and putative lytic activity. L, D-Transpeptidase was the only significantly upregulated lytic gene in Stenotrophomonas rhizophila EK20. Heterotrophs also shifted their central metabolism from the tricarboxylic acid cycle to the glyoxylate shunt. Concurrently, cyanobacteria clearly show contrasting antagonistic interactions with the four tested heterotrophic strains, which is also reflected in the physical attachment to their cells. In conclusion, antagonistic interactions with cyanobacteria were initiated within 24 h, and expression profiles suggest varied responses for the different cyanobacteria and studied cyanolytes. IMPORTANCE Here, we present how gene expression profiles can be used to reveal interactions between bloom-forming freshwater cyanobacteria and antagonistic heterotrophic bacteria. Species-specific responses in both heterotrophs and cyanobacteria were identified. The study contributes to a better understanding of the interspecies cellular interactions underpinning the persistence and collapse of cyanobacterial blooms.																	0099-2240	1098-5336				APR	2017	83	7							UNSP e02634	10.1128/AEM.02634-16								WOS:000397107300002	28115385

These increases biofloc concentration in the water and some form of removal is needed. An experiment was carried out to evaluate two management practices to control biofloc in Litopenaeus vannamei culture. Six tanks (48 m(3)) were divided into two treatments: water exchange and solid settler. Shrimp were stocked at 164 shrimp m(-2) and with 0.67 g of weight. After 61 days, shrimp under solid settler treatment demonstrated mean weight of 12.7 +/- 0.5 g with survival of 73.8 +/- 1.4%, and those under water exchange had a final weight of 10.1 +/- 0.2 g and survival rate of 57.8 +/- 11.1%. Total suspended solids did not differ between the treatments: 326.8 +/- 24.9 mg L-1 for water exchange and 310.9 +/- 25.3 mg L-1 for solid settlers. Settleable solids and productivity/respiration ratio was higher (P < 0.05) in water exchange treatment, indicating differences in physical and biological characteristics of bioflocs. Solids removal method influenced the water use, in which 1150 +/- 249 L of water was necessary to produce one kilogram of shrimp using water exchange strategy, and 631 +/- 25 L kg(-1) with the use of settlers. Our results indicate that continuous operation of settlers can reduce variability in solids characteristics and water quality variables such as ammonia. Both strategies are efficient in controlling biofloc concentrations of the water; however, settlers can reduce water use and improve shrimp production.

Shrimp postlarvae (98.47 +/- 8.6 mg) were fed for 32 days in tanks with water volume of 130 L and density of 1 individual L-1. One control treatment and four biofloc treatments (BFT1, BFT2, BFT3 and BFT4) with adding different carbon sources including molasses, starch, wheat flour and mixture of them, respectively, were considered at equal weight ratios. According to the results, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH were not significantly different among the biofloc treatments (P > 0.05). Maximum pH (8.27) and maximum dissolved oxygen (6.35 mg L-1) were recorded in the control. Maximum (0.43 mg L-1) and minimum (0.09 mg L-1) ammonia were recorded in the control and BFT2, respectively (P < 0.05). Using simple carbohydrates (molasses and starch) lowered the ammonia concentration significantly. The highest increase in body weight (1640.43 perpendicular to 231.28 mg), growth rate, specific growth rate (8.97 +/- 0.42% per day) and biomass (190.29 +/- 26.83 mg) were found in BFT1 and the highest survival (90 +/- 0.77%) was found in BFT4. The highest feed conversion (1.52 +/- 0.23) and the lowest feed efficiency (66.81 +/- 7.95) were observed in the control (P < 0.05). The proximate composition analysis revealed an increase in lipid and ash in biofloc treatments. Results indicated that using biofloc technology with zero-water exchange system and adding carbon sources could help to recycle waste and improve the water quality. Moreover, the type of carbonaceous organic matter as a substrate for heterotrophic bacteria would be effective in degradation and metabolization of ammonia and nitrite.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				APR	2017	48	4					1491	1501		10.1111/are.12985								WOS:000396054700013

A number of factors potentially affect nutrient content, but a quantitative understanding across the geographical range of the eastern oysters is lacking. This study was designed to quantify the relationships among various metrics of farmed eastern oysters near its northern geographical range focusing on nutrient content. Hatchery-reared oysters were deployed in polyethylene bags at six sites, and were measured on multiple occasions from 2010 to 2012. A quadratic polynomial fit to the combined datasets for shell height indicated that on average a 'cocktail' size oyster (63 mm shell height) would be reached after 2 year, and 'regular' size (76 mm) would require 3 year. There were significant differences in growth rates and oyster nutrient content among the sites; means for %N in soft tissue ranged from 6.9 to 8.6, and 0.07 to 0.18 in shell. Per cent N in soft tissue and shell were highest at two sites at the mouths of rivers with elevated dissolved inorganic N concentrations in the water. Grand means (all sites, seasons and years combined) of soft tissue N and C for regular size oysters were 7.3%and 38.5%, respectively; and for shell N and C were 0.13%and 12.0%respectively. Our study extends the range of data on nutrient content of the eastern oyster to northern New England, and indicates that oyster size, seasonality, and nutrient concentration in ambient water potentially affect %N and %C content of oysters.

Six treatments were set including, C (control treatment without sea cucumber culturing), S (small individual treatment), B (big individual treatment), Sd (small individual treatment with high density), Ss (small individual treatment adding carbohydrate source) and Sb (small individual treatment adding effective microorganisms). A total of 27916-32236 optimized reads and 564742 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from each samples. The phylum Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria predominated, representing 69.0197.21% of the bacterial communities in the water samples. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that higher similarity was observed among S, Sd, Ss and Sb. The densities of TB and Vibrio in Ss were significantly higher than those in the other culture treatments after the 7th day. The concentrations of NH4-N, NO2-N, NO3-N and PO4-P in Ss and Sb were relatively lower than the other treatments. Conclusively, no deterioration was found in the water environment parameters during the 21-day culture period without water exchange, indicating that low-level water exchange protocol may be applied to the industrial aquaculture system. Based on the effects of different operations on culture system, industrial aquaculture is proved to be a viable way to rear sea cucumber.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				APR	2017	48	4					1787	1798		10.1111/are.13016								WOS:000396054700040

A 50-day study was conducted with juvenile (3.2 g) shrimp stocked in 16 800 L tanks at a stocking density of 250 shrimp m(-3). Control of total ammonia concentration was performed by the addition of combined mixtures of soybean and sugarcane molasses to the culture water. Three different molasses treatments were evaluated using different soybean-to-sugarcane molasses ratios: 15-85%, 38-62% and 60-40% respectively. The control group was treated only with sugarcane molasses. Water quality, chlorophyll a concentration, heterotrophic bacterial load, Vibrio spp. concentration and zootechnical indexes were all evaluated. Total ammonia concentration was controlled by heterotrophic and chemotrophic pathways. Biofloc formation, as quantified by measuring the total suspended solids, was not altered. The Vibrio spp. concentration showed a significant reduction in treatments with soybean-to-sugarcane molasses ratios of 38-62% and 60-40%. All combined mixtures of soybean and sugarcane molasses could maintain water quality and productivity in the superintensive culture of L. vannamei using the biofloc system. Thus, the potential use of a residue from agroindustry as a carbon source in a biofloc culture is demonstrated.																	1355-557X	1365-2109				APR	2017	48	4					1827	1835		10.1111/are.13020								WOS:000396054700043

The 2 X 3 experimental feeds were prepared with and without microwave irradiation of ingredients prior to pelleting with either a meat mincer, extruder or steam conditioner followed by a meat mincer. Five feedstuff ingredients, including fish meal, meat and bone meal, soybean meal, broken rice and rice bran, were irradiated separately at optimal times, according to the thirdorder polynomial regression analysis between in vitro digestibility and microwave irradiation times (r = 0.681-0.942, P < 0.001, n = 42). The prepared feeds were studied for chemical compositions and responses in fish growth performance and feed utilization efficiency. The fish (1.57 +/- 0.01 g initial weight) were fed ad libitum for 4 months. All proximate chemical compositions of experimental feeds, except protein, were influenced by microwave processing, pelleting methods or their interaction (P < 0.05). There were no significant effects from either parameter on water quality during the fish trial. Fish fed steamed microwave-irradiated feed, mechanically pelleted with a meat mincer, showed the highest growth performance (weight gain 18.91 +/- 0.73 g and specific growth rate 2.15 +/- 0.26% day(-1)) and feed utilization efficiency (feed conversion ratio 1.31 +/- 0.05 g feed g gain(-1) and protein efficiency ratio 2.27 +/- 0.08 g gain g protein(-1)) compared with the other dietary groups. These findings indicate that microwave irradiation of feed ingredients prior to steam conditioning followed by mincing can improve aquafeed production quality.

In the Gulf of Aqaba (GoA), coral reefs are considered the dominating ecosystem, while seagrass meadows, recognized worldwide as important ecosystems, have received little attention. Absence of comprehensive seagrass maps limits awareness, evaluations of associated ecosystem services, and implementation of conservation and management tools. 2. Presented here are the first detailed maps of seagrass meadows along the Israeli coast of the northern GoA. Mapping was performed by snorkelling along transects perpendicular to the shore above meadows growing at 15-25 m. Measurements along these transects included position, meadow depth and visual estimations of seagrass cover. Shallow boundaries of meadows, parallel to shore, were recorded by GPS tracking. Supplementary work included drop-camera boat surveys to determine the position of the deeper edge of meadows. In addition, GIS layers were created that indicated shoreline infrastructures, near-shore human activities and potential pollution threats. Ecosystem services of seagrass meadows mapped were valuated using a benefit transfer approach. 3. In total, 9.7 km of the 11 km shoreline were surveyed and 2830 data points collected. Seagrasses were growing along 7.5 km of the shoreline, with shallow (15-25 m) meadows found to cover an area of 707 000 m(2) and valued at more than US$ 2 000 000 yr(-1) in associated ecosystem services. Pilot drop-camera surveys (additional 283 data points) indicated that meadows can extend down to 50 m in some places. Coastal uses and threats varied in character and location. A municipality runoff point and drainage canal located close to the largest meadow were identified as the main threats to local seagrasses. 4. These low-cost methods enhance our understanding of seagrass distribution in the northern GoA. They demonstrate a GIS-based tool for assessing how environmental changes might affect the cover and state of seagrasses, improving efforts to conserve seagrass, and have particular relevance to seagrass mapping in developing countries and/or island nations.

Combining ex situ and in situ methods to improve water quality testing for the conservation of aquatic species	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Determining whether water quality is suitable is an important part of managing aquatic species for conservation, although it is often challenging to achieve. Past approaches have largely consisted of tests exposing individuals to artificial solutions, or field studies that examine the effect of a subset of water quality parameters on the distribution or abundance of a species. 2. Owing to the complex nature of water chemistry in natural systems, which is difficult to replicate using laboratory studies or to capture entirely with correlational field studies, these types of study may not be suitable for determining accurately whether or not water quality at a particular site is suitable for a target species. In situations where conservation outcomes rely heavily on achieving this, an alternative approach is therefore needed. 3. Embryos of the threatened green and golden bell frog Litoria aurea were placed in water collected from ponds that were used by this species for breeding and ponds where breeding was not detected at Sydney Olympic Park, Australia. After 19 days, the tadpoles were placed in enclosures in the same breeding and non- breeding ponds, and monitored until they metamorphosed. 4. There was no difference in tadpole survival, time to metamorphosis or body condition between the two treatments, indicating that poor water quality was not a cause of low pond occupancy by tadpoles at the site and resources should be directed towards investigating other potential causes. 5. We suggest that this method of an ex situ followed by an in situ exposure study is an effective approach to eliminating or confirming poor water quality as a cause of population declines and reduced occupancy, for species that are aquatic for at least part of their life cycle. Other applications include establishing that artificially created habitat provides suitable water chemistry, or identifying a potential location for a reintroduction project.

A.; Legendre, Pierre			Environmental factors structuring benthic primary producers at different spatial scales in the St. Lawrence River (Canada)	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The influence of environmental factors controlling the biomass of submerged aquatic macrophytes, cyanobacterial mats, and epiphyton was examined at three nested spatial scales within the St. Lawrence River: (1) along a 250-km-long upstream-downstream river stretch, (2) among three fluvial lakes located within that river stretch and (3) within each fluvial lake at sites located upstream, at the mouth, and downstream of the St. Lawrence River tributaries. Over its 250-km-long course, large increases of water colour (fivefold), suspended matter (tenfold), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (twofold) and dissolved N and P concentrations (2.5-fold) were observed in the St. Lawrence River, showing the cumulative effects of human activities on water quality. In contrast, biomass of submerged vascular macrophytes dropped tenfold along the sampled reach whereas biomass of epiphytes and cyanobacterial mats rose significantly. Biomass of the three benthic primary producers (PP) was explained (59 %) by the combined effects of conductivity, TP and spatial structure. Macrophyte biomass was related to changes in conductivity (+), biomass of epiphyton responded to DIN:TDP ratio (+) and light extinction coefficient (+) and cyanobacterial mats coincided with differences in DOC (+) and NH4 (+) (-). Within-lake structure was the most important spatial component for all benthic PP, suggesting that local effects, such as enrichment by the inflow of tributaries, rather than upstream-downstream gradients, determined the biomass of benthic PP. Our study shows that the sum of local tributary inflows exerts major overall pressures on benthic PP in the St. Lawrence River and that conversely, small-scale management of individual watersheds, can markedly improve local ecological condition of the river ecosystems.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2017	79	2					345	356		10.1007/s00027-016-0501-4								WOS:000397570900011

Seasonal shifts in the relative importance of local versus upstream sources of phosphorus to individual lakes in a chain	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Water quality in the Yahara chain of lakes in southern Wisconsin has been degraded significantly since European settlement of the region, primarily as a result of anthropogenic nutrient inputs. While all four main lakes (Mendota, Monona, Waubesa, and Kegonsa) have undergone eutrophication, elevated phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations are particularly pronounced in the smaller lakes at the bottom of the chain (Waubesa and Kegonsa). Due to their short water residence times (2-3 months), these lakes are more responsive to seasonal variability in magnitude and source of phosphorus loading compared with the larger upstream lakes. In 2014, more than 80 % of the phosphorus load to Lake Waubesa passed through the outlet of Lake Monona (situated immediately upstream). However, between mid-May and late October when phosphorus concentrations in Lake Monona were reduced as a result of thermal stratification the upstream load dropped to similar to 40 % of the total, with the majority of loading during this period coming from Lake Waubesa's local watershed. Correspondingly, seasonal phosphorus trends in Lake Waubesa during summer are correlated with precipitation, rather than phosphorus concentrations leaving upstream lakes. While phosphorus export from the local watersheds of Lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa is relatively small on an annual time scale, targeted loading reductions in these areas during the summertime will most effectively reduce summertime phosphorus concentrations in these fast-flushing lakes. Understanding the interaction of landscape position, water residence time, and mixing regime can help guide watershed management for water quality improvements in lake chains.

Changes in macroinvertebrate trophic structure along a land-use gradient within a lowland stream network	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Running waters are among the most threatened ecosystems globally, having altered hydrological regimes, homogenized habitat, and impaired water quality. These multiple stressors impact aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem function across space and time, although a clear mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we examined the trophic response of macroinvertebrates among streams in a Swiss lowland catchment encompassing a gradient of land uses. Clear compositional changes were observed as anthropogenic impacts increased from least-impacted to agricultural and urbanized sites. Taxonomic diversity was lowest at sites with morphological and water quality impairment (agricultural sites), whereas taxonomic identity (susceptible vs. generalist species) mainly changed due to water quality degradation (agricultural and urban sites) based on the SPEAR (pesticides) index. Using stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15), a simplification in macroinvertebrate trophic structure was evident along the land use gradient. At a site receiving wastewater treatment effluent, stable isotopes also revealed trophic shifts in primary consumers that corresponded to changes in available food resources. Results further showed that some taxa losses, e.g., the mayfly Ecdyonurus, to land- use effects may be due to low trophic plasticity. The combination of analyses, including stable isotopes, provided an improved mechanistic understanding of community and population responses to land-use changes along river networks.																	1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2017	79	2					407	418		10.1007/s00027-016-0506-z								WOS:000397570900016

Ecotoxicological assessments show sucralose and fluoxetine affect the aquatic plant, Lemna minor	AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCP) are prevalent in aquatic systems, yet the fate and impacts on aquatic plants needs quantification for many compounds. We measured and detected sucralose (an artificial sweetener), fluoxetine (an antidepressant), and other PPCP in the Portneuf River in Idaho, USA, where Lemna minor (an aquatic plant in the environment and used in ecotoxicology studies) naturally occurs. Sucralose was hypothesized to negatively affect photosynthesis and growth of L. minor because sucralose is a chlorinated molecule that may be toxic or unusable for plant metabolism. A priori hypotheses were not created for fluoxetine due to lack of previous studies examining its impacts on plants. We conducted laboratory ecotoxicological assessments for a large range of concentrations of sucralose and fluoxetine on L. minor physiology and photosynthetic function. Frond green leaf area, root length, growth rate, photosynthetic capacity, and plant carbon isotopic composition (discrimination relative to a standard; delta C-13) were measured among treatments ranging from 0 to 15000 nmol/L-sucralose and 0-323 nmol/L-fluoxetine. Contrary to our predictions, sucralose significantly increased green leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, and delta C-13 of L. minor at environmentally relevant concentrations. The increase of delta C-13 from sucralose amendments and an isotope-mixing model indicated substantial sucralose uptake and assimilation within the plant. Unlike humans who cannot break down and utilize sucralose, we documented that L. minor a mixotrophic plant can use sucralose as a sugar substitute to increase its green leaf area and photosynthetic capacity. Fluoxetine significantly decreased L. minor root growth, daily growth rate, and asexual reproduction at 323 nmol/L-fluoxetine; however, ambiguity remains regarding the mechanisms responsible and the applicability of these extreme concentrations unprecedented in the natural environment. To our knowledge, this was the first study to show aquatic plants can uptake and metabolize sucralose as a carbon source. This study further supports the common notion that L. minor can be useful in bioremediation of PPCP from wastewaters. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The physical and chemical parameters from a total of 192 water samples were tested using standard methods. Additionally, a total of 48 fish samples were analyzed for heavy metal concentrations. Mean values for basic water quality parameters of COD, PO4 (-3), NH3 (-)-N, and NO3 (-)-N exceeded Saudi standards in all seasons. Mean metal concentrations in water were consistently at their highest concentrations in samples collected during the summer, and the lowest in samples collected during the winter. Mean metal concentrations in fish muscle tissue exceeded Saudi standards for As and Cd, and United Nations FAO standards for Cr, Ni, Zn, Fe and Mn. Statistical analysis showed highly significant positive correlations between metal concentrations in water and metal concentrations in fish muscle for As-Fe, Pb-Cr, Pb-Ni, Cr-Cu, and Cu-Fe. This study highlights the urgent need for monitoring and controlling wastewater discharge in Wadi Hanifa to ensure public safety.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				APR	2017	98	4					525	533		10.1007/s00128-017-2048-z								WOS:000397494600014	28214941

In this study, the allelopathic effects of Myriophyllum aquaticum and its exudate on two typical bloom-forming cyanobacteria, Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena flos-aquae, were investigated under laboratory conditions. The growth of the cyanobacteria was strongly inhibited by live M. aquaticum while the primary addition of M. Aquaticum exudates had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of M. aeruginosa but not A. flos-aquae. The results suggested that the persistent release of allelochemicals from live M. aquaticum was needed to effectively constrain the growth of A. flos-aquae. Analysis of cyanobacterial physiological indexes indicated that M. aquaticum produced an inhibitory effect on SOD enzyme activity of A. flos-aquae, while it affected membrane lipid peroxidation in M. aeruginosa. The results show the potential of M. aquaticum to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms in coexistence systems.																	0007-4861	1432-0800				APR	2017	98	4					556	561		10.1007/s00128-017-2034-5								WOS:000397494600018	28184984

E.; Vetter, Tobias; Wang, Xiaoyan; Zhang, Xinxin			A comparison of changes in river runoff from multiple global and catchment-scale hydrological models under global warming scenarios of 1 degrees C, 2 degrees C and 3 degrees C	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We present one of the first climate change impact assessments on river runoff that utilises an ensemble of global hydrological models (Glob-HMs) and an ensemble of catchment-scale hydrological models (Cat-HMs), across multiple catchments: the upper Amazon, Darling, Ganges, Lena, upper Mississippi, upper Niger, Rhine and Tagus. Relative changes in simulated mean annual runoff (MAR) and four indicators of high and low extreme flows are compared between the two ensembles. The ensemble median values of changes in runoff with three different scenarios of global-mean warming (1, 2 and 3 degrees C above preindustrial levels) are generally similar between the two ensembles, although the ensemble spread is often larger for the Glob-HM ensemble. In addition the ensemble spread is normally larger than the difference between the two ensemble medians. Whilst we find compelling evidence for projected runoff changes for the Rhine (decrease), Tagus (decrease) and Lena (increase) with global warming, the sign and magnitude of change for the other catchments is unclear. Our model results highlight that for these three catchments in particular, global climate change mitigation, which limits global-mean temperature rise to below 2 degrees C above preindustrial levels, could avoid some of the hydrological hazards that could be seen with higher magnitudes of global warming.

J	Missaghi, S; Hondzo, M; Herb, W				Missaghi, Shahram; Hondzo, Miki; Herb, William			Prediction of lake water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and fish habitat under changing climate	CLIMATIC CHANGE												We applied a three-dimensional lake water quality model to investigate the influence of local meteorological conditions on fish habitat under one historical and two future climate change scenarios. Compared to the historical normal climate scenario, the averaged surface water temperature increases up to 4 degrees C and the dissolved oxygen concentration is 1 mg L-1 less during the ice-free seasons under the future climate scenarios. The stratification periods expand up to 23% (46 days), thermocline depths increase 49%, and the onset of anoxia occurs 4 weeks earlier under the future climate scenarios. The dissolved oxygen concentrations and water temperatures are used as the key water quality parameters to investigate the temporal and spatial variabilities of fish habitat. The good growth, restricted growth, and lethal habitats for the coolwater fish change up to 14% of the total lake volume. Compared to the historical normal climate scenario, on average, the lake total volume for good growth, restricted growth, and lethal habitat of coolwater fish change +16, -18, and +85%, respectively. The most significant (70%) changes in lethal habitat for coolwater fish occurs in the upper 5 m of the water column. During summer, a modest increase of lethal habitat for coolwater fish (8% of total lake volume) has a pronounced impact on the good growth habitat. The prediction of spatial locations and time periods of potential fish habitats during stressed or lethal environmental conditions is becoming increasingly important for managing fish habitats under changing climate.																	0165-0009	1573-1480				APR	2017	141	4					747	757		10.1007/s10584-017-1916-1								WOS:000396826200011

Potamogeton crispus L., a species of pondweed, is widely used in such restoration because it can be easily propagated through its turions. However, little is known so far of the growth characteristics of turions growing under limited light or even in total darkness. The growth and physiological responses of plants raised from small, medium, or large turions (categorized on the basis of their weight) and growing in total darkness in an aquarium showed that plants raised from small turions were significantly shorter (33.4 +/- 4.8 cm) than those grown from medium or large turions (49.9 +/- 4.3 cm and 46.9 +/- 7.4 cm, respectively; the difference between the two categories was not significant) when measured on the average of 48th, 62nd and 69th days after planting. Although the plant biomass was significantly different among the three groups of turions, it remained virtually the same within each group throughout. Plants raised from the three categories of turions, however, did not differ significantly either in terms of root length or with respect to soluble protein contents and peroxidase activity; the last parameter increased significantly after 48 days in all the three categories, whereas the activity of superoxide dismutase increased significantly after 62 days. These observations indicate that P. crispus plants growing in total darkness suffer from stress due to antioxidants, especially after 48 days of culture. Therefore, it is recommended that larger turions be chosen for planting and that suitable measures be taken to ensure that at least some light reaches the plants 48 days after planting. Three formulas are presented, depending on the level of turbidity and the weight of turions, to calculate the maximum water depth at which P. crispus could survive for restoration of P. crispus in eutrophic lakes.

During the last years brass materials used in drinking water systems have been under discussion because of the amount of the lead content and relevant migration into the drinking water. In Scandinavia the requirement for the use of dezincification resistant brass in drinking water installations is widely utilized and hence, CuZn36Pb2As (CW602N) brass alloy is the type of brass that is mostly installed. In this study, the use of non-dezincification resistant brass alloy CuZn40Pb2 (CW617N) in drinking water systems in Rauma, Finland is examined using real-life distribution network built in the office building Technology Center Sytytin. This brass alloy is accepted to use in fittings or ancillaries in contact with drinking water for example in Germany and in the Netherlands. The acceptance is based on metal leaching data from a long-term rig test (EN 15664-1), showing that the release of lead and other harmful metals is below the parametric values given in the EU's Drinking Water Directive. In this study the brass couplings manufactured from CuZn40Pb2 brass possess dezincification after five years of use in drinking water systems delivering water from Rauma water work. The main reason for the dezincification type of corrosion lies in the high sulfate and chloride concentrations as well as in low alkalinity. In this case the high concentrations of sulfate are mainly responsible of the dezincification of brass couplings. Typically, due to the aggressiveness of the water and consequent general corrosion from all brass materials, the drinking water quality is deteriorated by high dissolved concentrations of lead, copper and zinc. It is evident that CuZn40Pb2 brass cannot be used and demand for the use of dezincification resistant brass in water systems is extremely important in order to avoid expensive failures and problems caused by leakages.

Assessment of physicochemical characteristics of Ganga Canal water quality in Uttarakhand	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												Assessment of physicochemical parameters of Ganga Canal water was carried out during 2012-2013 at Haridwar (Uttarakhand) with two different sites, i.e., Bhimgoda Barrage (site 1-control site) and Bahadrabad (site 2-contaminated site), where canal water flows with loads of pollution from highly commercial and industrial areas. During investigation, maximum turbidity (287.72 +/- 56.28 JTU), total solids (1167.60 +/- 303.90 mg l(-1)), free CO2 (1.88 +/- 0.22 mg l(-1)), total hardness (60.14 +/- 1.13 mg l(-1)), pH (7.1 +/- 0.13), nitrate (0.048 +/- 0.010), nitrite (0.019 +/- 0.001), biochemical oxygen demand (2.866 +/- 1.098), chemical oxygen demand (6.8 +/- 2.61) and phosphate (0.087 +/- 0.015), while minimum velocity (1.71 +/- 0.19 ms(-1)), transparency (0.12 +/- 0.08 m) and dissolved oxygen (7.95 +/- 0.44 mg l(-1)) were recorded in monsoon season at site 2 in comparison with site 1. The mean values of these parameters were compared with WHO and ISI standards and found significant differences (p < 0.05) in the mean values of turbidity, total solids, pH, dissolved oxygen, free CO2 and total hardness with sampling sites. The turbidity of both the sites 1 and 2 was recorded above the permissible limit. Turbidity of site 2 is much higher than of site 1, so it is counted as more polluted. The values of the studied parameters were more during monsoon season and summer season at site 2 as compared to site 1. The results indicated that most of the physicochemical parameters from Ganga Canal system were within or at periphery in comparison with permissible limit of ISI and WHO for drinking water and therefore may be suitable for domestic purposes, but it requires perceptible consideration due to intense changes in climate and increase in pollution.

Diverse manganese(II)-oxidizing bacteria are prevalent in drinking water systems	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Manganese (Mn) oxides are highly reactive minerals that influence the speciation, mobility, bioavailability and toxicity of a wide variety of organic and inorganic compounds. Although Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria are known to catalyze the formation of Mn oxides, little is known about the organisms responsible for Mn oxidation in situ, especially in engineered environments. Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria are important in drinking water systems, including in biofiltration and water distribution systems. Here, we used cultivation dependent and independent approaches to investigate Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria in drinking water sources, a treatment plant and associated distribution system. We isolated 29 strains of Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria and found that highly similar 16S rRNA gene sequences were present in all culture-independent datasets and dominant in the studied drinking water treatment plant. These results highlight a potentially important role for Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria in drinking water systems, where biogenic Mn oxides may affect water quality in terms of aesthetic appearance, speciation of metals and oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds. Deciphering the ecology of these organisms and the factors that regulate their Mn(II)-oxidizing activity could yield important insights into how microbial communities influence the quality of drinking water.

EFFECT OF FE (III) ON PSEUDOKIRCHNERIELLA SUBCAPITATA AT CIRCUMNEUTRAL PH IN STANDARD LABORATORY TESTS IS EXPLAINED BY NUTRIENT SEQUESTRATION	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												The complex chemistry of iron (Fe) at circumneutral pH in oxygenated waters and the poor correlation between ecotoxicity results in laboratory and natural waters have led to regulatory approaches for iron based on field studies (US Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Criteria and European Union Water Framework Directive proposal for Fe). The results of the present study account for the observed differences between laboratory and field observations for Fe toxicity to algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Results from standard 72-h assays with Fe at pH 6.3 and pH 8 resulted in similar toxicity values measured as algal biomass, with 50% effect concentrations (EC50) of 3.28 mg/L and 4.95 mg/L total Fe(III), respectively. At the end of the 72-h exposure, however, dissolved Fe concentrations were lower than 30 mg/L for all test concentrations, making a direct toxic effect of dissolved iron on algae unlikely. Analysis of nutrient concentrations in the artificial test media detected phosphorus depletion in a dose-dependent manner that correlated well with algal toxicity. Subsequent experiments adding excess phosphorus after Fe precipitation eliminated the toxicity. These results strongly suggest that observed Fe(III) toxicity on algae in laboratory conditions is a secondary effect of phosphorous depletion.

J	Nugegoda, D; Kibria, G				Nugegoda, Dayanthi; Kibria, Golam			Effects of environmental chemicals on fish thyroid function: Implications for fisheries and aquaculture in Australia	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY												Numerous environmental stressors exert acute or chronic effects on the fish thyroid cascade. Such effects could be mediated via thyroidal alterations, imbalance of plasma T4 and T3 levels or damage to the structure of the thyroidal tissues (thyroid hypertrophy, hyperplasia). The thyroidal system is intricately linked to other endocrine systems in vertebrates including the control of reproduction. Disruption of fish thyroid function by environmental stressors has the potential to result in deleterious effects including the inhibition of sperm production, reduction in egg production, gonad development, ovarian growth, swimming activity, fertilisation and increase in larval mortality. Thyroid hormones play a major role in the development and growth of fish, particularly during their early life stages, thus, thyroid disruption by environmental stressors could inhibit the growth of fish larvae and juveniles in wild fish and cultured species, limit fish seed production and result in a decline in wild fisheries. This review highlights the effects of several environmental toxicants including PBDE, PCBs, PCDD and PCDF, PAH/oil, phthalates, metals, pesticides, mixed pollutants/chemicals, cyanide; and other stressors including acid (low pH) and ammonia, on fish thyroid function. Environmental sources of chemical stressors and appropriate water quality guidelines to protect the freshwater and marine species for the relevant pollutants are also discussed including (when available) the Australian guidelines (2000) and Canadian water quality guidelines (where Australian guidelines are not available). To date there has been no published research on the effects of anthropogenic environmental pollutants on the thyroid system of any native Australian fish species. However, the detection of high risk chemicals (notably PBDEs, PCBs, PAHs, metals and pesticides) in Australian waterways and Australian fish and shellfish implies that thyroid disruption of Australian wild fish and aquacultured species could occur. It is therefore imperative that the effects of such pollutants on the thyroid system of Australian native fish be investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Comparison of fast elimination of Cr(VI) by alumina nanofiber and alumina nanoporous	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The goal of this study is examination of the mixture between adsorption and permeation process for removing chromium (VI) from the water. Two types of supported membranes are developed: The first one which was made by sol-gel method is called nanoporous and the second one which was made by electrospinning is called nanofiber. The sorption capacity of nanoporous and nanofiber is examined in single batch experiments at various pH values, and it is found that maximum chromium removal is observed for both nanoporous and nanofiber at pH 3.5. Adsorption studies illustrated that the Cr(VI) adsorption onto alumina nanoporous and nanofiber is affected by changes in pH, contact time, dosage of adsorbent, concentration of chromium and solution volume. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms can be used to explain the adsorption equilibria of Cr(VI) onto alumina nanoporous and nanofiber. It was found that balance adsorption data adequate Langmuir isotherm more than Freundlich model. Adsorption kinetics was found to be fitted to pseudo-second order and Weber and Morris model. The output of multiple linear regressions was run for the second-order response surface model implied that the linear agents of pH, sorbent dosage and Cr(VI) concentration are more significant factors. Manufacturing electrospun alumina nanofiber and sol-gel nanoporous with these cheap materials, renewable and fast methods are so important although the removal percentage is significant.				javid, allahbakhsh/D-3379-2016													1735-1472	1735-2630				APR	2017	14	4					803	812		10.1007/s13762-016-1217-7								WOS:000397148700012

But, by using technology of remote sensing, integrated with information from the data of digital image and modeling technology for the simulation of water quality will provide easiness during the observation on the quality of water changes on the river surface.

Improved water quality, through a reduction in diffuse pollution from agricultural sources, is an expected benefit of agri-environment schemes, but this has yet to be demonstrated in practice. Here, we evaluate the impact of Welsh agri-environment schemes on water quality and freshwater ecosystem condition through a combined monitoring and modelling framework. 2. To determine the influence of the agri-environment schemes on ecosystem condition, spatially independent catchments dominated by a single scheme (>40% of catchment) were compared to control catchments dominated (>70%) by agricultural land that was not part of any scheme. Biological indicators of water quality were monitored at the outfall of each catchment and a spatially explicit modelling framework of diffuse pollutant emissions applied to each of the 80 catchments. 3. Direct comparison ( scheme/non-scheme) was unable to identify any significant effect of agri-environment scheme participation. However, derived biological indicators that reflected organic pollution, eutrophication and pesticide run-off were strongly correlated with modelled concentrations of corresponding diffuse pollutants, thus providing a ground-truth for the models. Scenarios that assessed the correct counterfactuals ( i.e. the influence of scheme entry on pollutant output) were developed for the whole of Wales. The models indicated an important effect of scheme entry on water quality, but this effect was not evenly distributed across the landscape. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that agri-environment schemes can deliver improvements in water quality, through a reduction in diffuse pollution from agricultural sources. However, it is not easy to demonstrate scheme effectiveness; the combination of field survey and modelling used here provides a framework for addressing these difficulties. A spatially targeted approach for agri-environment scheme options to protect water resources from diffuse pollution is likely to be most effective at delivering water quality improvements.

Nitrite toxicity in juvenile Goodeinae fishes Skiffia multipunctata (Pellegrin, 1901) and Goodea atripinnis (Jordan, 1880)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					15th European Congress of Ichthyology	SEP 07-11, 2015	Porto, PORTUGAL	Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res				Lethal concentration (LC50) and sub-lethal effects of NO2-N on the endemic viviparous fishes Skiffia multipunctata (Pellegrin, 1911) (SM; considered threatened under Mexican regulations) and Goodea atripinnis (Jordan, 1880) (GA; without conservation status) were determined. LC50/96hr values were 0.002 and 0.359mg NO2-N/L for SM and GA, respectively. Sub-lethal exposure resulted in swelling of the gill epithelium, hyperplasia, fusion of the primary and secondary lamellae, erythrocyte pyknosis, and aneurysms with respiratory stress responses at 0.0012 and 0.244mg NO2-N/L for SM and GA. The study demonstrates that sensitivity of both species is strongly related to the conservation status and acceptable nitrite concentrations, which are clearly below those permitted by the Mexican national water quality norm for wildlife preservation. Therefore, this norm is not adequate protection for these species, and where other threatened species may also be affected. Adequate criteria for nitrites in Mexican waters should include the data of all threatened endemic species.																	0175-8659	1439-0426				APR	2017	33	2					300	305		10.1111/jai.13292								WOS:000397476300022

Pretreatment of seawater is a major step in seawater desalination, which can mitigate problems with reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. No clearly superior pretreatment technology exists, due to the variation in input water quality, and furthermore, the pretreatment must be designed to be functional with input water quality characteristics that vary considerably over time. The objective of this work is to conduct technology assessment by applying a lissome version of HOQ matrix developed in a case study of dissolved air flotation (DAF) system, which is used as water pretreatment for RO desalination systems. The DAF system technology is compared with other pretreatment processes such as ultrafiltration, sedimentation, and granular media filtration. General analysis provides insight to decision makers to help them improve technologies so that they could meet specific demands. HOQ offers a comparative analysis and identifies specific characteristics that must be improved to develop the chosen technology. The HOQ provides a comprehensive analysis for decision making in management, showing that no pretreatment technologies present a superior performance vis-a-vis all customer attributes, however, it identifies the features of the system, to which efforts should be funneled. For DAF system, these are: water quality changes and energy consumption. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal and inter-annual variability of phytoplankton in central Lake Diefenbaker (Saskatchewan, Canada) proximal to a large commercial aquaculture farm	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, is a large reservoir (392 km(2)) with multiple end users, including a commercial aquaculture farm, which rely on sustainable water quality. Phytoplankton samples were taken monthly at upstream, aquaculture, and downstream locations during August 2008 to November 2011. The phytoplankton community was primarily diatoms and cryptophytes. Diatom biomass was correlated with greater mixing depth, while cryptophyte biomass was correlated with higher dissolved nutrients. Phytoplankton biomass was characterized by date, season and year, and this information was used to test spatial differences between upstream, farm and downstream locations. There was no significant difference in chlorophyte, chrysophyte or dinoflagellate biomass spatially. Upstream sites (US) had higher diatom biomass in the fall (US-DS = 329 mg/m(3)). Downstream sites (DS) had higher cryptophyte biomass in the summer (DS-US = 241 mg/m(3)) and higher cyanobacteria biomass in the fall (DS-US = 15 mg/m(3)). Spatial trends in diatoms, cryptophytes, and cyanobacteria between upstream and downstream locations were found to be significantly related to distance downstream, but failed to provide evidence of a fish farm effect. There was far greater inter-annual variability than spatial variability in phytoplankton biomass of Lake Diefenbaker, a lake prone to flooding and drought. For instance, flooding in 2011 resulted in elevated suspended solids, nutrient concentrations, and algal biomass (particularly cryptophytes and dinoflagellates) due to a La Nina winter. Flood inputs of suspended solids to Lake Diefenbaker favour low-light adapted taxa (e.g., Rhodomonas minuta Skuja) over potentially toxic cyanobacteria.

Ehsan; Berglund, Emily Zechman			Complex Adaptive Systems Framework to Simulate the Performance of Hydrant Flushing Rules and Broadcasts during a Water Distribution System Contamination Event	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												In the event that a contaminant is introduced to a water distribution system, utility managers must respond quickly to protect public health. Mitigation strategies specify response actions, such as warning consumers to reduce water activities using the news media and flushing contaminated water at hydrants. The performance of alternative response actions may be influenced by sociotechnical dynamics, as consumer reactions to contaminant exposure and information about the event can change water demands, hydraulics, propagation of a contaminant plume, and public health consequences. This research develops a modeling framework to test and evaluate mitigation decisions that a utility manager may take to protect public health over a wide range of contamination events. An agent-based modeling framework is developed to integrate social behaviors with technical artifacts in a sociotechnical model to evaluate the public health consequences of a water event. Social actors, including consumers and utility managers, are represented as agents and are coupled with a water distribution network model and a news media model to evaluate the performance of response strategies. Strategies for flushing hydrants are encoded as decision trees that specify the location and timing of hydrant flushing, based on the activation of water-quality sensors. The agent-based model is described using the Overview, Design, and Details protocol and is demonstrated for a virtual midsized municipality, Mesopolis. Results compare the effectiveness of flushing hydrants using cautious and adaptive response strategies and the use of the news media to disseminate warning messages. The framework can be applied for cities to evaluate alternative management strategies.

J	Tompalski, P; Coops, NC; White, JC; Wulder, MA; Yuill, A				Tompalski, Piotr; Coops, Nicholas C.; White, Joanne C.; Wulder, Michael A.; Yuill, Anna			Characterizing streams and riparian areas with airborne laser scanning data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The established position and increasing availability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) as an important source of information including forest inventory, allows additional applications to be developed when such data are already available. One key focus area for the application of ALS data is the assessment of riparian ecosystems, due to their critical role for providing, regulating and supporting important ecosystem services. ALS data provide detailed and accurate digital terrain models (DTMs) under forest canopy, which in turn enable the characterization of detailed stream networks, stream properties, and associated vegetation characteristics in adjacent riparian ecotones. In a complex Pacific Northwest coastal forest, we demonstrate how ALS point clouds can be used to map a stream network and characterize stream properties including stream order, width, gradient, sinuosity, and solar shading. Of relevance to regulatory and sustainability related elements of forest management, we demonstrate the use of these data to identify stream classes and related riparian zones, as well as the fish-bearing potential of the stream. The total length of identified streams was 6421.8 km, of which 55% were of the lowest order streams. The median stream gradient was 16.4% with median stream width varying between 0.58 and 19.67 m for the smallest to largest streams respectively. Stream class and fish bearing potential were evaluated using independent data, with overall accuracies of 61.0% for stream class and 82.9% for fish-bearing potential. The median of stand height, canopy cover, and stand vertical variability within riparian management areas was 19.8 m, 88.6%, and 68%, respectively, and in general did not vary across stream orders. The majority of streams (74.4%) were not accessible for anadromous fish. For fish-bearing streams, we found that only 0.2% had a mean stand height <2 m, while 2.4% had canopy cover of <20%, and only 7.3% received <10 h of shade. The ALS data thus enabled a holistic characterization of riparian ecotones, providing useful information on both stream and vegetation properties that can support sustainable forest management, inform on erosion risk, and become a foundation for the quantification of ecosystem goods and services.

In this paper we discuss current drop-in biofuel production technologies and assess relevant biofuel policies in the U.S., particularly those impacting forest biomass in Maine and the Northeast. In this context, we examine the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) policy and its definition of biomass which favors biomass from plantations regardless of actual ecological impacts on biodiversity, soil and water quality. We argue that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should consider revising the definition of biomass eligible for renewable fuel credits to include sustainably managed natural forests.																	1364-0321					APR	2017	70						729	735		10.1016/j.rser.2016.11.253								WOS:000396184900054

These blooms are difficult to predict, vary in appearance and toxicity, and can show significant spatial heterogeneity: wind-and current -borne scums can produce an order of magnitude range in toxin levels along shorelines. The growing demand for reliable, cost-effective and rapid methods to detect toxins in bloom material and reduce the risk of public exposure cannot be met by most analytical lab turnaround times. Commercial microcystin test kits are now available, but few have been rigorously field-tested or incorporated into monitoring programmes. Working with a local health agency, we evaluated two kits with different operative ranges of detection, applied to samples covering a wide range of water quality, sample matrices, and bloom composition. We compared their performance against lab analyses using Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent and Protein Phosphatase Inhibition assays. Both kits could resolve samples with high (< 10 mu g/L microcystin equivalents (MCequiv)) and low/no toxins, but failed to reliably detect toxin levels between 1 and 5 mu g/L, at which threshold there were few false negatives (8%) but -one third of the samples (32%) yielded false positives. We conclude that these kits are potentially useful for screening and informed risk management decisions e.g. on beach closures, but should be followed up with more rigorous tests where needed. We describe how, based on these results, the kits have been successfully incorporated into the routine municipal beach monitoring and advisory programme by the Hamilton Public Health Services (Ontario).

J	Julian, P				Julian, Paul, II			Assessment of Upper Taylor Slough water quality and implications for ecosystem management in Everglades National Park	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This study addresses water quality conditions across several distinct hydrologic regimes in the Upper Taylor Slough (UTS) region of Everglades National Park and briefly considers implications for long-term water quality management. Due to upstream changes in water delivery and construction of a detention area, Taylor Slough has experienced a significant change in hydrology over a 27-year period, progressing from direct discharge at varying amounts to sheet flow via groundwater conditions. Cumulative flow and rainfall relationships at the inflow and outflow of UTS demonstrate distinct break points. These changes in water delivery and subsequent upstream water management have resulted in a change in water quality conditions within the UTS region. Since 1986, total phosphorus (TP) flow-weighted mean concentrations exiting UTS have significantly decreased from 10 mu g/L in the late 1980s to 4 mu g/L or less since 2010. Based on analysis of surface water ion ratios, saltwater intrusion is unlikely and rather hyporheic exchange could be occurring between the inflow and outflow of the UTS region. Based on the analysis of existing water quality data, the UTS region is a resilient oligotrophic wetland system retaining strong assimilation capacity in the face of major management changes. While TP concentrations remain extremely low, restoration is not complete for Taylor Slough and adjacent coastal basins will inevitably bring additional nutrient loading. Management of the Slough should recognize this and consider what water quality condition is best for long-term sustainability of Taylor Slough's ecology.																	0923-4861	1572-9834				APR	2017	25	2					191	209		10.1007/s11273-016-9509-8								WOS:000398185800005

Nitrate, Total Ammonia, and Total Suspended Sediments Modeling for the Mobile River Watershed	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS												This paper presents details of a water quality model of the Mobile River watershed that estimates total suspended sediments at the outlet of the watershed. The model is capable of simulating Nitrate (NO3), Total Ammonia (TAM), and Total Suspended Sediments (TSS) for extended periods of time at a daily temporal resolution (1970-1995). The Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran is used for modeling the hydrological, nitrogenous constituents, and sediment processes. Based on the nutrient simulation and exploration of the effects of two management practices (filter strips and stream bank stabilization and fencing) on nutrient removal, the resulting sediment model is used to implement the most efficient nutrient management practice and explore its effects on TSS concentrations in the Mobile River. Results show that the implementation of the management practice "stream bank stabilization and fencing" to agricultural lands in sub-watersheds that had intense agricultural activities produced the highest reductions of NO3 concentration (up to 14.06%) and TAM concentrations (8.01%). Based on the nutrient simulation and identification of "stream bank stabilization and fencing" as the most efficient BMP for nutrient concentration reduction, the sediment model was used to explore its effects on TSS concentrations in the Mobile River. Implementing "stream bank stabilization and fencing" produced monthly median TSS concentration reductions ranging from 3.6% to 10.6% in the Mobile River.

Microbial indicators as a diagnostic tool for assessing water quality and climate stress in coral reef ecosystems	MARINE BIOLOGY												Microorganisms play a fundamental role in the functioning and stability of coral reef ecosystems. However, environmental disturbances can trigger alterations to the natural microbial community composition and their functional traits with potentially detrimental consequences for host organisms, such as corals, sponges and algae and concomitant implications for the entire coral reef ecosystem. Coral reefs are increasingly affected by localized impacts such as declining water quality and global pressures derived from human-induced climate change, which severely alters the natural conditions on reefs and can push dominating benthic life forms towards the limit of their resistance and resilience. Microorganisms can respond very rapidly to these altered environmental conditions so defining their natural variability over spatial and temporal gradients is critical for early and accurate identification of environmental disturbances. The rapid response of microbes to environmental change is likely to confer significant advantages over traditional reef monitoring methods, which are based on visual signs of health deterioration in benthic coral reef macroorganisms. This review discusses the potential of microbes as early warning indicators for environmental stress and coral reef health and proposes priorities for future research.

Replacement of fishmeal by vegetable meal mix in the diets of Litopenaeus vannamei reared in low-salinity biofloc system: effect on digestive enzymatic activity	AQUACULTURE NUTRITION												Biofloc (consortium of diverse microorganisms associated to suspending substrates) was developed from waste of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei postlarvae culture under low salinity (5 g L-1) to provide an additional nutritious biomass and reduce fishmeal inclusion in feeds in a 28-day indoor shrimp nursery trial conducted in 15 experimental containers (250 L stocked at 600 org m(-3)). Four experimental diets (isoproteic and isocaloric) containing different percentage of fishmeal: 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% substituted by vegetable meal mix (corn, sorghum and wheat) were formulated and elaborated. A control treatment consisted of a commercial feed. The main water quality parameters were monitored, and no significant differences were found among treatments. The growth and survival were similar among treatments. In general, digestive enzymatic activities showed differences being greater in the biofloc system compared with clear water. It was concluded that low-salinity shrimp nursery could be successfully developed with minimum inclusion of fishmeal in feeds, without significant effect on production response. The adjustment of C : N ratio allowed the increase of microbial biomass in the bioflocs, which contributed to maintain good water quality, provide live food and enhance digestive enzymatic activity of cultured organisms.

The aim of this research is to identify constituents of concern (COCs) in OSPW sourced from an active settling basin with the goal of providing a sound rational for developing mitigation strategies for using constructed treatment wetlands for COCs contained in OSPW. COCs were identified through several lines of evidence: 1) chemical and physical characterization of OSPW and comparisons with numeric water quality guidelines and toxicity endpoints, 2) measuring toxicity of OSPW using a taxonomic range of sentinel organisms (i.e. fish, aquatic invertebrates, and a macrophyte), 3) conducting process-based manipulations (PBMs) of OSPW to alter toxicity and inform treatment processes, and 4) discerning potential treatment pathways to mitigate ecological risks of OSPW based on identification of COCs, toxicological analyses, and PBM results. COCs identified in OSPW included organics (naphthenic acids [NAs], oil and grease [O/G]), metals/metalloids, and suspended solids. In terms of species sensitivities to undiluted OSPW, fish >= aquatic invertebrates > macrophytes. Bench-scale manipulations of the organic fractions of OSPW via PBMs (i.e. H2O2+UV254 and granular activated charcoal treatments) eliminated toxicity to Ceriodaphnia dubia (7-8 d), in terms of mortality and reproduction. Results from this study provide critical information to inform mitigation strategies using passive or semi-passive treatment processes (e.g., constructed treatment wetlands) to mitigate ecological risks of OSPW to aquatic organisms.

The environmental good is shared by the study countries, but the countries differ substantially in their income levels and other characteristics. We compare the performance of value transfers (with or without income elasticity of willingness to pay adjustments) and function transfers that include only core variables supported by economic theory. Our results point to a new source of uncertainty associated with function transfer choosing a particular functional form. Even if only theoretically relevant explanatory variables are used, the theory offers no insights with respect to a functional relationship of the dependence (e.g., linear, log-linear, exponential, polynomial). We show that while different functional forms may offer improvements in model fit, this does not necessarily translate to improvements in transfer errors or minimum tolerance levels. In our case, the value transfer with constant (unit) income elasticity adjustment, corresponding to the log-log functional relationship between willingness to pay and income, performs the best, Including additional explanatory variables or using other functional forms worsens the quality of transfers. Overall, our study questions the rationale for using more complicated function transfers in international benefit transfers, as the relationships observed within a country or a group of countries does not necessarily translate to dependencies between countries.

J	Mogaji, KA				Mogaji, K. A.			Development of AHPDST Vulnerability Indexing Model for Groundwater Vulnerability Assessment Using Hydrogeophysical Derived Parameters and GIS Application	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												Producing a bias-free vulnerability assessment map model is significantly needed for planning a scheme of ground-water quality protection. This study developed a GIS-based AHPDST vulnerability index model for producing groundwater vulnerability model map in the hard rock terrain, Nigeria by exploiting the potentials of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) data mining models. The acquired borehole and geophysical data in the study area were processed to derive five groundwater vulnerability conditioning factors (GVCFs), namely recharge rate, aquifer transmissivity, hydraulic conductivity, transverse resistance and longitudinal conductance. The produced GVCFs' thematic maps were multi-criterially analyzed by employing the mechanisms of AHP and DST models to determine the normalized weight (W) parameter for the GVCFs and mass function factors (MFFs) parameter for the GVCFs' thematic maps' class boundaries, respectively. Based on the application of the weighted linear average technique, the determined W and MFFs parameters were synthesized to develop groundwater vulnerability potential index (GVPI)-based AHPDST model algorithm. The developed model was applied to establish four GVPI mass/belief function indices. The estimates based on the applied GVPI belief function indices were processed in GIS environment to create prospective groundwater vulnerability potential index maps. The most representative of the resulting vulnerability maps (the GVPIBel map) was considered for producing the groundwater vulnerability potential zones (GVPZ) map for the area. The produced GVPZ map established 48 and 52% of the areal extent to be covered by the lows/moderate and highs vulnerable zones, respectively. The success and the prediction rates of the produced GVPZ map were determined using the relative operating characteristics technique to give 82.3 and 77.7%, respectively. The analyzed results reveal that the developed GVPI-based AHPDST model algorithm is capable of producing efficient groundwater vulnerability potential zones prediction map and characterizing the predicted zones uncertainty via the DST mechanism processes in the area. The produced GVPZ map in this study can be used by decision makers to formulate appropriate groundwater management strategies and the approach may be well opted in other hard rock regions of the world, especially in economically poor nations.																	0033-4553	1420-9136				APR	2017	174	4					1787	1813		10.1007/s00024-017-1499-9								WOS:000398042000017

In the last decades, this biodiversity hotspot has been severely endangered by poorly treated wastewater discharges from upstream urban communities arriving through its two major contributors, the Cigtiela and Guadiana rivers. In this work, we analysed the potential risk of this constant input of micropollutants (estrogens, dioxin-like compounds and other endocrine disruptors) for the resident wildlife. We sampled 12 locations in TDNP and in the nearby Navaseca Pond during 2013, and performed a series of in-vivo and in-vitro bioassays, including Daphnia magna post-exposure feeding inhibition and recombinant yeast-based assays for dioxin-like and estrogenic activities. These results were then compared with the chemical composition of the samples, analysed by GC-MS/MS and LC-MS/MS, and evaluated according to their toxic potential as toxic equivalents or TEQ, The Navaseca Pond, heavily impacted by wastewater from the town of Daimiel, showed the highest levels of toxic compounds, estrogenic activity, and Daphnia toxicity. Conversely, the less impacted TDNP sites showed low residue levels of contaminants, low estrogenicity and dioxin-like activity and negligible toxicity. The results indicates that the current good chemical status of TDNP is menaced by both the inflow of wastewater treatment plants effluents from Guadiana and Cigiiela rivers into TDNP tributaries and, as it occurs in the Navaseca Pond, by direct sewage discharges.

Multivariate statistical evaluation of dissolved trace elements and a water quality assessment in the middle reaches of Huaihe River, Anhui, China	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												A total of 211 water samples were collected from 53 key sampling points from 5-10th July 2013 at four different depths (0 m, 2 m, 4 m, 8 m) and at different sites in the Huaihe River, Anhui, China. These points monitored for 18 parameters (water temperature, pH, TN, TP, TOC, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Co, Cr, Cd, Mn, B, Fe, Al, Mg, and Ba). The spatial variability, contamination sources and health risk of trace elements as well as the river Water quality were investigated. Our results were compared with national (CSEPA) and international (WHO, USEPA) drinking water guidelines, revealing that Zn, Cd and Pb were the dominant pollutants in the water body. Application of different multivariate statistical approaches, including correlation matrix and factor/principal component analysis (FA/PCA), to assess the origins of the elements in the Huaihe River, identified three source types that accounted for 79.31% of the total variance. Anthropogenic activities were considered to contribute Much of the Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni, Co, and Mn via industrial waste, coal combustion, and vehicle exhaust; Ba, B, Cr and Cu were controlled by mixed anthropogenic and natural sources, and Mg, Fe and Al had natural origins from weathered rocks and crustal materials. Cluster analysis (CA) was used to classify the 53 sample points into three groups of water pollution, high pollution, moderate pollution, and low pollution, reflecting influences from tributaries, power plants and vehicle exhaust, and agricultural activities, respectively. The results of the water quality index (WO) indicate that Water in the Huaihe River is heavily polluted by trace elements, so approximately 96% of the water in the Huaihe River is unsuitable for drinking. A health risk assessment using the hazard quotient and index (HQ/HI) recommended by the USEPA suggests that Co, Cd and Pb in the river could cause non-carcinogenic harm to human health.

Assessing anthropogenic impacts on riverine ecosystems using nested partial least squares regression	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The results of three Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression models were used to gain a holistic view on the consequences of natural processes and anthropogenic pressures for water quality degradation and biodiversity decline in a multi-use watershed. The processes were soil erosion and wildfire risk; the pressures comprised land use conflicts, leachates from domestic and industrial waste, arable farming intensity and livestock density. Water quality was characterized for concentrations of nutrients (nitrate, phosphate), oxygen demands (Biochemical Oxygen Demand - BOD5, Chemical Oxygen Demand - COD) and various metals (e.g., As, Cr). Ecological integrity was assessed by the recently developed MELT (Multiple Ecological Level Index). In total, 18 variables were processed in the regression models. Two models were called "nested models" because they dealt with initial (pressures), intermediate (water quality) and final (MELI) environmental descriptors, used as dependent (MELI, quality) or independent (quality, pressures) variables. The third was called "bypass model" because it dealt solely with initial and final descriptors. Overall, the results of PLS regression linked the ineffective treatment of domestic sewage to water quality and ecological integrity declines in the studied watershed. Put another way, all models recurrently affirmed the major role of local factors, meaning of point source pollution, in determining the quality of stream water and the integrity of freshwater ecosystems. Sources of diffuse pollution were accounted for as contributing factors in the PLS regressions, but their influence was scarcely perceptible in the results. The poor treatment of domestic effluents is a public concern. In their strategic plans for mitigating this problem in the forthcoming years, administrative authorities are concentrated on management initiatives to improve the quality of provided services, instead of considering the construction of new wastewater treatment plants.

Sources and mechanisms of nitrate and orthophosphate transport in urban stormwater runoff from residential catchments	WATER RESEARCH												Nutrients export from residential catchments contributes to water quality impairment in urban water bodies. We investigated the concentrations, transport mechanisms, and sources of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and orthophosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) in urban stormwater runoff generated in residential catchments in Tampa Bay, Florida, United States. Street runoff samples, collected over 21 storm events, were supplemented with rainfall and roof runoff samples from six representative residential catchments. Samples were analyzed for N and P forms, N and oxygen (O) isotopes of nitrate (delta O-18-NO3- and delta N-15 -NO3-), and delta O-18 and hydrogen (delta D) isotopes of water (H2O). We found that the main NO3-N source in street runoff was atmospheric deposition (range: 35-64%), followed by chemical N fertilizers (range: 1 -39%), and soil and organic N (range: 7-33%), whereas PO4-P in the street runoff likely originated from erosion of soil particles and mineralization from organic materials (leaves, grass clippings). The variability in the sources and concentrations of NO3-N and PO4-P across catchments is attributed to different development designs and patterns, use of various fill materials during land development, and landscaping practices. This data can be useful to develop strategies to offset the impacts of urban development (e.g., designs and patterns resulting in variable impervious areas) and management (e.g., fertilizer use, landscaping practices) on NO3-N and PO4-P transport in urban residential catchments.

THM and HAA formation from NOM in raw and treated surface waters	WATER RESEARCH												The disinfection by-product (DBP) formation potential (FP) of natural organic matter (NOM) in surface water sources has been studied with reference to the key water quality determinants (WQPs) of UV absorption (UV254), colour, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. The data set used encompassed raw and treated water sampled over a 30-month period from 30 water treatment works (WTWs) across Scotland, all employing conventional clarification. Both trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HM) FPs were considered. In addition to the standard bulk WQDs, the DOC content was fractionated and analysed for the hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) fractions. Results were quantified in terms of the yield (dDBPFP/dWQD) and the linear regression coefficient R-2 of the yield trend. The NOM in the raw waters was found to comprise 30-84% (average 66%) of the more reactive HPO material, with this proportion falling to 18-63% (average 50%) in the treated water. Results suggested UV254 to be as good an indicator of DBPFP as DOC or HPO for the raw waters, with R-2 values ranging from 0.79 to 0.82 for THMs and from 0.71 to 0.73 for HAAs for these three determinants. For treated waters the corresponding values were significantly lower at 0.52-0.67 and 0.46-0.47 respectively, reflecting the lower HPO concentration and thus UV254 absorption and commensurately reduced precision due to the limit of detection of the analytical instrument. It is concluded that fractionation offers little benefit in attempting to discern or predict chlorinated carbonaceous DBP yield for the waters across the geographical region studied. UV254 offered an adequate estimate of DBPFP based on a mean yield of similar to 2600 and similar to 2800 mu g per cm(-1) absorbance for THMFP for the raw and treated waters respectively and similar to 3800 and similar to 2900 g cm(-1) for HAAFP, albeit with reduced precision for the treated waters.

Rapid gravity filtration operational performance assessment and diagnosis for preventative maintenance from on-line data	CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL												Rapid gravity filters, the final particulate barrier in many water treatment systems, are typically monitored using on-line turbidity, flow and head loss instrumentation. Current metrics for assessing filtration performance from on-line turbidity data were critically assessed and observed not to effectively and consistently summarise the important properties of a turbidity distribution and the associated water quality risk. In the absence of a consistent risk function for turbidity in treated water, using on-line turbidity as an indicative rather than a quantitative variable appears to be more practical. Best practice suggests that filtered water turbidity should be maintained below 0.1 NTU, at higher turbidity we can be less confident of an effective particle and pathogen barrier. Based on this simple distinction filtration performance has been described in terms of reliability and resilience by characterising the likelihood, frequency and duration of turbidity spikes greater than 0.1 NTU. This view of filtration performance is then used to frame operational diagnosis of unsatisfactory performance in terms of a machine learning classification problem. Through calculation of operationally relevant predictor variables and application of the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm the conditions associated with the greatest risk of poor filtration performance can be effectively modelled and communicated in operational terms. This provides a method for an evidence based decision support which can be used to efficiently manage individual pathogen barriers in a multi-barrier system. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have been studied for the removal of GSM and MIB. However, in this work, a photo-Fenton treatment was investigated for the first time for the degradation of GSM and MIB in both synthetic and Nak-Dong River water from DWTPs. Synthetic water-based experiments were performed to investigate the optimal operation conditions for the removal of GSM and MIB, and the effects of water quality parameters of the photo-Fenton process, including the Fe(II)/H2O2 concentra tion, reaction time, pH, organic matter, and initial concentration of GSM and MIB. Degradation intermediates of dehydration and ring-opening were obsetved during the photo-Fenton process. The optimal conditions were determined to be 2 mg/L Fe(II) and 20 mg/L H2O2 at pH 5 considering both efficiency and cost. The degradation efficiency was lower than that of DI water, mainly because of the pH (7.2-7.6). Nevertheless, the photo-Fenton process meets the guideline levels (20 ng/L) in South Korea when the initial concentration in the river water is below 50 ng/L. In addition, trihalomethanes (THMs) and microcystin-LR (MC-LR), derived from cyanobacterial blooms and another cause for concern, were degraded effectively using the photo-Fenton process on the river water.

Here, we configured five separate SWAT (US Department of Agriculture's Soil and Water Assessment Tool) models to assess load reduction strategies for the agriculturally dominated Maumee River watershed, the largest P source contributing to toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie. Although several potential pathways may achieve the target loads, our results show that any successful pathway will require large-scale implementation of multiple practices. For example, one successful pathway involved targeting 50% of row cropland that has the highest P loss in the watershed with a combination of three practices: subsurface application of P fertilizers, planting cereal rye as a winter cover crop, and installing buffer strips. Achieving these levels of implementation will require local, state/provincial, and federal agencies to collaborate with the private sector to set shared implementation goals and to demand innovation and honest assessments of water quality-related programs, policies, and partnerships.

Geochemical source of ions in surface and ground waters was examined to evaluate potential effects of sulfidic mineralization on water quality. The surface and groundwater samples were analyzed to determine the major ions (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-) and trace elements (such as As, B, Br). Water-rock interactions and evaporation defined as the key phenomena on groundwater chemistry using Gibbs diagram. Concentrations of arsenic (As) varied from 16 to 606 mu g/L, which was higher than the WHO (2011). Calculated ionic ratios revealed that anions and cations in surface and ground waters originated from partial leaching through ion exchange in alteration zones. We postulate that the primary source of As resulted from oxidation of As-bearing sulfide minerals such as orpiment, realgar and arsenopyrite in argillic-pyrite alteration zone. High pH (>8) could provide the alkalinity to increase sulfide oxidation and release As into the water. The stable isotope data (delta O-18 and delta H-2) indicated the origin of the waters, which is mainly meteoric precipitation with partial effects from evaporation processes and exchanging ions with surrounding rocks. This confirms the notion that the source of all analyzed ions including the toxic As is geogenic. Hydrogeochemical process, which affected the water chemistry and thus environmental public health are likely to be water-rock interactions and evaporation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A diverse geological and topographical set up along with the fast growing population and anthropogenic activities has created a need of groundwater quality assurance fir drinking and domestic water supply in the region. The major hydro-geochemical process and impacts Of anthropogenic activities can be deciphered using multivariate statistical analysis, conventional graphical plots and saturation indices. Groundwater samples were collected from 170 locations spread over entire region and were analysed for a total of 12 water quality physico-chemical parameters. It is observed that the groundwater is neutral to alkaline in nature with electrical conductivity (EC) value ranging from 460 to 8980 mu s/cm. Chemometric analysis was performed along with geochemical modeling. The 3 clusters obtained through HCA were clearly differentiated based on their chemical characteristics i.e. concentration of major ions. High concentration of nitrate (NO3-) and fluoride (F-) exceeding WHO standards was found in 29% and 27% of the water samples respectively. It is observed that semi-arid climatic conditions along with rock-Water interaction, weathering and ion-exchange are the major factors controlling groundwater quality in the region. Oversaturation of fluorite and gypsum has resulted into high concentration of F- in study area. It is found that the results from statistical and geochemical models compliment the findings using conventional plots and are able to decipher comprehensive geochemistry of groundwater in the region.

However, salt accumulation remains a main obstacle for causing severe water flux decline, fouling aggravation and inhibitory on the microbial activity. Here, we report a novel microfiltration (MF) assisted AnOMBR (AnMF-OMBR) for mitigating salt accumulation. The results indicated that the MF membrane effectively prevented salt accumulation in the bioreactor. The stable salinity level (within the range of 2.5-4.0 mS/cm) enabled the AnMF-OMBR to achieve a long-term continuous operation together with a higher methane production in comparison with a conventional AnOMBR. The forward osmosis (FO) permeate from the AnMF-OMBR had excellent water quality, while the MF permeate required further treatment (e.g., phosphorus precipitation and activated carbon adsorption) before its beneficial reuse. A thick fouling layer combining biofouling and inorganic scaling was existed on the FO membrane. Further confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed the dominance of polysaccharides and microorganisms over proteins. The current study demonstrated that the AnMF-OMBR can be a promising and sustainable wastewater treatment technology for its simultaneous energy recovery (in the form of biogas) and water reuse (from both FO and MF membranes).

The present work demonstrates the bactericidal effect of chloridized silver wires, where chloridization was achieved through chemical/electrochemical methods. The disinfection kinetics of uncoated and chloridized silver wires immersed in a 100 mL batch reactor were compared for one Gram positive and two Gram negative model bacterial strains, i.e., Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441 and Escherichia coli MTCC 443 and MTCC 739, respectively. Results showed that the chloridized silver wires could achieve better bactericidal effect compared to the uncoated silver wires. Initial cell concentration (N-0) had a significant influence on the time required for complete disinfection which increased by more than 60 fold as N-0 increased from 10(3) to 10(9) CFU/mL. The disinfection kinetics was correlated with release of silver ions from the chloridized surfaces and was affected by changes in water quality and presence of other constituents in water. High alkalinity showed minimal adverse effect whereas high values of hardness and natural organic matter had severe adverse effect on disinfection kinetics and silver release. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Permeability test revealed that HL membrane exhibited the highest permeability with 7.22 +/- 0.79 L/m(2) h bar of permeability constant followed by AG membrane with a permeability constant of 6.03 +/- 0.25 L/m(2) h bar. Less permeable membrane was DL with a permeability constant of 2.08 +/- 0.11 L/m(2) h bar. In terms of rejection performance, conductivity, salinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), color, divalent ions (Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42-) and monovalent ions (Na+, K+, Cl- and HCO3-) were rejected by HL membrane with an average rejection of 37.2 +/- 2.1%, 38.6 +/- 2.5%, 72.5 +/- 5.5%, 79.9 +/- 6.1%, 85.4 +/- 1.2%, 86.0 +/- 0.5%, 88.8 +/- 0.3%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 46.0 +/- 0.9%, 27.0 +/- 0.3% 17.9 +/- 1.1%, 64.3 +/- 2.8%, respectively. The respective rejections by DL membrane were 31.1 +/- 0.8%, 31.2 +/- 1.1%, 36.8 +/- 16.4%, 68.2 +/- 7.3%, 81.0 +/- 4.0%, 77.9 +/- 0.7%, 84.7 +/- 07%, 99.9 +/- 0.0%, 41.0 +/- 04%, 18.4 +/- 1.7%, 14.0 +/- 1.3%, and 45.2 +/- 2.7%. On the other hand, higher water quality was obtained with AG-BWRO membrane. AG-BWRO achieved conductivity, salinity, COD, TOC and color rejections of 96.8 +/- 0.2%, 96.9 +/- 0.1%, 74.7 +/- 2.8%, 90.5 +/- 4.8% and 87.6 +/- 1.9%, respectively. Divalent ions and monovalent ions were rejected by AG-BWRO membrane with an average rejection of higher than 94%. In conclusion, AG-BWRO membrane was found to be the best membrane considering both product water quality and quantity. DL membrane was found to be the worst one among the three membranes investigated in this work.

Multivariate analysis and GIS-based soil suitability diagnosis for sustainable intensive agriculture in Beni-Moussa irrigated subperimeter (Tadla plain, Morocco)	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												The aim of this study was to diagnose the agricultural land quality in Beni-Moussa irrigated subperimeter, Tadla plain (Morocco), and to evaluate that whether they are still suitable for sustainable intensive agriculture using GIS and physicochemical analyses. Eight quality indicators, namely soil depth, soil texture, pH, EC, CEC, OC, OM and slope, and were analyzed in 27 topsoil samples (0-20 cm) collected from the study zone at September 2009-2015. GIS approach was used to provide than indicator specific maps and to generate the land suitability for intensive agriculture. The results showed that about 1.69% (1324.38 ha) of studied area are classified in the class 'excellent suitable', 17.14% (13449.81 ha) in 'good suitable', 75.70% (59393.30 ha) in 'medium suitable' and 5.47% (4293.11 ha) in 'poor suitable' for sustainable intensive agriculture. These two latter land suitability classes needed some restrictions on agricultural practices and appropriate management to be of good sustainable productivity, without soil deterioration and negative effects on environment. The findings of this study are promising and can be used as a basis for the further scientific works, but they required new investigations and experts' opinions to evaluate and increase their accuracy.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				APR	2017	3	1							UNSP 3	10.1007/s40808-017-0272-5								WOS:000432216000003

The goal was achieved by comparing two R rs datasets: one from atmospherically corrected image from Operational Land Imager (OLI)/ Landsat-8 and the R rs surface created by non-deterministic statistical approach. The R rs used to create the surface was computed by using samples gathered out in situ on 13-16 October 2014, and the OLI image used was taken in the first day of fieldwork. A reference surface from in situ TSM concentrations was also created to compare the estimates from both datasets (from statistical approach and image atmospherically corrected). The TSM estimates were made using empirical model, and the results demonstrate that non-statistical methods provide lowest errors to estimate the TSM concentration if compared to atmospheric corrected images.																	2363-6203	2363-6211				APR	2017	3	1							UNSP 19	10.1007/s40808-017-0285-0								WOS:000432216000019

There are broadly two environmental menaces associated with these agricultural stresses, increase of non-point source pollution loads at the surface and instigation of problem of secondary salinity (SS). The present study is applied vertical electrical soundings with Schlumberger electrode configuration having maximum current electrodes separation 300 m to assess the potential of freshwater layer lying over the saline groundwater. Primarily, the collected earth's resistivities were converted to groundwater quality using groundwater electrical conductivity (EC) from exploratory wells drilled at regular interval in the entire Thal Doab. Secondly, based on these EC values, the study area is divided into three different tubewell suitability classes as high, moderate and low with interpreted EC values as less than 1.5 dS/m, between 1.5 and 2.5 dS/m and greater than 2.5 dS/m, respectively. The spatial distribution maps of these suitability classes are done at six depth zones (0-50, 50-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-250, 250-300 m). Results indicate that there is an inverse relationship between the surface water recharge and SS which should be used for both tubewell depth as well as site optimization and a check on their future growth rates. In this way the eco-friendly agricultural growth rates can be established in Tehsil Kot Adhu, Thal Doab, Pakistan and the other areas having similar hydrogeological conditions.

A hydrological modeling approach was used to identify the sensitive hydrological parameters of the basin through Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) technique. SUFI-2 was used for the calibration of SOIL WATER ASSESSMENT TOOL (SWAT) model. It was calibrated for period (1979-2000) including 3 years as warm up (1979-1982), subsequently model was validated on 11 years of datasets (2001-2011). The percentage of observation covered by the 95PPU (p-factor) and the average thickness of the 95PPU band divided by the standard deviation of the measured data (r-factor), were taken into an account for performance evaluation of model. In calibration and validation the p-factor and the r-factor was obtained as 0.54, 0.76 and 0.68, 0.56 respectively. The coefficient of determination (R-2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS) and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) have been used for goodness of fit between observation and final best simulation. The R-2, NSE, PBIAS and RSR are 0.74, 0.73, -3.55 and 0.54 respectively during the calibration whereas in validation period values are 0.75, 0.69, 18.55 and 0.56 respectively.

J	Kumar, PJS				Kumar, P. J. Sajil			Geostatistical modeling of fluoride enrichment and nitrate contamination in the groundwater of Lower Bhavani Basin in Tamil Nadu, India	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Contamination of groundwater is posing serious threat to the household and drinking water supply schemes all over the world. Increase in concentration of Fluoride (F-) and Nitrate (NO3-) in the groundwater is frequently reported from Indian subcontinent. In this paper, we have studied the F- and NO3- concentration in the Lower Bhavani Basin located in Tamil Nadu state in south India. This is a hard rock dominated semi-arid climatic region, where groundwater is the potential source of drinking and agricultural purposes. Among the total 36 groundwater samples, 22% showed a higher concentration than the permissible of Indian Standard 1.2 mg/L for fluoride. The influence of geochemical factors such as pH, conductivity and Na/Ca ratios were identified. On the other hand, 16% of the samples exceeded the permissible limit of nitrate (45 mg/L). The source of nitrate is identified preliminarily as fertilizer usage in the agricultural fields and secondarily from the sewages. Kriging based Geostatistical model were used the spatial variation mapping of these ions. For fluoride, spatial variation maps showed definite correlation with the Geological formations, i.e., the high fluoride samples were observed in the NE regions of the basin. In case of Nitrate, higher concentration was observed in the Southern part of the basin. Mapping of water quality parameters spatially is proved to be an effective tool for better visualization and management of the groundwater resources in the study area.					P.

J	Ding, SK; Chu, WH				Ding, Shunke; Chu, Wenhai			Recent advances in the analysis of nitrogenous disinfection by-products	TRENDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												The potential occurrence of nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs) in drinking water raises concerns because of their high genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and carcinogenicity compared to those of carbonaceous DBPs. To meet water quality indexes, drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) adopt a shift from chlorination to chloramination during disinfection to control the formation of regulated DBPs, namely trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids. Meanwhile, DWTPs exploit source waters, which contain natural organic matter with high organic nitrogen content, impacted by algal blooms or municipal wastewater effluents to couple with the increasing water demands. However, these changes can result in the increase in the amounts of certain N-DBPs for the incomplete removal of organic nitrogen content and the addition of inorganic nitrogen content. To study the occurrence, formation, and control of N-DBPs, fundamental analysis techniques are indispensable for identifying and quantifying DBPs and their precursors (formation potential) in lab and real water samples. The analytical determination and quantification of DBPs mainly involve three steps, which are pre-treatment, compound separation by chromatography, and identification by detectors. In this paper, we provide a short review and summary of pre-treatment and analytical methods used in the determination of four types of frequently detected N-DBPs, namely halonitromethanes, haloacetonitriles, haloacetamides, and N-nitrosamines. In addition, the analytical methods for other emerging N-DBPs are also covered in this review.

J	Ma, J				Ma, Jian			Determination of chemical oxygen demand in aqueous samples with non-electrochemical methods	TRENDS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												Water contamination is a globally important environmental concern, with chemical oxygen demand ( COD) being a criteria in water quality assessment, providing information on the availability of chemically degradable fractions of organic pollutants. However, the standard method for COD analysis is time-consuming and results may vary between laboratories. Efforts to resolve these problems have mostly focussed on improvements to both digestion and detection techniques and this review addresses recent trends in the determination of COD in aqueous samples, based on published literature since 2000. The features of principal methods are critically reviewed, focusing on their practical applicability. This review includes an overview of: 1) standard methods; 2) novel digestion techniques; 3) varying detection methods, such as chemiluminescence, spectrophotometry and others; 4) and future trends in COD measurements. Electrochemical techniques are excluded, as despite their importance as an environmental friendly alternative for COD measurement, these methods have only recently been developed and require a full and separate review.																	2214-1588					APR	2017	14						37	43		10.1016/j.teac.2017.05.002								WOS:000429882600004

The events resulted in regime shifts cascading through all trophic levels, disturbing ecosystem functioning and damaging the water environment. Causal pathways by which the external (hydroclimate, overfishing) and internal (food web interactions) drivers provoke regime shifts are investigated. Statistical data analyses supported by an interpretative framework based on hierarchical ecosystem theory revealed mechanisms of hierarchical incorporation of environmental factors into the ecosystem. Evidence links Atlantic teleconnections to Black Sea hydroclimate, which together with fishing shapes variability in fish stocks. The hydroclimatic signal is conveyed through the food web via changes in productivity at all levels, to planktivorous fish. Fluctuating fish abundance is believed to induce a lagged change in competitor jelly plankton that cascades down to phytoplankton and influences water quality. Deprived of the stabilising role of apex predators, the Black Sea's hierarchical ecosystem organisation is susceptible to both environmental and anthropogenic stresses, and increased fishing makes fish stock collapses highly probable. When declining stocks are confronted with burgeoning fishing effort associated with the inability of fishery managers and decision-makers to adapt rapidly to changes in fish abundance, there is overfishing and stock collapse. Management procedures are ineffective at handling complex phenomena such as ecosystem regime shifts because of the shortage of suitable explanatory models. The proposed concepts and models reported here relate the hydroclimate, overfishing and invasive species to shifts in ecosystem functioning and water quality, unravelling issues such as the causality of ecosystem interactions and mechanisms and offering potential for finding ways to reverse regime shifts. We advocate a management approach aiming at restoring ecosystem hierarchy that might mitigate the costly consequences of regime shifts.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				APR	2017	23	4					1486	1498		10.1111/gcb.13508								WOS:000396836800011	27643946

Identification of critical contaminants in wastewater effluent for managed aquifer recharge	CHEMOSPHERE												Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) using highly treated effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plants has been recognized as a promising strategy for indirect potable water reuse. Treated wastewater effluent can contain a number of residual contaminants that could have adverse effects on human health, and some jurisdictions have regulations in place to govern these. For those that do not, but where reuse may be under consideration, it is of crucial importance to develop a strategy for identifying priority contaminants, which can then be used to understand the water treatment technologies that might be required. In this study, a multi-criteria approach to identify critical contaminants in wastewater effluent for MAR was developed and applied using a case study site located in southern Ontario, Canada. An important aspect of this approach was the selection of representative compounds for each group of contaminants, based on potential for occurrence in wastewater and expected health or environmental impacts. Due to a lack of MAR regulations in Canada, the study first proposed potential recharge water quality targets. Predominant contaminants, potential additional contaminants, and potential emerging contaminants, which together comprise critical contaminants for MAR with reclaimed water, were then selected based on the case study wastewater effluent monitoring data and literature data. This paper proposes an approach for critical contaminant selection, which will be helpful to guide future implementation of MAR projects using wastewater treatment plant effluents.

Spatiotemporal change of phosphorous speciation and concentration in stormwater in the St. Lucie Estuary watershed, South Florida	CHEMOSPHERE												Phosphorous (P) concentration in stormwater runoff varies at different spatial and temporal scales. Excessive P loading from agriculture system into the St. Lucie Estuary (SLE) contributed to water quality deterioration in southern Indian River Lagoon. This study examines the spatial and temporal shifts of different P forms in runoff and storm water under different land use, water management, and rainfall conditions. Storm water samplings were conducted monthly between April 2013 and December 2014 in typical farmland and along the waterway (Canal C-24) that connects lands to the SLE. Concentrations of different P forms and related water quality variables were measured. Approximately 89% of the collected water samples contained total P (17) concentrations exceeding the total maximum daily load (TMDL) level (0.081 mg L-1). Concentrations of different P forms declined from agricultural field furrows to the canal and then increased from the upstream to the downstream in the canal where urban activities dominated land use. Total dissolved P (TDP) was the predominant form of TP, followed by PO4-P. Speciation and concentrations of P varied with sites and sampling times, but were significantly higher in the summer months (from June to September) than in the winter. Water pH explained similar to 20% of TP variation. Spatiotemporal variations of P concentrations and compositions provide a data-based guide for development of best management practices (BMPs) to minimize P export from the SLE watershed.

Field-based application of developed solid phase extraction with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for vanadium speciation analysis of groundwaters from Argentina	TALANTA												High levels of vanadium have been reported in groundwater ( < 0.05-5300 mu g L-1 V) from different parts of Argentina, yet no detailed study of vanadium speciation has been performed. A highly selective strong anion exchange - solid phase extraction (SAX-SPE) method was used (in -situ) for vanadium speciation analysis of groundwater samples from La Pampa - LP (General San Martin and Eduardo Castex) and Buenos Aires - BA (San German) provinces in Argentina. In this method both vanadyl (V-Iv) and vanadate (V-v) were trapped by the complexation with disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid on a pre-conditioned SAX cartridge. In the laboratory, vanadium species were separated at different eluent pH levels. V-IV was eluted at pH 4 using methanol and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. V-v was eluted at pH 8 using dihydrogen ammonium phosphate. The eluted species were analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). This method was validated using an inter-analytical method comparison with HPLC-ICP-MS. A Paired t -test revealed that there was no significant difference (probability, P < 0.05) between the two methods. V-v was found to be predominate species in both sample collection areas (LP: 69 - 100%, BA: 33 - 89% of species) over the range of 158.0 - 4748.0 mu g L-1 in LP and 88.5 - 504.0 mu g L-1 in BA. Vlv was found at higher levels (29.0-301.0 mu g L-1) in Buenos Aires compared to General San Martin groundwater (4.4 - 161.0 mu g L-1). The results enhance the potential knowledge of the speciation of vanadium in terms of water quality and human health.																	0039-9140	1873-3573				APR 1	2017	165						391	397		10.1016/j.talanta.2016.12.078								WOS:000394064700056	28153273					
J	Chen, J; Zhu, WN; Tian, YQ; Yu, Q				Chen, Jiang; Zhu, Wei-Ning; Tian, Yong Q.; Yu, Qian			Estimation of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter From Landsat-8 Imagery for Complex Inland Water: Case Study of Lake Huron	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Spectral reflectance data, including irradiance reflectance (R-t) and remote sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficients a(CDOM)(440), were collected in the Saginaw River and Kawkawlin River plume regions of Lake Huron. We developed an empirical band ratio algorithm to derive a(CDOM)(440) that could be directly applicable to Landsat-8 imagery. A model ranking method is used to determine the best band ratios as well as their empirical functions. One problem of previous CDOM estimations from Landsat imagery is that they usually use R-t or R-t/pi rather than the real R-rs as the input data, but as a result of our study, algorithms derived using R-rs performed much better than using R-t. The green/red band ratio gave the best accuracies by fitting with power and exponential models (power model: R-2 = 0.819 and RMSE = 0.889 m(-1) and exponential model: R-2 = 0.829 and RMSE = 0.863 m(-1)). The power and exponential models were further validated using an independent data group, achieving excellent results with the RMSE of 0.642 and 0.504 m(-1), respectively. The application of the exponential model a(CDOM)(440) = 40.75e(-2.463x), x = R-rs(B3)/R-rs(B4) on two Landsat-8 images demonstrated that estimating CDOM from to Landsat-8 imagery has potential applications for monitoring water quality in long term and large scale.

J	Shi, P; Zhang, Y; Li, ZB; Li, P; Xu, GC				Shi, Peng; Zhang, Yan; Li, Zhanbin; Li, Peng; Xu, Guoce			Influence of land use and land cover patterns on seasonal water quality at multi-spatial scales	CATENA												The influence of land use patterns on stream water quality is scale-dependent in space and time. Understanding the relationship between landscape characteristics and water quality is of great importance to improve water contamination prediction in unmonitored watersheds and for providing guidelines for watershed land use planning. In this study, five water sampling sites in the upper Dan River basin were established to monitor seasonal water chemical contamination over the period of 2000 to 2008. The relationships between land use patterns and water quality were analyzed across multiple-scales using redundancy analysis. The results showed that stream water quality variables displayed highly temporal variations, with electrical conductivity (EC), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and total suspended solids (TSS) all generally displaying higher levels in the wet season, while there were higher concentrations of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), and dissolved oxygen (DO) in the dry season. The total contribution of land use patterns on overall water quality was stronger at the riparian scale than at the catchment and reach scales during the wet season. However, different land use metrics had different scale effects. Urban land had a higher positive relationship with degraded water quality at small scales than at large scales, whereas agricultural land displayed the opposite scale effects. Forest and grassland explained more water quality variations at the riparian scale than at other scales. Analyses of spatial development patterns suggested that size, density, aggregation, and diversity of landscape patterns were important factors impacting on stream water quality. The results provide important information regarding sustainable land use and landscape planning at multiple-scales that can be used to improve water quality. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Assortment and spatiotemporal analysis of surface water quality using cluster and discriminant analyses	CATENA												In this study, cluster analysis (CA) and discriminant analysis (DA) were used to assess the water quality and evaluate its spatial and temporal variations in South Florida. For this purpose, 15 years (2000-2014) data set of 12 water quality variables covering 16 monitoring stations, and about 35,000 observations were used. Agglomerative hierarchical CA grouped 16 monitoring sites into three groups (low pollution, moderate pollution, and high pollution) based on their similarity of water quality characteristics. DA, as an important data reduction method, and CA were used to assess the water pollution status and analysis of its spatiotemporal variation. It was found by the stepwise DA that five variables (chI-a, DO, TKN, TP and water temperature) were the most important discriminating water quality parameters responsible for temporal variations. In spatial DA, the stepwise mode identified seven variables (chl-a, DO, TKN, TP, magnesium, chloride, and sodium) and six variables (DO, TKN, TP, turbidity, magnesium, and chloride) as the most important discriminating variables responsible for spatial variations in wet and dry seasons, respectively. Different patterns associated with spatial variations were identified depending on the variables and considered season, however the overall trend of environment pollution problems was found from the low pollution (LP) region to high pollution (HP) region. It is believed that the results of this study could be very useful to the local authorities for the control and management of pollution and better protection of important riverine water quality.

J	Jin, YX; Lee, H; Jin, YO; Hong, S				Jin, Yongxun; Lee, Hyunkyung; Jin, Yang Oh; Hong, Seungkwan			Application of multiple modified fouling index (MFI) measurements at full-scale SWRO plant	DESALINATION												Recently, a modified fouling index (MFI) is published on ASTM, and thus, is expected to become a standard method for evaluating fouling potential, as a supplement to silt density index (SDI). Employing membranes with smaller pore size in MFI measurements has been continuously suggested in many previous studies. However, there was a lack of practical studies verifying the usefulness of MFI. In this study, the applicability of multiple MFIs (i.e., MFI0.45, MFI-UF100 (kDa) and MFI-UP10 (kDa)) were evaluated at a full-scale UF/RO seawater desalination plant located in the Middle East. For a year, MFIs were measured with RO feed water and the results were correlated with increments in differential pressure (DP) of RO process. Regression analysis was conducted in order to find out whether the fouling index could predict RO performance deterioration. The observed MFIs clearly showed correlation with DP variation, while SDI and water quality parameters (e.g. turbidity and UV254) exhibited relatively low accordance. Particularly, MFI-UF100 (kDa) was the most sensitive, indicating that colloidal fouling is the main cause of fouling in SWRO desalination. The regression results were reconfirmed through specific events where feed water quality was severely changed due to red tide or ship movement at intake. These events provided unconventional feed water characteristics, but similar trend was observed that MFI-UF100 (kDa) was most sensitive. The application of MFI in an actual plant provided valuable contribution for the further advancement of MFI measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Yang, H; Zhan, ZL; Yao, YX; Sun, ZY				Yang, Hui; Zhan, Zhonglai; Yao, Yuexin; Sun, Zhengyang			Influence of gravity-induced brine drainage on seawater ice desalination	DESALINATION												Experimental platform that can use cold energy of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to freeze seawater was designed and installed in laboratory. Freezing, gravity-driven and centrifugal desalination (FGCD) technologies were combined in the experitnents. Seawater taken from Bohai Bay was frozen and then the seawater ice samples were placed in ambient temperature to melt gradually with the brine drained induced by gravity. The gravity-induced brine drainage proportion for each sample was different because the melting time was not the same. Then the remaining ice was centrifuged for further brine removal. The influences of the gravity driven brine drainage on the gravity-induced salt removal efficiency, the overall salt removal efficiency after FGCD process and the ice yield rate were quantified. The results showed that the maximum Cl- removal efficiency can be >99% and the Cl concentration of the produced ice can meet the requirement of the standards for drinking water quality. Whereas the salt removal efficiency was negatively correlated with the ice yield rate: the more the ice yield, the lower the salt removal efficiency and vice versa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Particulate matter was collected from an adjacent parking lot and from a nearby parking garage as examples of weathered and un-weathered particulate matter. Particle size distributions were similar, but metal content was 3-35-fold higher and organic matter content was 3-fold higher in the parking garage particulate matter compared to the parking lot particulate matter. Replicate columns were established with either no particulate added as the control, or 20 g of parking lot or parking garage particulate matter. Synthetic rainwater was passed through the columns at variable rainfall intensity or fixed intensity to assess leaching. Metals were leached at higher concentrations from the parking garage particulate amended column, but from all columns less than 1% of the metal mass leached. Rainfall intensity did not have a large effect on leached metal concentrations, only varying effluent by about 2-fold. Synthetic stormwater with elevated dissolved Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb concentrations was passed through the same columns and metal removal efficiencies were on the order of 85-95%, 30 95%, 60-90%, and 95+% for each metal, respectively. After loading the column with a year's worth of stormwater metal exposure, removal efficiencies in the no particulate and parking lot particulate amended columns decreased, while parking garage particulate amended columns performed similarly with a small drop in Cu and Pb removal efficiencies. Generally, columns with no particulate and parking lot particulate amendments performed similarly, suggesting the pervious concrete is responsible for the majority of the initial metal retention. The parking garage particulate amended columns retained more metals from stormwater, perhaps due to an increase in that promoted surface precipitation as hydroxides or carbonate species on the pervious concrete, or due to complexation in the higher concentrations of organic matter and iron oxides in the particulate matter. Overall, metal retention was aided by the presence of organic matter in the particulate matter, but the pervious concrete itself was more important than particulates for metal retention. A strategy to increase metal retention and removal from the environment could involve amending pervious concrete with mixtures of well-defined sorbents to enhance metal retention.

This paper aims at developing an innovative methodology for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation. A total of eight criteria have been used for sustainability assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation in this study, and they are capital cost, detection and analysis costs, and operation and maintenance costs in economic aspects, effect of secondary pollution environmental aspect, effectiveness for water quality improvement and time for remediation in technological aspect, the effect on public health in social aspect, and policy support belonging to political aspect. The relative priorities of the alternative technologies with respect to each criterion were scored by Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and it was also employed to calculate the weights of the criteria. After determining the decision-making matrix,ELECTRE was employed to rank the alternatives according to their sustainability performances. An illustrative case has been studied by the proposed method, monitored natural attenuation (MNA) has been recognized as the most sustainable technology for groundwater remediation, followed by pump-treat (1382T) technology, permeable reactive barriers (PRB) and air sparing (AS). Finally, Sensitivity analysis was also carried out to test the robustness of the results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

An MILP model for optimizing water exchanges in eco-industrial parks considering water quality	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING												Unlike other resources that may come in multiple energy forms, there is no substitute for freshwater. Therefore, Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs) have been designed to encourage interplant water exchange networks in order to minimize the consumption of freshwater as well as the generation of wastewater. This study proposes a model that simultaneously minimizes the economic and the environmental objective functions of an EIP through goal programming. The economic costs considered integrates the necessary piping and operating costs together with the freshwater, wastewater, and treatment costs, while the environmental impact considered the volume and the quality of the water used and released by the EIP. Results showed that the considering water volume and quality in minimizing the environmental impact gave better results than considering water volume only. Economic costs and environmental impacts were also found to be dependent on the priorities given to each goal, as well as the treatment quality of the processes.

Validation of MODIS and VIIRS derived aerosol optical depth over complex coastal waters	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												In this study, the,Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) was applied to both MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suits (VIIRS) images to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) over water for blue, green and red wavelengths at 500 m (MODISSARA) and 750 m (VIIRSSARA) resolutions, respectively. Retrievals were compared with the Terra-MODIS Dark Target (DT) AOD at 3 km resolution (MODIS3K) and the VIIRS Environmental Data Record (VIIRSEDR) AOD at 6 km resolution, Validation was conducted using 86 Microtops II Sun photometer AOD measurements collected over different classes of water quality (low to high sediment levels) for seven days (6, 8, 9,13, and 15, 16 and 17 October 2014) between 10:00 to 15:00 local time. Thirty-eight to fifty percent and 44-54% of the MODIS3K and the VIIRSEDR AOD retrievals respectively, fall within the expected error (EE) with root mean square error from 0.12 to 0.14 and mean absolute error from 0.10 to 0.11. The MODISSARA and the VIIRSSARA AOD retrievals are well correlated with the ground-based measurements (R: MODISSARA = 0.86-0.89 and VIIRSSARA = 0.85-0.94), with a larger number of retrievals falling within the EE MODISSARA = 73-77% and VIIRSSARA = 71,82%) than MODIS3K and VIIRSEDR. The results indicate that the SARA algorithm is more robust than MODIS3K and VIIRSEDR global AOD products, and can retrieve accurate AOD over low to highly sedimented water surfaces, similar to good AOD retrievals over land.

Management of estuarine beaches on the Amazon coast though the application of recreational carrying capacity indices	TOURISM MANAGEMENT												The purpose of this paper is to determine the Recreational Carrying Capacity of three estuarine beaches (Colares, Marucla and Murubira) on the Amazon coast of Brazil, based on the combined assessment of natural conditions and visitor facilities. In the final analysis, the carrying capacity of Colares beach was estimated to be 1089 visitors per day, and that of Murubira beach, 238 visitors per day. At Marucla beach, however, the inadequate quality of the water resulted in an RCC of zero, indicating that the beach should not be visited for recreational use. The results of this study may provide a valuable diagnostic tool for the development of future state and municipal coastal management programs. We believe that the procedures adopted in this study are applicable to other estuarine beaches on the Amazon coast, as well as in other estuarine beaches elsewhere with similar natural characteristics.

Waldo			Using integrated, ecosystem-level management to address intensifying ocean acidification and hypoxia in the California Current large marine ecosystem	ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE												Ocean acidification is intensifying and hypoxia is projected to expand in the California Current large marine ecosystem as a result of processes associated with the global emission of CO2. Observed changes in the California Current outpace those in many other areas of the ocean, underscoring the pressing need to adopt management approaches that can accommodate uncertainty and the complicated dynamics forced by accelerating change. We argue that changes occurring in the California Current large marine ecosystem provide opportunities and incentives to adopt an integrated, systems-level approach to resource management to preserve existing ecosystem services and forestall abrupt change. Practical options already exist to maximize the benefits of management actions and ameliorate impending change in the California Current, for instance, adding ocean acidification and hypoxia to design criteria for marine protected areas, including consideration of ocean acidification and hypoxia in fisheries management decisions, and fully enforcing existing laws and regulations that govern water quality and land use and development.																	2325-1026					MAR 31	2017	5									10.1525/elementa.198								WOS:000397956400001

Without any pre-treatment but only with the simple filter, water samples passed through preconditioned COOH-PAN NFsM, which integrated extraction, purification and concentration into one single step, and the eluent was directly analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). Under the optimized conditions, the target analytes in 10 mL of water sample could be completely extracted by only 4 mg of COOH-PAN NFsM, and easily eluted using 400 ILL of methanol, indicating a high efficiency in both adsorption and desorption. Satisfactory linearity was achieved in the range of 0.4-40.0 ng mL(-1) for DIA, and 0.3-40.0 ng mL(-1) for DEA and ATZ. The limit of detection (LODs) were 0.12, 0.09 and 0.09 ng mL-1 for DIA, DEA and ATZ, respectively. The recoveries ranged from 81.35 to 120.32%, with the intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations of 4.03-9.81% even after the 6-cycle usage of NFsM. And, using just 10 mL loading sample, the LOD had already satisfied the demand of surface water quality monitoring levels, revealing the good sensitivity of the proposed method.

Multispectral images were acquired from a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) while concomitant measurements of gas exchange, plant water status, leaf structural traits and chlorophyll were taken in a commercial farm located in southeast Spain with two Citrus species, grapefruit and mandarin irrigated for eight years with saline reclaimed water (RW) combined with regulated deficit irrigation (RDI). Measurements at leaf scale and airborne flights were carried out twice a day, at 7 and 10 GMT. Irrigation with RW decreased gas exchange and leaf dry mass per unit area (LMA) on grapefruit. However, salinity from RW resulted in an increase in pressure potential (gyp) on mandarin and allowed maintaining net photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) when vapour pressure deficit increased. On both crops, leaf total chlorophyll (ChlT) concentrations were significantly reduced by RW. Moreover, RDI decreased A, gs and stem water potential (psi s) on grapefruit, independently of water quality. Regarding spectral data, red wavelength (R) was significantly correlated with Chl T (p < 0.001), except when mandarin was subjected to stressful climatic conditions (at 10 GMT); since R was influenced, in addition to Chl T, by the plant water and gas exchange status. Near infrared (NIR) was a useful indicator of psi s, A and gs on both crops. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was clearly related to gas exchange in both species and to psi s only on mandarin. Finally, we combined data from both Citrus species and the best indicators were NIR and R. The novelty of this study was to show that diurnal changes in physiological and structural traits of Citrus irrigated with RW combined with RDI can be determined by multispectral images from UAVs.
