J	Kim, J; Lee, T; Seo, D				Kim, Jaeyoung; Lee, Tongeun; Seo, Dongil			Algal bloom prediction of the lower Han River, Korea using the EFDC hydrodynamic and water quality model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The lower part of the Han River, which flows through Seoul, Korea, experienced excessive toxic cyanobac-terial growth in 2015. Modeling of algal bloom occurrence patterns in the lower part of this river was performed using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) to understand algal dynamics and thus better develop management alternatives. For a 71 km long river section, 1175 horizontal 2-D grid elements were developed. This grid system was determined adequate, as the maximum values of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition and orthogonality deviation were 0.5 and 20.1, respectively. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was chosen as the primary indicator for the likelihood of algal blooms. Calibration and verification of EFDC were performed by comparing the model results to three years of field data collected from 2013 to 2015. Calibration accuracy was verified not only for physical variables, including the mean water level and temperature, but also for other water quality variables in various locations of the study area. To improve the prediction accuracy of Chl-a, three dominant groups of algae were considered: diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria. The optimum growth temperature ranges were selected based on field data for the study area. It was found necessary to apply different maximum growth rates for algal groups for the upstream and downstream regions of the study area to appropriately reflect field observations. This result indicates that more than three algal groups need to be included to improve Chl-a calibration accuracy for the study area, yet the current EFDC model can consider only up to three phy-toplankton groups. Although this problem could be overcome by assigning different maximum growth rates for different regions, it may be necessary to improve EFDC so that it can include more phytoplankton groups.

Factors shaping species richness and biodiversity of riverine macroinvertebrate assemblages at the local and regional scale	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												The biodiversity and species richness of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages are under the strong pressure of environmental variables compounded with geographical and historical processes. Numerous studies that have investigated biodiversity and assemblage stability have shown the importance of choosing proper methodologies and paradigms. Consequently, the use of diversity measures and the partitioning of biodiversity at different spatial and temporal scales are of particular significance. Within habitats, only those species whose preferences remain within a tolerable range of the variability of abiotic factors are able to survive. The structure of biocoenosis at the local scale is determined mainly by current velocity/discharge, granulometry of the inorganic bottom substrate, quantity and quality of particulate organic matter, as well as water quality variables. Dispersion plays a key role in shaping regional diversity gradients, which supports the permanent inflow of individuals and their exchange between riverine basins. However, dispersion is also one of the basic aspects of the saturation/non-saturation of local communities with species from the regional species pool; a respective concept tries to determine how, why and to what degree local species richness is dependent on regional species richness.																	1585-8553	1588-2756				DEC	2017	18	3					227	236		10.1556/168.2017.18.3.1								WOS:000424882900001

Assessment of anthropogenic, seasonal and aquatic vegetation effects on the contamination level of oxbows	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												The contamination level of oxbows depends on both natural and anthropogenic effects. The aim of our study was to identify those abiotic and biotic factors that determine the contamination level of oxbows. The effect of anthropogenic activities, seasonality, and vegetation types was studied on the contamination level of surface water of oxbows. The following chemical variables were measured: suspended solid, ammonium, nitrate, chlorophyll-a, Al, Ba, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sr and Zn from eight oxbows from 2013 summer to 2014 autumn in the Upper Tisza region in Eastern Hungary. Three of the studied oxbows were protected, four oxbows were used for fishing and one oxbow was contaminated with wastewater. Our findings revealed that anthropogenic activities had remarkable effect on the contamination level of oxbows. Seasonality also influenced the contamination level, except the concentration of suspended solid, chlorophyll-a and manganese. Significant differences were found among vegetation types for the concentration of suspended solids, aluminium, iron, manganese and lead. The high level of iron concentration was not explained by the anthropogenic activities, suggesting that the quality of oxbows depends on both natural and anthropogenic effects.																	1585-8553	1588-2756				DEC	2017	18	3					237	243		10.1556/168.2017.18.3.2								WOS:000424882900002

Landscape indicators of groundwater nitrate concentrations: an approach for trans-border aquifer monitoring	ECOSPHERE												Groundwater is the primary source of nearly half the freshwater used in drinking and cooking worldwide. Excess nitrate contamination of groundwater is a growing health concern, particularly in regions of intensive agriculture. Monitoring the world's nearly 500 transboundary aquifer bodies is complicated by the complexities associated with multi-jurisdictional governance, disparities in data collection, and inconsistencies in geospatial data among countries. In a region where elevated groundwater nitrate concentrations are linked to overlying land use practices and land cover, we develop landscape indicators characterizing likely sources and examine their correspondence with groundwater nitrate concentrations. We evaluate an aquifer spanning the United States and Canada (the Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer) and ask two primary questions: Are nitrate concentrations in the aquifer changing over time? How well do landscape indicators help explain patterns of groundwater nitrate concentrations? To answer our first question, a time series (2005-2013) of groundwater nitrate concentrations was examined for 15 shallow wells using Mann-Kendall trend analysis tests. Nitrate concentrations in nine of the fifteen monitoring wells decreased while two increased over time. To answer our second question, a seamless harmonized cross-border land cover mosaic was created using available U.S. and Canadian land use and land cover data. Landscape indicators such as crop type (proportion of raspberries, forage, and pasture, etc.) were measured in terrestrial zones of influence (of varying sized radii which incorporated groundwater flow direction) surrounding each well. Backward stepwise regression was used to identify parsimonious models of landscape indicators which explain nitrate concentrations in the United States and Canada. The proportions of different berry types (e.g., blueberries and raspberries, and mixed berries), forage/pasture, and area of renovations explained 21-72% of the variance in groundwater nitrate concentrations, depending on zonal scale, direction, and/or jurisdiction. As very few studies have quantitatively linked groundwater nitrate concentrations to land use, land cover, or land use practices, our work provides an important transportable approach that is highly relevant to other regions facing similar management challenges.																	2150-8925					DEC	2017	8	12							e02047	10.1002/ecs2.2047								WOS:000423423200020

Global warming and other environmental changes have favored the success of invasive species, deeply modifying the structure of aquatic communities in large rivers. Some exogenous species could alter trophic interactions within assemblages by increasing the predation risk for potential prey species (top-down effect) and limiting the dynamics of others via resource availability limitation (bottom-up effect). Furthermore, large transboundary rivers are complex aquatic ecosystems that have often been poorly investigated so that data for assessing long-term ecological trends are missing. In this study, we propose an original approach for investigating long-term combined effects of global warming, trophic resource decrease, predation risk, and water quality variations on the trait-based structure of macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages over 26 yr (1985-2011) and 427-km stretch of the river Meuse (France and Belgium). The study of temporal variations in biological, physiological, and ecological traits of macroinvertebrate and fish allowed identifying community trends and distinguishing impacts of environmental perturbations from those induced by biological alterations. We provide evidence, for this large European river, of an increase in water temperature (close to 1 degrees C) and a decrease in phytoplankton biomass (-85%), as well as independent effects of these changes on both invertebrate and fish communities. The reduction of trophic resources in the water column by invasive molluscs has dramatically affected the density of omnivorous fish in favor of invertebrate feeders, while scrapers became the major feeding guild among invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate and fish communities have shifted from large-sized organisms with low fecundity to prolific, small-sized organisms, with early maturity, as a response to increased predation pressure.

Detecting Eutrophication Symptoms in a Subtropical Semi-Arid Coastal Lagoon by Means of Three Different Methods	WETLANDS												Excess supply of nutrients of anthropogenic origin is one of the main drivers of global change that is affecting the ecological function and provision of ecosystem services by coastal wetlands. This study examines the response of a subtropical semi-arid coastal lagoon to anthropogenic nutrient input, through the use and comparison of eutrophication indices and models, and compares the usefulness of such methods to identify eutrophication symptoms. The Lobos Lagoon is located on the eastern coast of the Gulf of California and receives agricultural and urban wastewater discharges. To identify potential eutrophication symptoms, the Trophic IndeX (TRIX), the Arid Zone Coastal Water Quality Index (AZCI) along with the Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status (ASSETS) model were used. Lobos Lagoon was found to have good environmental condition; however eutrophication symptoms were identified in the zone where untreated urban and agricultural wastewaters are discharged. Results obtained using the three methods were consistent and, thus, their performance can be considered as good and complementary, and can be used to evaluate the extent of eutrophication in subtropical semi-arid coastal lagoons.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2017	37	6					1105	1118		10.1007/s13157-017-0944-y								WOS:000419197800010

Comparative ecological transcriptomics and the contribution of gene expression to the evolutionary potential of a threatened fish	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Understanding whether small populations with low genetic diversity can respond to rapid environmental change via phenotypic plasticity is an outstanding research question in biology. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has recently provided the opportunity to examine variation in gene expression, a surrogate for phenotypic variation, in nonmodel species. We used a comparative RNA-seq approach to assess expression variation within and among adaptively divergent populations of a threatened freshwater fish, Nannoperca australis, found across a steep hydroclimatic gradient in the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. These populations evolved under contrasting selective environments (e.g., dry/hot lowland; wet/cold upland) and represent opposite ends of the species' spectrum of genetic diversity and population size. We tested the hypothesis that environmental variation among isolated populations has driven the evolution of divergent expression at ecologically important genes using differential expression (DE) analysis and an ANOVA-based comparative phylogenetic expression variance and evolution model framework based on 27,425 de novo assembled transcripts. Additionally, we tested whether gene expression variance within populations was correlated with levels of standing genetic diversity. We identified 290 DE candidate transcripts, 33 transcripts with evidence for high expression plasticity, and 50 candidates for divergent selection on gene expression after accounting for phylogenetic structure. Variance in gene expression appeared unrelated to levels of genetic diversity. Functional annotation of the candidate transcripts revealed that variation in water quality is an important factor influencing expression variation for N. australis. Our findings suggest that gene expression variation can contribute to the evolutionary potential of small populations.

Disappearing Submerged Aquatic Vegetation and Declining Water Quality in Lake Mattamuskeet	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Major threats to aquatic systems such as shallow lakes can include declining water quality, the loss of macrophyte beds, and the occurrence of harmful algal blooms. Often, these changes go unnoticed until a shift from a clear, oligotrophic system dominated by macrophyte beds to a turbid, eutrophic system dominated by phytoplankton and associated harmful algal blooms has occurred. Lake Mattamuskeet, which mostly lies within the boundary of Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge, North Carolina, is a shallow lake that has recently experienced a reduction in water clarity and macrophyte beds, also referred to as submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV), and an increase in nutrients, phytoplankton, harmful algal blooms, and cyanotoxin production. At Lake Mattamuskeet, SAV coverage and water clarity declined between the 1980s and 2015. During the same time, significantly increasing trends in nitrogen, phosphorus, turbidity, suspended sediments, chlorophyll a, and pH occurred. Current water-quality conditions (20122015) are not conducive to SAV survival and, in some cases, do not meet North Carolina water-quality standards for the protection of aquatic life. Water clarity declines appear to predate the SAV die-offs on the east side. Moving forward, SAV will serve as a primary indicator for lake health; and lake monitoring, research, and management efforts will focus on the restoration of aquatic grasses and water quality at Lake Mattamuskeet.																	1944-687X					DEC	2017	8	2					401	417		10.3996/082016-JFWM-068								WOS:000418056300006

Understanding and Finding Solutions to the Problem of Sedimentation in the National Wildlife Refuge System	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The National Wildlife Refuge System (Refuge System) is a collection of public lands maintained by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for migratory birds and other wildlife. Wetlands on individual National Wildlife Refuges (Refuges) may be at risk of increased sedimentation because of land use and water management practices. Increased sedimentation can reduce wetland habitat quality by altering hydrologic function, degrading water quality, and inhibiting growth of vegetation and invertebrates. On Refuges negatively affected by increased sedimentation, managers have to address complex questions about how to best remediate and mitigate the negative effects. The best way to account for these complexities is often not clear. On other Refuges, managers may not know whether sedimentation is a problem. Decision makers in the Refuge System may need to allocate resources to studying which Refuges could be at risk. Such analyses would help them understand where to direct support for managing increased sedimentation. In this paper, we summarize a case study demonstrating the use of decision-analytic tools in the development of a sedimentation management plan for Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge, Minnesota. Using what we learned from that process, we surveyed other Refuges in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Region 3 (an area encompassing the states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin) and Region 6 (an area encompassing the states of Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) about whether they experience sediment-related impacts to management. Our results show that cases of management being negatively affected by increased sedimentation are not isolated. We suggest that the Refuge System conduct a comprehensive and systematic assessment of increased sedimentation among Refuges to understand the importance of sedimentation in context with other management problems that Refuges face. The results of such an assessment could guide how the Refuge System allocates resources to studying and managing widespread stressors.																	1944-687X					DEC	2017	8	2					648	660		10.3996/012016-JFWM-004								WOS:000418056300025

Influence of Lake Surface Area and Total Phosphorus on Annual Bluegill Growth in Small Impoundments of Central Georgia	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The relationships between environmental variables and the growth rates of fishes are important and rapidly expanding topics in fisheries ecology. We used an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the influence of lake surface area and total phosphorus on the age-specific growth rates of Lepomis macrochirus (Bluegill) in 6 small impoundments in central Georgia. We used model averaging to create composite models and determine the relative importance of the variables within each model. Results indicated that surface area was the most important factor in the models predicting growth of Bluegills aged 1-4 years; total phosphorus was also an important predictor for the same age-classes. These results suggest that managers can use water quality and lake morphometry variables to create predictive models specific to their waterbody or region to help develop lake-specific management plans that select for and optimize local-level habitat factors for enhancing Bluegill growth.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				DEC	2017	16	4					546	566										WOS:000418425800006

The Effect of Beaver Ponds on Water Quality in Rural Coastal Plain Streams	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We compared water-quality effects of 13 beaver ponds on adjacent free-flowing control reaches in the Coastal Plain of rural North Carolina. We measured concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and suspended sediment (SS) upstream and downstream of paired ponds and control reaches. Nitrate and SS concentrations decreased, ammonium concentrations increased, and SRP concentrations were unaffected downstream of the ponds and relative to the control reaches. The pond effect on nitrate concentration was a reduction of 112 +/- 55 mu g-N/L (19%) compared to a control-reach-influenced reduction of 28 +/- 17 mu g-N/L. The pond effect on ammonium concentration was an increase of 9.47 +/- 10.9 mu g-N/L (59%) compared to the control-reach-influenced reduction of 1.49 +/- 1.37 mu g-N/L. The pond effect on SS concentration was a decrease of 3.41 +/- 1.68 mg/L (40%) compared to a control-reach-influenced increase of 0.56 +/- 0.27 mg/L. Ponds on lower-order streams reduced nitrate concentrations by greater amounts compared to those in higher-order streams. Older ponds reduced SS concentrations by greater amounts compared to younger ponds. The findings of this study indicate that beaver ponds provide water-quality benefits to rural Coastal Plain streams by reducing concentrations of nitrate and suspended sediment.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				DEC	2017	16	4					584	602										WOS:000418425800008

The porous, fissured, and soluble nature of the underlying karst bedrock (primarily dolomite and limestone) leads to the formation of underground drainage systems. Karst conduit networks dominate this system, and rainfall takes a crucial role on water cycle at China karst area. Nitrogen loss from the karst system is of particular concern, with regard to nutrient use efficiency as well as water quality, as much of the karst system, including steeply sloping terrain, is used for intensive agriculture. We use simulated rainfall experiments to determine the relationship between rainfall and nitrogen loss at typical karst slope land and then estimate nitrogen loss from the karst soil. The results show that both surface runoff and subsurface runoff have a significant linear correlation with rainfall at all studied sites. Subsurface runoff is larger than surface runoff at two karst sites, while the opposite is true at the non-karst site. Exponential function satisfactorily described the correlation between rainfall and nitrogen concentrations in runoff. Nitrates accounted for 60%-95% of the dissolved nitrogen loss (DN, an index of N-loss in this research). The estimated annual N-loss load varies between 1.05 and 1.67 Tg N/year in the whole karst regions of China from 1961 to 2014. Approximately, 90% of the N-loss load occurred during the wet season, and 90% of that passed through the subsurface. Understanding the processes and estimating N-loss is highly valuable in determining long-term soil security and sustainability in karst regions.

Riparian and microhabitat factors determine the structure of the EPT community in Andean headwater rivers of Ecuador	ECOHYDROLOGY												This research was conducted in the high-Andean basin of the Zhurucay River in southern Ecuador. In 4 river reaches, 19 sampling campaigns were conducted per reach spread over a period of 35months. The biotic samples were selected in the periods with greatest flow stability. Parallel to each sampling, 37 environmental variables grouped into 3 factors (riparian corridor, hydromorphology, and water quality) were recorded. The study aimed to analyse during periods of stable flow the influence of these environmental factors on the structure and density of the EPT community (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera) in a quasi-pristine aquatic ecosystem. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that the Froude number, gravel type, and width/depth ratio are the most relevant hydromorphological variables explaining variations in EPT density. Xiphocentronidae, Contulma, and Helicopsyche were observed to have a relationship with the order of the river, while Ochrotrichia, Nectopsyche, and Phylloicus varied with the type of riparian vegetation. Phylloicus, Ochrotrichia, and Nectopsyche were common in lentic sites, while the proportion of gravel and the width/depth ratio restricted the genus Helicopsyche. The only relevant water quality factor was the total phosphorus, which was related with 2 taxa. In conclusion, although macroinvertebrates are currently employed in water quality studies, riparian vegetation and hydromorphological factors are determinant for their communities in pristine Andean rivers. Such factors are therefore crucial in the study of environmental flows and the assessment of the ecological integrity.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				DEC	2017	10	8							UNSP e1894	10.1002/eco.1894								WOS:000417099800009

Ecosystem services mapping for detection of bundles, synergies and trade-offs: Examples from two Norwegian municipalities	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												The main objective of this work was to analyse how increased harvesting for bioenergy production might affect other Ecosystem Services (ES) in two Norwegian municipalities (Ringsaker and Voss). The aim was to identify locations where synergies or conflicts between ES could be expected. The spatial distribution of eight different ES (3 provision, 3 regulation and 2 cultural services) was modelled using information provided by land use spatial databases and additional data sources. Model parameters were set by integrating existing research and expert knowledge. Maps showing the level of provision of ES were analysed using a moving window to analyse scale dependence in the spatial distribution of ES provision. Map algebra was then used to identify areas providing multiple ES, thus defining the most important areas on which to focus the management of both synergies and trade-offs. Finally, specific 'binary bundles' maps, where bioenergy provision was compared with each of the other ES, were developed. The methodology proved its utility to assess the compatibility of bioenergy uses with other services. This straightforward approach is readily replicable in other regions and can be used as a decision support tool for planning and designing provision areas, and to ensure sustainable forest management approaches.

Of particular significance for lakes are severe storms that can influence biogeochemical processes and biological communities by disrupting the vertical thermal structure during periods of stratification. An exceptional storm passing over northern Germany in July 2011 provided an opportunity to assess the consequences and underlying mechanisms of such extreme events on the interplay between the physics and ecological characteristics of a deep, nutrient-poor lake. Wind speeds were among the most extreme on record. A suite of variables measured throughout the event consistently indicates that a cascade of processes pushed the clear-water lake into an exceptionally turbid state. Specifically, thermocline deepening by the storm-entrained cyanobacteria of a deep chlorophyll maximum located at about 8 m depth into the surface mixed layer. Released from light limitation, intense photosynthesis of the cyanobacteria boosted primary production, increased algal biomass, raised the pH and thus induced massive calcite precipitation to a level never observed within three decades of lake monitoring. As a consequence, water transparency dropped from 6.5 to 2.1 m, the minimum on record for 40 years, and the euphotic zone shrank by about 8 m for several weeks. These results show that cyanobacterial blooms not only are promoted by climate warming, but can also be triggered by extreme storms. Clear-water lakes developing a deep chlorophyll maximum appear to be particularly at risk in the future, if such events become more intense or frequent.

The Influence of Legacy P on Lake Water Quality in a Midwestern Agricultural Watershed	ECOSYSTEMS												Decades of fertilizer and manure applications have led to a buildup of phosphorus (P) in agricultural soils and sediments, commonly referred to as legacy P. Legacy P can provide a long-term source of P to surface waters where it causes eutrophication. Using a suite of numerical models, we investigated the influence of legacy P on water quality in the Yahara Watershed of southern Wisconsin, USA. The suite included Agro-IBIS, a terrestrial ecosystem model; THMB, a hydrologic and nutrient routing model; and the Yahara Water Quality Model which estimates water quality indicators in the Yahara chain of lakes. Using five alternative scenarios of antecedent P storage (legacy P) in soils and channels under historical climate conditions, we simulated outcomes of P yield from the landscape, lake P loading, and three lake water quality indicators. Legacy P had a significant effect on lake loads and water quality. Across the five scenarios for Lake Mendota, the largest and most upstream lake, average P yield (kg ha(-1)) varied by -41 to +22%, P load (kg y(-1)) by -35 to +14%, summer total P (TP) concentration (mg l(-1)) by -25 to +12%, Secchi depth (m) by -7 to +3%, and the probability of hypereutrophy by -67 to +34%, relative to baseline conditions. The minimum storage scenario showed that a 35% reduction in present-day loads to Lake Mendota corresponded with a 25% reduction in summer TP and smaller reductions in the downstream lakes. Water quality was more vulnerable to heavy rainfall events at higher amounts of P storage and less so at lower amounts. Increases in heavy precipitation are expected with climate change; therefore, water quality could be protected by decreasing P reserves.

Perpetual Phosphorus Cycling: Eutrophication Amplifies Biological Control on Internal Phosphorus Loading in Agricultural Reservoirs	ECOSYSTEMS												Nearly half of US lakes are impaired, primarily resulting from excessive nutrients and resultant eutrophication. The stability and recycling of sediment P results in differing degrees of internal P loading, which can alter lake water quality. In this study, we asked: (1) What are the underlying mechanisms controlling internal loading (net release) and retention of P? and (2) How does trophic state, specifically a hypereutrophic condition, affect internal P loading in agricultural reservoirs? We show that shifts in internal P loading are related to trophic-level indicators, including total P (TP) and chl-a concentrations. All study reservoirs were classified as hypereutrophic, and we grouped them as "less eutrophic" or "more eutrophic" based on TP and chl-a concentrations. In less eutrophic lakes, chemical variables (for example, oxygen) and sediment iron-bound P primarily controlled internal P loading under anaerobic conditions. However, in the more eutrophic lakes, biological variables, including phytoplankton biomass (as indicated by chl-a concentrations) and extracellular enzyme activity, drove internal P loading or reduced P retention under aerobic conditions. Biologically controlled aerobic internal P cycling was related to higher sediment organic P pools being broken down by enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, we theorize that as lakes become hypereutrophic, biological mechanisms begin to amplify internal P release by acting under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, thus creating a perpetual cycle of internal P loading. Thus, the role of biological processes and oxygen availability should be considered in water quality management strategies aimed at alleviating eutrophication in lakes.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				DEC	2017	20	8					1483	1493		10.1007/s10021-017-0126-z								WOS:000417063300007

Flooding drives a macroinvertebrate biomass boom in ephemeral floodplain wetlands	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Despite broad recognition of the importance of the Flood Pulse Concept to large river ecology, few studies have provided empirical evidence to support a number of its arguments. We compared and contrasted the responses of water quality, nutrients, and the macroinvertebrates of ephemeral and permanent wetlands to a 22-wk managed inundation. We hypothesized that inundation of ephemeral wetlands would mobilize higher concentrations of nutrients from floodplain sediments and C from organic matter, which would, in turn, fuel greater abundance and biomass of aquatic macroinvertebrates than in permanent wetlands. The response of ephemeral wetlands to flooding contrasted very strongly with that of permanent wetlands. Freshly inundated ephemeral wetlands had significantly higher dissolved nutrient and organic C concentrations than permanent wetlands and supported different aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. Macroinvertebrate diversity was higher in permanent wetlands, but ephemeral wetlands supported much greater macroinvertebrate abundance and biomass. Differences between macroinvertebrate communities in ephemeral and reference wetlands were driven primarily by Chironomidae. Chironomus tepperi was the dominant taxon among ephemeral wetlands, both numerically and by biomass. Early-colonizing Coleoptera contributed strongly to taxonomic richness among ephemeral wetlands. Analysis of functional feeding groups (FFGs) indicated that ephemeral wetlands contained a higher proportion of detritus-feeding collector-gatherers compared to permanent wetlands, suggesting an increased reliance on heterotrophic energy pathways. We showed that a managed flood pulse can mobilize latent terrestrial energy sources within ephemeral floodplain wetlands and support a boom of aquatic invertebrate biomass, with important implications for both terrestrial and aquatic food webs.

The invertebrates that inhabit them, and zooplankton specifically, play important roles in these wetlands. We compared the ability of taxon- and size-based analyses of the zooplankton community to predict the influence of environmental variables. We sampled environmental variables and zooplankton at 7 Mediterranean wetlands in the Iberian Peninsula (southern Spain) monthly along 1 hydroperiod cycle (2009-2010). We used 3 arrays for classifying the zooplankton community: 1) species occurring in >5% of the samples, 2) coarse-level taxa easily identified by a nonexpert (large branchiopods, small branchiopods, calanoid copepods, cyclopoid copepods, and harpacticoid copepods), and 3) 4 body-size classes (<1, 1-2.5, 2.5-10, and >10 mm in length). We used permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to test our hypotheses. Communities differed significantly among wetlands, and body size (55.8% of explained variance) was more useful than taxonomic composition (common taxa: 24.4%, coarse-level taxa: 26.5% of explained variance) for rapid assessment of the influence of the environmental variables on zooplankton community in temporary wetlands.

Although a key feature of urban areas is their higher temperature (urban heat islands), adaptive thermal evolution in organisms inhabiting urban areas has rarely been studied. We tested for evolution of a higher heat tolerance (CTMAX) in urban populations of the water flea Daphnia magna, a keystone grazer in freshwater ecosystems, by carrying out a common garden experiment at two temperatures (20 degrees C and 24 degrees C) with genotypes of 13 natural populations ordered along a well-defined urbanization gradient. We also assessed body size and haemoglobin concentration to identify underlying physiological drivers of responses in CTMAX. We found a higher CTMAX in animals isolated from urban compared to rural habitats and in animals reared at higher temperatures. We also observed substantial genetic variation in thermal tolerance within populations. Overall, smaller animals were more heat tolerant. While urban animals mature at smaller size, the effect of urbanization on thermal tolerance is only in part caused by reductions in body size. Although urban Daphnia contained higher concentrations of haemoglobin, this did not contribute to their higher CTMAX. Our results provide evidence of adaptive thermal evolution to urbanization in the water flea Daphnia. In addition, our results show both evolutionary potential and adaptive plasticity in rural as well as urban Daphnia populations, facilitating responses to warming. Given the important ecological role of Daphnia in ponds and lakes, these adaptive responses likely impact food web dynamics, top-down control of algae, water quality, and the socio-economic value of urban ponds.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				DEC	2017	23	12					5218	5227		10.1111/gcb.13784								WOS:000414969000022	28614592

Unexpected stasis in a changing world: Lake nutrient and chlorophyll trends since 1990	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The United States (U.S.) has faced major environmental changes in recent decades, including agricultural intensification and urban expansion, as well as changes in atmospheric deposition and climate-all of which may influence eutrophication of freshwaters. However, it is unclear whether or how water quality in lakes across diverse ecological settings has responded to environmental change. We quantified water quality trends in 2913 lakes using nutrient and chlorophyll (Chl) observations from the Lake Multi-Scaled Geospatial and Temporal Database of the Northeast U.S. (LAGOS-NE), a collection of preexisting lake data mostly from state agencies. LAGOS-NE was used to quantify whether lake water quality has changed from 1990 to 2013, and whether lake-specific or regional geophysical factors were related to the observed changes. We modeled change through time using hierarchical linear models for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), stoichiometry (TN:TP), and Chl. Both the slopes (percent change per year) and intercepts (value in 1990) were allowed to vary by lake and region. Across all lakes, TN declined at a rate of 1.1% year(-1), while TP, TN:TP, and Chl did not change. A minority (7%-16%) of individual lakes had changing nutrients, stoichiometry, or Chl. Of those lakes that changed, we found differences in the geospatial variables that were most related to the observed change in the response variables. For example, TN and TN:TP trends were related to region-level drivers associated with atmospheric deposition of N; TP trends were related to both lake and region-level drivers associated with climate and land use; and Chl trends were found in regions with high air temperature at the beginning of the study period. We conclude that despite large environmental change and management efforts over recent decades, water quality of lakes in the Midwest and Northeast U.S. has not overwhelmingly degraded or improved.

Removal of nutrients, trace organic contaminants, and bacterial indicator organisms in a demonstration-scale unit process open-water treatment wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A demonstration-scale unit process open-water wetland system was built to treat water from an effluent-dominated river (i.e., a river in which the flow consisted almost entirely of municipal wastewater effluent from May to October). Monitoring of the system over a two-year period indicated effective removal of nitrate, with concentrations decreasing by over 90% during summer. The temperature-independent areal first-order nitrate removal rate constant, k(20), ranged from 61.7 to 68.1 m yr(-1) after the microbial community was established, which is significantly higher than values typically observed in full-scale surface flow wetlands. The beta-adrenergic blockers, atenolol and propranolol, as well as the antiviral drug, acyclovir, were removed by photolysis and biotransformation in the wetland biomat, whereas the antiepileptic drug, carbamazepine, exhibited little removal. The bacterial indicators E. coli and enterococci decreased substantially during summer, mainly through sunlight exposure. Models of contaminant removal based upon measured flow rates and performance data collected at a similar pilot-scale system agreed well with measured data for nitrate and the trace organic contaminants. The model accurately predicted removal of enterococci but systematically over-predicted the removal of E. coli. During the two-year study period, routine maintenance was necessary to prevent colonization of the water surface with duckweed (Lemna spp.). Unit process open-water (UPOW) wetlands may offer a low-cost means of improving water quality in natural treatment systems that can be integrated with conventional surface-flow wetlands and other managed natural systems. The quantitative models of contaminant removal described in this study can be used to design natural treatment systems that balance the needs for local water quality requirements, available land and site-specific requirements.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				DEC	2017	109		A				76	83		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.09.017								WOS:000413737800010

Species-specific impacts of suspended sediments on gill structure and function in coral reef fishes	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Reduced water quality, in particular increases in suspended sediments, has been linked to declines in fish abundance on coral reefs. Changes in gill structure induced by suspended sediments have been hypothesized to impair gill function and may provide a mechanistic basis for the observed declines; yet, evidence for this is lacking. We exposed juveniles of three reef fish species (Amphiprion melanopus, Amphiprion percula and Acanthochromis polyacanthus) to suspended sediments (0-180 mg l(-1)) for 7 days and examined changes in gill structure and metabolic performance (i.e. oxygen consumption). Exposure to suspended sediments led to shorter gill lamellae in A. melanopus and A. polyacanthus and reduced oxygen diffusion distances in all three species. While A. melanopus exhibited impaired oxygen uptake after suspended sediment exposure, i.e. decreased maximum and increased resting oxygen consumption rates resulting in decreased aerobic scope, the oxygen consumption rates of the other two species remained unaffected. These findings imply that species sensitive to changes in gill structure such as A. melanopus may decline in abundance as reefs become more turbid, whereas species that are able to maintain metabolic performance despite suspended sediment exposure, such as A. polyacanthus or A. percula, may be able to persist or gain a competitive advantage.																	0962-8452	1471-2954				NOV 15	2017	284	1866							20171279	10.1098/rspb.2017.1279								WOS:000414773600004	29093217					
J	Jiang, L; Xia, M				Jiang, Long; Xia, Meng			Wind effects on the spring phytoplankton dynamics in the middle reach of the Chesapeake Bay	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The spring phytoplankton bloom, bridging nutrient loading and summer hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay especially in its middle reach, is highly sensitive to physical forcing. In addition to riverine input, winds could be a noticeable driver of estuarine phytoplankton variability, affecting its water quality and ecosystem health. In this study, wind impacts on the spring bloom were investigated utilizing the 29-year (1985-2013) monitoring data and an existing FVCOM-ICM estuarine water quality model. The retrospective analysis revealed that winds exerted a significant control on the spring algal biomass in the middle bay, which could be as important as the effects of riverine inputs. According to the model simulation, the mid-bay spring algal bloom was mainly fueled by the riverine nutrients, and its biomass was higher on the western than that on the eastern flank. Numerical experiments indicated a negative relationship between stratification and the overall algal biomass. It was found that up-estuary (southerly) winds could induce upwelling, thus enhance primary production along the western shore, and increase phytoplankton transport to deeper waters, making up-estuary winds most effective in the mid-bay transverse phytoplankton enrichment. Given that the regional wind pattern is tightly coupled with the large-scale climatic variability, it is recommended to fully consider climatic effects on the lower food web in ecosystem management in the future.

In this study, we analyzed the relationship between terrestrial net primary production (NPP) and the rate at which carbon is exported from the catchments in a temperate stream network. The analysis included more than 200 catchment areas in southwest Germany, ranging in size from 0.8 to 889 km(2) for which CO2 evasion from stream surfaces and downstream transport with stream discharge were estimated from water quality monitoring data, while NPP in the catchments was obtained from a global data set based on remote sensing. We found that on average 13.9 g Cm(-2)yr(-1) (corresponding to 2.7% of terrestrial NPP) are exported from the catchments by streams and rivers, in which both CO2 evasion and downstream transport contributed about equally to this flux. The average carbon fluxes in the catchments of the study area resembled global and large-scale zonal mean values in many respects, including NPP, stream evasion and the carbon export per catchment area in the fluvial network. A review of existing studies on aquatic-terrestrial coupling in the carbon cycle suggests that the carbon export per catchment area varies in a relatively narrow range, despite a broad range of different spatial scales and hydrological characteristics of the study regions.

Modeling nutrient removal using watershed-scale implementation of the two-stage ditch	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) is the most intensively farmed region of the Great Lakes. Because of the flat topography and poorly-drained soils many farmers rely on drainage management practices (e.g., subsurface tile drainage, ditch channelization) to maintain productive agriculture. However, these practices also facilitate the delivery of excess nutrients and sediments to Lake Erie, which have been linked to recurring harmful algal blooms (HABs) and associated environmental degradation. Implementation of inset floodplains in formerly channelized waterways via the two-stage ditch can improve water quality but the efficacy has been tested using only implementation in short reaches. Watershed models are critical tools for assessing watershed-scale implementation and as such can guide effective management. We evaluated the effectiveness of the two-stage ditch in improving water quality in the River Raisin Watershed (RRW), a major subbasin in the WLEB, combining empirical measurements for nutrient reductions from two-stage ditches across the Midwest with output from a Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. We modeled two-stage implementation in 25, 50, and 100% of headwater reaches in the RRW, and found that the practice could reduce total annual NO3--N export by 2, 5 and 10%, respectively. The two-stage was even more effective at reducing total phosphorus (TP) export, which was reduced by 12, 20 and 31%, respectively. Compared to other conservation practices, nutrient reduction efficiency for the two-stage ditch was good, both in terms of percent load reduction and cost, but watershed-scale adoption will be required in order to achieve significant nutrient reductions as called for by policymakers.

Subsurface tile drained area detection using GIS and remote sensing in an agricultural watershed	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Subsurface tile drainage has been used around the globe to lower the water table and drain soils that are seasonally or perennially wet making them suitable for agriculture and/or increasing productivity. However, tile drainage systems have a negative impact on water quality of adjacent streams and ditches due to the transport of excess fertilizer nutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from fields. To support nutrient management and conservation practices like drain water management (DWM), accurate delineation of the agricultural area drained by tiles is critical for quantifying nutrient yields (nutrient mass per area per time) to downstream water bodies. In this study, we tested Geographic Information System decision tree classification (GIS DTC) and satellite remote sensing based methods (i.e., image differencing) to determine tile drainage area in an agricultural watershed, Shatto Ditch Watershed (SDW) in Indiana, USA. Using these techniques, we estimated that 79% of the cultivated area of SDW is tile drained with 94% accuracy according to the image differencing approach whereas 55% is classified as tile drained with an accuracy of 75% based on estimates from the DTC approach with the most relaxed rule thresholds (where tiles exist on <= 4% slope with poorly and moderately well drained soils). Using satellite imagery to characterize tile drained area at a high resolution over large geographical extent shows promise and will be important for accurately quantifying nutrient yields from tiles which will inform management and conservation efforts to reduce excess nutrient export to downstream water bodies.

Phosphorus concentrations in a Florida Everglades water conservation area before and after El Nino events in the dry season	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The Florida Everglades depends on both seasonal hydroperiods and low nutrient loading. This study investigated phosphorus concentrations in a 237,000-ha wetland complex in the Greater Florida Everglades known as Water Conservation Area 3A (WCA-3A). WCA-3A is south and downstream of Lake Okeechobee and most of the agricultural activity in the Everglades region, but immediately north and upstream of the Everglades National Park. The original goal of the study was to investigate if this water conservation area was serving as a phosphorus sink during a 9-month period (October 2015 to June 2016) that normally would have bracketed the dry winter season of south Florida. The beginning of 2016 brought several unexpected polar fronts with high rainfall, an unusual weather pattern in subtropical Florida later confirmed to have been caused by an El Nino condition in the Pacific Ocean. Samples taken at the beginning of the dry season (October through December 2015 during pre-El Nino conditions) showed low phosphorus concentrations. In April and June 2016 during post-El Nino conditions, monthly average total phosphorus concentrations averaged 7.1-7.2 ppb total phosphorus in inflow region of WCA-3A, significantly higher (P = 0.030 and 0.045) than 3.0 and to 2.6 ppb in the wetland's outflow region. The wetland was found to be a sink of phosphorus with a 47% decrease in total phosphorus from north to south during this post- El Nino time. If future additional wetlands and water quality strategies are not in place to mitigate fluxes of phosphorus during future climate variations such as this El Nino condition, this wetland complex may take on an even greater role of protecting the water quality of the downstream Everglades National Park.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				391	395		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.028								WOS:000423883000005						
J	Mitsch, WJ				Mitsch, William J.			Solving Lake Erie's harmful algal blooms by restoring the Great Black Swamp in Ohio	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Harmful algal blooms are now a common occurrence around the world in these Anthropocene times because of fertilization of phosphorus and nitrogen for crop and animal production. One of the most dramatic cases in North America is the recent accelerated eutrophication of Lake Erie in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Also, we have lost, by some estimates, 50% of the world's wetlands in the 20th century and 90% of the wetlands in Ohio USA over the 19th and 20th centuries. We are proposing a serious analysis of an ecological engineering opportunity to restore parts of the former 400,000 ha (1 million acre) Great Black Swamp that was immediately southwest of Lake Erie in Ohio and is now one of the major sources of agricultural phosphorus to western Lake Erie through the Maumee River. Restoring and creating 20,000-40,000 ha (50,000-100,000 acres) or 5-10% of the original wetlands in the Black Swamp to optimize nutrient reduction could reduce phosphorus loading by 480-960 metric tons/year or 18-37% percent of the annual phosphorus loading by the Maumee River to Lake Erie. A thorough investigation of this idea will first require physical (mull-year mesocosm experiments), mathematical, and business models to explore biogeochemical, hydrologic and economic feasibility and reliability. If this presents reasonable results, it would be followed by the creation of a small 400-1000 ha (1000-2500 acre) demonstration treatment wetland in the Black Swamp region to see if wetland performance will scale up as predicted with the mesocosm and mathematical models. Only after a decade of studies at these smaller scale models and a demonstration levels would the full-scale nutrient retention wetlands be implemented in the former Black Swamp. When completed, these treatment wetlands would cover about 10% of the Great Black Swamp region and could remove, with proper ecological engineering design, 40% or more of the phosphorus load from the Maumee River Basin now going into Lake Erie.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				406	413		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.040								WOS:000423883000007

Design of real-time and long-term hydrologic and water quality wetland monitoring stations in South Florida, USA	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Hydrologic regimes in tropical and subtropical regions (e.g. hurricanes, tropical storms, and droughts) impact biogeochemical processes in created and restored wetlands with variability of wet/dry seasons and extreme weather events. Our South Florida Wetland Monitoring Network (SFWMN) with three real-time hydrologic, water quality, and meteorological field stations was established by the Everglades Wetland Research Park of Florida Gulf Coast University in the subtropical Southwest Florida, USA, beginning in 2012. The stations include a restored freshwater marsh (RFM) and adjacent meteorological field station; a restored brackish water marsh (RBM); and a created freshwater treatment wetland system and adjacent meterological station (CFTW). Continuous observations of water depth, temperature, salinity, and pH for the period of January 2012 to January 2016 indicate significant differences among the restored freshwater marsh, the restored brackish marsh, and the created freshwater treatment wetlands for water temperature and pH for wet and dry seasons. The brackish wetland salinity fluctuated between 26.16 (in the dry season) to 1.03 ppt (in the wet season). The real-time dataset allowed up-to-date information of the frequency and duration of severe weather events illustrating, for example, that 70% of the 2012 annual rainfall (1129 mm) occurring in July and August with a 75.4 mm precipitation during one event tropical storm Isaac on August 26-28, 2012. This storm led to a water stage peak in the brackish wetland due to excessive watershed runoff, not tidal surges, and salinity decreased from 22.3 to 5.5 ppt. The coefficient of variation (CV) for water depth and water quality from all wetland monitoring stations exhibited similar variations during all seasons, except when the salinity for the brackish marsh (RBM) had the highest CV values (1.02) in the wet season. Principal component analysis (PCA) at each station identified the variance in water depth and water quality parameters as due to seasonal changes of precipitation in distinct wet and dry seasons. The data from these monitoring stations are also used for research by scholars and students as well as for teaching a better understanding of wetlands dynamics and function in the classroom. As a whole, these stations are being used to bring awareness about the fragile and unique hydrological conditions of wetlands in subtropical Southwest Florida, especially for long-term conditions related to sea level changes and more frequent tropical storms.

Relative importance of external and internal phosphorus loadings on affecting lake water quality in agricultural landscapes	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Internal phosphorus (P) loading from the sediment poses a high risk of being an additional P source to deteriorate water quality. Previous studies hypothesized that internal P loads can be as high as external P inputs, especially in P enriched landscapes such as agricultural areas. However, internal P loadings in eutrophic conditions are rarely quantified or compared with external P loads. In this study, we aimed to answer these three questions; 1) how much P is internally released from the sediment of hypereutrophic lakes? 2) how much do internal P loads contribute to lake water quality compared to external loads? and 3) what factors regulate the release and retention of P in the sediment? We selected four hypereutrophic lakes located in Eastern Nebraska. In the study lakes and watersheds, internal and external P loads were quantified in 2014. Total P concentrations of inflow water collected from primary water channels feeding the study lakes and daily inflow water discharge rates were used to calculate external P loads. Internal P loads were quantified from flow-through soil core incubation experiments. External TP loads varied temporarily depending on the changes in discharge, and were highest during spring storm events. The majority of internal P loading (i.e. P release from sediment) occurred in the summer when lakes experience strong stratification (i.e. anaerobic conditions). This is likely associated with oxygen availability in the sediments and chemical dissolution of P. By comparing the annual-scale of external and internal P inputs, external P loadings were still the dominant P source to the lakes, contributing up to 98% of the total P input whereas internal P loadings accounted for 4-12% of the total P input. Although internal P loads were relatively minor on an annual time scale, we found that summer internal loadings in some of study lakes exceeded their external loadings. Our results confirmed the dominant influence of external P loadings on water quality in the reservoirs. This suggests that non-point source controls and watershed management strategies to reduce external loadings should be implemented prior to internal P loading controls. Internal P loadings can be a significant P source, even if just temporarily, worsening water quality of agricultural reservoirs and downstream ecosystems in the summer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Riparian forests play a major role in protecting water quality, and there is a need to assess the role of riparian restoration in reducing nutrients and sediment loading. This study uses watershed simulation modeling to evaluate impacts of riparian forest restoration on water quality in a tropical agricultural watershed. Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate streamflow, suspended sediment and nutrients of the Sarapui River watershed, located in southeast Brazil. We observe a spatial and temporal variation in water quality impacts of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) and rainfall patterns. Watersheds with agricultural and some residential areas had a higher sediment and nutrients loads than forest and with pasture land uses, especially during the wet season. Forested watersheds in general had a better water quality than other LULC types. Riparian restoration in the study watershed can reduce suspended sediment (9.26%), total nitrogen (22.6%), and total phosphorus (7.83%). Protecting riparian zone and site-conservation practices is critical to improve water quality. We observe that the simulation model provides a satisfactory baseline of the watershed system to evaluate impacts of land use changes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, less research has focused on public health service of wetlands: their ability to protect microbial quality of water for downstream while they attract wildlife populations. For urban surface water, transmission of antibiotic resistance is also an important concern. Under anticipated climate change scenarios, more extreme precipitation patterns are emerging. Thus, runoff and flooding from increased precipitation will impair surface water quality more significantly. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the dynamics of bacteria of public health concern in urban wetlands, including: Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Arcobacter, and two antibiotic resistance genes (sulfonamide, sul1 and tetracycline, tetQ); and 2) identify the major fecal contamination sources using microbial source tracking (MST). Water samples were collected across the urban wetlands in central Ohio from June 2013 to June 2014 and tested with a culture-based (E. coli) and quantitative PCR (the rest) methods. Since Canada geese were the most observed wildlife at the study sites and they are known to carry an array of infectious disease agents, their fecal samples were also collected. From the water samples, E. coli (fecal indicator) had the highest occurrence in 99.2% of the total samples, followed by sul1 (98.3%), Arcobacter (94.9%), STEC (74.6%), tetQ (58.5%), and Campylobacter (1.7%). Overall reduction in E. coli was 22.3% across the wetlands, but variation was observed depending on the season. Microbial source tracking suggested a high prevalence of avian- (44.9%) and ruminant- (38.1%) originated fecal contaminations (e.g., Canada geese and deer). From the geese fecal samples, STEC (93.2%) and Arcobacter (4.5%) were detected, which could potentially compromise wetlands functions in reductions in bacteria of public health concern and antibiotic resistance. The results suggest that careful wildlife management together with long-term monitoring of microorganisms of concern are needed for making urban wetlands as a sustainable frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread in surface water.

J	Marion, JW; Zhang, F; Cutting, D; Lee, J				Marion, Jason W.; Zhang, Feng; Cutting, David; Lee, Jiyoung			Associations between county-level land cover classes and cyanobacteria blooms in the United States	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Cyanobacteria blooms can cause public health concerns related to drinking water quality and water recreation. The rapidly changing global climate is anticipated to bring about an increased frequency of extreme weather events (e.g. stronger storms, more extensive droughts), which are expected to promote more frequent cyanobacteria blooms that persist for longer durations in freshwater. Land use planning, landscape management, and ecological engineering may present mitigation opportunities for decreasing the occurrence and intensity of current and future cyanobacteria blooms through improved nutrient management strategies thereby reducing eutrophication of watersheds. To examine the potential impacts of various land cover classes (and their relative density) on cyanobacteria bloom coverage, county-level data were obtained or generated from the National Land Cover Database and the national nutrient inputs to the land surface database. These data were paired with county-level estimates of cyanobacteria bloom area obtained by satellite-based MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer). Multivariable zero-inflated beta regression models were constructed for the U.S. and five U.S. regions for assessing the relationships between the proportion of county area experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom, county land cover types, and nutrient loading. The land cover type associated with the greatest decreases in bloom area in the national model was deciduous forest (p < 0.001). Open water extent (p = 0.001) and nitrogen loading from manure (p = 0.002) and fertilizer (p < 0.001) were positively associated with the proportion of water characterized as experiencing a cyanobacteria bloom. A significant interaction (p < 0.001) was observed between cultivated crop coverage and open water extent. Overall, increasing cultivated crop coverage was associated with increasing proportions of cyanobacteria blooms. Low intensity, medium intensity, and high intensity development land uses were not associated with bloom coverage in the national model, although development land uses were positively associated in several regional models. Ultimately, there is evidence that county-level land cover and nutrient loading, notably N in the national model, can impact countylevel cyanobacteria bloom coverage. Given regional model differences, additional remote sensing-based studies that examine watershed-based effects on cyanobacteria coverage are needed to establish watershed-specific associations. Studies that transcend county boundaries may provide greater utility than this correlational study for better characterizing land uses and mitigation measures that impact or could impact cyanobacteria bloom coverage in U.S. surface waters.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				556	563		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.032								WOS:000423883000022						
J	West, M; Fenner, N; Gough, R; Freeman, C				West, Mike; Fenner, Nathalie; Gough, Rachel; Freeman, Christopher			Evaluation of algal bloom mitigation and nutrient removal in floating constructed wetlands with different macrophyte species	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Algal blooms resulting from the eutrophication of surface waters represent a significant ecological and water treatment issue. The potential for wetland systems to act as sinks for various types of pollutants indicates their potential for mitigating algal blooms. Although nutrient uptake in terrestrial treatment wetland systems has received substantial attention in the literature, relatively little is known about the mechanisms involved in floating constructed wetland (FCW) function for algal control and whether plant species can optimise performance. Here, the effect of FCWs on water quality including nutrient levels and algal biomass was investigated, along with the effect of planting with different species of macrophyte. All the planted FCWs showed significant potential for algal bloom mitigation in both hypereutrophic and mesotrophic systems; algal biomass control is proposed to be due to the direct uptake of nitrate and phosphate via macrophyte roots, rather than algaecidal effect of phenolic compounds. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release was found to differ between species, with implications for drinking water treatment.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				581	588		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.033								WOS:000423883000025

Phosphorus (P) impairment of fresh surface waters is a major concern in the USA and worldwide. The aim of this study is to use a bench scale P removal system that utilizes electrocoagulation (EC) to address this water quality problem. This study examined the effects of treatment parameters (initial pH, initial conductivity, power input, and initial P concentration) on the ability of the EC process to remove P in solutions with initial P concentrations less than 2 mg/L. It also investigated the ability of EC to reduce concentrations of P in surface water and treated wastewater. P concentrations in phosphate solutions, surface water, and wastewater effluent were reduced by 99% in under 60 min. The removal efficiency was demonstrated to be directly proportional to the conductivity and power supplied.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		B				589	596		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.07.031								WOS:000423883000026

We aimed to reveal potential impacts of the North American crayfish Orconectes limosus on river assessment in the Neman River basin (southeastern Baltic Sea). A laboratory experiment using identical macroinvertebrate assemblages was conducted to compare feeding selectivity and effects between O. limosus and the European Astacus leptodactylus. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate potential impacts of O. limosus on disturbed and undisturbed crayfish-free macroinvertebrate assemblages: one dominated by Oligochaeta vs. one co-dominated by Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera and Mollusca (EPT-codominated). In the laboratory experiment, both crayfish species preferred feeding on Diptera (mostly chironomids), but O. limosus also selected Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera. Family richness did not change, but both species inflated the Shannon Diversity index by reducing Diptera domination. Astacus leptodactylus treatments had higher Shannon Diversity and percentage of EPT abundance compared to O. limosus treatments. Field experiments indicated (1) negative, (2) assemblage-specific, or (3) no effects of O. limosus on macroinvertebrate metrics. A negative effect, especially in the undisturbed assemblage, was observed on simple additive metrics based on taxa presence data, such as total or EPT family richness, or BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) score. Assemblage-specific effects were indicated for some metrics based on relative abundances. In the Oligochaeta-dominated assemblage, Shannon Diversity was inflated and the percentage of Oligochaeta abundance was reduced. In the EPT-codominated assemblage Shannon Diversity was deflated while the relative abundance of Oligochaeta was not affected. No effects were observed when using the ASPT (Average BMWP Score Per Taxon) or percentage of EPT abundance. We conclude that O. limosus may have a more diverse predatory diet than A. leptodactylus, and thus can have a stronger effect on macroinvertebrate taxa sensitive to disturbances. Therefore, the invasion of O. limosus can alter macroinvertebrate assemblages and compromise conventional ecological assessment, even when it displaces resident Astacus species.																	1798-6540	1818-5487				NOV	2017	12	4					523	540		10.3391/ai.2017.12.4.09								WOS:000418011300009

Differential environmental responses of tropical phytoplankton community in the southwest coast of India	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Phytoplankton characteristics (biomass, primary productivity, species composition and community structure) were studied in a tropical estuary (Cochin estuary) and adjacent coastal marine region for understanding the factors controlling their productivity patterns and community dynamics. The Cochin estuary (CE) sustained a high level of inorganic nutrients supporting very high phytoplankton biomass, productivity, and abundance. Though the CE exhibited a 2-3 fold increase in the annual mean of chlorophyll a (14.6 +/- 8.5 mg m(-3)) and primary production (1288 +/- 999 mgC m(-3)d(-1)) than the coastal waters, both regions sustained a substantial dominance of small-sized phytoplankton, in particular nanoplankton (2-20 mu m), which apparently contributed > 70% of total chlorophyll a and primary production. Diatoms were the dominant phytoplankton functional group (> 75% of total abundance) prevailed over both sampling locations almost throughout the year. However, the sporadic dominance of certain species of dinoflagellates (during premonsoon) and green and blue-green algae (during monsoon) were also encountered in the estuary. The SIMPER analysis, based on phytoplankton species abundance data, revealed the presence of certain characterizing species exclusive for both estuary and coastal waters, and most of them belonged to smaller diatoms e. g., Skeletonema costatum, Thalassiosira subtilis, Nitzschia longissima, Cylindrotheca closterium etc. The incessant proliferation of these small sized diatoms, especially in the CE, can be considered as a potential source of consistently higher phytoplankton biomass and primary productivity, and which can even survive in the recurring short-term (tides) and long-term (seasonal) hydrographic changes of the Cochin estuary.

Environmental forcing of intertidal benthic macrofauna of Bodo Creek, Nigeria: Preliminary index to evaluate cleanup of Ogoniland	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Pristine and before-disturbance baseline data are essential tools in monitoring and measurement of progress and net success or otherwise of restoration of degraded ecosystems. These are usually lacking in regions such as the Niger Delta where demands for such data is pressing due to impending pollution. We present a rare case of available pre-spill data of how distribution and abundance of macrobenthic infauna were structured by some physical and chemical variables of interstitial water in Bodo Creek, lower eastern Niger Delta, Nigeria, before two major oil spills impacted the creek in 2008. Monthly composite samples of macrobenthos and interstitial water in four soft-bottom unvegetated intertidal flats were analysed for one year. Thirty six taxa, twenty-two families and four classes of macrozoobenthos were recorded. The bivalves Lorepis aberrans, Macoma innominata, Senilia senilis, and polychaetes Nereis diversicolor, N. virens, N. pelagic and Clymenella torquata were eurizonal in distribution and abundant, attaining sub-dominant and dominant status at the sites. The observed pattern of reduction in rainy season macrofauna abundance in some river systems of the Niger Delta due to sediment instability was counterbalanced by increased recruitment of the dominant taxa. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed the explanatory (physicochemical) variables only accounted for 31.8% of variation in the species data. The species-environmental correlations were: 0.64, 0.74 and 0.72 for the first, second and third axes, respectively. Plans for cleanup, remediation and 'restoration' of Bodo Creek, have reached implementation stage as the Federal Government of Nigeria flagged off cleanup of Ogoniland on June 2, 2016. The usefulness of these data as potential template for monitoring and evaluation of water quality response to the proposed cleanup and restoration is highlighted. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Variability of marine macrofouling assemblages in a marina and a mariculture centre in Bahrain, Arabian Gulf	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Marine biofouling has significant environmental and industrial impacts. Biofouling is considered a specific problem for a wide range of coastal and marine industries, including aquaculture, shipping activities and ports. Colonization and growth of biofouling depend on the complex interactions of biological, physical and chemical factors. Anthropogenic disturbances from coastal modification and water pollution can affect biofouling communities. The coastline of the Arabian Gulf is influenced by marine pollution from a variety of land-based activities. This study investigated spatial and temporal aspects of macrofouling assemblages using experimental panels in a marina and a mariculture centre in Bahrain for a period of one year (2014). Macrofouling assemblages of the two sites differed distinctly in species richness and composition. A total of 38 species was recorded in the mariculture centre compared to eleven species in the marina. Assemblages in the mariculture centre were dominated by hydrozoans, actinozoans, ascidians and sponges, while those in the marina were dominated by tubeworms and barnacles. Different successional patterns were observed in the sampling sites. The sequence of species replacements started by green algae and hydrozoans, followed by actinozoans, ascidians and sponges in the mariculture centre. Brown and green algae, tubeworms and hydrozoans were the earliest successional groups followed by barnacles in the marina. The study provided an initial characterization for the variability of macrofouling assemblages in the naturally and anthropogenically stressed marine environment of the Arabian Gulf.

Effects of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and bream (Abramis brama) on the structure of the littoral community in a mesotrophic lake (Mesocosm Experiments)	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The effect of common carp and bream on hydrochemical parameters, abundance, and structure of phyto-, zooplankton, and macrozoobenthos has been studied in semienclosed mesocosms installed in the littoral zone of a mesotrophic lake. Significant differences in the biomass of different algal groups in mesocosms with fish in respect to the control were established only for diatoms and were not found for other phytoplankton groups. Common carp had a greater effect on the abundance of large zooplankton species (Diaphanosoma brachyurum) compared to bream. The abundance of the small Bosmina longirostris increased in mesocosms both with bream and common carp. The macrozoobenthos biomass reduced at higher rates in mesocosms with common carp than in those with bream, with the strongest effect of common carp on mayfly larvae. The differences between the consumption of chironomid and oligochaete larvae were not established in mesocosms with common carp. Bream mainly affected the larvae of mayflies and oligochaetes and, to a lesser degree, the chironomid larvae.																	1995-4255	1995-4263				NOV	2017	10	6					632	639		10.1134/S1995425517060117								WOS:000418097400005

Ecological resilience in lakes and the conjunction fallacy	NATURE ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												There is a pressing need to apply stability and resilience theory to environmental management to restore degraded ecosystems effectively and to mitigate the effects of impending environmental change. Lakes represent excellent model case studies in this respect and have been used widely to demonstrate theories of ecological stability and resilience that are needed to underpin preventative management approaches. However, we argue that this approach is not yet fully developed because the pursuit of empirical evidence to underpin such theoretically grounded management continues in the absence of an objective probability framework. This has blurred the lines between intuitive logic (based on the elementary principles of probability) and extensional logic (based on assumption and belief) in this field.

Leaf litter additions enhance stream metabolism, denitrification, and restoration prospects for agricultural catchments	ECOSPHERE												Globally intensive agriculture has both increased nitrogen pollution in adjacent waterways and decreased availability of terrestrially derived carbon frequently used by stream heterotrophs in nitrogen cycling. We tested the potential for carbon additions via leaf litter from riparian restoration plantings to act as a tool for enhancing denitrification in agricultural streams with relatively high concentrations of nitrate (1.3-8.1 mg/L) in Canterbury, New Zealand. Experimental additions of leaf packs (N = 200, mass = 350 g each) were carried out in 200-m reaches of three randomly selected treatment streams and compared to three control streams receiving no additional leaf carbon. Litter additions increased ecosystem respiration in treatment streams compared to control streams but did not affect gross primary production, indicating the carbon addition boosted heterotrophic activity, a useful gauge of the activities of microbes involved in denitrification. Bench-top assays with denitrifying enzymes using acetylene inhibition techniques also suggested that the coarse particulate organic matter added from leaf packs would have provided substrates suitable for high rates of denitrification. Quantifying denitrification directly in experimental reaches by open-channel methods based on membrane inlet mass spectrophotometry indicated that denitrification was around three times higher in treatment streams where litter was added compared to control streams. We further assessed the potential for riparian plantings to reduce large-scale downstream nitrogen losses through increasing in-stream denitrification by modeling the effects of increasing riparian vegetation cover on nitrogen fluxes. Here, we combined estimates of in-stream ecosystem processes derived from our experiment with a network model of catchment-scale nitrogen retention and removal based on empirical measurements of nitrogen flux in this typical agricultural catchment. Our model indicated leaf inputs associated with increased riparian cover had the potential to double the catchment level rate of denitrification, offering a promising way to mitigate nitrate pollution in agricultural streams. Altogether, our study indicates that overcoming carbon limitation and boosting heterotrophic processes will be important for reducing nitrogen pollution in agricultural streams and that combining empirical approaches for predictions suggests there are large potential benefits from riparian re-vegetation efforts at catchment scales.

Effects of seasonality and environmental gradients on Spartina alterniflora allometry and primary production	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Predictions of how salt marsh primary production and carbon storage will respond to environmental change can be improved through detailed datasets documenting responses to real-world environmental variation. To address a shortage of detailed studies of natural variation, we examined drivers of Spartina alterniflora stem allometry and productivity in seven marshes across three regions in southern Louisiana. Live-stem allometry varied spatially and seasonally, generally with short stems weighing more (and tall stems weighing less) in the summer and fall, differences that persist even after correcting for flowering. Strong predictive relationships exist between allometry parameters representing emergent stem mass and mass accumulation rates, suggesting that S.alterniflora populations navigate a trade-off between larger mass at emergence and faster rates of biomass accumulation. Aboveground production and belowground production were calculated using five and four approaches, respectively. End-of-season aboveground biomass was a poor proxy for increment-based production measures. Aboveground production (Smalley) ranged from 390 to 3,350gm(-2)year(-1) across all marshes and years. Belowground production (max-min) was on average three times higher than aboveground; total production ranged from 1,400 to 8,500gm(-2)year(-1). Above- and belowground production were both positively correlated with dissolved nutrient concentrations and negatively correlated to salinity. Synthesis: Interannual variation in water quality is sufficient to drive above- and belowground productivity. The positive relationship between nutrients and belowground production indicates that inputs of nutrients and freshwater may increase salt marsh carbon storage and ecosystem resilience to sea level rise.

Recently, several attempts have been made to use eDNA metabarcoding as an alternative tool. However, until now, most applied metabarcoding studies have been based on the taxonomic assignment of sequences that provides reference to morphospecies ecology. Usually, only a small portion of metabarcoding data can be used due to a limited reference database and a lack of phylogenetic resolution. Here, we investigate the possibility to overcome these limitations using a taxonomy-free approach that allows the computing of a molecular index directly from eDNA data without any reference to morphotaxonomy. As a case study, we use the benthic diatoms index, commonly used for monitoring the biological quality of rivers and streams. We analysed 87 epilithic samples from Swiss rivers, the ecological status of which was established based on the microscopic identification of diatom species. We compared the diatom index derived from eDNA data obtained with or without taxonomic assignment. Our taxonomy-free approach yields promising results by providing a correct assessment for 77% of examined sites. The main advantage of this method is that almost 95% of OTUs could be used for index calculation, compared to 35% in the case of the taxonomic assignment approach. Its main limitations are under-sampling and the need to calibrate the index based on the microscopic assessment of diatoms communities.

N.; Hausmann, Axel; Schubart, Christoph D.; Haszprunar, Gerhard			A DNA barcode library for Germanys mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												Mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera) are prominent representatives of aquatic macroinvertebrates, commonly used as indicator organisms for water quality and ecosystem assessments. However, unambiguous morphological identification of EPT species, especially their immature life stages, is a challenging, yet fundamental task. A comprehensive DNA barcode library based upon taxonomically well-curated specimens is needed to overcome the problematic identification. Once available, this library will support the implementation of fast, cost-efficient and reliable DNA-based identifications and assessments of ecological status. This study represents a major step towards a DNA barcode reference library as it covers for two-thirds of Germany's EPT species including 2,613 individuals belonging to 363 identified species. As such, it provides coverage for 38 of 44 families (86%) and practically all major bioindicator species. DNA barcode compliant sequences (500bp) were recovered from 98.74% of the analysed specimens. Whereas most species (325, i.e., 89.53%) were unambiguously assigned to a single Barcode Index Number (BIN) by its COI sequence, 38 species (18 Ephemeroptera, nine Plecoptera and 11 Trichoptera) were assigned to a total of 89 BINs. Most of these additional BINs formed nearest neighbour clusters, reflecting the discrimination of geographical subclades of a currently recognized species. BIN sharing was uncommon, involving only two species pairs of Ephemeroptera. Interestingly, both maximum pairwise and nearest neighbour distances were substantially higher for Ephemeroptera compared to Plecoptera and Trichoptera, possibly indicating older speciation events, stronger positive selection or faster rate of molecular evolution.																	1755-098X	1755-0998				NOV	2017	17	6					1293	1307		10.1111/1755-0998.12683								WOS:000415921900041	28449274

Conservation aquaculture: Shifting the narrative and paradigm of aquaculture's role in resource management	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												In the 21st century, aquaculture is generally characterized as a foe to conservation efforts. Yet, much has changed in the two seemingly disparate practices over the last two decades, motivating an updated evaluation of the scientific evidence for how aquaculture currently impacts conservation, as well as prospects for further alignment and research. Here we present a new perspective on conservation aquaculture, which we redefine as "the use of human cultivation of an aquatic organism for the planned management and protection of a natural resource." Looking across scales of conservation aquaculture that include single species to ecosystem level benefits (and limitations), we highlight ways aquaculture has historically, and is currently being integrated into conservation (e.g., habitat restoration of oyster beds) and areas that could be improved for the protection of critical species and habitats (e.g., aquarium trade of coral reef species). With a more strategic focus, there appears to be notable conservation aquaculture potential via the cultivation of species for harvest that could provide wild harvest alleviation through replacement or supplement particularly for over-exploited species and/or ecosystem services, such as improved water quality and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry on the planet, aligning farming practices with conservation objectives is particularly pressing to ensure that growth happens in the service of conservation in the most effective and sustainable way possible. The sheer potential of conservation aquaculture suggests a tale of redemption for aquaculture and opportunity for conservationists to bring in a new age of collaborative practices to address global issues.																	0006-3207	1873-2917				NOV	2017	215						162	168		10.1016/j.biocon.2017.09.012								WOS:000414883000019						
J	Peters, JR; Granek, EF; de Rivera, CE; Rollins, M				Peters, Joseph R.; Granek, Elise F.; de Rivera, Catherine E.; Rollins, Matthew			Prozac in the water: Chronic fluoxetine exposure and predation risk interact to shape behaviors in an estuarine crab	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Predators exert considerable top-down pressure on ecosystems by directly consuming prey or indirectly influencing their foraging behaviors and habitat use. Prey is, therefore, forced to balance predation risk with resource reward. A growing list of anthropogenic stressors such as rising temperatures and ocean acidification has been shown to influence prey risk behaviors and subsequently alter important ecosystem processes. Yet, limited attention has been paid to the effects of chronic pharmaceutical exposure on risk behavior or as an ecological stressor, despite widespread detection and persistence of these contaminants in aquatic environments. In the laboratory, we simulated estuarine conditions of the shore crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis, and investigated whether chronic exposure (60 days) to field-detected concentrations (0, 3, and 30 ng/L) of the antidepressant fluoxetine affected diurnal and nocturnal risk behaviors in the presence of a predator, Cancer productus. We found that exposure to fluoxetine influenced both diurnal and nocturnal prey risk behaviors by increasing foraging and locomotor activity in the presence of predators, particularly during the day when these crabs normally stay hidden. Crabs exposed to fluoxetine were also more aggressive, with a higher frequency of agonistic interactions and increased mortality due to conflicts with conspecifics. These results suggest that exposure to field-detected concentrations of fluoxetine may alter the trade-off between resource acquisition and predation risk among crabs in estuaries. This fills an important data gap, highlighting how intra- and interspecific behaviors are altered by exposure to field concentrations of pharmaceuticals; such data more explicitly identify potential ecological impacts of emerging contaminants on aquatic ecosystems and can aid water quality management.																	2045-7758					NOV	2017	7	21					9151	9161		10.1002/ece3.3453								WOS:000414873600044	29152204

We used morphological image processing to identify candidate ecological restoration areas based on their proximity to existing natural vegetation. We identified 1,102,720 candidate ecological restoration areas across the continental United States. Candidate ecological restoration areas were concentrated in the Great Plains and eastern United States. We populated the database of candidate ecological restoration areas with 17 attributes related to site content and context, including factors such as soil fertility and roads (site content), and number and area of potentially conjoined vegetated regions (site context) to facilitate its use for site prioritization. We demonstrate the utility of the database in the state of North Carolina, U.S.A. for a restoration objective related to restoration of water quality (mandated by the U.S. Clean Water Act), wetlands, and forest. The database will be made publicly available on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's EnviroAtlas website (http://enviroatlas.epa.gov) for stakeholders interested in ecological restoration.

Interplay of water quality and vegetation in restored wetland plant assemblages from an agricultural landscape	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality degradation from excessive fertilizer use and runoff is a worldwide problem. While this degradation impacts wetlands, these systems can also be a vehicle for water quality improvement. Restoration of wetlands in agricultural landscapes has recently increased, but little work has evaluated the relationship of plant assemblages and water quality parameters in restored, non-treatment wetlands. This study examines the impact of self-designed wetland plant assemblages on nitrogen and sediment dynamics. Thirty mesocosms were seeded with soil from restored wetlands and allowed to develop from the seed bank to emergent assemblages. During the 2015 growing season (seven to nine months after establishment), these assemblages were exposed to treatment loads of nitrogen and sediment, common stressors to wetlands in agricultural landscapes. Water samples were taken up to five days post-treatment in July and September to quantify interactions between the stressors and plant assemblages. Analyses showed plant assemblage identify was not structured by treatment, but by the site of soil origin. Treatment removal rates were influenced by total amount of the stressor present, with nitrogen removal rates being higher, in relative terms, in low nitrogen amended treatments. Additionally, plant quality, not quantity, was linked to nitrogen and sediment loss rates, and over time, elevated nitrogen and sediment loads were associated with decreased plant assemblage quality. This study demonstrates the ability of plants from restored wetlands to affect nutrient and sediment dynamics, with three significantly differing plant assemblages all exhibiting substantial nutrient and sediment reduction capacity. Nevertheless, we also found that in a relatively short time (seven to nine months) common stressors in agricultural settings can significantly impact wetland plant assemblage quality, and that this may be linked to a reduced capacity for nutrient and sediment removal.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		A				255	262		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.034								WOS:000412127500030

Hydrologic and water quality performance of regenerative stormwater conveyance installed to stabilize an eroded outfall	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Conveying concentrated urban runoff to outfall locations frequently leads to stream bank erosion, channel incision, and the formation of headcuts. Installed in an incised eroded channel, regenerative stormwater conveyance (RSC) is a grade-control and treatment system that uses a series of pools and cascades with an underlying sand bed. As a recently developed practice, RSC performance evaluations are needed to improve the design and guide regulatory accreditation. An eroded channel with a 10% longitudinal slope was stabilized with a five-cell system and monitored for a 14-month period. A small capture volume (6-mm design event) and groundwater intrusion resulted in minimal hydrologic benefit. Hydrologic mitigation was attained only for storms less than 12.7 mm. The RSC converted a substantial 50% of inflow to media flow at the second cell; however, the media flow entirely reemerged as surface flow in the saturated downstream pools. Small but statistically significant reductions in event mean concentrations occurred: 17% total suspended sediment (TSS), 17% total phosphorus (TP), and 3% total nitrogen (TN). Water quality improvements occurred primarily between the upstream and second cell, indicating limited processing by the wetter downstream pools. Comparisons between inter-event outflow grab samples and storm event outflow concentrations show nitrogen export during inter-event periods (47% increase in TN concentration). Due to elevated inter-event concentrations, overall mass loading of nitrogen increased. Hydrologic and water quality benefits were garnered only in the first three cells where groundwater intrusion was minimal. Future implementations of RSC are encouraged to account for seasonal high water table elevations that interact with the RSC media and adequately size pool and sand layer capture volumes.

J	McMillan, SK; Noe, GB				McMillan, Sara K.; Noe, Gregory B.			Increasing floodplain connectivity through urban stream restoration increases nutrient and sediment retention	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stream restoration practices frequently aim to increase connectivity between the stream channel and its floodplain to improve channel stability and enhance water quality through sediment trapping and nutrient retention. To measure the effectiveness of restoration and to understand the drivers of these functional responses, we monitored five restored urban streams that represent a range of channel morphology and restoration ages. High and low elevation floodplain plots were established in triplicate in each stream to capture variation in floodplain connectivity. We measured ecosystem geomorphic and soil attributes, sediment and nutrient loading, and rates of soil nutrient biogeochemistry processes (denitrification; N and P mineralization) then used boosted regression trees (BRT) to identify controls on sedimentation and nutrient processing. Local channel and floodplain morphology and position within the river network controlled connectivity with increased sedimentation at sites downstream of impaired reaches and at floodplain plots near the stream channel and at low elevations. We observed that nitrogen loading (both dissolved and particulate) was positively correlated with denitrification and N mineralization and dissolved phosphate loading positively influenced P mineralization; however, none of these input rates or transformations differed between floodplain elevation categories. Instead, continuous gradients of connectivity were observed rather than categorical shifts between inset and high floodplains. Organic matter and nutrient content in floodplain soils increased with the time since restoration, which highlights the importance of recovery time after construction that is needed for restored systems to increase ecosystem functions. Our results highlight the importance of restoring floodplains downstream of sources of impairment and building them at lower elevations so they flood frequently, not just during bankfull events. This integrated approach has the greatest potential for increasing trapping of sediment, nutrients, and associated pollutants in restored streams and thereby improving water quality in urban watersheds.																	0925-8574	1872-6992				NOV	2017	108		A				284	295		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.006								WOS:000412127500033						
J	Julian, P				Julian, Paul, II			Commentary on "Mitsch et al., 2015, Protecting the Florida Everglades wetlands with wetlands: Can stormwater phosphorus be reduced to oligotrophic conditions?"	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed wetlands have been utilized with varying levels of success in an effort to reduce nutrient concentrations entering waterways. In south Florida, stormwater treatment areas (STAs) have been utilizedto remove excessive phosphorus (P) from surface waters for more than two decades with remarkableresults. Even though the STAs have been operational for more than two decade, further improvementof P removal performance is necessary to achieve the desired outflow concentrations. This commentary critically reviews a recently published manuscript concerning the ability of alternative vegetativecommunities' ability to improve STA treatment efficiency. The commentary provides clarification of Everglades STA effluent limit and the total P water quality criterion established for the Everglades ProtectionArea.

Drivers of landscape evolution: multiple regimes and their influence on carbon sequestration in a sub-tropical peatland	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Typically, restoration goals target a point in history, i.e., the pre-human-influence state, however, ecosystems are dynamic and restoration goals must consider the potential evolution of the system, along with primary causes of landscape degradation and the resultant resilience. Using the Everglades as a case study, known disturbances were linked to biogeochemical and vegetation patterns to compare the divergence of the anthropogenically impacted landscape from that expected during natural peatland evolution. Specifically, landscape soil biogeochemistry of similar to 1,100 sites was examined in context of hydroperiod, spatial and temporal trends in water quality from the 1940s through present, elevation, and vegetation communities. This provided a link between carbon (C) accumulation and the influence of anthropogenic alterations. The network of canals created to manage water resulted in a greater ratio of surface water to rainfall contribution to the water budget, restored connectivity of groundwater to surface water, and facilitated overdrainage and mineral and nutrient enrichment of the ecosystem, causing multiple regime shifts and evidence of C loss. This study suggests that restoration can promote the accumulation of minerotrophic peats, but it is difficult to recreate the trajectory towards the ombrotrophic peatland, one of the end members and most C rich portions of the ecosystem, given changes in source waters and connectivity. In addition, a comparison with the literature and paleoecological data confirmed that while phosphorus (P) and C accumulation are positively related, even relatively small increases in P content reduced the proportional C content of peat soils. Overall, this study highlights the need to consider the potential natural trajectories of landscape development, the multiple coexisting resultant regimes, and the importance of soil biogeochemical properties when establishing and prioritizing restoration goals. Given the resilience and feedback loops of the anthropogenically impacted areas, active management of these areas may be necessary if we are to restore the vegetation community composition and biogeochemical characteristics to those of natural regimes, however, some legacy effects will constrain future restoration efforts.																	0012-9615	1557-7015				NOV	2017	87	4					578	599		10.1002/ecm.1269								WOS:000414241400003

To ensure the safety of water consumption of cities in Jingjinji area, we investigated the abundance of three classes of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water and sediment of six water supply reservoirs in this area. The results showed that the detection frequency of sul1, tetM and ermB were 100%. However, the content ranges of these genes were different (10(-5) to 10(-2)/16S gene copies for sul1, 10(-5) to 10(-3)/16S gene copies for ermB, and 10(-5) to 10(-3)/16S gene copies for tetM). The content of ribosome protection proteins (RPP) genes were the highest in all selected tet genes. The highest abundance of ARGs in water and sediment samples was sampled from Panjiakou reservoir and Guanting reservoir, respectively. Except COD, chla and tetM, there are no significant correlation between water quality parameters and ARGs. Overall, this study provides integrated profiles of the three types of ARGs in water supply reservoirs of Jingjinji area and thus helps to re-evaluate the effects of human activities to water supply reservoirs.

H.; Bruun, Hans Henrik			Recovery of lake vegetation following reduced eutrophication and acidification	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In recent decades, many aquatic ecosystems in Europe and North America have experienced reduced inputs of nutrients and acidifying substances because of improved sewage treatment and reduced emission of sulphur oxides. We evaluated the consequences of these efforts to changes in water chemistry, species richness and community composition of aquatic macrophytes in 56 lakes in Denmark around 1990 and again around 2010. 2. Reductions in lake water concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen were strongest in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes, for example, lakes which had been heavily affected by domestic sewage. These changes translated into decreased algal biomass in the most eutrophied lakes. Oligo- and mesotrophic lakes did not change significantly in terms of nutrients or algal biomass. Water clarity increased across all lakes but not significantly in specific trophic lake groups. Alkalinity and pH increased significantly (up to 2pH-units) in low-alkaline lakes, while well-buffered high-alkaline lakes (>0.5meq/L) did not show any change. 3. Macrophyte species richness per lake increased, on average, by 13% during the 20-year study period. The increase was strongest in species preferring nutrient-rich conditions and could be directly attributed to reductions in phytoplankton biomass in lakes of medium water clarity. The similarity among all lakes in terms of species composition increased over the study period. This development was closely related to higher average species richness and was mainly caused by recolonisation of lakes, recovering from past eutrophication, by relatively common species (e.g., Lemna trisulca, Sparganium emersum and Potamogeton berchtoldii). Higher pH in low-alkaline lakes was accompanied by a shift from acid-tolerant to more acid-sensitive species. 4. Our results demonstrate that investment in pollution control has been successful in terms of markedly improving water quality of lakes and, with a time lag, macrophyte species richness. Although relatively common species have spread across lakes and resulted in homogenised macrophyte communities, continued efforts to reduce pollution could ensure the survival of rare specialist species and perhaps even increase their abundance in the future.

Here, we quantify and identify drivers of spatial and temporal beta diversity in diatom assemblages between historical and modern times. Location: United States of America. Major Taxa: StudiedDiatoms. Tim Period: pre-AD 1850 and c. 2007. Methods: Using sedimentary genus-level diatom data from 169 lakes and species-level data for 52 lakes, we computed spatial beta diversity across all lakes and within ecoregions for 2007 and pre-AD 1850 time points. We also computed local contributions to beta diversity (LCBD) and analysed them with respect to environmental variables. Total beta diversity was partitioned into replacement and abundance difference components to identify mechanisms possibly responsible for spatial beta at each time point. Temporal beta diversity indices (TBI) were also computed for each lake by comparing the diatom data of all lakes at the time points. TBIs were decomposed into taxon losses and gains to facilitate interpretation. TBIs and their components were related to contemporary land cover. Results: Temporal beta diversity varied significantly as a function of forest cover, with higher temporal beta in lakes from watersheds with contemporary lower forest cover. Spatial beta diversity was similar between the historical and 2007 time points. Lakes with substantial local contributions to beta diversity were differentiated by water quality and land cover variables at a local scale, but showed no systematic regional pattern. Main conclusions: Spatial beta diversity of diatoms across the U.S.A. does not appear to have changed between pre-AD 1850 and 2007, suggesting that broad-scale land use and hydrological alteration of the landscape has not homogenized these communities. Temporal beta diversity occurred through genus gains and losses and was significantly related to land cover in watersheds. These analyses, pairing spatial and temporal beta diversity, provide insight into the mechanisms maintaining diatom diversity.

J	Eriander, L				Eriander, Louise			Light requirements for successful restoration of eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) in a high latitude environment - Acclimatization, growth and carbohydrate storage	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												The short growth season in high latitude environments pose challenges for eelgrass restoration, particularly in areas that receive little light due to e.g. depth or reduced water quality conditions. In order to improve our understanding of the acclimatization potential of eelgrass to low light and the light requirement for successful restoration of eelgrass, an indoor mesocosm study was performed assessing three light (3, 5 and 10 mol photons m(- 2) day(-1)) and two temperature conditions (12 and 20 degrees C). The aim of the study was to determine if eelgrass transplants originating from a shallow donor meadow with high light could acclimatize to low light conditions and how different light conditions affect growth characteristics and carbohydrate storage of transplants. A second aim was to investigate how eelgrass grown under different light conditions cope during severe shading (zero light) under the two temperature conditions, and how severe shading affect the carbohydrate stock of transplants. The results demonstrate that eelgrass can acclimatize to light levels from 10 down to 3 mol photons m(-2) day(-1) by adjustments in morphology, pigmentation and growth strategy, but with a significant reduction in the production of lateral branches below 5 mol photons m(-2) day(-1). Temperature had a strong positive effect on shoot morphology and above ground biomass production independent of light treatment, but less effect on branching. Furthermore, the study shows that acclimatized eelgrass transplants can store carbohydrates at light levels down to 3 mol photons m(-2) day(-1), but that losses occur in relation to the transplantation process and as a result of severe shading. Survival of transplants during severe shading conditions demonstrated large temperature dependent effects, with no effects of previous light conditions. The results from this study provide important insight into the phenotypic response by eelgrass to environmental conditions and could have important implications for management and restoration of eelgrass in high latitude environments with respect to acclimatization potential and the minimum light requirement for successful restoration.																	0022-0981	1879-1697				NOV	2017	496						37	48		10.1016/j.jembe.2017.07.010								WOS:000412252700006

Forestry best management practices for erosion control in haul road ditches near stream crossings	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Poorly designed and maintained forest road stream crossings can directly link erosion sources to streams. Forestry best management practices (BMPs) provide techniques that are useful for preventing sedimentation associated with ditch erosion. However, few studies have quantified ditch BMP sediment reductions. Thus, our primary objective was to evaluate erosion control effectiveness due to ditch BMPs and secondarily to quantify ditch BMP implementation costs. Sixty ditch segments near stream crossings were reconstructed, and five ditch BMP treatments were applied using a completely randomized design resulting in 11 to 13 replications per treatment. Ditch BMP treatments were (1) bare ditch (Bare), (2) grass seed with lime fertilizer (Seed), (3) grass seed with lime fertilizer and erosion control mat (Mat), (4) rock check dams (Dam), and (5) completely rocked (Rock). Silt fence sediment traps and sediment pins were measured over one year to determine treatment effectiveness. Trapped sediment deposits indicated that median erosion rates were greatest for Dam (6.14 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [2.74 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]), followed by Bare (4.92 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [2.19 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]), Rock (1.73 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [0.77 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]), Seed (1.04 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [0.46 tn ac(-1) y(-1)]), and Mat (0.82 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) [0.37 tn ac(-1) yr(-1)]). Results suggested that Mat treatments had significantly lower erosion rates than Bare and Dam, while Rock and Seed provided intermediate levels. Costs of BMP treatments were least expensive for Seed (US$6.10 approach(-1)), followed by Mat (US$21.33 approach(-1)), Dam (US$71.43 approach(-1)), and Rock (US$141.08 approach(-1)). Results suggest that erosion began to accelerate disproportionately when bare soil levels were between 30% and 50%; therefore, minimum soil cover of 50% is recommended for ditches.

Results show adjacency causes decreases in housing prices between 13 and 14% for the average home. Additionally this negative effect exacerbates with basin age.

Modelling for management: Coral photo-physiology and growth potential under varying turbidity regimes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Suspended and deposited sediments can negatively impact coral health by reducing light penetration and smothering coral tissue. As coral sediment thresholds vary among species and between locations, setting sediment thresholds for the management of activities that increase sediment loads continues to be a challenging goal. Static threshold values used to date do not take into account temporal and spatial variations in a coral's ability to acclimate to high sediment loads leading to either management approaches that are overly conservative or do not protect corals. This study presents a numerical model that quantifies the relationship between coral photosynthesis and growth potential under varying turbidity-driven light regimes. The model accounts for coral acclimation potential as well as a dynamic energy transfer between host and symbiont using field data collected from nearshore reefs in Singapore combined with both established and novel mathematical relationships. The model yielded photosynthetic and respiratory outputs that were comparable to in situ data collected, illustrating the predictive capability of modelling coral growth potential to declines in light driven by suspended sediments. The inclusion of more than one coral species into the model allows for variations in responses to sediments among different coral morphologies and taxa, and will strengthen the predictive capacity for management of sediment related events. As demonstrated here, the model can be used to identify least risk scenarios for dredging operations as a means of both conserving coral reefs as well as ensuring cost-effective management practices.

Long-term acoustic monitoring of fish calling provides baseline estimates of reproductive time-lines in the May River estuary, southeastern USA	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												In this study, our goal was to perform acoustic monitoring of the May River, South Carolina (USA), for a 9 mo period and estimate reproductive timelines for a community of soniferous fishes. Acoustic recorders were deployed to collect sound samples for 2 min, every 20 min at 4 stations from the source to the mouth from February to November 2013. We detected the acoustic presence of 6 fish species: Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus, black drum Pogonias cromis, silver perch Bairdiella chrysoura, oyster toadfish Opsanus tau, spotted sea trout Cynoscion nebulosus, and red drum Sciaenops ocellatus. Acoustic detection rates and diversity of soniferous fish were higher near the mouth and de creased towards the source, suggesting a selection of deeper water and/or more stable water quality conditions for spawning. We estimated the start and end dates of the spawning season and calculated the total hours of chorusing for silver perch, oyster toadfish, spotted seatrout, and red drum. Each species followed a specific seasonal and daily pattern of calling, and we observed synchrony of these calling patterns among stations. For silver perch, oyster toadfish, black drum, and spotted seatrout, a negative tem perature anomaly correlated with decreased calling intensity, while a positive anomaly increased sound production. For oyster toadfish and spotted seatrout, the lunar phase significantly influenced calling. These data serve as a foundation for future studies that are investigating how climate variability may affect seasonal spawning timelines and year class strength of fish populations using passive acoustic monitoring.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				OCT 13	2017	581						1	19		10.3354/meps12322								WOS:000414582700001

The mechanism of red tide occurrence has been studied for many years, and a lot of indicators and techniques have been developed. Although these studies have effectively expanded the knowledge of mechanisms of red tide occurrence, the combination effect of water quality factors of different sea areas on red tide occurrence has not received enough attention. In this paper, a water quality factor dissimilarity network model (WDN), which can systematically reflect water quality of different sea areas, is presented. According to this model, a series of WDN networks are constructed with the data collected from monitoring stations of Bohai Sea and North Yellow Sea, and a novel red tide detection approach based on the outlier analysis of node strengths is proposed. Based on the analysis of the results obtained using this approach, the locality, the seasonality and the alternation of red tide occurrences are revealed. The validation from actual red tide events shows that our model and approach perform effectively and contribute to expanding the knowledge of mechanisms of red tide occurrence. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Wang, P; Benoit, G				Wang, Peng; Benoit, Gaboury			Modeling the biogeochemical role of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria in phosphorus cycling in a managed eutrophic lake	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Vertical distributions of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), sulfide, chlorophyll, and primary production produced by photosynthetic sulfur bacteria (PSB) were studied in a small stratified, highly productive, and dimictic lake, Linsley Pond, CT, USA. The goal was to understand and model the role of PSB in a lake undergoing trophic transformation as a result of lake management involving reduced phosphorus loading. High levels of sulfide developed in the anoxic hypolimnion, though a decrease was observed compared to earlier years, possibly as a result of lake management under a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) process. A deep chlorophyll maximum was observed, and absorption spectra confirmed that it was the result of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria. The summer chlorophyll maximum occurred at an interface marked by high amounts of sulfide and low, but adequate, levels of light. Primary production by PSB was found at a depth of 7 m in July 2008, and thereafter extended slowly to 9 m until late fall overturn. PSB only contributed a minor portion of total primary production in Linsley Pond that year, but a straightforward biogeochemical phosphorus model reveals that the existence of PSB serves as a significant biological barrier for phosphorus being transported back into the upper mixing zone. A large amount of TDP was trapped in the hypolimnion, and upward transport of TDP from the upper boundary of the hypolimnion to the mixing zone was about 30% of external phosphorus loading from the only tributary during the summer stratification period. By comparison, the amount of TDP assimilated by PSB and settling back to the hypolimnion was comparable to external phosphorus loading to the lake from its tributary. As lake management reduces external P loading and productivity, bottom sulfide is likely to decrease, suppressing PSB activity and having the undesired effect of allowing more TDP to be transported upward to the epilimnion as this biological barrier is suppressed.

Effects of changes in nutrient loading and composition on hypoxia dynamics and internal nutrient cycling of a stratified coastal lagoon	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The effects of changes in catchment nutrient loading and composition on the phytoplankton dynamics, development of hypoxia and internal nutrient dynamics in a stratified coastal lagoon system (the Gippsland Lakes) were investigated using a 3-D coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical water quality model. The study showed that primary production was equally sensitive to changed dissolved inorganic and particulate organic nitrogen loads, highlighting the need for a better understanding of particulate organic matter bioavailability. Stratification and sediment carbon enrichment were the main drivers for the hypoxia and subsequent sediment phosphorus release in Lake King. High primary production stimulated by large nitrogen loading brought on by a winter flood contributed almost all the sediment carbon deposition (as opposed to catchment loads), which was ultimately responsible for summer bottom-water hypoxia. Interestingly, internal recycling of phosphorus was more sensitive to changed nitrogen loads than total phosphorus loads, highlighting the potential importance of nitrogen loads exerting a control over systems that become phosphorus limited (such as during summer nitrogen-fixing blooms of cyanobacteria). Therefore, the current study highlighted the need to reduce both total nitrogen and total phosphorus for water quality improvement in estuarine systems.																	1726-4170	1726-4189				OCT 6	2017	14	19					4423	4433		10.5194/bg-14-4423-2017								WOS:000412383600001

This paper presents the results of a study on the diversity and seasonal succession of phytoplankton in Seri Serdang Lake and Faculty of Engineering Lake conducted between November 2013 and February 2014. A total of 27 species from four phyla (Chlorophyta, Euglenophyta, Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyta) and 33 species belonging to Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Euglenophyta and Dinophyta were identified from Seri Serdang Lake and the Faculty of Engineering Lake, respectively. Chlorophyta were most dominant in both lakes. Highest number of species recorded was Monoraphidium sp. in Seri Serdang Lake and Pediastrum tetras in Faculty of Engineering Lake. Seri Serdang Lake had lower phytoplankton density (20 cells ml(-1) to 396 cells ml(-1)) as compared to the Faculty of Engineering Lake (250 cells ml(-1) to 300 cells ml(-1)). Although the distance between the two lakes is short, they do not share the same tributary probably leading to the observed differences in water quality, species diversity and succession pattern.																	0564-3295					OCT	2017	58	3					485	496										WOS:000422760500002

Mapping and valuation of South Africa's ecosystem services: A local perspective	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES					Workshop on Optimizing and Unlocking Investment in Ecological Infrastructure in South Africa	NOV 15-19, 2015	Dept Environm Affairs S Africa, SOUTH AFRICA	Deutsche Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit GmbH, Econ Land Degradat, Ecosystem Serv Partnership, Australian Natil Univ	Dept Environm Affairs S Africa			We used locally-sourced and other relevant information to value ecosystem services provided by South Africa's terrestrial, freshwater and estuarine habitats. Our preliminary estimates suggest that these are worth at least R275 billion per annum to South Africans. Notwithstanding benefits to the rest of the world, natural systems provide a major source of direct income to poor households, and generate significant value in the economy through tourism and property markets, as well as providing considerable non-market benefits. Higher values correspond both to areas of higher biomass, which have higher capacity to supply ecosystem services, and areas of higher population densities, which generate demand as well as threats. The value of regulating services is higher for natural systems closer to population centres. Amenity values are highest in cities and protected areas, with the fragmented green open space areas within cities have among the highest values per ha. Even if the gaps are taken into account, our estimates are far lower than estimates based on average global values, but are likely to be more accurate, relevant and tractable to policymakers. Nevertheless, some services have large global values, the recognition of which is important in developing strategies for financing biodiversity conservation.

Climate change, land degradation and an inherently semi-arid, variable climate are making it increasingly difficult for water service providers to deliver sufficient quantity and quality of water to meet escalating demand. Investments in ecological infrastructure are seldom considered as a way of augmenting water supplies and improving water quality over the long-term. However, hydrological modelling shows that protecting and rehabilitating ecological infrastructure could generate meaningful gains in water quantity in two important South African water supply systems, the Baviaanskloof-Tsitsikamma and uMngeni catchments. The costs of such interventions, as estimated using resource economic techniques, are within the same order of magnitude as built infrastructure solutions. Investments in ecological infrastructure can also have a considerable range of other benefits. These findings make a compelling case for large-scale investment in the rehabilitation and protection of ecological infrastructure, which can be a cost-effective option for achieving water resource planning objectives. The types of rehabilitation activities planned would depend on the needs of local water users. Associated long-term monitoring and research would further improve knowledge of these systems, and provide support for the modelled results.

Converting bahiagrass pasture land to elephantgrass bioenergy production enhances biomass yield and water quality	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Changing pasture land to the production of bioenergy crops will affect regional water dynamics. Returning byproducts of industrial conversion of bioenergy crops like fermentation residual or biochar back to the field could be used to improve sustainable nutrient management, but could also impact water quantity and quality in ways that are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of land-use conversion from low input bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Fliigge) pastures to elephantgrass [Pennisetum purpureum (L.) Schum.] for bioenergy production under different nutrient management practices on biomass yield, crop water dynamics and nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching during growing and dormant seasons. Treatments evaluated were 1) bahiagrass + 50 kg N ha(-1); 2) elephantgrass + 50 kg N ha(-1); 3) elephantgrass + 50 kg N ha(-1) + fermentation residual; 4) elephantgrass + 50 kg N ha(-1) + biochar; and 5) elephantgrass + 250 kg N ha(-1). Data were collected on crop evapotranspiration (ET), water use efficiency, drainage, NO3-N leaching, and aboveground dry matter accumulation. Dry matter yield of elephantgrass was 4- to 7-fold greater than bahiagrass after the first growing season, but was similar among elephantgrass treatments. Elephantgrass produced with no residual amendments reduced drainage (approx. 43% across all growing seasons) compared to bahiagrass, and this reduction was exacerbated in the residual treatments. Reduced drainage was associated with increased ET. Elephantgrass, regardless of treatment, reduced the amount of NO3-N lost through drainage compared to bahiagrass. Therefore, replacing bahiagrass with elephantgrass will increase cropping system water use and diminish the rate of groundwater replenishment during the growing season, which could have detrimental effects for other ecosystem processes that rely on this water resource. However, elephantgrass increased the efficiency with which water was used to produce biomass and reduced NO3-N leaching to groundwater.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				OCT 1	2017	248						20	28		10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.021								WOS:000411539700003

This increases nitrate concentrations in the baseflow of streams, enhancing downstream eutrophication. Conservation practices reduce the impacts from agriculture, but little is documented on the recovery time of shallow groundwater after agriculture ceases and conservation practices are applied. Although conservation practices may reduce groundwater nitrate, they may also lead to the production of the greenhouse gas methane. This study investigated the temporal sequence of applying post-agricultural conservation practices and the effects on nitrate and methane concentrations in shallow groundwater. Harleigh Farms is a complex of fields near Oxford, MD (USA) that have been taken out of crop production and placed in conservation programs at various times after 1997. Groundwater nitrate and dissolved methane were sampled monthly from Nov 2012-Nov 2013 using age of the conservation practice as a proxy for time since fertilization. In this chronosequence study, an exponential decline in groundwater nitrate levels was found over the 16 year time period since last fertilization. Within 3-5 years after the cessation of intensive grain production, groundwater nitrate concentrations in the top of the surface unconfined aquifer dropped from 11 mg NO3--N L-1 to 0.5 mg NO3--N L-1. Methane only accumulated to high concentrations (2-60 mu M CH4) in hydric soils with low nitrate concentrations (<< 0.1 mg NO3--N L-1). Our results indicate rapid loss of nitrate in the top of the surficial aquifer after the cessation of intensive agriculture and seasonal accumulations of methane in wetland-based conservation practices. These data indicate that time series of groundwater nitrate concentrations at the top of the unconfined aquifer can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of agricultural conservation practices.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				OCT 1	2017	248						200	214		10.1016/j.agee.2017.07.026								WOS:000411539700021

Facing a wicked problem with optimism: issues and priorities for coral conservation in Hong Kong	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Economic development and environmental conservation are often seen as opposing forces in the arena of government policy-making. With more than 7 million people and a rich diversity of marine species and habitats, Hong Kong is an excellent case study to explore this dynamic. Despite anthropogenic impacts, Hong Kong still hosts more than 90 species of stony corals within a marine area of 1650 km 2. This is remarkable in light of the global plight of coral reefs, which have been reduced by similar to 80% worldwide in recent decades. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has not been immune to this negative trend with an unfortunate track of marine environmental disasters and, as such, can be viewed a harbinger for the future trajectory of coral reefs worldwide. Yet, the story is not entirely negative. Hong Kong possesses key assets, including capable government environmental agencies and competitive research led by local universities, which can bring novel and promising approaches for coral biodiversity conservation in an urbanized context. To coordinate and assist conservation efforts in Hong Kong, we here identify and prioritize major management efforts and identify knowledge gaps for coral conservation based on updated coral biodiversity distribution and a current literature review. Specifically, we propose five priorities for the most positive impact on conservation efforts: (1) reconstruct environmental baselines and establish long-term monitoring of local coral communities, (2) enhance the management and protection of local coral habitats, (3) improve water quality, (4) gain an understanding of the genetic connectivity among local and distant coral communities, and finally, (5) establish an active restoration program for local coral species/communities. In order to build progressive and integrative management strategies for coral biodiversity conservation in Hong Kong, we suggest specific ways in which these priorities be addressed and encourage a fresh dialogue between the government, the public and academia.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				OCT	2017	26	11					2521	2545		10.1007/s10531-017-1383-z								WOS:000412139000001

Model parameters for representative wetland plant functional groups	ECOSPHERE												Wetlands provide a wide variety of ecosystem services including water quality remediation, biodiversity refugia, groundwater recharge, and floodwater storage. Realistic estimation of ecosystem service benefits associated with wetlands requires reasonable simulation of the hydrology of each site and realistic simulation of the upland and wetland plant growth cycles. Objectives of this study were to quantify leaf area index (LAI), light extinction coefficient (k), and plant nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) concentrations in natural stands of representative plant species for some major plant functional groups in the United States. Functional groups in this study were based on these parameters and plant growth types to enable process-based modeling. We collected data at four locations representing some of the main wetland regions of the United States. At each site, we collected on-the-ground measurements of fraction of light intercepted, LAI, and dry matter within the 2013-2015 growing seasons. Maximum LAI and k variables showed noticeable variations among sites and years, while overall averages and functional group averages give useful estimates for multisite simulation modeling. Variation within each species gives an indication of what can be expected in such natural ecosystems. For P and K, the concentrations from highest to lowest were spikerush (Eleocharis macrostachya), reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), smartweed (Polygonum spp.), cattail (Typha spp.), and hardstem bulrush (Schoenoplectus acutus). Spikerush had the highest N concentration, followed by smartweed, bulrush, reed canary grass, and then cattail. These parameters will be useful for the actual wetland species measured and for the wetland plant functional groups they represent. These parameters and the associated process-based models offer promise as valuable tools for evaluating environmental benefits of wetlands and for evaluating impacts of various agronomic practices in adjacent areas as they affect wetlands.

Trophic state indicators are a better predictor of Florida bass condition compared to temperature in Florida's freshwater bodies	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Forecasted increases in global temperatures will likely have profound effects on freshwater fishes. Overlaid on increasing global temperatures, human populations are expected to grow, which will increase anthropogenic nutrient enrichment in freshwater ecosystems. Florida (US) represents the equatorial range limit for many freshwater fishes, thus these species are potentially at risk to climate warming. Likewise, Florida's population is expected to aggressively expand, increasing risk for nutrient enrichment. In this study, we examined whether maximum water temperatures or trophic state indicators (a proxy for nutrient enrichment) better explains variation in Florida Bass (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) condition across 23 different Florida freshwater bodies distributed throughout the state. Florida Bass lengths and weights, temperature, and chlorophyll-alpha, total phosphorous (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) measures were collected in the late summer and fall from 2010 to 2012. We described relationships between bass relative condition and environmental measurements (temperature, and trophic state indicators) across these lake-year combinations using linear and non-linear regressions. We found no significant relationship between temperature and bass condition (r(2) = 0.01). However, we found that trophic state indicators did predict bass condition (r(2) = 0.39-0.50). Though research is needed to more rigorously assess the effects of rising temperature on bass condition, our results may suggest that lake productivity is currently an influential driver on Florida Bass. As such, management efforts should continue to closely monitor and manage water quality and potential nutrient enrichment in Florida's freshwater waters, as bass condition appears to be closely tied to lake productivity.																	0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2017	100	10					1181	1192		10.1007/s10641-017-0635-9								WOS:000412840700003

Loudoun reservoir, Tennessee (USA)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Following water quality and minimum flow improvements to the impounded Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) have been restocked annually since 2000. Our goal was to seasonally assess foraging mode of this recovering population in Ft. Loudoun Reservoir in the Upper Tennessee River. During 2014-15, individuals were captured using trot-lines in a 13-km reach that supports the greatest density of lake sturgeon. We used colonic flushing and gastric lavage techniques to obtain diet. We took systematic benthic sediment grabs along multiple transects throughout the reach and opportunistically deployed rock cages filled with hard substrates to assess potential prey that colonize hard surfaces. Foraging modes of lake sturgeon were determined by comparing relative abundances of invertebrate taxa in the gut contents (6581 invertebrates) of 28 fish to the relative abundances of the same invertebrate taxa collected from the resource base (1667 invertebrates). Proportional similarity, Levin's niche breadth, and Manly's index were used to assess the degree of prey selectivity. Lake sturgeon fed selectively on a narrow range of available prey consisting mostly of larval chironomids (93% composition by number during warm season, 96% during cool season), some genera of which they prey upon selectively, primarily Chironomus sp., but to a lesser extent Procladius, Ablabesmyia, Coelotanypus, and Cryptochironomus spp. Meanwhile, other abundant taxa in the resource base were avoided, such as Oligochaetes, Hexagenia mayflies, and the chironomid Glyptotendipes. Our results illustrate that assessing seasonally available prey from habitat utilized by lake sturgeon is important when investigating diet preference.																	0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2017	100	10					1301	1314		10.1007/s10641-017-0643-9								WOS:000412840700011

A methodology for relating wetland configuration to human disturbance in Alberta	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Widespread loss of wetland ecosystems resulting from human land use highlights the need for a reclamation strategy that can sustain wetland ecosystem services. Since wetland function partly depends on landscape structure, reclamation and monitoring can be aided by knowing the differences in wetland configuration between undisturbed and disturbed landscapes. Objectives Identify a parsimonious set of landscape metrics for quantifying wetland configuration and land-cover composition, and quantify how these metrics vary with anthropogenic disturbance. Methods A large suite of landscape metrics quantifying area/edge, shape, aggregation, and diversity were calculated for landscapes in the Grassland, Parkland, and Boreal Natural Regions of Alberta. Variable reduction techniques were applied to identify representative metrics. These representative metrics were related to anthropogenic disturbance using non-parametric tests. Results The spatial configuration of wetlands in low-disturbance and high-disturbance landscapes were significantly different from other landscapes. Aggregation metrics were the most commonly identified measures of wetland configuration independent of wetland-proportion in the landscape. Conclusions Our findings provide insight for reclamation and monitoring by showing that some aspects of wetland configuration vary independently of composition, and therefore both need to be considered when parameterizing the design of reclaimed landscapes. We suggest that using landscape metrics in a reference condition approach is appropriate for evaluating landscape degradation and for setting landscape reclamation targets and monitoring programs.																	0921-2973	1572-9761				OCT	2017	32	10					2059	2076		10.1007/s10980-017-0566-z								WOS:000412693200010

However, few large-scale studies have compared the performance of DNA metabarcoding with that of routine morphological identification. 2. We performed metabarcoding using four primer sets on macroinvertebrate samples from 18 stream sites across Finland. The samples were collected in 2013 and identified based on morphology as part of a Finnish stream monitoring program. Specimens were morphologically classified, following standardised protocols, to the lowest taxonomic level for which identification was feasible in the routine national monitoring. 3. DNA metabarcoding identified more than twice the number of taxa than the morphology-based protocol, and also yielded a higher taxonomic resolution. For each sample, we detected more taxa by metabarcoding than by the morphological method, and all four primer sets exhibited comparably good performance. Sequence read abundance and the number of specimens per taxon (a proxy for biomass) were significantly correlated in each sample, although the adjusted R-2 values were low. With a few exceptions, the ecological status assessment metrics calculated from morphological and DNA metabarcoding datasets were similar. Given the recent reduction in sequencing costs, metabarcoding is currently approximately as expensive as morphology-based identification. 4. Using samples obtained in the field, we demonstrated that DNA metabarcoding can achieve comparable assessment results to current protocols relying on morphological identification. Thus, metabarcoding represents a feasible and reliable method to identify macroinvertebrates in stream bioassessment, and offers powerful advantage over morphological identification in providing identification for taxonomic groups that are unfeasible to identify in routine protocols. To unlock the full potential of DNA metabarcoding for ecosystem assessment, however, it will be necessary to address key problems with current laboratory protocols and reference databases.

Role of a naturally varying flow regime in Everglades restoration	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The Everglades is a low-gradient floodplain predominantly on organic soil that undergoes seasonally pulsing sheetflow through a network of deepwater sloughs separated by slightly higher elevation ridges. The seasonally pulsing flow permitted the coexistence of ridge and slough vegetation, including the persistence of productive, well-connected sloughs that seasonally concentrated prey and supported wading bird nesting success. Here we review factors contributing to the origin and to degradation of the ridge and slough ecosystem in an attempt to answer How much flow is needed to restore functionality? A key restoration objective is to increase sheetflow lost during the past century to reestablish interactions between flow, water depth, vegetation production and decomposition, and transport of flocculent organic sediment that build and maintain ridge and slough distinctions. Our review finds broad agreement that perturbations of water level depth and its fluctuations were primary in the degradation of landscape functions, with critical contributions from perturbed water quality, and flow velocity and direction. Whereas water levels are expected to be improved on average across a range of restoration scenarios that replace between 79 and 91% of predrainage flows, the diminished microtopography substantially decreases the probability of timely improvements in some areas whereas others that retain microtopographic differences are poised for restoration benefits. New advances in predicting restoration outcomes are coming from biophysical modeling of ridge-slough dynamics, system-wide measurements of landscape functionality, and large-scale flow restoration experiments, including active management techniques to kick-start slough regeneration.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				OCT	2017	25			1	SI		S27	S38		10.1111/rec.12558								WOS:000414165700003

Water quality implications of hydrologic restoration alternatives in the Florida Everglades, United States	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The use of models to generate future scenarios is an important tool for restoration planning. We used a scenario modeling approach to examine water quality implications of five options for Everglades hydrologic restoration. In oligotrophic Everglades wetlands, phosphorus (P) inputs exceeding 10 mu g/L cause P accumulation in soils and a shift to cattail marsh. Everglades restoration seeks to improve wetland hydrology while ensuring that delivered water contains no more than 10 mu g P/L (long-term average). Outputs from a landscape-scale ecological model, the Everglades Landscape Model (ELM), showed that P concentrations in new water inputs will be controlled by P uptake by constructed treatment wetlands and by the movement of legacy P. Benthic periphyton responds quickly to changes in P, initiating a eutrophication response cascade, so we used ELM output to drive periphyton response models that predicted abundance, quality, and composition. All five restoration scenarios had similar effects on these three attributes in Everglades National Park, but variable responses across the other wetland units depended on water delivery and legacy P mobilization. Periphyton biomass was considerably reduced in scenarios that maximized freshwater delivery, but predicted values for periphyton total P were below the legal P concentration maximum in most of the Everglades. Benthic algal edibility increased more than 4-fold, with the greatest increases in the deeper water areas. To meet water quality standards for the five restoration scenarios, we estimated that Everglades restoration should include an additional 105-156 km(2) of treatment marshes upstream of surface water inflows to the landscape.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				OCT	2017	25			1	SI		S48	S58		10.1111/rec.12513								WOS:000414165700005						
J	Pajunen, V; Luoto, M; Soininen, J				Pajunen, Virpi; Luoto, Miska; Soininen, Janne			Unravelling direct and indirect effects of hierarchical factors driving microbial stream communities	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: The diversity and distributions of organisms are jointly influenced by local environment and large-scale variables, such as land cover patterns, dispersal processes and climate. However, the drivers of microbial diversity are complex and the pathways of these drivers' effects are to date largely unresolved, especially in freshwaters. We disentangled the causal direct and indirect effects of climate, land cover and water chemistry on stream diatom communities using hierarchical settings. Location: Finland, a geographical gradient of c. 1200 km (60 degrees-70 degrees N). Methods: We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to analyse patterns in diatom richness, composition and the uniqueness of species composition in 143 streams. The community composition was defined as the value of the first axis in non-metric multidimensional scaling and the uniqueness of species composition of each site as its local contribution to beta diversity. Results: Species richness was mainly affected directly by energy and resource availability, increasing with nutrients but decreasing with growing degree days (GDD). The community composition was strongly influenced directly by conductivity and mainly indirectly by anthropogenic land use but also to a lesser degree by GDD (directly and indirectly), indirectly by precipitation and directly by the amount of boreal wetlands. The uniqueness of species composition increased with conductivity but decreased with nutrient concentrations with high number of unique species in southernmost and northernmost sites. Main conclusions: Our SEM analyses revealed some of the important links between climate, land cover and water chemistry, all of which influenced the microbial diversity. Energy availability has varying indirect and direct effects on diatom communities regardless of local stream conditions, whereas land cover patterns affect aquatic communities most likely indirectly through water chemistry. Collectively, these results suggest that it is important to consider environmental variables simultaneously at different hierarchically ordered scales in macroecological and biogeographical research.

J	Wang, HB; Qin, J; Hu, YH				Wang, Hongbing; Qin, Jun; Hu, Yonghong			Are green roofs a source or sink of runoff pollutants?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Retention of rainwater runoff is a primary function of green roofs in their contribution as one of the main indicators of "Sponge City". However, the influence of green roofs on runoff quality and whether they are a source or sink of pollutants is ambiguous. A concept model of pollutant cycling is proposed in this paper, based on a systematic literature review, which includes the direct factors substrate and structure of the green roof system; and indirect factors such as plant species, irrigation, fertilizer, atmospheric deposition, and age of the green roof. In addition, the model identifies each factor as a pollutant source or sink and explores relations among the factors. Examples in the literature were drawn to demonstrate the factors and pollutant materials including metallic elements such as Zn, Pb, Cd, Fe, Mn, Cr, Cu, and Ca; and nutrients such as N, NO3--N, NH4-N, DON, P, PO43--P, K, and DOC. The concept of "moderate growth vigor" is proposed; moderate growth is optimal for runoff quality and low and persistent fertility, and a low benchmark to control diseases and insect pests. The concept of "clean sources and pollutant retention" should be adopted, i.e., pollutant sources such as substrate, irrigation water, fertilizer, pesticide, and other local pollution sources should be removed or cleaned, and pollutants should be detained or decreased by plant degradation, slow-release material, filter layer, and actinic and microbial degradation. These results will aid understanding of the mechanism of runoff pollution and improve stormwater runoff quality from source to sink in green roofs.

Impacts of gravel jetting on the composition of fish spawning substrates: Implications for river restoration and fisheries management	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Fine sediments can impact river biota, with egg and larval stages of lithophilic fish particularly sensitive to deposition of sand- to clay-sized particles ('fines') in spawning gravels. Mitigation and restoration methods include jetting to cleanse gravels of fines. Despite wide application, impacts of jetting on gravel composition and quality have rarely been quantified. Here, gravel jetting impacts on sediment composition in the River Great Ouse (UK), were tested during an in-situ experiment completed at riffle (55.6 +/- 13.4 m(2)) and patch (0.3 m(2)) scales to determine its magnitude and persistence on surface and subsurface substrate conditions. Before-after (riffle) and control-impact (patch) designs were used, with bedload sediment traps installed downstream of experimental patches to investigate the sediments mobilised during jetting. At the riffle scale, surface grain size was significantly altered; fines were removed resulting in coarser and better-sorted sediments. Similar patterns were detected at the patch scale, although sediment sorting was not significantly altered. Despite reduced fine sediment content of subsurface gravels at the riffle scale, the overall grain size composition was not significantly altered. At the patch scale, no subsurface improvements were detected. Temporally, at the riffle scale, no changes in surface or subsurface sediments lasted more than 12 months; patch scale changes generally persisted for less than 3 months. Thus, whilst gravel jetting could improve spawning gravel quality for surface spawning fishes, including European barbel Barbus barbus, its effects are short-lived. Because subsurface sediments are not affected by gravel jetting, the benefits are limited for redd-building fishes, such as salmonids. Consequently, reducing fine sediment delivery to rivers, such as by changes in agricultural practices, is more sustainable for managing excessive river sedimentation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Almuktar, SAAAN; Abed, SN; Scholz, M				Almuktar, Suhad A. A. A. N.; Abed, Suhail N.; Scholz, Miklas			Recycling of domestic wastewater treated by vertical-flow wetlands for irrigation of two consecutive Capsicum annuum generations	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Due to water scarcity, there is great interest in reusing various nutrient-rich wastewaters. The aim of this article is consequently to evaluate if domestic wastewater treated by various wetland systems can be successfully recycled to irrigate generations of commercial crops such as Chilli (Capsicum annuum) grown in compost within a laboratory environment to obtain a cultivar adapted to domestic wastewater. The corresponding objectives were to assess the irrigation water for long-term growth when applying recycled wastewater, the impact of various wastewaters subject to the wetland characteristics, the impact of treated wastewater volume for irrigation, and the economic return of different experimental set-ups in terms of marketable yields. The vertical-flow wetlands treated domestic wastewater well, meeting the irrigation water quality standards for most water quality parameters, except for phosphorus (4.2 +/- 0.48 mg/l), ammonia-nitrogen (4.2 +/- 2.64 mg/l), potassium (7.0 +/- 3.03 mg/l) and total coliforms (69647 +/- 64852.6 CFU/100 ml), which showed high values significantly (p < 0.05) exceeding common thresholds set for irrigation applications of 2 mg/l, 5 mg/l, 2 mg/l, and 1000 CFU/100 ml. Chilli generations were grown successfully when applying wastewater treated by wetlands and organic soil. High Chilli generation yields concerning economic return were linked with wetlands containing small aggregates with long contact and resting times and fed with a high inflow loading rate (undiluted wastewater), releasing more nutrients into their effluent producing the best fruit quality with respect to weight, length and width resulting in a greater marketable profit of about 46% compared with the others. First generation Chilli plants were grown with considerably shorter heights and produced abundant fruit numbers, which were harvested earlier than their mothers due to the reduction (approximately 55%) of irrigation water volume used for them compared to their mothers. However, excessive nutrients applied on mother plants via irrigation water resulted in better fruit quality regarding dimensions and weights compared with their corresponding first generation plants, leading to a greater marketable profit by about 25%.

J	Shrestha, S; Farrelly, J; Eggleton, M; Chen, YS				Shrestha, Sagar; Farrelly, John; Eggleton, Michael; Chen, Yushun			Effects of conservation wetlands on stream habitat, water quality and fish communities in agricultural watersheds of the lower Mississippi River Basin	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetland conservation programs (e.g., Wetland Reserve Program and Conservation Reserve Program) have been implemented throughout the Mississippi River Basin to reduce environmental impacts from agricultural activities. However, there is limited information on the overall effectiveness of these programs on improving stream ecological conditions. To address this issue, replicate streams from southeastern Arkansas draining watersheds containing predominately croplands (n = 4, termed "cropland") and created wetlands (n = 4, termed "wetland") were monitored monthly from August 2012 through July 2013. Although repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) detected many significant time x stream type interactions, several habitat parameters and total habitat scores exhibited a general improvement in wetland streams. Some water quality conditions were better in wetland streams (e.g., lower turbidity, total suspended solids, and nutrient) compared to cropland streams. The time (season) effect was significant (p < 0.05) for 13 of the 14 water quality parameters measured, meaning that water quality varied seasonally. Among the water quality parameters measured, three (water temperature, pH, and turbidity) exhibited significant (p < 0.05) time x stream type interaction, meaning that the stream type effect was not consistent through time (seasons). Fish community sampling collected 6543 specimens from 12 species during the study period; 4410 and 2133 fish specimens were collected from cropland and wetland streams, respectively. Fish community metrics such as species diversity, species evenness, and species richness index were not significantly (p > 0.05) greater in wetland streams. Overall, the conservation wetlands in the Lower Mississippi River Basin appear to have significantly improved stream habitat and moderately improved water quality, though no significant fish community effect was detected.

In this study, the spatial and temporal variability in nitrate (NO3-), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was analyzed in the Selke (Germany) river continuum from three headwaters draining 1-3 km(2) catchments to two downstream reaches representing spatially integrated signals from 184-456 km(2) catchments. Three headwater catchments were selected as archetypes of the main landscape units (land use x lithology) present in the Selke catchment. Export regimes in headwater catchments were interpreted in terms of NO3-, DOC and SRP land-to-stream transfer processes. Headwater signals were subtracted from downstream signals, with the differences interpreted in terms of in-stream processes and contributions from point sources. The seasonal dynamics for NO3- were opposite those of DOC and SRP in all three headwater catchments, and spatial differences also showed NO3- contrasting with DOC and SRP. These dynamics were interpreted as the result of the interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes, for which riparian zones were hypothesized to play a determining role. In the two downstream reaches, NO3- was transported almost conservatively, whereas DOC was consumed and produced in the upper and lower river sections, respectively. The natural export regime of SRP in the three headwater catchments mimicked a point-source signal (high SRP during summer low flow), which may lead to overestimation of domestic contributions in the downstream reaches. Monitoring the river continuum from headwaters to downstream reaches proved effective to jointly investigate land-to-stream and in-stream transport, and transformation processes.

J	Park, JY; Ale, S; Teague, WR				Park, Jong-Yoon; Ale, Srinivasulu; Teague, W. Richard			Simulated water quality effects of alternate grazing management practices at the ranch and watershed scales	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Inappropriate grazing management with high stocking rates can result in significantly higher levels of runoff, sediment and nutrient losses to surface water resources. An assessment of water quality effects of various grazing management practices enables the selection of appropriate management practices. The overall objective of this study was to assess the impacts of alternate grazing management practices including the heavy continuous (HC), light continuous (LC) and adaptive multi-paddock (MP) grazing, and no grazing (EX; exclosure) on water quality at the ranch and watershed scales in the rangeland-dominated (71% rangeland) Clear Creek Watershed (CCW) in north central Texas using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The SWAT model was calibrated and validated for water quality predictions using the measured data on county-level crop yield (1980-2013), and monthly sediment (1994-2009), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads (1986-2009) at the watershed outlet. The ranch-scale assessment results at two study ranches indicated that when the grazing management was changed from the baseline MP grazing to HC grazing, the simulated average (1980-2013) annual surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP losses increased within the ranges of 106%-117%, 6.0-8.1 ton ha(-1), 8.3-11.5 kg ha(-1), and 1.6-2.6 kg ha(-1), respectively. At the watershed-scale, shifting grazing management from the baseline HC grazing to the improved MP grazing decreased surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP loads by 47.0%, 39.7%, 35.1% and 34.1%, respectively. Thus, adaptive MP grazing was found to be the best grazing management practice for the CCW in terms of water quality protection and improvement in ecosystem functions such as reduced soil erosion and increased nutrient retention at both ranch and watershed scales. However, the magnitudes of water quality benefits due to adoption of MP grazing vary according to the extent of grazing lands in a watershed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

We combined statistical (spectral analysis and Machine learning techniques) and physically based models to generate, for the first time in this system, a predictive tool of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a) and composition (morphology-based functional groups). The results, based on a 11-year time series, revealed two alternating phases in the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass. One phase is characterized by high inorganic turbidity and low phytoplankton biomass, and the other by low inorganic turbidity and variable (low and high) phytoplankton biomass. A threshold of turbidity (29 TNU), above which phytoplankton remains with low biomass (<15-20 ug/l) was established. The periods of high turbidity, which in total cover 30% of the time series, start abruptly and are related to external forcing. Meteorological conditions associated with the beginning of these periods were modeled through a regression tree analysis. These conditions consist of moderate to high wind intensities from the SW direction, in some cases combined with high antecedent precipitation or low water level. The results from the physically-based modeling indicated that the long decaying time-scale of turbidity and intermediate resuspension events could explain the prolonged length of the high turbidity periods (similar to 1.5 years). Random Forests models for the prediction of phytoplankton biomass and composition in periods of low turbidity resulted in a proportion of explained variance and a classification error over a test sample of 0.46 and 0.34 respectively. Turbidity, conductivity, temperature and water level were within the most important model predictors. The development and improvement of this type of modeling is needed to provide management tools to water managers in the current water supply situation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The model was calibrated and validated using pilot-scale experimental data, with satisfactory results. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) values were 0.86 and 0.03 for TP, 0.71 and 0.38 for TN, 0.93 and 6.78 for Chl a, and 0.99 and 27.61 for submerged macrophyte biomass. The GBAEDM was then used to choose appropriate species and suitable initial plant biomass submerged macrophyte recovery in Gonghu Bay. The appropriate species at 1 m depth were Vallisneria spinulosa (1150 g/m(2)), Myriophyllum spicatum (525 g/m(2)), and V. spinulosa-M. spicatum mixed (600 g/m(2); 3:1) communities. At 2 m depth, the appropriate species were M. spicatum (1450 g/m(2)) and V. spinulosa M. spicatum mixed (1950 g/m(2); 12:1) communities. Only M. spicatum (1608 g/m(2)) was recommended at 3 m depth. Finally, the GBAEDM was used to determine the critical water transparency thresholds for submerged macrophytes in Gonghu Bay. A transparency value of 0.62 m at 2 m (the WT/H value of 0.31) was determined as the critical underwater light threshold for the recovery of submerged macrophytes in Gonghu Bay.

Influence of Different Habitat Factors on Creek Chub (Semotilus atromaculatus) within Channelized Agricultural Headwater Streams	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Natural history information on habitat relationships of Semotilus atromaculatus (Creek Chub) in channelized agricultural headwater streams in the northeastern region of North America is limited. We hypothesized that Creek Chubs within channelized agricultural headwater streams would be more strongly influenced by instream habitat than other physical and chemical habitat variables. We sampled Creek Chubs and measured watershed characteristics, riparian habitat characteristics, geomorphology, instream habitat characteristics, and water chemistry in 14 channelized agricultural headwater streams in central Ohio from 2006 to 2011. We found that the abundance, mean length, and biomass of Creek Chub were most strongly influenced by watershed characteristics (land use, soil type) and geomorphology (channel shape, channel size). Our results indicate that conservation and restoration practices designed to mitigate physical habitat degradation are most likely to benefit Creek Chub within channelized agricultural headwater streams.																	1092-6194	1938-5307				SEP	2017	24				8		18	44										WOS:000419391200003

On the outflow of Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Lake Maracaibo, an important wet coastal area located in the Caribbean Sea, is connected to the Gulf of Venezuela by a narrow, shallow channel known as Barra de Maracaibo. The water quality of this is poor owing to the very low water rate exchange with the Gulf. The authors make use of sea surface temperature (SST) satellite imagery and numerical modelling to study the conditions of the outflow of Lake Maracaibo. The lake is found to be fully driven by the circulation out of the lake. Three different situations are considered: upwelling, no upwelling, and the transient state between them. The authors propose conceptual and numerical models to explain the conditions for outflow. Moreover, it is found that outflow is possible only when the tradewinds stop and before the warmer waters of the Caribbean have reached the Colombian coasts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

Detecting invertebrate species in archived collections using next-generation sequencing	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												Invertebrate biodiversity measured at mostly family level is widely used in biological monitoring programmes to assess anthropogenic impacts on ecosystems. However, next-generation sequencing (NGS) could allow development of new more sensitive biomonitoring tools by allowing rapid species identification. This could be accelerated if archived invertebrate collections and environmental information from past programmes are used to understand species distributions and their environmental responses. In this study, we take archived macroinvertebrate samples from two sites collected on multiple occasions and test whether NGS can successfully detect species. Samples had been stored in 70% ethanol at room temperature for up to 12 years. Three amplicons ranging from 197 to 274 bps within the DNA barcode region were amplified from samples and compared to DNA barcoding libraries to identify species. We were able to amplify partial DNA barcodes from most samples, and species were often detected with multiple amplicons. However, some singletons and taxa poorly covered by DNA barcoding were missed. This suggests additional DNA barcodes will be required to fill 'gaps' in current DNA barcode libraries for aquatic macroinvertebrates and/or that it may not be possible to detect all taxa in a sample. Furthermore, older samples often detected fewer taxa and were less reliable for amplification, suggesting NGS is best used on samples within 8 years of collection. Nevertheless, many common taxa with existing DNA barcodes were reliably identified with NGS and were often present at sites across multiple years, showing the potential of NGS for detecting common and abundant species in archived material.																	1755-098X	1755-0998				SEP	2017	17	5					915	930		10.1111/1755-0998.12644								WOS:000415921600008	27987268

M.; Specken, Bart; Ottburg, Fabrice			Impact of invasive crayfish on water quality and aquatic macrophytes in the Netherlands	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Several species of invasive crayfish have become established in the Netherlands, the most recent addition being Orconectes virilis. Since crayfish are known to impact water quality and aquatic macrophytes in areas they invade, this study investigated whether this was also the case for this species under Dutch conditions and if so, whether a crayfish density producing "no effects" could be established. We focussed on the potential impact of O. virilis on water quality variables (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and turbidity), as well as their impact on submerged and emergent macrophytes. In a compartment experiment with different densities of O. virilis, statistically significant effects were observed at crayfish densities of 1.25 crayfish/m(2) on electrical conductivity, turbidity, submersed macrophyte biomass, and the emergent plant Sagittaria sagittifolia, due to crayfish actively severing plants and physically disturbing the sediment. No statistically significant differences with controls were observed at a density of 0.63 crayfish/m(2). Since densities of 0.03 to 5 crayfish/m(2) have been found in different water types in the Netherlands, this indicates that the water quality and macrophyte biomass in Dutch waters are being negatively impacted by invasive crayfish. As a consequence, attempts to reach a good ecological status as required in the Water Framework Directive will be frustrated by the presence of this invader.																	1798-6540	1818-5487				SEP	2017	12	3			SI		397	404		10.3391/ai.2017.12.3.12								WOS:000413823900012

In previous studies of lake quality target management, the water quality targets were poorly correlated with watershed pollutant reduction, and most studies lacked visualized management platform that covered all elements including lakes, in-lake estuaries, rivers and watershed regions. In this study, a browser/server-based visualization platform for lake quality target management was developed. Five models that covered both the watershed and lake scales were integrated based on two critical functions. First, the proposed method can be used to determine watershed pollutant reduction amounts based on certain lake quality target parameters, such as those for TN, TP, NH3N and COD. Second, the method can simulate the lake quality trends associated with different watershed adjustment plans. The platform was deployed by the Taihu Basin Authority (TBA) of the Ministry of Water Resources. Overall, this platform is a useful tool for watershed-lake environmental management.																	1574-9541	1878-0512				SEP	2017	41						40	53		10.1016/j.ecoinf.2017.07.008								WOS:000412261000005						
J	Hagger, V; Dwyer, J; Wilson, K				Hagger, Valerie; Dwyer, John; Wilson, Kerrie			What motivates ecological restoration?	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Ecological restoration projects are motivated by diverse environmental and social reasons. Motivations likely vary between stakeholders or regions, and influence the approach taken to plan, implement, and monitor restoration projects. We surveyed 307 people involved in the restoration of native vegetation across Australia to identify their underlying motivations. We also elicited information on planning, implementation, and monitoring of restoration projects. We found that biodiversity enhancement is the main motivation for undertaking restoration, with biodiversity offsetting, water quality improvements, and social reasons as important secondary motivations. Motivations varied significantly by stakeholder type and region. Restoration projects primarily motivated by ecosystem service provision (e.g. water quality improvements and social reasons) sought less pristine ecological outcomes than projects motivated by biodiversity enhancement or offsetting. Rigorous monitoring designs (e.g. quantitative, repeatable surveys, and use of performance indicators) were rarely used in restoration projects, except for projects motivated by scientific research. Better alignment of different restoration motivations with the planning and monitoring of restoration projects should deliver greater benefits through setting appropriate objectives and evaluating outcomes against these objectives. These improvements will increase the capacity of the restoration practice to meet international biodiversity commitments and communicate restoration outcomes to stakeholders.

This farm-scale study took place along a 1 km section of a headwater stream in southern Quebec (southeastern Canada). Five tree species with contrasted ecological characteristics were planted (Populus x canadensis, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Quercus macrocarpa, Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus), with black plastic (polyethylene) mulches as the vegetation management method, as well as a control with no vegetation management, all within a fenced herbaceous riparian buffer. Tree growth and survival were measured along with soil nutrient supply. Significant Species x Vegetation treatment interactions where observed for all growth variables (p < 0.001), but also for soil nitrate (NO3) supply (p < 0.01). All species benefited from the plastic mulch treatment, but varied greatly in their responses. After 5 years, mulched hybrid poplar produced 774 times more stem volume than red oak without mulch. Across all species/vegetation treatment combinations, a 13-fold variation in soil NO3 supply rate was observed during the 4th growing season. Compared to the other species, NO3 supply rate in hybrid poplar plots was 3987% lower in the plastic mulch treatment and 4862% lower in the control treatment. Significantly higher soil NO3 supply rates were observed beneath the mulches of non nitrophilous species (white pine and red oak). Red oak growth was negatively correlated with NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.57, p < 0.05) in the mulch treatment. Early-successional nitrophilous species (hybrid poplar and red ash) planted with the plastic mulch led to the lowest increase in soil NO3 and the greatest gains in buffer structural attributes (stem volume, diameter and height). Hybrid poplar growth was positively correlated with soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) in the control treatment. Natural abandoned field/grassland invaders (white pine and bur oak) grew well without black plastic mulch, while the growth of non-mulched red oaks was marginal. In the control treatment, stem volume was a strong negative predictor (across all species) of soil NO3 supply (R-2 = 0.91, p < 0.05), indicating that under herbaceous vegetation competition larger trees have a greater ability to reduce soil NO3. This study provides evidence that particular tree species/vegetation management treatment combinations strongly influence early riparian buffer structural development and soil NO3 dynamics in agricultural riparian zones.

Finding the harvesting frequency to maximize nutrient removal in a constructed wetland dominated by submerged aquatic plants	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Water quality is still poor in many freshwater ecosystems around the world as a result of anthropogenic nutrient loading. Constructed wetlands can be used to remove excess nutrients. In these wetlands, helophytes or free floating aquatic plants are traditionally used to absorb the nutrients. The nutrients are subsequently exported upon harvesting of the plants. However, rooted submerged plants may be more effective to extract nutrients from moderately eutrophicated ecosystems than helophytes or floating species. Here, we tested how the frequency of harvesting affected submerged biomass production, biomass nutrient content and the resulting amount of nutrients removed, as well as the vegetation composition and structure. Two Myriophyllum spicatum dominated shallow ponds, with moderately low surface water nutrient loading (similar to 5.6 mg N.m(-2).d(-1) and similar to 1.32 mg P.m(-2).d(-1)) were used. Each pond was subjected to four harvesting treatments: mowing lx, 2x, 3 x or 5 x between May and September 2015. Harvesting 2 x or 3 x removed most biomass and nutrients, while mowing either 5 x or only once at the end of the growing season removed the lowest amount of nutrients from the system. Furthermore, the dominance of M. spicatum in the vegetation was best maintained in plots mown 2 x, while its cover declined in plots mown more frequently, resulting in an increase of charophyte abundance. We conclude that harvesting at an intermediate frequency is best when aiming to remove the maximum amount of nutrients under a moderately low nutrient loading. Harvesting more frequently may be a suitable management method to reduce dominance of M. spicatum in situations where it causes nuisance problems due to massive growth. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A consistent investigation for three years about macrophyte, phy-toplankton, zooplankton and water quality has been conducted to explore the effect of macrophyte restoration on improving aquatic ecosystem. The results showed that macrophyte biomass and coverage after the restoration were as high as 821 g/m(2) and 55%, respectively, and the dominant species were Cer-atophyllum demersum, Myriophyllum verticillatum and Potamogeton crispus. Moreover, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total suspended solids (TSS) and nitrate nitrogen (NN) significantly decreased yearly, but the changes in total phosphorus (TP) and ammonia nitrogen (AN) were not significant during the investigation. Phytoplankton density and biomass significantly decreased, and the dominant species changed from blue-green algae to green algae. Zooplankton density and biomass, however, significantly increased yearly, and the small-sized dominant species (such as, Keratella cochlearis, Polyarthra trigla, etc.) were gradually replaced by the large-sized species (such as, Asplanchna priodonala, Alma guttata, etc.) during the restoration. In addition, macrophyte was negatively correlated with nutrients, but positively correlated with zooplankton. Phytoplankton was also positively related with TN. These correlations showed that restored macrophytes could decrease nutrition loading in water body, inhibit phytoplankton growth to decrease the risk of algae blooms, and support more large-sized zooplankton to strengthen the top-down control of phytoplankton. Therefore, our results showed that macrophyte restoration is a very potential and effective method to combat with the eutrophication and develop water quality in the eutrophic subtropical lakes, and deserves more attentions in future subtropical/tropical lake managements.

Connecting Teenagers to Coastal Sciences through Research and Education: Shark Fest Program	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												In 2010, the Marine Education Center collaborated with the Center for Fisheries Research and Development's Shark Research Program to design an educational program that combined research experiences and educational opportunities for teenage audiences. This program, Shark Fest, educates students about the sharks of the Mississippi Sound and engages them in scientific studies of shark populations and movements. This program has reached 398 participants in grades 7-12. During the program, students assist in conducting a population survey using a 152.4-m (500-ft) bottom longline with 50 hooks and fishing with a rod-and-reel. Students measure, weigh, determine sex, and identify to species all captured sharks, and tag those in good condition prior to release. Program participants also conduct water-quality sampling (salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and water clarity) at each sample site for addition to the database. Students take a pre-test and post-test to assess the level of knowledge gained during the program. Results of a paired-sample t-test on 2015 pre-test and post-test data reflected a significant difference in pre-test (mean = 6.16, SD = 2.36) and post-test (mean = 8.54, SD = 1.93) scores (t([83]) = -9.172, P < 0.0001), indicating an increase in content knowledge. Written and verbal post-participation assessments also highlighted a positive student experience. We conducted opportunistic interviews with several students 4 years after they were in the program and found evidence of retained knowledge along with positive overall impressions. Some participants stated that the experience influenced their career pursuits.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				SEP	2017	16				10		11	25		10.1656/058.016.0sp1006								WOS:000411136200004						
J	Kozel, T				Kozel, Thomas			Rocky River Wetland Usage for Education and Recreation: Early Planning and Implementation in Anderson County, South Carolina	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The Rocky River Conservancy, Anderson University, the City and County of Anderson, SC, and local environmental groups are working in partnership to rehabilitate, preserve, and develop similar to 200 ha of forested and emergent wetland and contiguous upland located within the city limits of Anderson, SC. The goal of the project is to provide a natural resource usable by the local community for education, and passive and active recreation, while safeguarding this unique and dwindling natural habitat. The environmental advocacy organization, Upstate Forever (Greenville, SC), secured an EPA grant for a hydrology assessment and long-range planning for the site. The long-range vision includes plans for construction of boardwalks, observation platforms, and a discovery center. Anderson University faculty and students have been surveying the site's flora and fauna and collecting water-quality data. Vertebrates documented include 21 species of fishes, 18 species of amphibians and reptiles, 120 species of birds, and 11 species of mammals. A tree-frog mark-recapture program has begun. Clearing of overgrown trails, opening sites for access to wetland margins, removal of trash, addition of trail signage, and trail enhancement are underway. Community and civic groups such as local garden clubs are being made aware of the resources available to them. The Anderson University Life-long Learning program, and local teachers have visited and used the site. Fund-raising, stepwise development without harming or altering the flora and fauna, and continuing to raise community awareness and buy-in of the value of this resource represent ongoing challenges.																	1528-7092	1938-5412				SEP	2017	16				10		109	131		10.1656/058.016.0sp1012								WOS:000411136200010

Organic sediment pulses impact rivers across multiple levels of ecological organization	ECOHYDROLOGY												Sedimentation is a pervasive environmental pressure affecting rivers globally. Headwaters draining catchments rich in organic soils (i.e., peat) are particularly vulnerable to enhanced sedimentation caused by land management and environmental change, yet many of the ecological consequences of peat deposition are poorly understood. We conducted a before-after-control-impact experiment in two rivers draining blanket peatland in Northern England to test the effect of sediment inputs on water quality, macroinvertebrate drift, macroinvertebrate community structure, and ecosystem metabolism. Sediment addition increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, total oxidised nitrogen and suspended sediment concentration in rivers, and intensified the total drift of macroinvertebrates particularly at night. By contrast, the abundance and richness of benthic macroinvertebrates were unaffected, except for declines in Coleoptera abundance in one river. The gross primary production of both rivers was strongly suppressed as the benthos was smothered by sediment. Community respiration also declined, albeit by different extents in the two rivers. Our experiment revealed that short-term pulses of organic sediment in rivers can have broad effects on water quality and biota, from influences on the dispersal of individual organisms to the modification of ecosystem processes. Organic sediments therefore warrant further examination, to include longer observation periods and more sites. It is particularly important to clarify the extent to which impacts extend from peatland streams into larger rivers downstream. Such studies are necessary to inform global management efforts to restore the integrity of river ecosystems under a range of water and biodiversity policy mechanisms.

Peak flows were released in the early part of the pulse to simulate a spring flood, with approximately 101.7 mcm released at Morelos Dam on the U.S.-Mexico border. The remainder of the pulse flow water was released to the riparian corridor via Mexicali Valley irrigation spillway canals, with 20.9 mcm released at Km 27 Spillway (41 km below Morelos Dam) and 9.3 mcm released at Km 18 Spillway (78 km below Morelos Dam). We used sequential satellite images, overflights, ground observations, water discharge measurements, and automated temperature, river stage and water quality loggers to document and describe the progression of pulse flow water through the study area. The rate of advance of the wetted front was slowed by infiltration and high channel roughness as the pulse flow crossed more than 40 km of dry channel which was disconnected from underlying groundwater and partially overgrown with salt cedar. High lag time and significant attenuation of flow resulted in a changing hydrograph as the pulse flow progressed to the downstream delivery points; two peak flows occurred in some lower reaches. The pulse flow advanced more than 120 km downstream from Morelos Dam to reach the Colorado River estuary at the northern end of the Gulf of California. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Phosphorus fertilization, soil stratification, and potential water quality impacts	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Water quality experts have suggested that no-till induces phosphorus (P) stratification, which may exacerbate soluble P (SP) runoff from agricultural fields, contributing to eutrophication. Conservationists have been concerned about increased SP loading to Lake Erie, which has been partially blamed on adoption of no-till and the concomitant P stratification of no-till soils. This study was conducted to provide better insight into. the potential link between P stratification from no-till soils and P losses via runoff with the objective of exploring P fertilization strategies on P stratification and P runoff from a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation. Plots were established with nine treatments, including unfertilized, diammonium phosphate (DAP) applications, monoammonium phosphate (MAP) applications, surface applied, injecting fertilizer or tilling fertilizer in, and the use of cover crops. Fertilizer applications were made at 24.4 kg P ha(-1) (21.8 lb P ac(-1)) every other year or at 9.6 kg P ha(-1) (8.7 lb P ac(-1)) every year. Disking, which was intended to minimize P stratification, resulted in the greatest stratification, with significantly higher water SP and Mehlich 3 I) in the 0 to 5 cm (0 to 2 in) soil layer compared to the other treatments. There were no differences in SP or total P (TP) runoff from rainfall simulations between fertilizer source (MAP versus DAP) or fertilizer rate (annual versus biennial). The highest SP concentrations observed were from DAP applied to cover crops at the high application rate (24.4 kg P ha(-1) applied every other year). This may suggest cover crops are. not the ideal practice to decrease SP losses from agricultural fields. Incorporation of fertilizer reduced SP but increased erosion and could potentially increase TP loss. Injecting liquid fertilizer (polyphosphate [Poly]) at the time of planting resulted in lower SP and TP loads than surface applied fertilizers. We encourage other researchers to confirm these results at the field-to-watershed scale to ensure there are not unintended consequences of adopting this fertilization strategy. Further, fertilizer dealers, crop consultants, and farmers sholild be encouraged to consider liquid fertilizer applications 8 one option to minimize P losses.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					417	424		10.2489/jswc.72.5.417								WOS:000410019500004

Delivering on the potential of formal farmer networks: Insights from Indiana	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Several formal farmer networks have emerged throughout the midwestern United States to address issues of nitrogen (N) runoff and eutrophication. The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of these formal fanner networks through an evaluation of two networks in Indiana. The research was guided by two main questions: (1) Are farmers who participate in the networks actually implementing better nutrient management practices? (2) Are participating farmers spreading their knowledge of better nutrient management practices to other farmers outside the formal networks? Interviews with select network members were conducted in early 2014, and a mail survey of all network members was conducted in the summer of 2014. Survey results were compared to the results of a statewide Indiana Nutrient Management Survey conducted during the winter of 2014. The results show that network farmers vary significantly from nonnetwork farmers in multiple ways. Network farmers have more positive attitudes toward water quality, perceive water pollution as a more severe problem, and utilize more conservation practices than nonnetwork farmers. Network farmers also vary in demographic characteristics. Length of time in the network is positively associated with reporting a change in N management practices. Diffusion of nutrient management practices outside the networks seems very limited. The findings point to ways that formal farmer networks can be improved. One recommendation is to diversify the participants and include more farmers who have not already adopted conservation practices. Another recommendation is to increase the number of group meetings during the year. One meeting is insufficient to build the trust and rapport necessary for farmers to accept and adopt the technologies being shared by others. Finally, outreach should focus on economic arguments for improved N management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					463	470		10.2489/jswc.72.5463								WOS:000410019500008

Determining the number of measurements required to estimate crop residue cover by different methods	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Crop residue left after harvest plays an important role in controlling against soil erosion and in increasing soil organic matter content of agricultural soils. Crop residue management is a practice of great importance in southwestern Ontario, where soil management practices have an effect on Great Lakes water quality. The use of remote sensing data to measure and monitor crop residue can be fast and efficient. However, remote sensing based studies need calibration and validation using field observations. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal number of ground-truthing field measurements (i.e., digital photographs) required to estimate residue levels. To do so, we compared the residue estimates derived from digital photographs with those derived from the standard line-transect method. Residue was measured from 18 fields located in southern Ontario, and data collected included percentage of crop residue using line-transect and photographic grid methods. Results were analyzed using linear regression, correlation tests, ANOVA, and means tests. Analyses were also conducted to retrospectively determine the minimum number of line transects or digital photos required to estimate crop residue cover at specified levels of power. Results showed that (1) percentage of crop residue estimates derived from using digital photographs were strongly correlated (r = 0.91, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.83, and n = 90) to those derived from using line transects; (2) counting 50 to 100 points per digital photograph was sufficient to accurately estimate the percentage of residue cover; and (3) there was greater variability in the results for soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) than for corn (Zea mays L.), with the highest variability for medium-level soybean residue. Overall, the digital photograph method to estimate percentage of residue was found to be a suitable alternative to the line-transect method, which is more time consuming and labor intensive. Determining the optimal numbers of measurements to estimate crop residue cover is important to those wishing to use digital photo capture methods to record, archive, and measure residue for remote sensing calibration and validation or for handheld mobile device applications.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					471	479		10.2489/jswc.72.5471								WOS:000410019500009

Sedimentation in a small lake following conversion of bottomland forest to row cropping	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Areas of native bottomland hardwood forest in the lower Red River basin in Louisiana were cleared for row cropping around 1970. Erosion and sediment deposition in channels and lakes presumably, increased, affecting hydrologic connectivity and lake ecosystems: Sediment deposited in a representative small lake after land conversion was determined in 2000 from the distribution of cesium (Cs-137) with depth. Sediment consisted of low-density clay deposited above dense silt loam. Organic carbon (C) and Cs-137 profiles had lower and upper concentration maxima. The lower maxima established the circa 1970 lakebed at <= 0.9 m (3 ft) above the morphological discontinuity and from 2.1 to 1.3 m (6.9 to 4.3 ft) below the 2000 lakebed at positions midlake and halfway to the bank, respectively. The upper maxima were likely due to progressive land conversion around the lake, coupled with increasing clay content of sediment upwards to the 2000 lakebed. A quiescent settling model was used to estimate the composition of runoff water necessary to produce the depth, texture, and density of sediment above the lower Cs-137 maxima. The Annualized Agricultural Nonpoint Source water quality model was calibrated to match this composition, and sediment accumulation under alternative management scenarios was calculated. Compared to conventional-till. (CT) soybeans (Glycine max L.) for 30 years, CT with cover crop (CC), no-till (NT), NT with CC management, and forest might have reduced sedimentation in the lake by about 20%, 40%, 60%, and 98%, slowing changes in light penetration, temperature, turbidity, and chemistry that affect the lake ecosystem.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				SEP-OCT	2017	72	5					530	538		10.2489/jswc.72.5.530								WOS:000410019500014						
J	Drever, MC; Hrachowitz, M				Drever, Mark C.; Hrachowitz, Markus			Migration as flow: using hydrological concepts to estimate the residence time of migrating birds from the daily counts	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Estimating the length-of-stay, the number of days a bird can be expected to stay at a site, at stopover sites is critical to understanding the migration ecology and estimating the population sizes of birds as they move between breeding and non-breeding sites. 2. Estimating the length-of-stay of migrating animals at stopover sites has an analogue in the hydrological concept of transit time, the amount of time that water spends in a reservoir, which can be calculated as a numerical integration of inflow and outflow rates with an underlying Storage Age Selection function. 3. We used this approach to estimate the lengths-of-stay of migrating Western Sandpiper (Calidris mauri) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina) based on the time series of daily counts at two sites in British Columbia, Canada. The approach yielded mean transit times for Western Sandpiper during southward migration at Sidney Island that ranged between 9.6 days and 3.8 days, and showed a significant decline over time, 1992-2001, and is consistent with the estimates obtained from the capture-mark-resight studies. Transit times during northward migration at Roberts Bank, Fraser River Delta, based on the best available information ranged from 1.8 to 3.2 days for Western Sandpiper, and had a median value of 2.0 days for Dunlin, which is consistent with the estimates obtained from the radio-telemetry studies. 4. These results indicate that the hydrological flow models may offer a means to estimate the length-of-stay from the daily counts of birds during migration. The models present an opportunity for testing the alternate hypotheses concerning the roles of behavioural-vs. habitat-related mechanisms driving shorebird population sizes.

Local environment and connectivity are the main drivers of diatom species composition and trait variation in a set of tropical reservoirs	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A metacommunity is defined as a set of local communities that are connected by dispersal and are controlled by environmental drivers operating at different spatial and temporal scales. Although diatom ecology has been studied extensively in temperate and lotic ecosystems, knowledge of tropical lentic systems is more limited. 2. We evaluated how planktonic and surface-sediment diatom communities, including trait-based communities, were structured by environmental, spatial and land-use variables in tropical reservoirs. Diatoms were sampled in seven reservoirs (31 sites in total) in south-east Brazil, from the surface sediment and the plankton in summer and winter. 3. Diatom communities responded primarily to a trophic gradient and secondarily to a light-availability gradient. Connectivity was also a strong predictor, whereas land use had a weaker influence on community variation. Our results further suggested that surface-sediment and planktonic diatom groups were structured by similar environmental variables. Trait-based analysis also indicated that these communities were related to environmental and spatial factors. 4. We conclude that (1) trophic state, light availability and connectivity were the main drivers of diatoms in this set of tropical reservoirs, resulting in spatially structured communities; (2) patterns for surface-sediment diatoms resembled both summer and winter diatom communities in the plankton; and (3) the effects of the explanatory variables (local environment, connectivity and land use) varied among the different biological datasets (i.e. when organised taxonomically, or according to growth morphology, cell size or trophic preference). We emphasize that studies in tropical reservoirs should take spatial variables into account, due to the connectivity of the sites.

Land-use changes, such as converting riparian vegetation to human use or changing the management practices of farm ponds, are assumed to be major factors that change such ecosystems from a clear-water state to a turbid state, leading to deterioration of water quality and biodiversity in such ponds. Using the database of a large-scale pond survey, we evaluated the effects of surrounding land use (landscape factors and modern pond management practices), fish abundance, and other environmental variables on total phosphorus concentration and taxonomic richness patterns of six biological indicators associated with changes in the trophic state. Local- and landscape-level vegetation structure associated with land use and total fish abundance were among the factors influencing the total phosphorus concentration of farm ponds, a main driver of trophic state changes. In addition, a transition from a clear-water state to a turbid state was associated with lower taxonomic richness of aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates, and adult Odonata, and a higher taxonomic richness of phytoplankton and fish. Based on these results, we discuss potential land-use and pond management strategies for conserving and/or restoring the water quality and biodiversity of farm ponds through maintenance of a clear-water state.

Relative role of transport and source -limited controls for estrogen, TDP, and DOC export for two manure application methods	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Developing successful mitigation strategies for emerging contaminants can be difficult due to incomplete understanding of factors controlling their fate and transport. A variety of data analysis techniques can be used to assess the fate and transport behavior of pollutants in runoff water. Here, we use concentration-discharge, load discharge, and coefficient of variation relationships to examine how two methods of dairy manure application (surface broadcast and shallow disk injection) affect the transport dynamics of estrogens, total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Nine surface runoff events were sampled from Oct 2014 June 2015 from 12 research plots (six with each application method) in Central Pennsylvania after fall application. The plots received inorganic fertilizer for 15 years, but only four manure applications since 2012. Both TDP and DOC exhibited similar transport behavior under both manure application methods that indicate transport-limited control of export, potentially due to legacy sources in soils. However, estrogen loads exhibited dilution responses, a sign of source-limited controls. The strength of the dilution response for estrogens was greater for surface applied manure relative to the injected manure, suggesting that manure application methods can be used to control the mobilization potential of estrogens. Additionally, results suggest the longer-term application history of inorganic fertilizer led to the transport-limited dynamics exhibited by TDP, while the short-term application history of manure caused estrogen transport to be source-limited. Our findings provide insight into how anthropogenic drivers (application type, method, and history) and natural drivers (hydrology, biogeochemistry) are interconnected in agricultural fields, and point to opportunities for protecting, downstream water quality.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				SEP 1	2017	247						308	318		10.1016/j.agee.2017.06.045								WOS:000408597800034						
J	Vilmi, A; Karjalainen, SM; Heino, J				Vilmi, Annika; Karjalainen, Satu Maaria; Heino, Jani			Ecological uniqueness of stream and lake diatom communities shows different macroecological patterns	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim: To discover whether lake and stream diatom communities show different patterns in species richness and in their local (LCBD) and species (SCBD) contributions to beta diversity in relation to macroscale environmental characteristics. Location: Finland. Methods: As biological data, we used diatom samples collected from Finnish stream (n = 492) and lake (n = 290) sites. As explanatory variable data, we used information on macroscale environmental and historical aspects, such as bedrock, soil and post-glacial highest shoreline. We also accounted for catchment areas, different levels of isolation and relative centrality of the study sites. We ran multiple linear models and selected best models based on AICc values. Results: We found that macroscale factors affecting diatom richness and ecological uniqueness differed clearly between streams and lakes. LCBD and species richness of stream communities were more affected by regional environmental characteristics, whereas LCBD and species richness of lake communities were more often driven by spatial measures. The measures of LCBD and species richness showed a slightly negative relationship in streams, but no such relationship was detected in lakes. Also, we showed that, for both streams and lakes, SCBD was strongly determined by the number of sites occupied by a species and the overall abundance of a species. Main conclusions: Our findings related to the distinction between the determinants of lake and stream species richness or LCBD may be tied to the different hydrological connectivity levels occurring in freshwater lotic and lentic systems. Also, in streams, sites with exceptional ecological uniqueness seem to have a rather low number of species. Our findings may be applied to biological conservation and monitoring planning, emphasizing that not only species-rich but also unique low-richness sites may be valuable conservation goals.

Effects of landuse intensification on stream basal resources and invertebrate communities	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Human population growth and development have degraded freshwater ecosystems through direct negative effects on basal resources and higher trophic levels. Knowledge of how basal resources are influenced by anthropogenic activities is needed to examine foodweb responses and to evaluate negative effects of human disturbance. We combined quantitative sampling of all putative resources and consumers and naturally occurring stable isotopes of resource C and N to investigate how land use influences characteristics of basal resources (leaf litter, fine particulate organic matter [FPOM] suspended in water, FPOM deposited in pools, and epilithon) and the invertebrate communities in 9 streams of British Columbia (Canada) on a seasonal basis. Study streams were grouped as forest, cropland, and urban, based on percentages of land use in their catchments. We tested for seasonal and spatial differences in biomass, isotopic variability, and overlap of different basal resources and their relationships with invertebrate communities. Our results show that landuse intensification promotes wholesale degradation, which includes deterioration of water quality, changes to the quantity and quality of basal resources, and shifts in community structure of benthic invertebrates. Stream basal resources showed large variations in isotopic signatures caused by landuse changes, with the largest isotopic variability observed in cropland streams and the smallest in urban streams. Invertebrate communities had fewer taxa and reduced functional diversity in impaired streams (i.e., cropland and urban) via simplification of feeding styles of consumers, probably because of bottom-up controls. Our study highlights the importance of quantifying the isotopic variability of basal resources to estimate effects on food webs over time and along landuse intensification gradients.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2017	36	3					609	625		10.1086/693457								WOS:000407373600013

Assessing the expansion of wadeable benthic macroinvertebrate collection methods in large semiwadeable rivers	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Benthic macroinvertebrates are used commonly as water-quality indicators in wadeable streams and rivers. However, increased depth and overall complexity of large rivers may cause inaccessibility or unacceptable index and metric variability when attempting a single wadeable method. Significant increases in sampling effort and time expenditure have been recommended to compensate for the increased variability when assessing large rivers. However, the transition between wadeable streams and nonwadeable rivers is not well defined, especially for free-flowing systems. We evaluated the utility of a modified wadeable-stream collection method for sampling large and complex semiwadeable rivers. Our results suggest that water-quality measurements across the width of a river can be used to identify influences of multiple water sources. This spatial information and a single-habitat (e.g., riffle-run) approach could be used with a modest increase in sampling effort to reduce metric variability and provide important source-tracking information. These supplementary data and a grasp of the complex ecological processes that exist in large rivers are essential for recognizing why biological communities differ among sites and for using macroinvertebrates to assess large river systems.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				SEP	2017	36	3					683	691		10.1086/692942								WOS:000407373600018

Shifting paradigms in restoration of the world's coral reefs	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Many ecosystems around the world are rapidly deteriorating due to both local and global pressures, and perhaps none so precipitously as coral reefs. Management of coral reefs through maintenance (e.g., marine-protected areas, catchment management to improve water quality), restoration, as well as global and national governmental agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., the 2015 Paris Agreement) is critical for the persistence of coral reefs. Despite these initiatives, the health and abundance of corals reefs are rapidly declining and other solutions will soon be required. We have recently discussed options for using assisted evolution (i.e., selective breeding, assisted gene flow, conditioning or epigenetic programming, and the manipulation of the coral microbiome) as a means to enhance environmental stress tolerance of corals and the success of coral reef restoration efforts. The 2014-2016 global coral bleaching event has sharpened the focus on such interventionist approaches. We highlight the necessity for consideration of alternative (e.g., hybrid) ecosystem states, discuss traits of resilient corals and coral reef ecosystems, and propose a decision tree for incorporating assisted evolution into restoration initiatives to enhance climate resilience of coral reefs.

Multiple stressors threaten the imperiled coastal foundation species eelgrass (Zostera marina) in Chesapeake Bay, USA	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Interactions among global change stressors and their effects at large scales are often proposed, but seldom evaluated. This situation is primarily due to lack of comprehensive, sufficiently long-term, and spatially extensive datasets. Seagrasses, which provide nursery habitat, improve water quality, and constitute a globally important carbon sink, are among the most vulnerable habitats on the planet. Here, we unite 31 years of high-resolution aerial monitoring and water quality data to elucidate the patterns and drivers of eelgrass (Zostera marina) abundance in Chesapeake Bay, USA, one of the largest and most valuable estuaries in the world, with an unparalleled history of regulatory efforts. We show that eelgrass area has declined 29% in total since 1991, with wide-ranging and severe ecological and economic consequences. We go on to identify an interaction between decreasing water clarity and warming temperatures as the primary drivers of this trend. Declining clarity has gradually reduced eelgrass cover the past two decades, primarily in deeper beds where light is already limiting. In shallow beds, however, reduced visibility exacerbates the physiological stress of acute warming, leading to recent instances of decline approaching 80%. While degraded water quality has long been known to influence underwater grasses worldwide, we demonstrate a clear and rapidly emerging interaction with climate change. We highlight the urgent need to integrate a broader perspective into local water quality management, in the Chesapeake Bay and in the many other coastal systems facing similar stressors.

A major challenge is overcoming the associated costs to agricultural producers. We integrate spatially-explicit models of ecosystem processes with agricultural commodity production models to analyze the biophysical and economic consequences of alternative land use and land management patterns to achieve Total Maximum Daily Loads targets in a proto-typical agricultural watershed. We apply these models to find patterns that maximize water quality objectives for given levels of foregone agricultural profit. We find it is possible to reduce baseline watershed phosphorus loads by similar to 20% and sediment loads by similar to 18% without any reduction in agricultural profits. Our results indicate that meeting more stringent targets will result in substantial economic loss. However, when we add the social benefits from water quality improvement and carbon sequestration to private agricultural net returns we find that water quality improvements up to 50% can be obtained at no loss to societal returns. The cost of meeting water quality targets will vary over time as commodity and ecosystem service, prices fluctuate. If crop prices drop or the value of ecosystem services increase, then achieving higher water quality goals will be less costly. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the macroinvertebrate communities from the main tributaries in the Three Gorges Reservoir Catchment (TGRC) were investigated as a function of the four seasons to explore the temporal variations in macroinvertebrate communities and further tests the temporal stability of certain metrics that are based on macroinvertebrates under a routine bioassessment framework. Results: The taxa richness reached the highest point in spring, followed by winter, autumn and summer. The taxa Chironomidae, Heptageniidae, Corbiculidae and Baetidae dominated the communities across seasons. The temporal variations in communities were mainly reflected in the changes in taxa proportions between seasons. The percentages of the taxa Heptageniidae and Baetidae were the highest in autumn (normal discharge period) and lowest in summer (high discharge period). The abundance of macroinvertebrates was the lowest in summer, increased in autumn and winter, and then decreased in spring. Natural fluctuations of aquatic ecosystems (temporal effects) resulted in variations that were apparent in macroinvertebrate-based metrics, such as EPT%, Baetidae%, Caenidae%, Ephemerellidae% and Hydropsychidae%. Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrated that the macroinvertebrate communities in the main tributaries of the TGRC varied as a function of seasons. This variation was fundamentally similar to the seasonal patterns in subarctic and temperate streams. Different hydro-morphological characteristics and water quality during the high discharge period (summer), low discharge period (winter) and normal discharge period (spring and autumn) strongly affected the distribution patterns of macroinvertebrate communities. Discharge variation among seasons resulted in seasonal fluctuations in the density of macroinvertebrates. In the TGRC, autumn was the important hatching period for mayflies (Ephemeroptera). The variations in metrics related to macroinvertebrates indicated that temporal effects should not be neglected under a biomonitoring framework in future studies.																	0716-078X	0717-6317				AUG 29	2017	90								6	10.1186/s40693-017-0069-y								WOS:000408693700001

They cause numerous ecological problems and also economic costs to water companies. The process-representation of the algal community model PRO-TECH was tested within the extended Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation framework which includes pre-defined Limits of Acceptability for simulations. Testing was a precursor to modification of the model for real-time forecasting of algal communities that will place different demands on the model in terms of a) the simulation accuracy required, b) the computational burden associated with the inclusion of forecast uncertainties and c) data assimilation. We found that the systematic differences between the model's representation of underwater light compared to the real lake systems studied and the uncertainties associated with nutrient fluxes will be the greatest challenges when forecasting algal blooms.

Habitat change mediates the response of coral reef fish populations to terrestrial run-off	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Coastal fish populations are typically threatened by multiple human activities, including fishing pressure and run-off of terrestrial pollution. Linking multiple threats to their impacts on fish populations is challenging because the threats may influence a species directly, or indirectly, via its habitats and its interactions with other species. Here we examine spatial variation in abundance of coral reef fish across gradients of fishing pressure and turbidity in Fiji. We explicitly account for multiple pathways of influence to test the alternative hypotheses that (1) habitat moderates predation by providing shelter, so habitat loss only affects prey fish populations if there are abundant predators, (2) habitat change co-drives biomass of both prey and predator functional groups. We examined responses of 7 fish functional groups and found that habitat change co-drives both predator and prey responses to turbidity. Abundances of all functional groups were associated with changes in habitat cover; however, the responses of their habitats to turbidity were mixed. Planktivore and piscivore abundance were lower in areas of high turbidity, because cover of their preferred habitats was lower. Invertivore, browser and grazer abundance did not change strongly over the turbidity gradient, because different components of their habitats exhibited both increases and decreases with turbidity. The effects of turbidity on fish populations were minor in areas where fish populations were already depleted by fishing. These findings suggest that terrestrial run-off modifies the composition of reef fish communities indirectly by affecting the benthic habitats that reef fish use.

J	Baumber, A				Baumber, Alex			Enhancing ecosystem services through targeted bioenergy support policies	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												While policy-makers in the bioenergy sector have paid considerable attention over the past decade to the risks that energy cropping can pose to forests, soils and food security, there has been less focus on how bioenergy policies can be designed to enhance ecosystem services. Some perennial energy crops have demonstrated the potential to provide habitat for biodiversity, improve soil health, enhance water quality, mitigate dryland salinity and sequester carbon. While much uncertainty exists around which forms of energy cropping might deliver these benefits, opportunities exist to preferentially support beneficial energy crops through the adaptation of existing bioenergy policies. This article provides a global review of bioenergy policy instruments that identifies existing and potential mechanisms for promoting the enhancement of ecosystem services. While many existing bioenergy support policies promote fuel supply (a provisioning service) and climate change mitigation (a regulating service), it is less common for bioenergy policies to actively enhance ecosystem services such as habitat provision, soil improvement and water regulation. Further opportunities to promote these ecosystem services exist through structured tax concessions, sub-mandates, banding and renewable energy auctions, but careful consideration needs to be given to trade-offs between services, risks of disservices and the need for complementary nonenergy policies.

Building the bridge between ecosystem services research and practice	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												There is growing demand for information regarding the impacts of decisions on ecosystem services and human benefits. Despite the large and growing quantity of published ecosystem services research, there remains a substantial gap between this research and the information required to support decisions. Research often provides models and tools that do not fully link social and ecological systems; are too complex, specialized, and costly to use; and are targeted to outcomes that differ from those needed by decision makers. Decision makers require cost-effective, straightforward, transferable, scalable, meaningful, and defensible methods that can be readily understood. We provide illustrative examples of these gaps between research and practice and describe how researchers can make their work relevant to decision makers by using Benefit Relevant Indicators ( BRIs) and choosing models appropriate for particular decision contexts. We use examples primarily from the United States, including cases that illustrate varying degrees of success in closing these gaps. We include a discussion of the challenges and opportunities researchers face in adapting their work to meet the needs of practitioners. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Due to its fine spatial scale and focus on the rural environment, LUCI is well-placed to help both farm and catchment managers to explore and quantify spatially explicit solutions to improve water quality while also maintaining or enhancing other ecosystem service outcomes. LUCI water quality and agricultural productivity models were applied to a catchment in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources, sinks and pathways in the landscape were identified and trade-offs and synergies between water quality and agricultural productivity were investigated. Results indicate that interventions to improve water quality are likely to come at the expense of agriculturally productive land. Nonetheless, loss of agriculturally productive land can be minimised by using LUCI to identify, at a fine spatial scale, the most appropriate locations for nutrient intervention. Spatially targeted and strategic nutrient source management and pathway interception can improve water quality, while minimising negative financial impacts on farms. Our results provide spatially explicit solutions to optimize agricultural productivity and water quality, which will inform better farm, land and catchment management as well as national and international policy.

J	Shoemaker, C; Kroger, R				Shoemaker, Cory; Kroger, Robert			Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches to Understanding Changes in Redox Potential Due to Hydrology and Vegetation in Agricultural Drainage Ditches	WETLANDS												Excess nutrient loading from agricultural landscapes contributes to downstream water quality degradation. To mitigate these issues, agricultural drainage ditches have recently gained attention as potential sites for nutrient reduction. We examined the effects of vegetation and hydrology on oxidation-reduction (redox) potential. Testing occurred in an agricultural drainage ditch fitted with weirs in the summer of 2012. Redox potential was recorded using continuous automated data loggers and analyzed using both frequentist and Bayesian methods. Significant difference was found when analyzing redox potential response to vegetation (t = -1.75, P = 0.08, df = 9754) and hydrology treatments (t = 7.51, P < 0.001, df = 9754) in a frequentist manner. Vegetation and hydrologic treatments were significant when analyzed using Bayesian methods; however, the interactions of the two terms had the greatest posterior weights. This study suggests that the innovative use of vegetation and controlled drainage can affect Eh, in particular Eh heterogeneity within ditch systems. Results obtained by analyzing these data in both a frequentist and Bayesian methods were similar in terms significance and magnitude. However, Bayesian methods, and their ability to incorporate prior information into a management framework, may be better suited for systems where previous information can be incorporated into analyses.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2017	37	4					705	714		10.1007/s13157-017-0901-9								WOS:000408670000009

Spatial and Temporal Variability in Benthic Invertebrate Assemblages in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Upper Klamath Lake (UKL) in southern Oregon has experienced declines in water quality due to excessive nutrient loading. This has led to annual cyanobacterial blooms, primarily of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (AFA). Benthic invertebrates are important food resources for benthic feeding fishes; however, they can increase autochthonous nutrient cycling in lakes and as a result might be contributing to poor water quality in UKL. This study determined the density and taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrate assemblages in three geographic regions (north, central, and south) and three habitats (littoral, open-water and trench) across UKL. Sediment composition and water quality were also characterized at each of the 21 benthic invertebrate collection sites. Three sampling trips were made from May-July 2013. Mean lake-wide invertebrate density was 12 617 + 7506 individuals m(-2) (n = 63, based on 189 Ekman grabs) with oligochaetes, chirono-mids, and leeches representing 97% of all individuals. Mean invertebrate richness per sample was 16 +/- 4 (n = 63). Two and three-way repeated measures ANOVAs identified differences in invertebrate densities and richness among regions, habitats, and sampling periods. There were no differences in total density among sampling periods. Total density was higher in littoral compared to open-water habitats, and in the northern region, proximal to all riverine inputs to the lake, compared to the central or southern regions. Although variances were heterogeneous, the number of taxa appeared to differ between habitats and regions.																	0029-344X	2161-9859				AUG	2017	91	3					257	271		10.3955/046.091.0306								WOS:000408014800004						
J	Parparov, A; Gal, G				Parparov, Arkadi; Gal, Gideon			Quantifying Ecological Stability: From Community to the Lake Ecosystem	ECOSYSTEMS												We performed a methodological study aimed at extending our previously developed approach to quantify the ecological stability of biotic communities and an entire ecosystem, using Lake Kinneret as a case study. The ecological stability of the biotic communities (phytoplankton and zooplankton) of Lake Kinneret was estimated using two different aggregating schemes. The first scheme used the combined stability index, based on the combined indices of the individual phytoplankton (SI[Comb](P)) and zooplankton (SI[Comb](Z)) taxonomic groups. The total community stability index was calculated based on the total abundances of these communities. The stability of the entire ecosystem was estimated for two sets of ecosystem state variables, a lake "trophic state" set and a "water quality" set, which provided considerably different estimates of the lake ecosystem stability. Good agreement between the results of this study and qualitative estimates of Lake Kinneret stability validates the suitability of this approach to estimate the stability of different ecological units.																	1432-9840	1435-0629				AUG	2017	20	5					1015	1028		10.1007/s10021-016-0090-z								WOS:000407846100012

Rather, the mix of urban hubs surrounded by undeveloped expanses creates a ratchet process whereby anthropogenic activity is sufficient to introduce and spread invaders, but for which the costs of monitoring and managing remote ecosystems is prohibitive. Elodea spp. is the first aquatic invasive plant to become established in Alaska and has potential for widespread deleterious ecological and economic impacts. A rapid eradication response with herbicides has been identified as a priority invasion control strategy. We conducted a multi-lake monitoring effort to assess collateral impacts from herbicide treatment for Elodea in high latitude systems. Variability in data was driven by seasonal dynamics and natural lake-to-lake differences typical of high latitude waterbodies, indicating lack of evidence for systematic impacts to water quality or plankton communities associated with herbicide treatment of Modal. Impacts on native macrophytes were benign with the exception of some evidence for earlier onset of leaf senescence for lily pads (Nuphar spp.) in treated lakes. We observed a substantial increase in detected native flora richness after Elodea was eradicated from the most heavily infested lake, indicating potential for retention of native macrophyte communities if infestations are addressed quickly. While avoiding introductions through prevention may be the most desirable outcome, these applications indicated low risks of non-target impacts associated with herbicide treatment as a rapid response option for Elodea in high latitude systems.																	0006-3207	1873-2917				AUG	2017	212		A				300	309		10.1016/j.biocon.2017.06.015								WOS:000407186000033

Balancing lake ecological condition and agriculture irrigation needs in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The Mississippi Alluvial Valley includes hundreds of floodplain lakes that support unique fish assemblages and high biodiversity. Irrigation practices in the valley have lowered the water table, increasing the cost of pumping water, and necessitating the use of floodplain lakes as a source of water for irrigation. This development has prompted the need to regulate water withdrawals to protect aquatic resources, but it is unknown how much water can be withdrawn from lakes before ecological integrity is compromised. To estimate withdrawal limits, we examined descriptors of lake water quality (i.e., total nitrogen, total phosphorus, turbidity, Secchi visibility, chlorophyll-a) and fish assemblages (species richness, diversity, composition) relative to maximum depth in 59 floodplain lakes. Change-point regression analysis was applied to identify critical depths at which the relationships between depth and lake descriptors exhibited a rapid shift in slope, suggesting possible thresholds. All our water quality and fish assemblage descriptors showed rapid changes relative to depth near 1.2-2.0 m maximum depth. This threshold span may help inform regulatory decisions about water withdrawal limits. Alternatives to explain the triggers of the observed threshold span are considered.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				AUG 1	2017	246						354	360		10.1016/j.agee.2017.06.022								WOS:000405973000036

Potential distribution of endangered Mexican golden trout (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) in the Rio Sinaloa and Rio Culiacan basins (Sierra Madre Occidental) based on landscape characterization and species distribution models	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The Mexican Golden Trout (Oncorhynchus chrysogaster) is a threatened native species inhabiting three river basins in the Sierra Madre Occidental. Despite some efforts from science groups to obtain information about this trout, the Rio Sinaloa and Rio Culiacan basins, to the south, remain the least studied area, compared to the Rio Fuerte basin. To overcome this gap, a survey (2014 to 2015) was undertaken to obtain new records and confirm the presence for historic records in both watersheds. After filtering records for this species, eighteen locations were used to model potential distribution, using the GARP and MaxEnt, including landscape characterization based on hydrologic analysis and satellite imagery classification. Coincidence between models was >85% for a potential distribution area of 4300 km(2), defined by six bioclimatic and physiographic variables, with the hydrologic network covering 3000 km. To avoid overestimation, the final distribution area included only the 100 m fringe surrounding the drainage network and its associated landscape features. Jackknife resampling was used to validate both the models, successfully predicting more than 80% of the locations (p < 0.001). The estimated area covers 275 km2, mainly defined by second- and third-order streams, at altitudes >2000 m, high water quality (transparent, dissolved oxygen >5 mg L-1; temperature < 26 degrees C), and was part of amatrix of undisturbed forests. This study provides new findings about this endangered species and new elements for designing appropriate monitoring programs supporting trout conservation and management.

Direct and indirect effects of predatory young-of-year fishes in a dryland river food web	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Young-of-year (YOY) fishes are sometimes numerically dominant vertebrate consumers in many large river systems, but their effects as predators are not as well understood as those of adult fishes. We predicted that YOY fishes influence community composition and abundance of invertebrate prey. Predation effects could be especially important in recruitment-driven dryland river systems, where YOY fishes seasonally comprise a large portion of overall fish biomass. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to quantify effects of YOY fishes on trophic dynamics and interactions with environmental factors in a dryland river food web. We manipulated presence of YOY fishes (an assemblage of cypriniform species) and supplemental allochthonous carbon (LEAF treatments) in 24 mesocosms, and measured invertebrate abundance and diversity over 6weeks. Experimental conditions mimicked a seasonal river drying regime that occurs during YOY fish growth. Seasonal drying in the Rio Grande frequently results in isolated pools with altered habitat complexity and riparian connectivity. Fishes exerted direct top-down control of invertebrate assemblage composition through differential prey selection, and indirect control mediated by non-lethal responses of invertebrates to predatory fishes. We observed enhanced water clarity in LEAF treatments associated with greater prey selectivity in fishes, presumably through enhanced visual feeding. Stable isotope analysis (C and N) was used to measure indirect impacts of YOY fishes on invertebrate prey items. YOY fishes caused a significant decrease in isotopic niche breadth among invertebrate taxa, suggesting that fish predators limit foraging opportunities for these consumers. However, allochthonous carbon sources were predominant in invertebrate diets in all LEAF treatments, suggesting consumer access to more biologically available autochthonous production is limited by factors other than fish predation. Although the roles of abiotic drivers and adult fishes in determining food web structure have received more attention, our results indicate that YOY fishes exert biologically relevant top-down control of invertebrate assemblage composition and trophic complexity in dryland river ecosystems against a backdrop of substantial changes in carbon availability and abiotic conditions (e.g. water quality and habitat volume) over the growing season.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	2017	62	8					1410	1421		10.1111/fwb.12954								WOS:000405074600009						
J	de Castro, DMP; Doledec, S; Callisto, M				de Castro, Diego M. P.; Doledec, Sylvain; Callisto, Marcos			Landscape variables influence taxonomic and trait composition of insect assemblages in Neotropical savanna streams	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Stream invertebrate assemblages are structured by environmental factors acting at multiple spatial scales. Identifying the spatial scale that most influences the species-environment relationships is a major goal of community ecology. We evaluated the importance of catchment and site scales and associated environmental variables in shaping Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) assemblages in Neotropical savanna headwater streams. Sampling sites were associated with 20 catchment-scale variables that depicted land cover and land use as well as natural geophysical variables such as altitude and climate. Site-scale habitat was characterised by 55 variables that described habitat hydromorphology, substrate, flow, canopy, in-stream cover and water quality. EPT traits were assessed using 28 categories of 7 biological traits, which represented the best available current knowledge for EPT in Neotropical savanna streams. We analysed the relationships between the catchment- and site-scale habitat variables and the taxonomic and trait composition of insect assemblages using 1,760 samples collected in 160 stream sites. Catchment- and site-scale variables both explained significant variation in EPT taxon and trait composition. Substrate, habitat hydromorphology and land use most influenced variation in taxonomic composition, whereas trait composition was mainly affected by land use. Catchment geographic position explained less assemblage variation. To our knowledge, this study is the first assessment of the impact of catchment- and site-scale variables on the trait and taxon composition of stream insect assemblages in Neotropical savanna streams. It highlights the need for better regional biological knowledge of invertebrates to generate more general trait-based approaches in freshwater ecosystem conservation.

The results showed that the removal rates for chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) reached 14.56%-30.49%, 38.21%-67.96%, and 24.22%-41.14% respectively, in the TEC treatment, and 51.22%-57.90%, 64.61%-81.95%, and 40.29%-53.45% respectively, in the IMAEC treatment, suggesting that the IMAEC revetment treatment showed higher water purification performance than the TEC revetment treatment. The results of SUVA254, a250/a365 and a253/a203 indicated that the IMAEC treatment showed relatively high removal efficiencies of refractory aromatic compounds. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis indicated that the removal rates for three fluorescent components (humic-like Components 1 and 2, and protein-like Component 3) reached 27.94%, 9.69% and 27.86 respectively, in the TEC treatment, and 51.35%, 30.10%, and 52.97% respectively, in the IMAEC treatment. 2D-COS mapping suggested that protein-like materials were more susceptible than humic-like substances, to the addition of metal ions. Protein-like materials can preferentially interact with metal ions, resulting in the effective removal of DOM-metal complexes, and can further influence the migration and transformation of metal ions.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wading birds have declined across Europe as the intensification of lowland agriculture has resulted in the loss and degradation of wetland areas. Lowland aggregate extraction sites that incorporate areas of fine, waste sediments deposited in silt lagoons have the potential to be restored for wader conservation. We set out to determine the potential value of silt lagoons to wading birds by comparing the water quality, sediment profiles, aquatic invertebrate abundance and diversity (prey availability) and wader site use at five sites representing various stages of active aggregate extraction and restoration for conservation purposes. Wader counts were conducted monthly over a twelve month period using replicated scan samples, and the invertebrate communities studied during the breeding and autumn migration season (June-September). Water quality variables were similar between sites, but sediments from active quarries were dominated by moderately sorted fine sands in comparison to the coarser sediment profiles of restored areas. June and September there was no significant difference in invertebrate diversity between sites, however richness was significantly lower on quarry sites and total abundance a factor of ten higher at restored sites than on silt lagoons, with the dominant taxa similar across all sites. Waders used all sites; albeit at lower abundance and richness on silt lagoons and two species were recorded breeding on active silting sites. We conclude that the fine, uniform sediments of modern silt lagoons limited invertebrate diversity and abundance, diminishing the value of silt lagoons to waders. Simple low-cost intervention measures increasing substrate heterogeneity and creating temporary ponds could increase invertebrate richness and abundance, and enhance the conservation potential of these sites.

Water quality before and after watershed-scale implementation of stormwater wet ponds in the coastal plain	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wet ponds have been used extensively for stormwater control throughout the US, including coastal areas. Despite the widespread application of these water control structures, few studies have investigated how watershed-scale implementation of wet ponds affects downstream water quality or how the pollutant removal efficacy of wet ponds changes over time in a coastal setting. This study utilizes a seven year data set of nutrient, total suspended solid, and chlorophyll-a concentration data collected during baseflow and stormflow from two coastal headwater streams draining a developed (28% impervious) and an undeveloped (1.2% impervious) watershed. The seven year record encompasses before, during, and after a large construction project and concurrent implementation of wet ponds in the developed watershed that drain 97% of the watershed area. Additional nutrient, total suspended solid, and chlorophyll-a concentration data were collected from within a wet pond in the developed watershed during baseflow over a single spring and summer. A comparison of stream water quality before and after the construction project and wet pond implementation in the developed watershed showed that mean chlorophyll-a, nitrate-nitrite (NOx-), organic nitrogen, and total suspended solid concentrations significantly increased, the mean orthophosphate (PO43-) concentration significantly decreased, and the mean ammonium (NH4+) concentration did not change. Over a three year time period after construction and pond implementation, developed stream chlorophyll-a, ammonium, and organic nitrogen concentrations decreased, and nitrate-nitrite, orthophosphate, and total suspended solid concentrations increased compared to the reference stream during the same period, indicating changes in pollutant removal capacity. A comparison of baseflow and stormflow samples during the Post period and samples from a wet pond in the developed watershed indicated that ponds were functioning as sources of chlorophyll-a and total suspended solids to the stream and sinks for nitrate-nitrite. Overall, watershed-scale implementation of wet ponds in the developed watershed failed to mitigate many negative water quality impacts caused by increased development. This study suggests that centralized stormwater management may not be optimal for maintaining water quality in coastal environments, and that pond retrofits combined with frequent excavation could improve pollutant removal by wet ponds. Further research on the effects of nutrient cycling in coastal wet ponds and wet pond maintenance is needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Etheridge, JR; Burchell, MR; Birgand, F				Etheridge, J. Randall; Burchell, Michael R., II; Birgand, Francois			Can created tidal marshes reduce nitrate export to downstream estuaries?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed marshes have the potential to serve as a buffer between anthropogenic sources of nitrogen and nutrient sensitive estuaries. Yet, there is little information available on the reduction of nitrogen loads that created tidal marshes might provide. A 5.6 ha brackish marsh was constructed between row crop agricultural production and an estuary in North Carolina. Nitrate-N fluxes in and out of the marsh were monitored multiple times per hour for over a year to capture tidal and storm dynamics. Out of the five storms when most of the fluxes occurred, nitrate was retained in four (up to 42%), and released in the fifth, such that over the monitoring period the marsh retained 9% (40 kg) of the nitrate that entered. Nutrient addition tracer studies confirmed the potential nitrate retention (up to 45%) of the marsh. The residence time of water in the constructed brackish marsh was identified as the primary factor limiting nitrate retention through an examination of the factors that were related to percent nitrate retention. A retention model based on a mass transfer coefficient was applied during the storm events and tracer studies to further evaluate the marsh N retention capacity. The model adequately simulated the nitrate retention with calibrated mass transfer coefficients (0.1-0.56 m day(-1)) that fell within the range of those reported in literature for other systems. These results indicate that constructed tidal marshes can serve as substantial nitrate sinks and can be an integral part of overall plans to reduce the nutrient export to estuaries.

Effectiveness of water diversion and erosion control structures on skid trails following timber harvesting	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Sediment in forested watersheds is produced primarily from highly disturbed areas such as skid trails. Forestry best management practices (BMPs) have been developed to minimize erosion and water quality problems, but the efficacies of various BMP options such as water bars are not well documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different distances (slope lengths) between water diversion structures (water bars) on runoff volume and soil loss on different skid trail gradients on two soils with different textures. The treatments were located in an Iranian temperate forest and included combinations of three levels of trail gradient (<10%, 10-20% and >20%), four different distances between water bars (25, 50, 75, and 100 m), and two soil textures (clay loam and silt loam). Results showed that runoff volume increased curvilinearly and soil loss linearly with distances between water bars regardless of the soil texture and trail gradient. The greater distances on trail gradients >20% resulted in the highest amounts of runoff and soil loss; shorter distances on trail gradients <10% resulted in the lowest runoff and soil loss amount for the two tested soil textures. On the clay loam soil, 50 and 75 m were the most effective distances between water bars for trail gradients >20 and <20%, respectively. On the silt loam soil, 25 m and 50 m were the most effective distances between water bars for trail gradients >20 and <20%, respectively. The results of our study confirm that slope angle is a primary factor in controlling surface runoff and soil loss on skid trails and that soil texture becomes increasingly important as slope gradients become steeper. Therefore, reducing skid trail slope during construction skid trails is recommended to decrease surface runoff and soil loss in forest operations. Further, BMPs should consider soil texture in addition to slope gradient when recommending spacing between water bars. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, the water quality of the second and subsequent reservoirs usually changes. Based on a zero-dimensional model, this work describes the mass balances of 23 limnological variables in a system of 6 cascade reservoirs located in a well-preserved hydrographic basin (within the Brazilian Tropical Atlantic Forest). Ecosystem services are also mentioned to stress the importance of this system to improve the water quality of the Juquia-Guacu River. Samples were taken from the reservoirsi inputs, in the lacustrine region, and in the Juquia-Guacu River downstream of each reservoir. According to the zero-dimensional model (continuous stirred tank reactor), it can be concluded that: i) the retention intensities of the,elements varied within each reservoir itself and among the reservoirs. These differences occur because chemical and biotic processes concerning retentions are different, and the specific physical conditions (e.g. water velocity, flow, stratification) related to the retentions of each element are different; ii) not all reservoirs presented high assimilation coefficients for all variables, the six reservoirs were very efficient in terms of retaining the elements; iii) the system reduced the amounts of 87% of the variables; iv) for variables related to erosion and runoff the cascade of reservoirs was not able to decrease the values; v) the The high percentage of retention of the limnological variables enables us to evaluate the importance of these reservoirs to reduce eutrophication (nitrogen and phosphorus compounds), turbidity, TS, color, coliforms (total and fecal) from the Juquia-Guacu River.

Lake Karla was one of the most important wetlands of Greece with many benefits not only to biodiversity preservation, to water balance of the watershed, but also to local economy in terms of fisheries. Its drainage, in 1962, created a lot of environmental problems and led to the local economy shrinking. After its refilling, the newly reestablished water body is considered a vital aquatic ecosystem since it is listed in the network of Natura 2000. The monitoring results, the pressures and their causes that affected the restoration effort are presented. The assessment of the water quality is achieved by evaluating the results of the monitoring and fieldwork programs that Management Body of Eco-development Area of Lake Karla has performed during the last four years funded by the European Union. The results indicate strong eutrophication along with threats to biodiversity. The delay of implementation of Lake Karla reconstruction project, the decline from the proposed Environmental Terms and the lack of environmental policy are the most important causes of pressures.

J	Brandao, ILD; Mannaerts, CM; Saraiva, ACF				Brandao, Isabel Leidiany de Sousa; Mannaerts, Chris M.; Fonseca Saraiva, Augusto Cesar			Seasonal variation of phytoplankton indicates small impacts of anthropic activities in a Brazilian Amazonian reserve	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												Knowledge about phytoplankton community structure helps in assessing the quality of a water body. However, variables related to it are not routinely surveyed in most of the water quality monitoring programs. Our approach included studying the diversity of these organisms, in a large tropical reservoir in a Brazilian Amazonian reserve. The research was carried out in the rainy and dry season when measurements were performed every three hours and at five different depths. A total of 40 water samples were collected to analyze temporal variations of abiotic and biotic factors. Physico-chemical parameters were analyzed to characterize the ecosystem and relationships between these variables and phytoplankton functional groups were statistically tested. The data were examined using analysis of variance and canonical correspondence analysis. We identified 9 functional groups in both seasons. The functional group M, which represents organisms with developed adaptations to high insolation and stable environments, had a higher relative percentage of contribution to the total biomass in the rainy season. Group P, which tends to be present in the more eutrophic lakes and is tolerant to carbon deficiency, had a higher relative percentage of contribution to the total biomass in the dry season. This study indicated that the fluctuations of the water level reflected in seasonal changes of phytoplankton biomass and environmental variables. Additionally, this experiment permitted to advise on sampling strategies for monitoring phytoplankton in lakes and reservoirs.

Temporal and spatial variability in macroinvertebrate community structure in relation to environmental variables in Gbako River, Niger State, Nigeria	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Temporal and spatial variability in macroinvertebrate community structure in relation to environmental variables in Gbako River, Niger State, Nigeria was evaluated monthly for a period of six months using modified kick sampling techniques. Four study stations were selected along the river course (upper reaches of less human impacts through mid-reaches with relative high human impacts to lower reaches of less human impacts), designated as stations 1, 2, 3, and 4. High concentrations of dissolved oxygen, lower nutrient and BOD levels were recorded in stations 1 and 4 while lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen, higher nutrient, conductivity levels, and BOD levels were recorded in stations 2 and 3. There was an abundance of the pollution sensitive taxa such as Ephemeroptera (mayflies), Coleopteran (Gyrinus spp., Dytiscus spp.) and Anisoptera (Gomphus sp., Lestinogomphus, Cordulex spp.) in all the stations, especially the upper and lower reaches, whereas on the other hand, some pollution tolerant species like the Crustaceas, Dipterans, Mollusca (Neritina rubricate, Potadoma sp.) were merely restricted to the middle reaches (stations 2 and 3). Of the total number of individual benthic invertebrates recorded during the entire study, 53% was recorded in the dry season while the remaining 47% was recorded in the wet season. However, this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05) when the student t-test (t(stat/cal) = 0.388), t(crit) = 2.447) for the densities and abundances of macroinvertebrates recorded during the two sampling seasons was applied. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) separated the less impacted from the more impacted sites and also showed that the invertebrate fauna was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with environmental factors of Gbako River. The CCA identified conductivity, depth, flow velocity, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, and phosphates as important variables structuring the macroinvertebrate assemblages. The higher number of benthic invertebrates recorded in the dry season could be attributed to the unstable nature of the substrates through inputs and influx of storm water during the rainy season months.																	0564-3295					JUL	2017	58	2					229	240										WOS:000409434700002

SEASONAL PROGRESSION OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS IN A TEMPORARY WETLAND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA	WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST												Seasonal wetlands are important habitats for biodiversity of both invertebrate and vertebrate fauna. Many aquatic species have life history traits adapted to colonizing and developing in temporary aquatic habitats, and these traits influence the annual succession of the macroinvertebrate community. The chronology of taxon appearance and the variation in relative abundances during the hydroperiod are important for understanding population dynamics, trophic interactions, and responses to drought. This study investigated the successional changes in macroinvertebrate abundances in a seasonal wetland in northern California. Water quality parameters were measured regularly, including dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, surface area, and specific conductance during the wet season (January-July) in 2007-2009. Macroinvertebrates were collected with net sweeps (mesh > 500 mu m), and the presence of life stages of amphibians were visually observed from March to June each year. As the hydroperiod progressed, wetland surface area decreased, while water temperature and specific conductance increased. Macroinvertebrate abundance increased with the progression of the hydroperiod, and the richness of macroinvertebrate predator taxa tripled from 2 families in March to 6 families in June. The earliest part of the hydroperiod in the wetland was dominated by Cyzicus clam shrimp and Linderiella occidentalis fairy shrimp. Limnephilus caddisfly larvae were few in number but were found exclusively in the early season. Sequential changes of dominant invertebrate taxa and relative abundances of macroinvertebrates were evident, particularly among several macroinvertebrate predators. Among these predators, the early-season community was dominated by larval dytiscid beetles, while later-season communities demonstrated increased predator richness (e.g., Notonecta backswimmers) and were dominated by Lestes damselflies. Larvae of the vertebrate predator Taricha torosa, which may act as a top predator, were present during the later stages of the hydroperiod. The phenology of individual aquatic taxa and their specific life history strategies may impact the sensitivity of macroinvertebrate populations to increased annual variation in hydroperiod that may result from climate changes in this region.																	1527-0904	1944-8341				JUL	2017	77	2					176	188		10.3398/064.077.0205								WOS:000408018500004

Diatoms to human uses: linking nitrogen deposition, aquatic eutrophication, and ecosystem services	ECOSPHERE												Nitrogen (N) loading to aquatic ecosystems can lead to eutrophication, changing the ecosystem within a waterbody, including primary productivity, water clarity, and food web dynamics. Nutrient loading often first affects the primary productivity of aquatic systems through shifts in phytoplankton communities. However, ecologically important changes in phytoplankton are often not relatable to the general public-whose behavior would need to change to alter patterns of nutrient loading. Therefore, we use the STressor-Ecological Production function-final ecosystem Services Framework to develop 154 chains that link changes in biological indicators of aquatic eutrophication (a shift in phytoplankton community) to final ecosystem services that people use or appreciate. We identify 13 ecological production functions (EPF) within three different ecosystems (alpine lakes, lakes, and estuaries) that connect changes in phytoplankton and algae to ecological endpoints that the general public and policy makers can appreciate. Using the Final Ecosystem Goods and Services Classification System, we identify 18 classes of human beneficiaries that potentially will be impacted by a change in one of these endpoints. We further assign strength-of-science scores to each link within the EPFs for the 154 chains according to how well each link is supported by current peer-reviewed literature. By identifying many pathways through which excess N loading in U. S. surface waters can affect ecosystems and ultimately the beneficiaries of ecosystem services, this work intends to draw attention to gaps in empirical ecological literature that constrain understanding of the magnitude of effects that excess N loading can have on human well-being. Results highlight the importance of intersections between the natural and social sciences when managers and policy makers evaluate impacts from ecological stressors. A balance between knowledgeable specialists proved key to applying this approach and will continue to remain important.

Agricultural Phosphorus Balance Calculator: A tool for watershed planning	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Best management practices implemented to minimize agricultural phosphorus (P) water quality impacts typically focus on retaining nutrients rather than improving P use efficiencies. Although it is now well understood that long-term reduction of P loadings requires achieving a watershed level P balance, this concept is generally not incorporated in watershed planning. This paper develops a detailed P balance for the Albert Lea Lake watershed, a high production agricultural watershed in south-central Minnesota, United States. Watershed specific crop and livestock management data were acquired through personal interviews, surveys, feedlot permits, and site visits. These data, together with published resources, were used to develop an open-source Agricultural P Balance Calculator to compute P use efficiencies of livestock operations, crop production, and collectively, the watershed's agricultural system. In 2010, the P use efficiency was 1.7, indicating that more P was being exported from the watershed as agricultural products than imported, implying that crops were "mining" P from watershed soils. The Agricultural P Balance Calculator enables users to identify production areas where P use efficiency strategies could be incorporated into conservation implementation planning, thereby enhancing prospects for meeting P reduction goals.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JUL-AUG	2017	72	4					395	404		10.2489/jswc.72.4.395								WOS:000405360300013

Linking the biological impacts of ocean acidification on oysters to changes in ecosystem services: A review	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Continued anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are acidifying our oceans, and hydrogen ion concentrations in surface oceans are predicted to increase 150% by 2100. Ocean acidification (OA) is changing ocean carbonate chemistry, including causing rapid reductions in calcium carbonate availability with implications for many marine organisms, including biogenic reefs formed by oysters. The impacts of OA are marked. Adult oysters display both decreased growth and calcification rates, while larval oysters show stunted growth, developmental abnormalities, and increased mortality. These physiological impacts are affecting ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services by oyster reefs. Oysters are ecologically and economically important, providing a wide range of ecosystem services, such as improved water quality, coastlines protection, and food provision. OA has the potential to alter the delivery and the quality of the ecosystem services associated with oyster reefs, with significant ecological and economic losses. This review provides a summary of current knowledge of OA on oyster biology, but then links these impacts to potential changes to the provision of ecosystem services associated with healthy oyster reefs.

We used a framework to present the effect of the two fundamental social, political and economic changes on the biodiversity and ecosystems of Hungary from 1989 until recently. First, following the democratic transformation in 1989 social, political, economic and institutional drivers led to the increase in farmland biodiversity, improvement of water quality due to less chemical use and decrease of habitat loss within protected areas. At the same time, land privatisation and uncertain ownership led to habitat degradation, abandonment and fragmentation. These changes were coupled with the spread of alien species and re-ploughing. The second change was joining the European Union in 2004. This resulted in the establishment of the Natura 2000 network, the application of the relevant EU policies, and access to conservation related EU funds, which contributed to successful habitat restorations increasing of some charismatic species' populations. Meanwhile, however, disappearance of extensive farming practices, agricultural intensification and infrastructural developments driven by some increasing EU funds led to a net habitat loss, degradation and decline in biodiversity, with more than half of the species of European importance having unfavourable conservation status. Increased support for conservation institutions, adaptive and extended agri-environment schemes and further research and monitoring to establish, refine and supervise sustainable management practices, including water management, are needed to prevent further biodiversity loss in the coming years.

Approaches for evaluating subsurface phosphorus loss potential from soil profiles	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The importance of subsurface phosphorus (P) transport in deterioration of surface water quality is well documented. Practices and treatments have been identified and modeling approaches have been implemented to decrease the subsurface P load to surface waters. Soil phosphorus storage capacity (SPSC) is a site-assessment tool that predicts the potential for P loss from soils. We examined the use of SPSC to assess soil profile P distributions and loss potentials for two contrasting soil types: manure-impacted Spodosols and Ultisols. Our specific objectives were to (i) validate prediction of the Langmuir P bonding strength, K-L, the Freundlich adsorption coefficient, K-F, or the linear adsorption coefficient, K-D of Spodosols (Ap, E and Bh horizons) and Ultisols (Ap, E and Bt horizons) using SPSC-based equations developed for surface and sub-surface horizons (Ap, E and Bt) of Ultisols and (ii) identify factors affecting retention and release of P. Results showed that SPSC derived from oxalate-extractions data can effectively predict P isotherm parameters used in P transport models. The SPSC also captured differences between soil horizons within a profile pertinent to P loss. Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) concentrations related to negative SPSC, likely due to the presence of these components in dairy manure. The initial sorbed P in the solid phase (So) of both soil types was related to soil components such as Mg, Ca and total P when SPSC was positive. The equations developed from A, E and Bt horizons of Ultisol relating isotherm parameters to the PSR and SPSC made successful predictions for all horizons of Ultisols sampled from locations different from those in the current study and Spodosols suggesting that such equations might be applicable across a wide range of soils.																	0167-8809	1873-2305				JUL 1	2017	245						92	99		10.1016/j.agee.2017.05.006								WOS:000403988600010

However, relatively little research has been conducted on managing P in rice (Oryza sativa L.) production systems, where fanning practices differ from those of upland cropping systems due to water ponding on the soil surface (field ponding water; FPW). Because FPW is a direct source of surface runoff, identifying the main source of P and the critical period of high P concentrations in the FPW provide important insights to mitigating P runoff losses. In this study, field monitoring and laboratory incubation experiments were combined to evaluate how soil P content and conventional P fertilizer application affected FPW P concentrations in rice-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation systems of five Chinese rice producing regions. All soils had Olsen-P concentrations (10.1-20.5 mg kg(-1)) well below the critical levels (30-172 mg kg(-1)) for promoted risks of P loss. However, conventional P application rate significantly elevated FPW P concentrations compared to no P application, and P fertilizer contributed 47-92% of total P (TP) and 59-97% of total dissolved P (TDP) in the FPW. Temporarily, both TP and TDP concentrations peaked one day after P application (0.15-8.90 mg TP L-1 and 0.16-4.49 mg TDP L-1), then decreased rapidly and stabilized five days later. We conclude that fertilizer is the major source of P loss in Chinese rice production systems, and that P fertilizer rate should be optimized to reduce P concentrations in the effluent water in the first week following P application.

Persistent toxic pollutants representing three classes: organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were studied in grab water samples, in passive samplers/SemiPermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) and in fish tissues collected along the Strymonas River, northern Greece at three sampling campaigns during the year 2013. Almost all the target compounds were detected in the study river of Strymonas, northern Greece at the periods of high rainfall intensity and/or low flow-rate. The most frequently detected compounds were 1,2-benzanthracene, benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, endosulfan I, endosulfan II, endosulfan sulfate, endrin aldehyde, fluorene, methoxychlor, polychlorinated biphenyl PCB 28, PCB 180 and pyrene. The family of DDT compounds and aldrin were also occasionally detected. Agricultural run-off and waste effluents are the main sources of hydrophobic organic compounds in the river basin. The use of SPMDs allowed the detection of more micropollutants than active sampling (31 vs. 16, respectively). Results showed relatively low risk however the potential risk associated with micropollutants such as 1,2-benzanthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), endosulfan II, methoxychlor, PCB 180 and pyrene should not be neglected. Performing risk assessment based on passive sampling, more information was obtained about temporal and spatial variation. SPMDs could be applied as a pre-evaluation before chemical monitoring in biota.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				JUL	2017	26	5					625	638		10.1007/s10646-017-1795-2								WOS:000403461400005	28382548

Impact of ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate on tadpoles of Alytes obstetricans	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The presence of pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers negatively affect aquatic communities in general, and particularly amphibians in their larval phase, even though sensitivity to pollutants is highly variable among species. The Llobregat Delta (Barcelona, Spain) has experienced a decline of amphibian populations, possibly related to the reduction in water quality due to the high levels of farming activity, but also to habitat loss and alteration. We studied the effects of increasing ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate levels on the survival and growth rate of Alytes obstetricans tadpoles under experimental conditions. We exposed larvae to increasing concentrations of nitrate and ammonium for 14 days and then exposed them to water without pollutants for a further 14 days. Only the higher concentrations of ammonium (> 33.75 mg/L) caused larval mortality. The growth rate of larvae was reduced at a22.5 mg/L NH4 (+), although individuals recovered and even increased their growth rate once exposure to the pollutant ended. The effect of nitrate on growth rate was detected at a80 mg/L concentrations, and the growth rate reduction in tadpoles was even observed during the post-exposure phase. The concentrations of ammonium with adverse effects on larvae are within the range levels found in the study area, while the nitrate concentrations with some adverse effect are close to the upper range limit of current concentrations in the study area. Therefore, only the presence of ammonium in the study area is likely to be considered of concern for the population of this species, even though the presence of nitrate could cause some sublethal effects. These negative effects could have an impact on population dynamics, which in this species is highly sensitive to larval mortality due to its small clutch size and prolonged larval period compared to other anuran amphibians.																	0963-9292	1573-3017				JUL	2017	26	5					667	674		10.1007/s10646-017-1799-y								WOS:000403461400009	28409413

This Himalayan geothermal region encompassed hot springs ranging in temperature from 60 to 95 degrees C, in pH from 6.2 to 9.4, and in mineralogy from bicarbonates (Tato Field), sulfates (Tatta Pani) to mixed type (Murtazaabad). Microbial community structures in these geothermal springs remained largely unexplored to date. In this study, we report a comprehensive, culture-independent survey of microbial communities in nine samples from these geothermal fields by employing a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. The bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Chloroflexi were dominant in all samples from Tato Field, Tatta Pani, and Murtazaabad. The community structures however depended on temperature, pH, and physicochemical parameters of the geothermal sites. The Murtazaabad hot springs with relatively higher temperature (90-95 degrees C) favored the growth of phylum Thermotogae, whereas the Tatta Pani thermal spring site TP-H3-b (60 degrees C) favored the phylum Proteobacteria. At sites with low silica and high temperature, OTUs belonging to phylum Chloroflexi were dominant. Deep water areas of the Murtazaabad hot springs favored the sulfur-reducing bacteria. About 40% of the total OTUs obtained from these samples were unclassified or uncharacterized, suggesting the presence of many undiscovered and unexplored microbiota. This study has provided novel insights into the nature of ecological interactions among important taxa in these communities, which in turn will help in determining future study courses in these sites.

J	Grochowska, J; Augustyniak, R; Lopata, M				Grochowska, Jolanta; Augustyniak, Renata; Lopata, Michal			How durable is the improvement of environmental conditions in a lake after the termination of restoration treatments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The study was conducted on Lake Dlugie,a water body lying in Olsztyn, a town situated in northeastern Poland. From 1956 to 1976raw wastewater was discharged into Lake Dlugie and therefore heavy pollution was the reason for the total degradation of this lake. The concentrations of nutrients were very high in the bottom water layer (TN 22.89 mg L-1, TP 3.50 mg L-1). The mean concentration of chlorophyll an exceeded 60 mu g L-1 on average and Secchi disc visibility was less than 1 m. The discontinuation of sewage discharge into the lake caused the saprotrophic state to transform into hypertrophy. Further improvement of the environmental conditions in the lake was possible only after the implementation of an appropriate restoration method. The restoration procedure of this lake began in 1987. The first stage involved an artificial aeration method, and the second stage consisted of a phosphorus inactivation method. The applied restoration methods led to the improvement of Lake Dlugie's water quality. Even ten years after the restoration oscillated in the range of 5-10 mu g L-1, Chlorophyll a contents oscillated in the range of 5-10 mu g L-1, and Secchi disc visibility amounted to c.a. 4.5 m.

They are affected by nutrient and light availability and seasonal changes. In this study, we investigated the changes of C/N metabolism and growth of three natural submersed macrophyte populations (i.e., each in a different site), Potamogeton maackianus, in response to water depth gradients with 0.5 m interval in a freshwater lake for four seasons. Changes were identified by measuring the biomass of the sampled macrophytes and metabolite contents of soluble carbohydrate (SC), starch, and free amino acid (FAA) in their organs. Results showed that no significant and consistent changes were found in the SC and FAA contents in leaves and stems from 1.0 m to 5.5 m water depth, as compared to previous results of controlled studies, suggesting a relative stable C/N metabolism in response to the depth gradients in studied natural populations of P. maackianus. The metabolite contents with the most variations appeared mainly because of seasonal changes. The metabolite contents of the macrophyte populations were more closely correlated with the chemical parameters than with the light parameters in water columns. No significant correlations were found between the metabolite contents with the light attenuation coefficient ($K$) and Secchi depth (SD) in water columns. The NO3-N and total phosphorus (TP) contents in water columns were positively correlated with the SC and starch contents in leaves, respectively. The NH4-N content in water columns was negatively related to the FAA content in leaves. Metabolite contents had weak correlations with depth gradients and light parameters, probably because of the physiological integration among individuals by developed stolons and the canopy-forming characteristic of this species. Our results highlighted the importance of water quality to the C/N metabolism in natural population of submersed macrophyte. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Piano, E; Falasco, E; Bona, F				Piano, Elena; Falasco, Elisa; Bona, Francesca			How does water scarcity affect spatial and temporal patterns of diatom community assemblages in Mediterranean streams?	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Mediterranean streams are mostly characterised by intermittent flow regime, with droughts in summer followed by floods in autumn. During droughts, the creation of lentic habitats (i.e. lentification process) and isolated pools in the riverbeds (i.e. fragmentation process) represents a strong selective pressure on biotic communities, which might be intensified by human-induced water scarcity. In the highly heterogeneous habitat patches created by these processes, species sorting may be driven by stochastic mechanisms, as well as by environmental filtering. In this work, we investigated the spatial and temporal patterns in the assemblage of diatom communities during water scarcity periods in Mediterranean streams. Five oligotrophic streams, which were similar in terms of physical and chemical parameters, were sampled in the Ligurian Alps (NW Italy). Data were collected during moderate flow in April 2014 and then at least monthly during water scarcity, from June to September 2014, in: (1) lentic sites, where the water flow became slower but was permanent all year around, (2) fragmented sites, where the riverbed stretch dried out creating isolated pools. For each sampling site, we collected six benthic diatom samples from different microhabitats. We examined which type of factors, i.e. spatial or environmental, better explained the temporal and spatial variation in diatom communities. We then calculated the turnover and nestedness components of dissimilarity by comparing samples collected during moderate flow with samples obtained during a period of water scarcity. We further investigated if the idiosyncrasy of diatom species, i.e. a measure of their discrepancy from a nested pattern, could be explained by the ecological niche width of species and/or by species traits. Our results showed a contribution of both environmental and spatial factors in determining species composition during water scarcity, with the overall trends in community structure being driven by species turnover. The percentage of idiosyncratic species (those departing from the nested pattern) increased with increasing water scarcity, but showed no differences in terms of species traits. According to our results, species turnover, with replacement of sensitive species by tolerant species, seemed to be the dominating process in diatom benthic communities during water scarcity in the streams under investigation. A better evaluation of species autecology could improve the evaluation of water quality in Mediterranean streams.

Sequential rather than interactive effects of multiple stressors as drivers of phytoplankton community change in a large lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Predicting how freshwater biota respond to multiple stressors is currently a major challenge facing aquatic ecologists and environmental managers. Lake Simcoe is an ideal location to test the impact of multiple stressors on aquatic biota over time, as changes in climate warming, species invasions, nutrient loading, and human population growth have occurred throughout the last three decades. In this study, we used a suite of multivariate analyses to quantify the unique and interactive effects of physico-climatic, water quality, and biological variables in explaining phytoplankton community composition from 1986 to 2012. Changes in water quality, zooplankton abundance and community composition (following the invasion of Bythotrephes longimanus), euphotic zone temperature and thermal stability, and the invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) acting at different times throughout the period of record, were associated with major shifts in the phytoplankton community of Lake Simcoe: dominance of eutrophic diatoms and cyanobacteria from 1986 to 1997 shifted to chlorophytes after 1998, then again to a diverse mix of taxa represented by all major categories of algae after 2004. Contrary to expectation, we found little evidence that interactions between multiple stressors are taking place in Lake Simcoe. Instead, our results demonstrated the sequential nature of multiple stressors in influencing interannual variation in phytoplankton community structure. By occurring consecutively over time, we propose a sequence of stressors has influenced the ecological health of the lake over the preceding three decades. Considered by category, biological stressors, followed by water quality, then temperature and climate, explained the largest amount of total variance in the phytoplankton data. The prominence of zooplankton community changes as significant predictors of phytoplankton community change throughout the period of record suggests the top-down effect of these herbivores are also very important. Our results highlight the importance of extensive ecosystem monitoring in determining ecosystem health. Our approach may assist in the management of other aquatic systems, where identifying when multiple stressors are not operating may simplify the management process, allowing remediation efforts to focus on the most impactful stressors as primary targets for ecosystem restoration.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2017	62	7					1288	1302		10.1111/fwb.12945								WOS:000403021500015						
J	Reynaud, A; Lanzanova, D				Reynaud, Arnaud; Lanzanova, Denis			A Global Meta-Analysis of the Value of Ecosystem Services Provided by Lakes	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												This study presents the first meta-analysis on the economic value of ecosystem services delivered by lakes. A worldwide data set of 699 observations drawn from 133 studies combines information reported in primary studies with geospatial data. The meta-analysis explores antagonisms and synergies between ecosystem services. This is the first meta-analysis to incorporate simultaneously external geospatial data and ecosystem service interactions. We first show that it is possible to reliably predict the value of ecosystem services provided by lakes based on their physical and geographic characteristics. Second, we demonstrate that interactions between ecosystem services appear to be significant for explaining lake ecosystem service values. Third, we provide an estimation of the average value of ecosystem services provided by lakes: between 106 and 140 USD$2010 per respondent per year for non-hedonic price studies and between 169 and 403 USD$2010 per property per year for hedonic price studies.

The Integrated Ecological Modeling System (IEMS) forecasts water quality and quantity, habitat suitability for aquatic biota, fish biomasses, population densities, productivities, and contamination by methylmercury across head-water watersheds. We applied this IEMS to the Coal River Basin (CRB), West Virginia (USA), an 8-digit hydrologic unit watershed, by simulating a network of 97 stream segments using the SWAT watershed model, a watershed mercury loading model, the WASP water quality model, the PiSCES fish community estimation model, a fish habitat suitability model, the BASS fish community and bioaccumulation model, and an ecoservices post-processer. Model application was facilitated by automated data retrieval and model setup and updated model wrappers and interfaces for data transfers between these models from a prior study. This companion study evaluates baseline predictions of ecoservices provided for 1990-2010 for the population of streams in the CRB and serves as a foundation for future model development.

From soil water to surface water - how the riparian zone controls element transport from a boreal forest to a stream	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Boreal headwaters are often lined by strips of highly organic soils, which are the last terrestrial environment to leave an imprint on discharging groundwater before it enters a stream. Because these riparian soils are so different from the Podzol soils that dominate much of the boreal landscape, they are known to have a major impact on the biogeochemistry of important elements such as C, N, P and Fe and the transfer of these elements from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems. For most elements, however, the role of the riparian zone has remained unclear, although it should be expected that the mobility of many elements is affected by changes in, for example, pH, redox potential and concentration of organic carbon as they are transported through the riparian zone. Therefore, soil water and groundwater was sampled at different depths along a 22m hillslope transect in the Krycklan catchment in northern Sweden using soil lysimeters and analysed for a large number of major and trace elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Ca, Cd, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Fe, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Si, Sr, Th, Ti, U, V, Zn, Zr) and other parameters such as sulfate and total organic carbon (TOC). The results showed that the concentrations of most investigated elements increased substantially (up to 60 times) as the water flowed from the uphill mineral soils and into the riparian zone, largely as a result of higher TOC concentrations. The stream water concentrations of these elements were typically somewhat lower than in the riparian zone, but still considerably higher than in the uphill mineral soils, which suggests that riparian soils have a decisive impact on the water quality of boreal streams. The degree of enrichment in the riparian zone for different elements could be linked to the affinity for organic matter, indicating that the pattern with strongly elevated concentrations in riparian soils is typical for organophilic substances. One likely explanation is that the solubility of many organophilic elements increases as a result of the higher concentrations of TOC in the riparian zone. Elements with low or modest affinity for organic matter (e.g. Na, Cl, K, Mg and Ca) occurred in similar or lower concentrations in the riparian zone. Despite the elevated concentrations of many elements in riparian soil water and groundwater, no increase in the concentrations in biota could be observed (bilberry leaves and spruce shoots).

J	Smith, RM; Kaushal, SS; Beaulieu, JJ; Pennino, MJ; Welty, C				Smith, Rose M.; Kaushal, Sujay S.; Beaulieu, Jake J.; Pennino, Michael J.; Welty, Claire			Influence of infrastructure on water quality and greenhouse gas dynamics in urban streams	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Streams and rivers are significant sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) globally, and watershed management can alter greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from streams. We hypothesized that urban infrastructure significantly alters downstream water quality and contributes to variability in GHG saturation and emissions. We measured gas saturation and estimated emission rates in headwaters of two urban stream networks (Red Run and Dead Run) of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research project. We identified four combinations of stormwater and sanitary infrastructure present in these watersheds, including: (1) stream burial, (2) inline stormwater wetlands, (3) riparian/floodplain preservation, and (4) septic systems. We selected two first-order catchments in each of these categories and measured GHG concentrations, emissions, and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC) and nutrient concentrations biweekly for 1 year. From a water quality perspective, the DOC: NO3- ratio of streamwater was significantly different across infrastructure categories. Multiple linear regressions including DOC: NO (-)(3) and other variables (dissolved oxygen, DO; total dissolved nitrogen, TDN; and temperature) explained much of the statistical variation in nitrous oxide (N2O, r(2) = 0.78), carbon dioxide (CO2, r(2) = 0.78), and methane (CH4, r(2) = 0.50) saturation in stream water. We measured N2O saturation ratios, which were among the highest reported in the literature for streams, ranging from 1.1 to 47 across all sites and dates. N2O saturation ratios were highest in streams draining watersheds with septic systems and strongly correlated with TDN. The CO2 saturation ratio was highly correlated with the N2O saturation ratio across all sites and dates, and the CO2 saturation ratio ranged from 1.1 to 73. CH4 was always supersaturated, with saturation ratios ranging from 3.0 to 2157. Longitudinal surveys extending form headwaters to third-order outlets of Red Run and Dead Run took place in spring and fall. Linear regressions of these data yielded significant negative relationships between each gas with increasing watershed size as well as consistent relationships between solutes (TDN or DOC, and DOC: TDN ratio) and gas saturation. Despite a decline in gas saturation between the headwaters and stream outlet, streams remained saturated with GHGs throughout the drainage network, suggesting that urban streams are continuous sources of CO2, CH4, and N2O. Our results suggest that infrastructure decisions can have significant effects on downstream water quality and greenhouse gases, and watershed management strategies may need to consider coupled impacts on urban water and air quality.																	1726-4170	1726-4189				JUN 13	2017	14	11					2831	2849		10.5194/bg-14-2831-2017								WOS:000403227200001

Since benthic macroinvertebrate assembly can reflect the benthic stream conditions, we assessed the river habitat integrity based on benthic macroinvertebrate multi-metric model. The development and application of Benthic macroinvertebrate multi-metric index (B-MMI) was based on samples collected from October to November 2014 at representative sites from upper to lower reaches in Luanhe River, Haihe River Basin, China. Hydromorphology, water quality and land use patterns were considered to define reference sites and metrics related to macroinvertebrate community composition, structure, function and tolerance to pollution were selected as candidate metrics. Then, Range, sensitivity and redundancy tests were used to select candidate metrics based on their ability to distinguish the reference and impaired sites. As the result, four core indicators were selected to build the B-MMI: EPT%, Tubificidae%, BI (Biotic Index), Collect-Gatherers%. The values of B-MMI ranged from 0.21 to 3.75 in 17 sites. Based on B-MMI values, the habitat integrity of 29% sites were in very poor status and 6% were in excellent status. The upper reaches were influenced by animal husbandry and tourism, while the lower reaches were influenced by urbanization and dams. More good habitats were located in middle reaches under less human disturbances. Overall, this B-MMI shows promise for developing biomonitoring tools to assess the habitat integrity of streams, to provide appropriate restoration strategies and policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Currently, overall water quality of the river is very poor, i.e., Class IV (based on the Malaysian water quality standards), mainly due to wastewater discharged from residential area and industries without being properly treated. Due to severe pollution, aquatic ecosystem has not been properly developed. Thus, it is being considered to construct a new wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to prevent discharge of pollutants and to improve the river water quality. Therefore, this study was conducted to identify the pollution sources along the river and assess their impacts on the water quality. In addition, a numerical model was formulated with the Environmental Fluid Dynamic Code (EFDC) to find a best plan to improve the water quality. Through the model simulation, it was found that wastewater from all the U-drains and culverts along the river should be collected by sewer, transported to a WWTP for treatment, and then pumped to the upstream of the river for discharge. It was also found that if the WWTP would reduce pollution load by 80%, the current water quality of the river would improve by 80% to achieve Class II. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services (RAWES): An example from Colombo, Sri Lanka	ECOSYSTEM SERVICES												Wetlands make essential positive contributions to multiple dimensions of human wellbeing. However, recognition of these benefits is often lacking in decision-making, compromising the wellbeing of both the ecosystem and is many linked human beneficiaries. Wetland site managers, decision-makers and stakeholders all need to better understand the benefits provided by wetlands. Despite a plethora of available assessment techniques, very few approaches are genuinely rapid, applicable across different wetland types or consider the realities of time and money resource constraints. The Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services (RAWES) approach is presented as a method that meets these needs, illustrated through its practical application in over 60 different wetland sites supporting development of a Wetland Strategy for the Metro Colombo Region, Sri Lanka. The approach is based on the trained, local assessors using a variety of field indicators in order to assess the positive or negative contribution over 30 wetland ecosystem services provide at local, regional or global scales. Outputs are simplified, signalling to decision- makers the diversity of interlinked ecosystem service outcomes consequent from management policies and actions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Spatio-temporal co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs: a modelling approach using physical-chemical predictors	AQUATIC INVASIONS												The invasion of alien species can have serious economic and ecological impacts. Ecologically, invasions often lead to an increased rate of native species replacement and decreased biodiversity. A critical step in the dominance of alien species is their successful co-occurrence with native species. In this study, we assessed the occurrence of alien molluscs and their co-occurrence with native molluscs and identified the determining physical-chemical variables. We expected that a combination of some key variables of water quality could provide suitable conditions promoting alien molluscs to occur and to co-occur with native molluscs. The analyses were based on 20-year data, collected from river systems across Flanders (Belgium). Classification Trees (CTs) were used to perform the analyses and to develop the predictive models. Based on CT models, the co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs could be reliably predicted based on physical-chemical variables. However, there was insufficient data to determine the environmental conditions in which alien taxa dominate. From the past to the present, spatial co-occurrence significantly increased. Sinuosity, ammonium and nitrate concentrations, chemical oxygen demand, pH and conductivity were the key determining variables. Our findings suggest that the co-occurrence of alien and native molluscs mainly occurs in straight rivers with good chemical water quality. These results provide insights into the ecology and behaviour of alien species which could support management practices and priority setting for conservation planning in surface waters of Flanders and Europe.																	1798-6540	1818-5487				JUN	2017	12	2					147	158		10.3391/ai.2017.12.2.03								WOS:000406481300003

Intensive, long-term studies on hydrological and hydrochemical parameters were monitored at 4 permanent dripping sites (VP1-VP4) in the Velika Pasica Cave (Slovenian) over a period from 2006 to 2013 concurrently with aquatic fauna sampling. Multivariate methods were applied to elucidate the relationship between the environmental conditions and the resident aquatic ecosystem. Seven major aquatic taxa were collected from the drips, with Copepoda being the dominant taxa; however, the spatial distribution and composition of these species varied distinctively at the 4 study sites; the drip water from different sites had distinct hydrological and hydrochemical characteristics. The most significant parameters influencing community composition were drip water discharge volume and NO3-ion content. The results indicate that hydrology and hydrochemistry significantly influence the microdistribution of aquatic fauna within the epikarstic aquifer.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				JUN	2017	10	4							UNSP e1835	10.1002/eco.1835								WOS:000403068700013

The effects of catchment and riparian forest quality on stream environmental conditions across a tropical rainforest and oil palm landscape in Malaysian Borneo	ECOHYDROLOGY												Freshwaters provide valuable habitat and important ecosystem services but are threatened worldwide by habitat loss and degradation. In Southeast Asia, rainforest streams are particularly threatened by logging and conversion to oil palm, but we lack information on the impacts of this on freshwater environmental conditions, and the relative importance of catchment versus riparian-scale disturbance. We studied 16 streams in Sabah, Borneo, including old-growth forest, logged forest, and oil palm sites. We assessed forest quality in riparian zones and across the whole catchment and compared it with stream environmental conditions including water quality, structural complexity, and organic inputs. We found that streams with the highest riparian forest quality were nearly 4 degrees C cooler, over 20 cm deeper, had over 40% less sand, greater canopy cover, more stored leaf litter, and wider channels than oil palm streams with the lowest riparian forest quality. Other variables were significantly related to catchment-scale forest quality, with streams in the highest quality forest catchments having 40% more bedrock and 20 times more dead wood, along with higher phosphorus, and lower nitrate-N levels compared to streams with the lowest catchment-scale forest quality. Although riparian buffer strips went some way to protecting waterways, they did not maintain fully forest-like stream conditions. In addition, logged forest streams still showed signs of disturbance 10-15 years after selective logging. Our results suggest that maintenance and restoration of buffer strips can help to protect healthy freshwater ecosystems but logging practices and catchment-scale forest management also need to be considered.

Influence of Local, Landscape, and Regional Variables on Sedge and Marsh Wren Occurrence in Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands	WETLANDS												We determined the influence of habitat, landscape, geographic, and climate variables on Sedge Wren (Cistothorus platensis) and Marsh Wren (C. palustris) occurrence in 840 coastal wetland survey points throughout the Great Lakes. Variables included surrounding land use and configuration out to 2000 m; latitude; longitude; temperature; precipitation; and vegetation characteristics within 100 m. Classification trees predicted Sedge Wren occurrence at points in the western Great Lakes with < 11 km of roads within 1000 m. Emergent herbaceous wetland within 500 m, woody wetland within various distances, and sedge within 100 m were also positively associated with Sedge Wren occurrence. Marsh Wren occurrence was predicted at points in the southern Great Lakes with < 42% developed land within 500 m. Emergent herbaceous wetland within 500 m, cropland within various distances, and cattail within 100 m were also positively associated with Marsh Wren occurrence. Our results suggest limiting development around wetlands is important for conserving these bird species throughout Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Landscape-scale land cover variables are easily obtainable and significantly increase our ability to predict occurrence of these species across a broad geographic scale.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2017	37	3					447	459		10.1007/s13157-017-0881-9								WOS:000403573000005

Planning and establishment principles for constructed wetlands and riparian buffer zones in agricultural catchments	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												In a great number of scientific articles on water quality improvement using constructed wetlands (CW) and riparian buffers zones (RBZ) at catchment scale, contradictory results are found. In most cases this is due to underestimating or even ignoring the role of the hydrological factor for water quality improvement. It has often resulted in biased estimates of buffering systems' efficiency at catchment scale and, consequently, has caused planning and establishment failures, mistakes and inconsistencies in legislative acts and finally, it has influenced stakeholder's willingness to support these eco-technological measures. In this paper we present a short but critical overview of the potential of CWs and RBZs in water quality improvement at catchment scale and highlight the most important aspects to be considered when planning, establishing and managing these systems.

Recovering hydromorphological functionality to improve natural purification capacity of a highly human-modified wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					9th International Meeting of the European-Chapter of the Society-of-Wetland-Scientists (SWS) on Wetlands Biodiversity and Services - Tools for Socio-Ecological Development held Jointly with the 6th Conference of the European-Pond-Conservation-Network	SEP 14-18, 2014	Huesca, SPAIN	Soc Wetland Scientists, European Chapter, European Pond Conservat Network				Modification of the hydrological regime by human actions can reduce the capacity of wetlands to improve water quality. For the first time, a study was conducted of the inherent pollution attenuation capacity of wetlands associated with the highly regulated Spanish Tagus River. We determined the natural purification capacity of a floodplain where irrigated agriculture predominates and hydraulic connection with the river is virtually nonexistent. To this end, continuous hydrophysical measurements and sediment and water samples were taken during the period extending from April 2013 to March 2014. A multi-parametric dataset including hydraulic, physico-chemical, bacterial and macroinvertebrate indicators was collected from ten piezometers located within a meander, together with two additional sampling points in the river. Sampling was performed monthly to measure hydraulic and physico-chemical parameters and quarterly for bacteria and macroinvertebrates. The data enabled us to implement different but complementary methodological approaches to characterize denitrification. Specifically, we performed: (i) end-member mixing analysis (EMMA); (ii) macroinvertebrate characterization; (iii) denitrification potential analysis; (iv) bacterial assemblage structure analysis; and (v) hydrological modeling of the current and different future management scenarios. All the approaches except EMMA indicated the same conclusion: denitrification is almost nonexistent due to the fact that the study site does not present the hydric soil and oxygen-limited conditions required to enable denitrification. The EMMA analysis showed that theoretical nitrate concentrations were lower than expected in some areas during the summer months (e.g. Delta NO3 = -41 in August 2013), which may have been because irrigation intensity was spatiotemporal variable at the study site. Our results show that floodplain denitrification has been drastically reduced due to the suppression of flood pulses. In this context, restoration of the hydrological regime in riverine wetlands would lead to the decay of nitrates whose dynamic evolution increases with flooding, as scenarios tested by the MOHID hydro-biogeochemical model have demonstrated.

Assessment of the denitrification process in alluvial wetlands at floodplain scale using the SWAT model	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					9th International Meeting of the European-Chapter of the Society-of-Wetland-Scientists (SWS) on Wetlands Biodiversity and Services - Tools for Socio-Ecological Development held Jointly with the 6th Conference of the European-Pond-Conservation-Network	SEP 14-18, 2014	Huesca, SPAIN	Soc Wetland Scientists, European Chapter, European Pond Conservat Network				As alluvial plains support intensive agricultural activities, they often suffer from groundwater nitrate pollution. Denitrification is recognised as an important process in nitrate pollution control in riparian zones. In shallow aquifer zones influenced by recharged surface water, denitrification efficiently attenuates nitrate in groundwater as well, and the exchange between surface water and groundwater has a significant impact on the occurrence of denitrification. Denitrification is simulated in numerous models, however most models do not take into account the denitrification occurring in shallow aquifers or the influence of recharge surface water in the alluvial aquifer with organic carbon and bacteria to activate denitrification. In this study, a new module was developed that represents the occurrence of denitrification in the shallow aquifer of alluvial floodplains. Nitrate inputs in the shallow aquifer caused by the recharged river water through both lateral (river bank) and vertical (surface) infiltration and the influence of flooding on nitrate leaching were added to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool - Landscape Unit Darcy (SWAT-LUD) model. The influences of both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) on denitrification were evaluated. The modified model was applied on an experimental site located in the floodplain of the Garonne River (southwest France). Results showed that the modified SWAT-LUD model was able to simulate the aquifer nitrate concentration in the near-bank zone (riparian zone) satisfactorily. The near-bank zone in the floodplain played the most important role in attenuating nitrate through denitrification with an annual denitrification rate of around 130 kg N-NO(3)(-)ha(-1)y(-1), representing about 40% of the nitrate input in this area. POC was more important than DOC in the denitrification process, especially in the near-bank zone where 98% of the nitrate was attenuated through POC consumption. Relationships between denitrification rates, groundwater levels and total input nitrate masses in the near-bank zone were determined. The results illustrated that groundwater levels were positively related to the denitrification rates in the near-bank zone. The absolute denitrification rate increased as the nitrate content increased, but the relative consumption rate by denitrification decreased. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Samples were taken during different periods of the year during 2011-2014 to evaluate the influence of agricultural activities during the two years following their completion. Nitrate concentration was significantly higher in the in-stream wetlands, showing a clear dilution effect caused by the inputs of the irrigation return flows. The patterns followed by the first-order nitrate removal rate constant were different for in-stream and off-stream wetlands and during irrigation and non-irrigation seasons. During non-irrigation seasons, the nitrate outflowing concentration was found to be negatively correlated (p < 0.01) to the first-order nitrate removal rate constant for in-stream wetlands, indicating that high nitrate inputs may restrict the effectiveness of the wetlands. Temperature and dissolved oxygen were also found to significantly influence the performance of off-stream wetlands during non-irrigation seasons, but only dissolved oxygen promoted the nitrate removal during the irrigation period, indicating the influence of the seasonal factor on nitrate and wetlands dynamics. The results of this study showed that although a longer time is required to achieve optimal wetland development, wetlands can be used as buffer zones that effectively remove nitrates. This study emphasizes the influence of the agricultural seasonality of the factors affecting nitrate removal in wetlands, expanding the information provided by similar studies and validating a model that is applicable to a wide range of agricultural, hydrological and seasonal conditions.

Riparian forest is thus a green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation. However, a long history of landscape alteration now calls for maintenance and restoration by ecological engineering. This study evaluates management guidelines advocating constant vs. variable width of riparian forest protected zones in managed landscapes. In naturally dynamic forests, stands with gap-phase dynamic along streams often provide a network of habitats with a high degree of continuity in tree canopy cover and dead wood for biodiversity conservation and delivery of ecosystem services including water purification. Based on the observation that tall herb sites indicate a potential for temporally continuous forest cover, we tested three null hypotheses. Tall herb sites ( 1) are equally common in the riparian zone and in the surrounding forest landscape; ( 2) have the same width on both sides of a stream; and ( 3) their widths are independent of the width of the adjacent stream. We described the ground vegetation in transects along and perpendicular to streams, and in the surrounding landscape, in six 3rd stream order catchment located in Sweden, Lithuania and the Komi Republic of Russia. The results showed that tall herb sites were 21-27 times more common along streams compared to in the rest of the landscape, the width of tall herb sites varied considerably along streams, and it was independent of the width of the adjacent stream. This study suggests that rather than fixed-width guidelines for riparian set-asides, to support cost-efficient maintenance of riparian forest, local site conditions should be used as guide for planning, maintenance and engineering of riparian ecotones. Because tall herb forest sites were historically cleared for agricultural purposes, the potential natural amount of riparian forest is severely underestimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The lake has hosted numerous different management efforts. Diversion of sewage waters away from the lake in 1979 resulted in a considerable reduction of external P loading. Due to diffuse loading from agricultural areas, external loading however still exceeds the critical loading of the lake, thus having an effect on the water quality. The total P concentration of surface layers has decreased but is still on a hypertrophic level (90 g1-1). The high productivity of the lake is maintained also by intensive internal P loading, and the sediment has a potential to release P to the water for decades even if external loading would be reduced to a tolerable level. Internal P loading has not decreased over the studied decades despite numerous within-lake management efforts (aeration with different methods, food web management). In opposite, our results demonstrated that destratification applied since 1998 resulted in a persisting internal P loading. Destratification has increased the concentration of oxygen and decreased the concentration of soluble P in deep water, but at the same time it has accelerated P release from aerobic bottoms. This can be due to elevated near-bottom temperatures, enhanced liberation of organic P through accelerated mineralization, and increased sediment resuspension by aeration-induced turbulence. Additionally, increasing wind velocities may have a role in the increasing aerobic internal loading. Food web management has compensated for the amplified P-cycling, revealed by the decreasing chlorophyll:total P ratio. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Sustained Biogeochemical Impacts of Wildfire in a Mountain Lake Catchment	ECOSYSTEMS												Wild and prescribed fires can cause severe deterioration in water quality, including increases in sediment, nutrients and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Due to the unpredictability of wildfires, few studies have been able to employ before-after, control-intervention experimental designs, or to evaluate fire-induced water-quality changes in the context of long-term datasets. Here, we present data from a lake draining a moorland catchment in the United Kingdom, part of a 22-site, 25 year monitoring network, which experienced a major wildfire in 2011. The main water-quality response was a large, sustained increase in nitrate concentrations, sufficient to raise acidity and aluminium concentrations, effectively reversing over a decade of recovery from the effects of acid deposition. Concurrently, we observed a clear reduction in DOC concentrations, contrasting with prescribed fire studies from similar ecosystems (none based on before-after studies) that have suggested that burning causes DOC to increase. However, data from a downstream water supply reservoir do suggest a fire-induced change in DOC quality towards more soil-derived aromatic organic compounds, and lake sediment data suggest a large increase in particulate organic carbon. We conclude that the biogeochemical responses to wildfire in our moorland catchment were broadly similar to those observed in forest ecosystems elsewhere, but that historically high nitrogen deposition has made the ecosystem particularly susceptible to nitrate leaching and (re-)acidification. The observed reduction in DOC concentrations casts some doubt on the widely held view that prescribed burning in moorland systems has contributed to long-term DOC increases.

In aquatic sciences, this effort is expanding the scope of questions and analyses that can be performed to further our knowledge of the global drivers of water quality. Cyanotoxin concentration is one variable that has received considerable attention, and although strong local-scale models have been described in the literature, modelling cyanotoxin concentrations across broader spatial scales has been more difficult. Commonly used statistical frameworks have not fully captured the complex response of toxic algal blooms to global change, limiting our ability to predict and mitigate the impairment of freshwaters by toxic algae. Here, we advance our understanding of emergent drivers of cyanotoxins across a structured landscape by applying a hierarchical "hurdle" model. Location: Lakes and reservoirs in the conterminous United States [n = 1127]. Methods: We studied cyanobacteria and their toxins [microcystins] during the 2007 summer period. We applied a hierarchical zero-altered model to test the importance of multi-scale interactions among environmental features in driving microcystin concentrations above the limit of detection. We then used boosted regression trees [BRTs] to identify environmental thresholds associated with severe impairment by microcystins. Results: Accounting for numerous non-detections, spatial heterogeneity and cross-scale interactions substantially improved continental-scale predictions of bloom toxicity. Our model accounted for 55% of the variance in the probability of detecting microcystins across the United States, and 26% of the variability in microcystin concentrations once detected. BRTs further showed that although both local and regional drivers were associated with microcystin concentrations at low to intermediate provisional guidelines, only local drivers came into play when predicting higher limits. Main conclusions: Identifying the interaction between local and regional processes is key to understanding the heterogeneous responses of microcystins to environmental change. Our framework could increase the effectiveness of continental-scale analyses for many different water variables.

Incorporation of wastes by native species during and after an experimental aquaculture operation	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Freshwater aquaculture increases dissolved and particulate nutrients near fish cages, but the degree to which they are incorporated into tissues of native animals is uncertain. At the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada, a cage culture of Rainbow Trout was operated seasonally for 5 y, and invertebrates and fishes were collected before, during, and after culturing from the experimental lake and a reference lake to assess changes in stable isotopes of C and N in their tissues. The feed contained marine fishmeal and was higher in C and N isotope values (delta C-13 and delta N-15) than lake biota by >= 4 parts per thousand (all taxa) and 3 parts per thousand (all invertebrates), respectively. During the aquaculture operation, delta N-15 of littoral and pelagic invertebrates, profundal chironomids, minnows, and Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) increased by 2 to 5 parts per thousand relative to before aquaculture values. In the 1(st) and 2(nd) years after aquaculture, delta N-15 of several invertebrate taxa and all fishes continued to increase 1 to 2 parts per thousand/y. In contrast, during aquaculture, only minnows and trout had significant increases (up to 3 parts per thousand) in delta C-13. In the period after aquaculture, the delta C-13 of fishes, plankton, and profundal chironomids declined to below values measured before or during aquaculture. Isotopic analysis of native biota can be used to monitor assimilation of cage culture wastes in freshwater ecosystems.

Calibration of the biological condition gradient in Minnesota streams: a quantitative expert-based decision system	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												The Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) is a conceptual model that describes changes in aquatic communities with increasing levels of anthropogenic stress. The gradient represented by the BCG has been divided into 6 levels of condition that biologists consider readily discernible in most areas of North America. We developed quantitative BCG models for 7 warm-water stream types in Minnesota for both fish and macroinvertebrates. Panels of aquatic biologists calibrated the general BCG model to Minnesota streams by assigning test samples (271 macroinvertebrate and 288 fish samples) to BCG Levels 1 to 6. From the panelists' descriptions of their criteria for assigning sites to levels, a set of quantitative operational rules was developed for performing the same task. We developed a decision model based on fuzzy-set theory to account for discontinuities and to identify when BCG assignments might be intermediate between adjacent levels. This model captures the consensus professional judgment of the panel and uses panel-derived rules. Decisions based on the quantitative model for macroinvertebrates exactly matched 77% of the panel decisions, 89% within 1/2 BCG level, and 100% within 1 BCG level. Decisions based on the quantitative fish model exactly matched 70% of the panel decisions, 86% within 1/2 BCG level, and 99% within 1 BCG level. The BCG provides a tool to interpret aquatic biological condition along a gradient of naturalness and is consistent across stream types and political boundaries. It includes documentation of baselines to prevent inadvertent shifting, and the BCG logic rules are transparent, a desirable property for communicating condition, management goals, and water-quality criteria.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				JUN	2017	36	2					427	451		10.1086/691712								WOS:000401114200015

While satellite Earth observation offers great promise to support this need, significant challenges remain in quantifying connections between ecosystem functions, ecosystem services, and human well-being benefits. Here, we provide a framework showing how Earth observation together with socioeconomic information and model -based analysis can support assessments of ecosystem service supply, demand, and benefit, and illustrate this for three services. We argue that the full potential of Earth observation is not yet realized in ecosystem service studies.

Decline of a giant salamander assessed with historical records, environmental DNA and multi-scale habitat data	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Freshwater species are declining rapidly but more complete data are needed for determining the extent and cause(s) of population declines and extirpations. Integrating newer survey techniques, freely available data, and traditional field work may allow for more effective assessment of population decline. We used detailed historical species records and environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods to identify changes in population distribution of a long-lived, imperiled stream salamander, the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis: Cryptobranchidae). We used logistic regression with Bayesian inference to test whether selected environmental variables may be good predictors of hellbender population persistence and extirpation. Hellbenders persisted in only 42% of the 24 historical record sites. The best fit model indicated electrical conductivity (EC) was the strongest predictor of hellbender population persistence (EC<278S/cm) and extirpation. Conductivity was strongly negatively correlated with canopy cover within the total watershed (r=-0.83, n=21, p<0.001) and riparian buffer of the watershed (r=-0.77, n=21, p<0.001). Electrical conductivity tends to increase following deforestation, and may inhibit sperm motility and thus limit recruitment of hellbenders and other aquatic vertebrate species with external fertilisation. By integrating historical data, eDNA, field data, and freely available high resolution remote sensing data, our study design allowed for rapid assessment of predictors of and changes in hellbender distribution over a relatively broad geographic area. This cost- and time-effective approach may be used for evaluating other rare aquatic species.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2017	62	6					967	976		10.1111/fwb.12917								WOS:000400571200001

To predict the consequences of river restoration, biological invasions and water quality change in the taxonomic composition of macroinvertebrate communities in rivers, we extended the mechanistic model Streambugs, which describes growth, respiration and death of interacting taxa under given environmental conditions. The model parameterised with prior knowledge on macroinvertebrate traits had already a reasonable explanatory power for data from restored and unrestored sites in two Swiss rivers. As anticipated, the explanatory power of the model was increased further by incorporation of learning from observations through Bayesian inference. The predictive application of the model to changes in water quality and invasions by alien species indicated the importance of integrative planning of management measures: although invasive species are predicted to be able to colonise restored and unrestored sites and replace native species, both invasion of alien species and subsequent exclusion of native taxa is predicted to be reduced when water quality improves. The unavoidable simplification in the mathematical description of complex interactions in the macroinvertebrate community results in predictions that are uncertain. Our modelling techniques make the best attempt to quantify this uncertainty. Despite the uncertainty that always calls for more research, this study makes a considerable step towards improving our understanding of community structure and supporting river management through mechanistic, predictive modelling of macroinvertebrate communities in rivers under changing environmental conditions.

We aimed at filling this gap by assessing the relative effects of hydroclimatic and water quality factors on the trait composition of invertebrate assemblages over 30 years in the Middle Loire River (France). Using a priori predictions on the long-term variation of trait-based adaptations over the three decades, we evaluated the ability of invertebrate traits to indicate the effects of warming, discharge reduction and water quality improvement. Hydroclimatic and water quality factors contributed to up to 65% of the variation in trait composition. More than 70% of the initial trait response predictions made according to observed long-term hydroclimatic changes were confirmed. They supported a general climate-induced trend involving adapted resistance and resilience strategies. A partial confounding effect of water quality improvement acting on trophic processes was also highlighted, indicating that improved water quality management can significantly help to reduce some adverse effects of climate change. This trait-based approach can have wider implications for investigating long-term changes driven by multiple, potentially confounded factors, as frequently encountered in the context of global change.																	1354-1013	1365-2486				JUN	2017	23	6					2297	2307		10.1111/gcb.13575								WOS:000400445900015	27873443

Estuary-ocean connectivity: fast physics, slow biology	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Estuaries are connected to both land and ocean so their physical, chemical, and biological dynamics are influenced by climate patterns over watersheds and ocean basins. We explored climate-driven oceanic variability as a source of estuarine variability by comparing monthly time series of temperature and chlorophyll-a inside San Francisco Bay with those in adjacent shelf waters of the California Current System (CCS) that are strongly responsive to wind-driven upwelling. Monthly temperature fluctuations inside and outside the Bay were synchronous, but their correlations weakened with distance from the ocean. These results illustrate how variability of coastal water temperature (and associated properties such as nitrate and oxygen) propagates into estuaries through fast water exchanges that dissipate along the estuary. Unexpectedly, there was no correlation between monthly chlorophyll-a variability inside and outside the Bay. However, at the annual scale Bay chlorophyll-a was significantly correlated with the Spring Transition Index (STI) that sets biological production supporting fish recruitment in the CCS. Wind forcing of the CCS shifted in the late 1990s when the STI advanced 40 days. This shift was followed, with lags of 1-3 years, by 3- to 19-fold increased abundances of five ocean-produced demersal fish and crustaceans and 2.5-fold increase of summer chlorophyll-a in the Bay. These changes reflect a slow biological process of estuary-ocean connectivity operating through the immigration of fish and crustaceans that prey on bivalves, reduce their grazing pressure, and allow phytoplankton biomass to build. We identified clear signals of climate-mediated oceanic variability in this estuary and discovered that the response patterns vary with the process of connectivity and the timescale of ocean variability. This result has important implications for managing nutrient inputs to estuaries connected to upwelling systems, and for assessing their responses to changing patterns of upwelling timing and intensity as the planet continues to warm.

J	Chen, WY; Li, X				Chen, Wendy Y.; Li, Xun			Cumulative impacts of polluted urban streams on property values: A 3-D spatial hedonic model at the micro-neighborhood level	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urban streams could concurrently bring about both positive amenities accruing to the view of waterscape and negative disamenities associated with water pollution. In this paper, we focus on a specific question that has not yet been explicitly answered in the extant literature: how-to estimate the cumulative impacts of urban streams (which refer to the combined impacts of amenities and disamenities of multiple sources) in high density and high-rise urban contexts. A typical residential apartment complex (comprised of a number of apartment units located in dozens of mid- to high-rise commercial apartment buildings on a contiguous land parcel) in Guangzhou, south China, is used as a case study. A detailed palette of natural amenities and environmental disamenities of two bifurcated streams are quantified via the generalized spatial two-stage least squares (GS2SLS) model. In this model, an originally constructed 3-D spatial connectivity matrix, cube contiguity, is applied to address, in a sophisticated manner, an array of endogenous, exogenous, and error interactions along both horizontal and vertical dimensions that inherently exist in the spatial context of high-rise housing markets. Our results from spatial hedonic models at the micro-neighborhood level demonstrate that homebuyers tend to evaluate urban streams' chemical, physical, and ecological features holistically. A cumulative impact is also found, as homebuyers would like to pay an extra premium for an apartment located farther away from both polluted streams. This study advances the extant literature by contributing to a novel and effective extension of the conventional two-dimensional spatial matrix which can capture the long-ignored spatial correlation existing amongst apartment units located on contiguous floors, as well as a robust estimation of the demand of urban natural and environmental amenities in the gradually rising mid- and high-rise housing market in both developing and developed countries.																	0169-2046	1872-6062				JUN	2017	162						1	12		10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.01.012								WOS:000399627800001

While traditional stormwater management has relied on gray infrastructure such as piped conveyances to collect and convey stormwater to wastewater treatment facilities or into surface waters, cities are exploring green infrastructure to manage stormwater at its source. Decentralized green infrastructure leverages the capabilities of soil and vegetation to infiltrate, redistribute, and otherwise store stormwater volume, with the potential to realize ancillary environmental, social, and economic benefits. To date, green infrastructure science and practice have largely focused on infiltration-based technologies that include rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable pavements. However, a narrow focus on infiltration overlooks other losses from the hydrologic cycle, and we propose that arboriculture - the cultivation of trees and other woody plants - deserves additional consideration as a stormwater control measure. Trees interact with the urban hydrologic cycle by intercepting incoming precipitation, removing water from the soil via transpiration, enhancing infiltration, and bolstering the performance of other green infrastructure technologies. However, many of these interactions are inadequately understood, particularly at spatial and temporal scales relevant to stormwater management. As such, the reliable use of trees for stormwater control depends on improved understanding of how and to what extent trees interact with stormwater, and the context-specific consideration of optimal arboricultural practices and institutional frameworks to maximize the stormwater benefits trees can provide.

Quality Problems in Hawaii	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												The economic value of water quality is poorly understood in Hawaii. Quantifying the economic value of coastal water quality would inform policy decisions that impact the coast and help justify expenditures in water quality improvements. We conducted a non-market valuation of beach recreationalists' preferences and willingness to pay for water quality and associated attributes at Oahu beaches. Using a discrete choice experiment analyzed by a conditional logit model, results suggest individuals were willing to pay $11.43 per day at the beach to reduce days of bacterial exceedance from 11 to 5 per year, a further $30.72 to reduce it to no bacterial exceedances at all. WTP to move from 15 ft to 30 ft of underwater visibility was $35.71, a further $14.80 to increase from 30 ft to 60 ft. Respondents were also willing to pay $15.33 to improve coral reef cover from 10% to 25%, a further $4.89 to improve to 45% cover. WTP for moving from 9 fish species to 18 species was $7.14, a further $2.47 to increase that to 27 fish species. These environmental improvements can improve Oahu recreationalists' welfare by $205 million, $550 million, $639 million, $265 million, $274 million, $88 million, $128 million, and $44 million per year, respectively. Welfare gains may justify increased spending in management and restoration of coastal ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Functional diversity of microbial communities in pristine aquifers inferred by PLFA- and sequencing-based approaches	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Microorganisms in groundwater play an important role in aquifer biogeochemical cycles and water quality. However, the mechanisms linking the functional diversity of microbial populations and the groundwater physico-chemistry are still not well understood due to the complexity of interactions between surface and subsurface. Within the framework of Hainich (north-western Thuringia, central Germany) Critical Zone Exploratory of the Collaborative Research Centre AquaDiva, we used the relative abundances of phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFAs) to link specific biochemical markers within the microbial communities to the spatio-temporal changes of the groundwater physico-chemistry. The functional diversities of the microbial communities were mainly correlated with groundwater chemistry, including dissolved O-2, Fe-t and NH4+ concentrations. Abundances of PLFAs derived from eukaryotes and potential nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (11Me16:0 as biomarker for Nitro-spira moscoviensis) were high at sites with elevated O-2 concentration where groundwater recharge supplies bioavailable substrates. In anoxic groundwaters more rich in Fe-t, PLFAs abundant in sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), iron-reducing bacteria and fungi increased with Fe-t and HCO3- concentrations, suggesting the occurrence of active iron reduction and the possible role of fungi in meditating iron solubilization and transport in those aquifer domains. In more NH4+ -rich anoxic groundwaters, anammox bacteria and SRB-derived PLFAs increased with NH4+ concentration, further evidencing the dependence of the anammox process on ammonium concentration and potential links between SRB and anammox bacteria. Additional support of the PLFA-based bacterial communities was found in DNA- and RNA-based Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, which showed high predominance of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria Nitrospira, e.g. Nitrospira moscoviensis, in oxic aquifer zones and of anammox bacteria in more NH4+ -rich anoxic groundwater. Higher relative abundances of sequence reads in the RNA-based datasets affiliated with iron-reducing bacteria in more Fe-t-rich groundwater supported the occurrence of active dissimilatory iron reduction. The functional diversity of the microbial communities in the biogeochemically distinct groundwater assemblages can be largely attributed to the redox conditions linked to changes in bioavailable substrates and input of substrates with the seepage. Our results demonstrate the power of complementary information derived from PLFA-based and sequencing-based approaches.

Predicting the impacts of Mississippi River diversions and sea-level rise on spatial patterns of eastern oyster growth rate and production	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												There remains much debate regarding the perceived tradeoffs of using freshwater and sediment diver-sions for coastal restoration in terms of balancing the need for wetland restoration versus preserving eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) production. Further complicating the issue, climate change-induced sea-level rise (SLR) and land subsidence are also expected to affect estuarine water quality. In this study, we developed a process-based numerical modeling system that couples hydrodynamic, water quality, and oyster population dynamics. We selected Breton Sound Estuary (BSE) (similar to 2740 km(2)) in the eastern Mississippi River Deltaic Plain since it is home to several of the largest public oyster seed grounds and private leases for the Gulf coast. The coupled oyster population model was calibrated and validated against field observed oyster growth data. We predicted the responses of oyster population in BSE to small-(142 m(3) s(-1)) and large-scale (7080 m(3) s(-1)) river diversions at the Caernarvon Freshwater Diversion structure planned in the 2012 Coastal Master Plan (Louisiana) under low (0.38 m) and high (1.44 m) relative sea-level rise (RSLR=eustatic SLR+subsidence) compared to a baseline condition (Year 2009). Model results showed that the large-scale diversion had a stronger negative impact on oyster population dynamics via freshening of the entire estuary, resulting in reduced oyster growth rate and production than RSLR. Under the large-scale diversion, areas with optimal oyster growth rates (>15 mg ash-free dry weight (AFDW) oyster(-1) wk(-1)) and production (>500 g AFDW m(-2) yr(-1)) would shift seaward to the southeastern edge of the estuary, turning the estuary into a very low oyster production system. RSLR however played a greater role than the small-scale diversion on the magnitude and spatial pattern of oyster growth rate and production. RSLR would result in an overall estuary-wide decrease in oyster growth rate and production as a consequence of decreased salinities in the middle and lower estuary because rising sea level likely causes increased stage and overbank flow downstream along the lower Mississippi River.

J	Reder, K; Alcamo, J; Florke, M				Reder, Klara; Alcamo, Joseph; Floerke, Martina			A sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a continental-scale water quality model of pathogen pollution in African rivers	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Continental-scale water quality modeling is a new scientific approach concerned with computing the level of water pollution for several river basins at once. Uncertainties in these models, and in models of smaller scale, arise especially from the specification of model parameters. To identify and analyze these uncertainties we perform a global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using Latin Hypercube Sampling on the WorldQual water quality model. The focus of the analysis is the river pathogen model of WorldQual as applied to rivers in Africa. This is the first uncertainty and sensitivity analysis performed on a continental-scale pathogen river pollution model. The median output uncertainty of the model (coefficient of variation, based on log-transformed data), assuming plausible estimates of 42 parameter uncertainties, was 10.7%; 90% of grid cells had output uncertainties below 23%. The parameters making the largest contribution to this uncertainty (in order of importance) are the pathogen waste loading per capita, the in-stream settling velocity of pathogens, the percentage of population in a river basin connected to a sewer system, and the raw effluent concentration from the manufacturing sector. Over the continental study area, model output uncertainty and the most sensitive parameters were found to have a highly irregular spatial pattern. This finding suggests that model performance is a strong function of local and regional conditions and that reducing the uncertainty of a single parameter may not lead to large improvements in model performance over the entire continent. A more efficient approach would be to improve model performance region-by-region and improve the estimation of specific parameters known to have a large influence on model uncertainty in those regions. The analysis showed that only four parameters dominate output uncertainty over 93% of the study area, implying that model performance can be substantially improved by reducing the uncertainty of a small number of parameters.

Ecological restoration of a severely degraded coastal acid sulfate soil: A case study of the East Trinity wetland, Queensland	ECOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT & RESTORATION												A severely degraded acid sulfate soil wetland near Cairns, Queensland, has been returned to a functional estuarine habitat using a cost-effective, low-technology method based on the reintroduction of tidal water. Gradual increases in tidal inundation, combined with targeted liming of the tidal stream, restored conditions that promoted chemical and microbial processes leading to the rapid recolonisation of mangrove communities and other estuarine flora and fauna.

This study focused on the composition and stability of blooms as well as their taxa-specific ecological sensitivity to the main causal factors (especially phosphorus and nitrogen) in degraded urban lakes. The analyzed lakes were assessed with respect to the trophic state as well as ecological status. Total phytoplankton biomass (ranging from 1.5 to 181.3 mg dm(-3)) was typical of blooms of different intensity, which can appear during a whole growing season but are the most severe in early or late summer. Our results suggested that steady-state and non-steady-state bloom assemblages including mono-, bi- and multi-species or heterogeneous blooms may occur in urban lakes. The most intense blooms were formed by the genera of Cyanobacteria: Microcystis, Limnothrix, Pseudanabaena, Planktothrix, Bacillariophyta: Cyclotella and Dinophyta mainly Ceratium and Peridinium. Considering the sensitivity of phytoplankton assemblages, a new eco-sensitivity factor was proposed (E-SF), based on the concept of Phytoplankton Trophic Index composed of trophic scores of phytoplankton taxa along the eutrophication gradient: The E-SF values of 0.5, 1.3, 6.7 and 15.1 were recognized in lakes having a high, good, moderate or poor ecological status, respectively. For lake restoration, each type of bloom should be considered separately because of different sensitivities of taxa and relationships with environmental variables. Proper recognition of the taxa-specific response to abiotic (especially to N and P enrichment) and biotic factors could have significant implications for further water protection and management (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Environmental variability indicates a climate-adaptive center under threat in northern Mozambique coral reefs	ECOSPHERE												A priority for modern conservation is finding and managing regions with environmental and biodiversity portfolio characteristics that will promote adaptation and the persistence of species during times of rapid climate change. The latitudinal edges of high-diversity biomes are likely to provide a mixture of environmental gradients and biological diversity that meet the portfolio criteria needed for adaptive systems. Northern Mozambique and the Quirimbas Islands represent the edge of a coral reef diversity center with limited potential to expand because of geologic and oceanographic limits on the southern edges. This region does, however, have the potential to be its own discrete adaptive center if it contains climate refugia and there are environmental gradients that promote acclimatization, ecological reorganization, and natural selection. Consequently, to evaluate this potential we tested for strong regional environmental spatial heterogeneity that might indicate a climate-adaptive center. Additionally, we evaluated human influences and environmental and demographic data on finfish, coral, and sea urchins in 66 reefs across similar to 4 degrees of latitude to evaluate ecological changes and human threats. A number of clear gradients in environmental and human influences were observed. For example, temperature increased and became more centralized and right-skewed, while water quality decreased to the south. Coral communities susceptible to thermal stress were found in the north where dispersed temperatures indicated a location with either tolerance to or refugium from recent thermal disturbances. Nevertheless, high coral diversity was found in southern deep-water channels. Further, spatial patterns for corals and fish differed indicating complex geographic-fishing-biodiversity gradients. Consequently, environmental conditions for an adaptive portfolio exist and include refugia for preserving climate-sensitive and for numbers of coral taxa. Fishing and urban threats were observable as reduced fish biomass, diversity, and body sizes but higher biomass of sea urchins. We observed that many remote and protected areas had fish biomass values lower than expected or near maximum sustainable yields. This indicates low compliance and widespread migratory fishing, which is reducing fish diversity below maximum levels. Recommendations to sustain this adaptive center are to maintain fish biomass >500 kg/ha by increasing fisheries restrictions and compliance.

A common way to do so is to include ecological regions in sampling schemes and empirical models. However, most existing ecological regions were developed for specific purposes, using a limited set of geospatial features and irreproducible methods. Our study purpose was to: (1) describe a method that takes advantage of recent computational advances and increased availability of regional and global data sets to create customizable and reproducible ecological regions, (2) make this algorithm available for use and modification by others studying different ecosystems, variables of interest, study extents, and macroscale ecology research questions, and (3) demonstrate the power of this approach for the research question-How well do these regions capture regional-scale variation in lake water quality? To achieve our purpose we: (1) used a spatially constrained spectral clustering algorithm that balances geospatial homogeneity and region contiguity to create ecological regions using multiple terrestrial, climatic, and freshwater geospatial data for 17 northeastern U.S. states (similar to 1,800,000 km(2)); (2) identified which of the 52 geospatial features were most influential in creating the resulting 100 regions; and (3) tested the ability of these ecological regions to capture regional variation in water nutrients and clarity for similar to 6,000 lakes. We found that: (1) a combination of terrestrial, climatic, and freshwater geospatial features influenced region creation, suggesting that the oft-ignored freshwater landscape provides novel information on landscape variability not captured by traditionally used climate and terrestrial metrics; and (2) the delineated regions captured macroscale heterogeneity in ecosystem properties not included in region delineation-approximately 40% of the variation in total phosphorus and water clarity among lakes was at the regional scale. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of this method for creating customizable and reproducible regions for research and management applications.

The OLR clearly influenced both sponge pore water quality and relative flagellates and ciliates (free-swimming, carnivorous, crawling, and stalked protozoa) abundances in the retained sludge. Immediately after the OLR was increased from 1.05 to 1.97 kg chemical oxygen demand (COD) m(-3) day(-1), COD and NH4+-N treatment efficiencies both deteriorated, and relative flagellates and ciliates abundances then increased from 2-8 % to 51-65 % total cells in the middle-bottom part of the DHS reactor. In a continuous operation at a stable OLR (2.01 kg COD m(-3) day(-1)), effluent water quality improved, and relative flagellates and ciliates abundances decreased to 15-46 % total cells in the middle-bottom part of the DHS reactor. This result may indicate that flagellates and ciliates preferentially graze on dispersed bacteria, thus, stabilizing effluent water quality. Additionally, to investigate eukaryotic community structure, clone libraries based on the 18S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene of the retained sludge were constructed. The predominant group was Nucletmycea phylotypes, representing approximately 29-56 % total clones. Furthermore, a large proportion of the clones had < 97 % sequence identity in the NCBI database. This result indicates that phylogenetically unknown eukaryotes were present in the DHS reactor. These results provide insights into eukaryotic community shift in the DHS reactor treating domestic sewage.																	0095-3628	1432-184X				MAY	2017	73	4					801	814		10.1007/s00248-016-0871-0								WOS:000401565700005	27796418

However, the use of filter-feeding aquatic animals to control eutrophic water bodies remains debatable. As such, more work is needed to understand the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on the restoration of eutrophic water bodies. In this study, we first conducted a mesocosm experiment to evaluate the combined effects of submerged macrophytes and aquatic animals on water body restoration, and then applied these results in the field. We found that silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) deteriorated water quality by increasing nutrient and total suspended solid concentrations, and decreased the biomass of submerged macrophytes. However, triangle sail mussels (Hyriopsis cumingii) promoted the establishment of a clear-water state by grazing on phytoplankton and detritus, and stimulating submerged macrophyte growth. In practical ecological engineering, we suggest that silver carp can be used at low density (20 g/m(3)) as a biomanipulation tool, despite their potential to deteriorate water quality. Furthermore, stocking mussels in nets at a biomass of 150 g/m3 can be effectively used to restore eutrophicated water bodies. Finally, Hydrilla verticillata and Potamogeton malaianus, in combination with filter-feeding aquatic animals, are suitable submerged macrophyte species for the restoration of eutrophicated lakes.

ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												While phosphorus (P) is a vital element in freshwater systems, excessive P loads will induce eutrophication. Large inputs of various pollutants, including P, to rivers in semi-arid regions result in complex environmental problems. In this study, we investigate dissolved oxygen (DO), ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3), chemical oxygen demand (CODcr), soluble reactive P (SRP) in surface water and pore water, and sediment P in the Niuwei River, within the Hai River Basin. From our results we developed and tested a theory for P release in semi-arid regions driven by DO. The results show that NH3 and CODcr can cause variations in DO in surface water. The presence of pollutants at high concentrations caused seasonal hypoxia. Hypoxic river water induced adsorption and hydrolysis of NaOH-Pi and labile organic P (L-Po), which then resulted in increased SRP concentrations in pore water and surface water. Overall, our results illustrate that NH3 and CODcr may be important for P adsorption and desorption and for management of water quality problems in rivers in semi-arid regions.

Performance of a hybrid pilot-scale constructed wetland system for treating oil sands process-affected water from the Athabasca oil sands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Mining leases in the Athabasca oil sands (AOS; near Ft. McMurray, Canada) produce large volumes of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) that contain potentially problematic constituents requiring treatment prior to surface water discharge into receiving aquatic systems. The aim of this research was to identify constituents of concern (COCs) in OSPW sourced from an AOS external tailings facility and design a hybrid pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTS) to decrease concentrations of COCs and subsequently mitigate risks. COCs were identified based on comparisons to ambient water quality thresholds for the protection of aquatic life (i.e. Canadian Environmental Quality Guidelines [CEQGs], Alberta Environment Water Quality Guidelines [Alberta WQGs], and United States Environmental Protection Agency Water Quality Criteria [USEPA WQC]) and toxicity endpoints. Performance of the hybrid pilot-scale CWTS was evaluated by rate and extent of COC removal and change in toxicity as measured by an aquatic invertebrate Ceriodaphnia dubia. Following characterization of OSPW, specific COCs were identified as: naphthenic acids (NAs), oil and grease (O/G), metals/metalloids (Al, B, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn), chloride, and total suspended solids (TSS). A hybrid pilot-scale CWTS was designed to promote treatment processes to alter (transfer and transform) COCs using sequential reducing and oxidizing wetland reactors and a solar photocatalytic treatment reactor using fixed film titanium dioxide (TiO2). Performance criteria were achieved as the CWTS decreased concentrations of NM, O/G, and metals below protective thresholds and decreased toxicity to C. dubia. Results from this study provide proof-of-concept data to inform hybrid passive or semi-passive treatment approaches (i.e. constructed wetlands) that could be used to mitigate COCs contained in OSPWs.

It ultimately affects the water quality of large shallow lakes through sediment resuspension and nutrient diffusion. Impacts of the wind field, hence needed to be studied, especially; (1) the impacts of wind field on the vertical profile, and (2) on the generation of the reverse flow field at large shallow wind exposed lakes. The present study investigated the wind field impacts on the water flow field at different water depths in the large shallow Taihu Lake by using precise wind and velocity profile data acquired at Dongtaihu bay. The results revealed that wind speed and direction have dominant effects on water movement in the large shallow lake. High frequency of wind direction generates more frequent reverse flow field at each layer of the water column. The dominant wind directions found with a high probability of Contribution in the generation of reverse flows at the surface (42.4%), upper middle (38.4%) and bottom (51.5%) layers with large-scale shear of the flow field. Similarly, probability statistics showed that dominant wind speeds have more contributions in the generation of compensation currents at the lower middle (42.6%) layer of the vertical water profile with medium scale shear of the flow field. High wind speeds play a major role in the generation of large flows at all layers of flow profile, but long-term steady wind speeds with consistent wind direction generate stable current in the large shallow lake which reduce the diffusion and nutrient resuspension in the large shallow Taihu Lake. Results of the current study provide a novel ground to study sediment/nutrient resuspension, transport and water quality scenarios in large shallow wind exposed lakes while considering reverse flow field in shallow waters.

Effects of submerged zone, media aging, and antecedent dry period on the performance of biochar-amended biofilters in removing fecal indicators and nutrients from natural stormwater	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Biochar has demonstrated promising performance as an amendment to biofilter soil media in removing fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) from simulated stormwater. However, there is no study that investigates its efficacy in treating natural stormwater runoff. Additional information, including the effects of antecedent dry period, microbial biofilm, and presence of a saturation zone on the performance of biochar-augmented biofilters are needed to inform their field implementation. This study uses laboratory column experiments to monitor FIB (enterococci and Escherichia coli) and nutrient removal capacity of biochar-amended biofilters for 140 days using natural stormwater. Our study also investigates the effects of antecedent dry days (ADD) and the presence of a saturation zone (SZ) on the performance of lab-scale biochar-amended biofilters. The results suggest insignificant influence of the ADD and SZ on FIB removal performance, however biofilters with a SZ perform significantly better in removing nitrate-nitrogen compared to those without a SZ. In addition, it appears that the presence of biofilm augments nutrient removal capacity but reduces FIB removal capacity. Our observations indicate that biochar-amended biofilters are able to treat (to comply with recreational water quality standard for FIB) urban stormwater runoff for the duration of the experiment. Nitrate- and ammonium-nitrogen removal in the biologically aged biofilters is found to be 50-60% while the total dissolved phosphorus and the organic nitrogen removal is 20-30%. Our results inform full-scale design of biochar-amended biofilters in order to meet the total maximum daily load (TMDL) and municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) permitting requirement for FIB and nutrients.

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in Australian stormwater biofilters	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stormwater biofilters are important tools for managing runoff in urban watersheds. To the authors' knowledge, there have been no accounts examining the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters. This plant-fungi relationship is an important interaction in most terrestrial ecosystems, playing a role in nutrient dynamics, water cycling, and soil organic matter decomposition. The presence of mycorrhiza in biofilters could have implications for nutrient and metal uptake in plants, and thus enhance removal of target pollutants. Additionally, the establishment, growth, and survivability of plants could be enhanced when roots are colonized by mycorrhizae. The aim of this study was to determine the extent of colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in biofilters of varying ages in three Australian cities: Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. The 32 biofilters surveyed supported 56 plant species, with dominant species belonging to the Cyperaceae, Iridaceae, Juncaceae, Onagraceae, Poaceae, and Xanthorrhoeaceae families. Mycorrhizal associations were identified from 4 of the 11 most dominant plant species from 9 different biofilters, but relatively low percentages of mycorrhizal colonization (3-25% colonization) were observed in biofilter plant roots. Mycorrhizal colonization was not related to biofilter age. These results demonstrate that mycorrhizal fungi colonize plant roots growing in biofilters. These findings provide useful evidence of the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in stormwater biofilters that support subsequent investigation into their roles in these systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Potential of using immobilizing agents in aided phytostabilization on simulated contamination of soil with lead	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Lead (Pb) is one of the key heavy metals which have a significant influence on the individual components of the natural environment. A glasshouse pot experiment was designed to evaluate the potential use of different amendments as immobilizing agents in the aided phytostabilization of Pb-contaminated soil, using Lolium perenne L The research aimed to determine the influence of Pb in doses of 0, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg/kg of soil, as well as diatomite, chalcedonite, dolomite, limestone, and activated carbon amendments on the content of trace elements in the above-ground parts and roots of L. perenne. The study utilised analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA). The content of trace elements in plants, pseudo-total and extracted by 0.01 M CaCl2, were determined using the method of spectrophotometry. All of the investigated element contents in the tested parts of L perenne were significantly different in the case of applying reactive amendments to the soil, as well as increasing concentrations of Pb. The greatest average above-ground biomass was observed when diatomite and chalcedonite were amended into the soil. Activated carbon, limestone and chalcedonite caused significant increases of Pb concentrations in the roots. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study presents results from one of the best-documented long-term monitoring projects in Poland, based on three periods of electrofishing: 1986-88 (TI),1996-98 (T2) and 2011-12 (T3). After decades of severe point-source pollution, water quality has been improving since the early 1990s. However, the recovery of fish assemblages was recorded with a considerable delay, i.e. not in T2 but in T3. Species richness in T3 increased by >= 50% in relation to T2. The recovery process proceeded at a different pace in the upper (section X), middle (section Y) and lower (section Z) river courses. The good status recorded in X in T3 was qualitatively different from the good status observed in TI as migratory and/or lithophilic species were less common. Section X, with relatively clean tributaries, was isolated from the rest of the Warta system by the Jeziorsko Reservoir constructed between X and Y in 1986 (without fish passage). Ichthyofauna in Y was not only in the poorest condition but was also recovering very slowly because of migration barriers and polluted tributaries, resulting in a severe shortage of sources of recolonizers. The quickest positive changes were recorded in Z because of the beneficial role played by certain less degraded tributaries and the direct connection to the recipient Odra River. Significant increases in biomass were recorded in Z for both limnophilic and rheophilic species; the former may be linked to zones of stagnant water existing between groynes and the latter to fast-flowing water near groyne heads.

Variable rate nitrogen management in corn: Response in two crop rotations	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Decision-making criteria to accurately predict nitrogen (N) rates in corn (Zea mays L.) would greatly benefit canopy sensor-guided variable rate N (VRN) management with positive implications for water quality. The objectives of this study were to measure corn yield response to VRN applied at the midvegetative corn growth stage and compare yield and agronomic efficiency (AE) between a one-time spring-N application (preplant or early sidedress) and two VRN management strategies, split-N (VRNS) and rescue-N (VRNR). Field sites located across Iowa received spring-N fertilizer at six application rates, with additional N potentially applied with each VRN spring-N rate and for the VRNS and VRNR strategies at the V10 growth stage based on canopy sensing. Drought conditions were evident during 2012 and 2013 in Iowa, which resulted in reduced corn yield and requirement for N fertilizer at many site-years. The VRN with 0 and 56 kg N ha-1 (50 lb N ac-1) applied in the spring was most closely aligned with calculated economic optimum N rate and AE. The VRNS and VRNR strategies applied more N than was needed, compared to spring-N only. Canopy sensors did not detect adequate to excess N, and therefore N applied prior to VRN application should be part of sensing-based algorithm criteria. Mean corn yield with the soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.)-corn rotation was not maintained with VRN when no spring-N was applied. Yield comparison showed no differences between spring-N, VRNS, and VRNR for both rotations. However, the greatest AE was achieved with spring-N and the VRNS strategy in the soybean-corn rotation. Weather events that occur during and after canopy sensing and VRN application remain an important factor for successful corn yield response to N rate and timing, and should be considered with canopy sensor VRN. Results from this study provide feedback on how to translate remote sensing data into VRN management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2017	72	3					183	190		10.2489/jswc.72.3.183								WOS:000400389700005

Cost-effectiveness of reverse auctions for watershed nutrient reductions in the presence of climate variability: An empirical approach for the Boone River watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that changes in climate patterns (higher temperatures, changes in extreme precipitation events, and higher level of humidity) will adversely impact water quality. Given the implications of climate change on water and soil quality, it is important for watershed managers, stakeholders, and policymakers to understand not only the effectiveness of different conservation practices in improving water quality, but also the cost-effectiveness of a watershed-level policy program designed for implementing conservation practices. A system of points measuring the efficiency of five conservation practices in reducing nutrient (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) runoff are estimated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in this study for the Boone River watershed (BRW) in north central Iowa. The points can be interpreted as indices of the environmental benefits associated with each conservation practice. Among the various market instruments proposed as resource and cost-revelation mechanisms, competitive biddings, also referred to as "reverse auctions" or procurement auctions, have come to the attention of researchers and policymakers. Competitive bidding mechanisms induce landowners to submit bids close to their opportunity costs, thus increasing the budgetary cost-effectiveness and revealing the true costs of adopting different conservation practices. This study considers the cost efficiency of reverse auction programs designed for improving water quality in the BRW, where the bids are constructed using the system of points.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAY-JUN	2017	72	3					280	295		10.2489/jswc.72.3.280								WOS:000400389700015

We investigated how average environmental niche breadths (climate, water quality and climate-water quality niches) in aquatic macrophyte communities are related to ecological gradients (latitude, longitude, altitude, species richness and lake area) among four distinct regions (Finland, Sweden and US states of Minnesota and Wisconsin) on two continents. We found that correlations between the three different measures of average niche breadths and ecological gradients varied considerably among the study regions, with average climate and average water quality niche breadth models often showing opposite trends. However, consistent patterns were also found, such as widening of average climate niche breadths and narrowing of average water quality niche breadths of aquatic macrophytes along increasing latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. This result suggests that macrophyte species are generalists in relation to temperature variations at higher latitudes and altitudes, whereas species in southern, lowland lakes are more specialised. In contrast, aquatic macrophytes growing in more southern nutrient-rich lakes were generalists in relation to water quality, while specialist species are adapted to low-productivity conditions and are found in highland lakes. Our results emphasise that species niche breadths should not be studied using only coarse-scale data of species distributions and corresponding environmental conditions, but that investigations on different kinds of niche breadths (e.g., climate vs. local niches) also require finer resolution data at broad spatial extents.

Local and landscape scale determinants of macroinvertebrate assemblages and their conservation value in ponds across an urban land-use gradient	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Urbanisation represents a growing threat to natural communities across the globe. Small aquatic habitats such as ponds are especially vulnerable and are often poorly protected by legislation. Many ponds are threatened by development and pollution from the surrounding landscape, yet their biodiversity and conservation value remain poorly described. Here we report the results of a survey of 30 ponds along an urban land-use gradient in the West Midlands, UK. We outline the environmental conditions of these urban ponds to identify which local and landscape scale environmental variables determine the biodiversity and conservation value of the macroinvertebrate assemblages in the ponds. Cluster analysis identified four groups of ponds with contrasting macroinvertebrate assemblages reflecting differences in macrophyte cover, nutrient status, riparian shading, the nature of the pond edge, surrounding land-use and the availability of other wetland habitats. Pond conservation status varied markedly across the sites. The richest macroinvertebrate assemblages with high conservation value were found in ponds with complex macrophyte stands and floating vegetation with low nutrient concentrations and little surrounding urban land. The most impoverished assemblages were found in highly urban ponds with hard-engineered edges, heavy shading and nutrient rich waters. A random forest classification model revealed that local factors usually had primacy over landscape scale factors in determining pond conservation value, and constitute a priority focus for management.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				MAY	2017	26	5					1065	1086		10.1007/s10531-016-1286-4								WOS:000399235300004

Macrophyte beds in a subtropical reservoir shifted from a nutrient sink to a source after drying then rewetting	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Macrophytes play a key role in assimilating and storing nutrients in shallow aquatic ecosystems, but their capacity to act as a long-term nutrient sink can be affected by water level fluctuations. Water level drawdown in reservoirs followed by rewetting may mobilise a significant nutrient pool. These nutrients can be stored in the littoral zone in dead or dormant macrophytes, and in the desiccated sediments within the macrophyte beds. However, the contribution of desiccated macrophyte beds to nutrient release upon rewetting has not been well quantified. 2. Our study examined the effect of rewetting the previously desiccated waterlily Nymphoides indica (Menyanthaceae) in treatments (1) without sediments (N.i.-Sed), and (2) with sediments in N. indica beds (N.i.+Sed) on water quality. 3. We found that longer drying duration increased dissolved nutrients (nitrate/nitrite, ammonium and total dissolved organic nitrogen/phosphorus) and organic carbon release from N.i.+Sed and N.i.-Sed treatments after rewetting. In the N.i.+Sed treatment with <4 weeks of desiccation, all N. indica plants regenerated from roots after subsequent rewetting. In addition, the resulting nutrient/carbon release was not significantly different to the control treatment which did not have desiccation. A significant increase in dissolved nutrient and carbon concentrations in the water column was found in treatments with more than 10 weeks of desiccation followed by rewetting. This coincided with the sediment reaching its minimum moisture content. Furthermore, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations in the overlying water also increased with more than 10 weeks of desiccation, presumably in response to the increased nutrient availability and the removal of competition for nutrients from macrophytes. 4. On the basis of our laboratory experiments, we calculated the potential effect of desiccated and rewetted N. indica beds on water quality in a local N. indica-dominated reservoir after water level drawdown. We also separated the contribution of N. indica plants from their macrophyte beds on water quality changes. Fourteen days after rewetting, the total dissolved nutrients released from N. indica alone (N.i.-Sed) could contribute 0.5% of the total nitrogen and 29% of total phosphorus to the water column concentrations in the whole reservoir. In contrast, N. indica beds (N.i.+Sed) contributed more total dissolved nitrogen (4.3%) but less total dissolved phosphorus (0.3%) release into the water column. The higher nitrogen release for the N.i.+Sed treatment was likely due to the organic matter decomposition in the sediment in macrophyte beds. In contrast, the less dissolved phosphorus release, compared with the N. indica alone, was likely the result of phosphate adsorption by previously desiccated soil particles and/or assimilation by phytoplankton, since the phytoplankton biomass (as measured by Chl-a concentrations) was significantly higher in the N.i.+Sed treatment. 5. This study highlights the importance of managing both the duration and rate of water level drawdown in reservoirs to prevent rooted macrophytes, like N. indica, from becoming a source of nutrients, which may cause deterioration in water quality.

In-stream nitrate removal capacity may be used as a proxy for the ecosystem service of water quality regulation. It is well known that this natural function is driven by abiotic and biotic factors in running water environments. With regard to biotic drivers, most of the literature focuses on the microbial community influences, but there has been very little emphasis on the relationship with the benthic macroinvertebrate community. Since this community feeds on microbial assemblages (autotrophic and/or heterotrophic biofilms) that live on the streambed and in the hyporheic zone of the river, macroinvertebrates also have the potential to influence nitrate removal via its influences on microbiological processes. 2. The objective of this study was to examine the potential relationship between the macroinvertebrate communities and nitrate removal. A dataset of in-stream nitrate removal rates measured in nine-third-order streams was analysed. The simultaneous influences of abiotic (hydromorphological, physical and chemical characteristics) and biotic (biofilm and macroinvertebrate) drivers were examined and together explained 56% of the in-stream nitrate removal variance. An analysis of the independent contributions of each driver showed that abiotic drivers (e.g. ammonium, dissolved organic carbon, temperature and transient zone) contributed 40% of this nitrate removal variance, whereas the macroinvertebrate community contributed 39%. 3. The potential relationship between macroinvertebrates and nitrate removal was subsequently explored using trait-based approaches of the macroinvertebrate community. This method allows for the selection of trait modalities assuming a top-down control of microbial communities by macroinvertebrates, with in-stream abiotic conditions correlated with nitrate removal (assuming that environmental conditions affect macroinvertebrate community composition). 4. The main trait modalities positively correlated with nitrate removal were scraper (feeding habit), flagstones/boulders/cobbles/pebbles (substrate preference), crawler and interstitial (locomotion) and detritus (food). The main modalities negatively correlated with nitrate removal were silt and mud with microphytes (as substrate preference), and with fine sediment with microorganisms, and dead animals (as food sources). These results agreed with the hypothesis of top-down control and enhanced understanding of the influence of hydromorphological factors on nitrate removal. 5. This study highlights the involvement of the macroinvertebrate community in in-stream nitrate processing, and demonstrates the usefulness of applying a functional approach to explain relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem function.				sauvage, sabine/P-1742-2015; Solimini, Angelo/C-9290-2018; Marti, Eugenia/J-9146-2012; Puig, Maria Angeles/A-4485-2013	sauvage, sabine/0000-0002-6360-1036; Marti, Eugenia/0000-0002-6910-4874; Puig, Maria Angeles/0000-0003-0997-3055; Morais, Manuela/0000-0003-0482-4309; Sabater, Francesc/0000-0001-6767-231X; COLAS, FANNY/0000-0002-5485-6715												0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2017	62	5					929	944		10.1111/fwb.12913								WOS:000398592200009

Living in close proximity to the Bay improves access to these amenities and should be capitalized into local housing markets. We investigate these impacts in the largest hedonic analysis of water quality ever completed, with over 200,000 property sales across 14 Maryland counties. We use a spatially explicit water quality dataset, along with a wealth of landscape, economic, geographic, and demographic variables. These data allow a comprehensive exploration of the value of water quality, while controlling for a multitude of other influences. We also estimate several variants of the models most popular in current literature, with a focus on the temporal average of water quality. In comparing 1 year and 3 year averages, the 3 year averages generally have a larger implicit price. Overall, results indicate that water quality improvements in the Bay, such as those required by EPA's Total Maximum Daily Load, could yield significant benefits to waterfront and near-waterfront homeowners.																	0921-8009	1873-6106				MAY	2017	135						103	113		10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.12.014								WOS:000395597700010

Allen			Bloom and bust: Toxic algae's impact on nearby property values	ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS												Over the past decade harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a nationwide environmental concern. HABs are likely to increase in frequency and intensity due to rising summer temperatures caused by climate change and higher nutrient enrichment from increased urbanization. Policymakers need information on the economic costs of HABs to design optimal management policies in the face of limited budgets. Using a detailed, multi lake hedonic analysis across 6 Ohio counties between 2009 and 2015 we show capitalization losses associated with near lake homes between 11% and 17% rising to above 22% for lake adjacent homes. In the case of Grand Lake Saint Marys, we find one-time capitalization losses exceeding $51 million for near lake homes which dwarfs the State of Ohio's cleanup expenditure of $26 million.

The model looks at the role of and explains the linkages between urban commons' biophysical structures, user population characteristics, power dynamics, use behavior, benefits generated, and management strategies. The model adds to existing literature by focusing on direct benefits and equity and by elaborating on the role of transaction costs and management strategies in governing urban commons. Considering direct benefits allows for a complete picture of overall benefits while making governance decisions, as opposed to considering benefits received only through human effort. Focusing on power asymmetries between stakeholders highlights the inequities created in accessing benefits from urban commons. Elaborating on management strategies provides greater insight into the complexities of managing urban commons and the impacts that governance decisions can have. Finally, including transaction costs highlights the factors that influence costs of managing resources. We illustrate the use of the model with literature from urban India. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

By analyzing long-term data from 110 mountainous streams draining into German drinking water reservoirs, nitrate concentrations indeed declined in the majority of catchments. Furthermore, our meta-analysis indicates that the declining nitrate levels are linked to the release of dissolved iron to streams likely due to a reductive dissolution of iron(III) minerals in riparian wetland soils. This dissolution process mobilized adsorbed compounds, such as phosphate, dissolved organic carbon and arsenic, resulting in concentration increases in the streams and higher inputs to receiving drinking water reservoirs. Reductive mobilization was most significant in catchments with stream nitrate concentrations < 6 mg L-1. Here, nitrate, as a competing electron acceptor, was too low in concentration to inhibit microbial iron(III) reduction. Consequently, observed trends were strongest in forested catchments, where nitrate concentrations were unaffected by agricultural and urban sources and which were therefore sensitive to reductions of atmospheric nitrogen depositions. We conclude that there is strong evidence that the decline in nitrogen deposition toward pre-industrial conditions lowers the redox buffer in riparian soils, destabilizing formerly fixed problematic compounds, and results in serious implications for water quality.

However, there is a paucity of research that couples functional measures with assessments of ecosystem structure. In mid-sized and large rivers, effects of restoration on key ecosystem processes, such as ecosystem metabolism, have rarely been addressed and remain poorly understood. We compared three reaches of the third-order, gravel-bed river Ruhr in Germany: two reaches restored with moderate (R1) and substantial effort (R2) and one upstream degraded reach (D). Hydromorphology, habitat composition, and hydrodynamics were assessed. We estimated gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) using the one-station open-channel diel dissolved oxygen change method over a 50-day period at the end of each reach. Moreover, we estimated metabolic rates of the combined restored reaches (R1 + R2) using the two-station open-channel method. Values for hydromorphological variables increased with restoration intensity (D < R1 < R2). Restored reaches had lower current velocity, higher longitudinal dispersion and larger transient storage zones. However, fractions of median travel time due to transient storage were highest in R1 and lowest in R2, with intermediate values in D. The share of macrophyte cover of total wetted area was highest in R2 and lowest in R1, with intermediate values in D. Station R2 had higher average GPP and ER than R1 and D. The combined restored reaches R1 C R2 also exhibited higher GPP and ER than the degraded upstream river (station D). Restoration increased river autotrophy, as indicated by elevated GPP : ER, and net ecosystem production (NEP) of restored reaches. Temporal patterns of ER closely mirrored those of GPP, pointing to the importance of autochthonous production for ecosystem functioning. In conclusion, high reach-scale restoration effort had considerable effects on river hydrodynamics and ecosystem functioning, which were mainly related to massive stands of macrophytes. High rates of metabolism and the occurrence of dense macrophyte stands may increase the assimilation of dissolved nutrients and the sedimentation of particulate nutrients, thereby positively affecting water quality.

Among 32 identified tintinnid species, the agglomerated genera Tintinnopsis (20 sp), dominated the community (similar to 62%) followed by Tintinnidium (2 sp), Leprotintinnus (2 sp), Codonellopsis, Stenosemella, Helicostomella, Favella, Eutintinnus, Metacylis, Dadayiellaand Wangiella (each comprising single species). A wide range of seasonal variations in tintinnid abundance was recorded maximum (2067 +/- 893 ind. l(-1)) for Tintinnopsis beroidea and minimum (11 +/- 4 ind. l(-1)) for Metacylis sp. during the investigation period. The biomass and daily production rate of tintinnid ranged from 0.004-2.764 mu g C l(-1) and 0.04-3.54 mu g C l(-1) day(-1) respectively. An overall dominance and diversity of the small-sized tintinnid (lorica length < 76 mu m) belonging to the genera Tintinnopsis sp., Tintinnidium sp., Codonellopsis sp., Wangiella sp., Eutintinnus sp., Metacylis sp. and Helicostomella sp. was pronounced, accounting similar to 66% of the total tintinnid abundance. K-dominance curves were plotted against log rank k, showed species dominance over the investigated sites. The multidimensional scaling (MDS) Canonical Analysis of Principal coordinates (CAP) highlighting a significantly different spatial distribution of tintinnid. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) map showed clustering of core species with chl a and nitrate and could be considered as the crucial factors controlling the distribution and seasonal patterns of tintinnid. Biota-environment (BIOENV) analyses also reveal that these two parameters were the significant causative factors, suggesting that tintinnid may be used as a bioindicator for discriminating water quality in this estuarine system. The study provided detailed information of microzooplankton which enhances our understanding regarding its crucial role in marine ecosystem and complex biotic interactions for maintaining the ecological and economic stability.

Their aim is to provide a small but comprehensive set of monitoring variables that would give a balanced picture of the development of biodiversity and the reaching of international and national biodiversity targets. Globally, GEO BON (Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network) has suggested 22 candidate EBVs to be monitored. In this article we regard EBVs as a conceptual tool that may help in making national scale biodiversity monitoring more robust by pointing out where to focus further development resources. We look at one country-Finland-with a relatively advanced biodiversity monitoring scheme and study how well Finland's current biodiversity state indicators correspond with EBVs. In particular, we look at how national biodiversity monitoring could be improved by using available remote sensing (RS) applications. Rapidly emerging new technologies from drones to airborne laser scanning and new satellite sensors providing imagery with very high resolution (VHR) open a whole new world of opportunities for monitoring the state of biodiversity and ecosystems at low cost. In Finland, several RS applications already exist that could be expanded into national indicators. These include the monitoring of shore habitats and water quality parameters, among others. We hope that our analysis and examples help other countries with similar challenges. Along with RS opportunities, our analysis revealed also some needs to develop the EBV framework itself.

Such neonicotinoid use may pose a risk to non-target insects, including pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests, and ecosystems. This study assessed neonicotinoid residues in groundwater, surface runoff water, soil, and native plants adjacent to corn and soybean crop fields with a history of being planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds from 2008 to 2013. Data from six sites with the same crop management history, three with and three without in-field prairie strips, were collected in 2015-2016, 2-3 years after neonicotinoid (clothianidin and imidacloprid) seed treatments were last used. Three of the six neonicotinoids analyzed were detected in at least one environmental matrix: the two applied as seed coatings on the fields (clothianidin and imidacloprid) and another widely used neonicotinoid (thiamethoxam). Sites with prairie strips generally had lower concentrations of neonicotinoids: groundwater and footslope soil neonicotinoid concentrations were significantly lower in the sites with prairie strips than in those without; mean concentrations for groundwater were 11 and 20 ng/L (p = 0.048) and <1 and 6 ng/g (p = 0.0004) for soil, respectively. Surface runoff water concentrations were not significantly (p = 0.38) different for control sites (44 ng/L) or sites with prairie strips (140 ng/L). Consistent with the decreased inputs of neonicotinoids, concentrations tended to decrease over the sampling timeframe. Two sites recorded concentration increases, however, potentially due to disturbance of previous applications or influence from nearby fields where use of seed treatments continued. There were no detections (limit of detection: 1 ng/g) of neonicotinoids in the foliage or roots of plants comprising prairie strips, indicating a low likelihood of exposure to pollinators and other insects visiting these plants following the cessation of seed coating use. Offsite transport of neonicotinoids to aquatic systems through the groundwater and surface water were furthermore reduced with prairie strips. This study demonstrates the potential for prairie strips comprising 10% of an agricultural catchment to mitigate the non-target impacts of neonicotinoids.

How seasonality and anthropogenic impacts can modulate the structure of aquatic benthic invertebrate assemblages	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												We studied a benthic invertebrate assemblage of a stream that passes through pristine, rural, suburban and urban areas of a municipality located in southeastern Brazil to investigate a possible relationship between this assemblage structure and urbanization. The environmental variables and fauna structure were analyzed in a spatial and temporal scale, sampling the four sites in a dry and wet season. We found a clear spatial pattern, with higher similarity between sites from rural and suburban area that presented intermediate environmental characteristics. The pristine site showed in both seasons the lowest values of alkalinity and fecal coliform. On the other hand, the site located in the urban area showed the lowest concentration of dissolved oxygen and higher of suspended solids, ammonia and fecal coliform. The extreme values of these three variables occurred in the wet season, probably related to the high rainfall values. The benthic invertebrate fauna structure followed the same longitudinal and seasonal pattern found for the environmental variables. The site in urban area showed the lowest richness, diversity and evenness, with a dominance of two groups resistant to adverse environmental conditions (Oligochaeta and Orthocladiinae) and absence of more sensitive groups (Coleoptera, Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera). The increase drag of the substrate and associated invertebrates can be responsible for the lower abundance and richness observed in the wet season. The environmental variables that best defined the differentiation between sites (dissolved oxygen, organic suspended solids and fecal coliform) related directly to urbanization effects, like dump effluents and removal of riparian vegetation.																	1585-8553	1588-2756				APR	2017	18	1					47	55		10.1556/168.2017.18.1.6								WOS:000403545100006

There has been a recent increase in the necessity of combining methods and tools to create interdisciplinary evaluations of water ecosystem services, especially in developing countries where there is a lack of systematized and updated socioenvironmental information. We propose a framework for the assessment of water supply ecosystem services that includes environmental, social and economic dimensions. We describe and develop each of these dimensions with a particular focus on identifying the key variables that are needed to answer them. First, we performed research of the literature regarding the evaluation methods that are sufficiently flexible to apply them to local scales in countries where information is limited. Then, we chose the Magdalena River Watershed to apply this perspective because it is an illustrative area of vital importance to Mexico City's ecosystem services. We believe that this proposal has outlined basic guidelines to help decision makers improve water management and may provide an opportunity to change public policies on peri-urban ecosystems.

Youth-focused citizen science: Examining the role of environmental science learning and agency for conservation	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Citizen science by youth is rapidly expanding, but very little research has addressed the ways programs meet the dual goals of rigorous conservation science and environmental science education. We examined case studies of youth-focused community and citizen science (CCS) and analyzed the learning processes and outcomes, and stewardship activities for youth, as well as contributions to site and species management, each as conservation outcomes. Examining two programs (one coastal and one water quality monitoring) across multiple sites in the San Francisco Bay Area, CA, in-and out-of-school settings, we qualitatively analyzed in-depth observations and pre- and post-program interviews with youth and educators. First, we examined evidence from the programs' impacts on conservation in the form of contribution to site and species management. We found that youth work informed regional resource management and local habitat improvement. Second, we examined the youth participants' environmental science agency (ESA). ESA combines not only understanding of environmental science and inquiry practices, but also the youths' identification with those practices and their developing belief that the ecosystem is something on which they act. We found that youth developed different aspects of environmental science agency in each context. We identify three key CCS processes through which many of the youth developed ESA: ensuring rigorous data collection, disseminating scientific findings to authentic external audiences, and investigating complex social-ecological systems. Our findings suggest that when CCS programs for youth support these processes, they can foster youth participation in current conservation actions, and build their capacity for future conservation actions.

J	Hugonnot, V				Hugonnot, Vincent			Morphological, phytocoenotic and functional approach of bryoliths in the lower valley of the Isere River (from Saint-Marcellin to Romans), France	REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE												The flora and vegetation of bryoliths located in the main river channel were studied in the vicinity of four dams (Beauvoir, Saint-Hilaire, Pizancon and La Vanelle) in the Isere lower valley. Palustriella commutata is the more frequent species. Other species are locally frequent, as e.g. Eucladium verticillatum, Hymetzosodium recurvirostrum, Boum pseudotriquetrum. From a floristic perspective, bryoliths of the Isere lower valley are typical of temperate Europe. The communities are complex and structured by a small number of bryophyte species that mostly respond to water availability. This type of vegetation is referred to a European priority habitat named 7220 Sources petriflantes avec formation de tuf (Cratoneurion). From a morphological point of view, two main types of bryoliths systems coexist: cascades and dams. The bryoliths of the Isere lower valley, like others from southem France, are characterized by multiple-equilibria, which make them sensitive ecosystems: hydrochemical equilibrium linked to water quality; biological equilibrium due to encrusting bryophytes occurrence and growth; hydrological equilibrium due to type of water input. Water supply accounts for floristic, bryocoenotic and functional richness. All carbonate precipitation processes rely heavily on water supply abundance and quality. Studied bryoliths, as they are disconnected from the general hydrological functioning, are strictly dependant of the Molassic aquifers they are fed by. Hence bryoliths of Isere lower valley are oligotrophic systems within an overall eutrophic valley. All bryoliths are threatened by strong anthropic pressure. Trampling, forestry, but mostly water extraction, are worrying threats. Many bryoliths were exploited for building stone in the past. Today, Holocene bryoliths are settled over ancient travertine systems which have a great paleogeographical value.																	0249-7395					APR-JUN	2017	72	2					116	133										WOS:000398985600002

Potamogeton crispus L., a species of pondweed, is widely used in such restoration because it can be easily propagated through its turions. However, little is known so far of the growth characteristics of turions growing under limited light or even in total darkness. The growth and physiological responses of plants raised from small, medium, or large turions (categorized on the basis of their weight) and growing in total darkness in an aquarium showed that plants raised from small turions were significantly shorter (33.4 +/- 4.8 cm) than those grown from medium or large turions (49.9 +/- 4.3 cm and 46.9 +/- 7.4 cm, respectively; the difference between the two categories was not significant) when measured on the average of 48th, 62nd and 69th days after planting. Although the plant biomass was significantly different among the three groups of turions, it remained virtually the same within each group throughout. Plants raised from the three categories of turions, however, did not differ significantly either in terms of root length or with respect to soluble protein contents and peroxidase activity; the last parameter increased significantly after 48 days in all the three categories, whereas the activity of superoxide dismutase increased significantly after 62 days. These observations indicate that P. crispus plants growing in total darkness suffer from stress due to antioxidants, especially after 48 days of culture. Therefore, it is recommended that larger turions be chosen for planting and that suitable measures be taken to ensure that at least some light reaches the plants 48 days after planting. Three formulas are presented, depending on the level of turbidity and the weight of turions, to calculate the maximum water depth at which P. crispus could survive for restoration of P. crispus in eutrophic lakes.

B.; Naden, Pamela S.; Skates, James			Do agri-environment schemes result in improved water quality?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Improved water quality, through a reduction in diffuse pollution from agricultural sources, is an expected benefit of agri-environment schemes, but this has yet to be demonstrated in practice. Here, we evaluate the impact of Welsh agri-environment schemes on water quality and freshwater ecosystem condition through a combined monitoring and modelling framework. 2. To determine the influence of the agri-environment schemes on ecosystem condition, spatially independent catchments dominated by a single scheme (>40% of catchment) were compared to control catchments dominated (>70%) by agricultural land that was not part of any scheme. Biological indicators of water quality were monitored at the outfall of each catchment and a spatially explicit modelling framework of diffuse pollutant emissions applied to each of the 80 catchments. 3. Direct comparison ( scheme/non-scheme) was unable to identify any significant effect of agri-environment scheme participation. However, derived biological indicators that reflected organic pollution, eutrophication and pesticide run-off were strongly correlated with modelled concentrations of corresponding diffuse pollutants, thus providing a ground-truth for the models. Scenarios that assessed the correct counterfactuals ( i.e. the influence of scheme entry on pollutant output) were developed for the whole of Wales. The models indicated an important effect of scheme entry on water quality, but this effect was not evenly distributed across the landscape. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that agri-environment schemes can deliver improvements in water quality, through a reduction in diffuse pollution from agricultural sources. However, it is not easy to demonstrate scheme effectiveness; the combination of field survey and modelling used here provides a framework for addressing these difficulties. A spatially targeted approach for agri-environment scheme options to protect water resources from diffuse pollution is likely to be most effective at delivering water quality improvements.

The environmental good is shared by the study countries, but the countries differ substantially in their income levels and other characteristics. We compare the performance of value transfers (with or without income elasticity of willingness to pay adjustments) and function transfers that include only core variables supported by economic theory. Our results point to a new source of uncertainty associated with function transfer choosing a particular functional form. Even if only theoretically relevant explanatory variables are used, the theory offers no insights with respect to a functional relationship of the dependence (e.g., linear, log-linear, exponential, polynomial). We show that while different functional forms may offer improvements in model fit, this does not necessarily translate to improvements in transfer errors or minimum tolerance levels. In our case, the value transfer with constant (unit) income elasticity adjustment, corresponding to the log-log functional relationship between willingness to pay and income, performs the best, Including additional explanatory variables or using other functional forms worsens the quality of transfers. Overall, our study questions the rationale for using more complicated function transfers in international benefit transfers, as the relationships observed within a country or a group of countries does not necessarily translate to dependencies between countries.

Here, we configured five separate SWAT (US Department of Agriculture's Soil and Water Assessment Tool) models to assess load reduction strategies for the agriculturally dominated Maumee River watershed, the largest P source contributing to toxic algal blooms in Lake Erie. Although several potential pathways may achieve the target loads, our results show that any successful pathway will require large-scale implementation of multiple practices. For example, one successful pathway involved targeting 50% of row cropland that has the highest P loss in the watershed with a combination of three practices: subsurface application of P fertilizers, planting cereal rye as a winter cover crop, and installing buffer strips. Achieving these levels of implementation will require local, state/provincial, and federal agencies to collaborate with the private sector to set shared implementation goals and to demand innovation and honest assessments of water quality-related programs, policies, and partnerships.

The events resulted in regime shifts cascading through all trophic levels, disturbing ecosystem functioning and damaging the water environment. Causal pathways by which the external (hydroclimate, overfishing) and internal (food web interactions) drivers provoke regime shifts are investigated. Statistical data analyses supported by an interpretative framework based on hierarchical ecosystem theory revealed mechanisms of hierarchical incorporation of environmental factors into the ecosystem. Evidence links Atlantic teleconnections to Black Sea hydroclimate, which together with fishing shapes variability in fish stocks. The hydroclimatic signal is conveyed through the food web via changes in productivity at all levels, to planktivorous fish. Fluctuating fish abundance is believed to induce a lagged change in competitor jelly plankton that cascades down to phytoplankton and influences water quality. Deprived of the stabilising role of apex predators, the Black Sea's hierarchical ecosystem organisation is susceptible to both environmental and anthropogenic stresses, and increased fishing makes fish stock collapses highly probable. When declining stocks are confronted with burgeoning fishing effort associated with the inability of fishery managers and decision-makers to adapt rapidly to changes in fish abundance, there is overfishing and stock collapse. Management procedures are ineffective at handling complex phenomena such as ecosystem regime shifts because of the shortage of suitable explanatory models. The proposed concepts and models reported here relate the hydroclimate, overfishing and invasive species to shifts in ecosystem functioning and water quality, unravelling issues such as the causality of ecosystem interactions and mechanisms and offering potential for finding ways to reverse regime shifts.

Predicting the impact of Lake Biomanipulation based on food-web modeling-Lake Kinneret as a case study	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Biomanipulation is a tool decision makers use to achieve desirable management goals. In lakes, one of the most common goals is the improvement of water quality, an objective that can be achieved mainly by reducing the amount of phytoplankton in the water. Although it is a very clear goal that is achievable by using actions that affect the phytoplankton biomass, experience shows that primary biomanipulation goals are rarely achieved. A biomanipulation program was conducted in Lake Kinneret over a 12-year period with the goal of improving water quality by reducing the population of the dominant fish species in the lake. However, the biomanipulation failed to achieve the goal and the program was stopped. We used Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) scenarios to examine the effect of biomanipulation on the ecosystem. The results of these scenarios show that biomanipulation actions, such as those used in the lake, indeed fail to improve water quality; furthermore, they will actually increase the amount of phytoplankton in the water and decrease water quality. The development of the method described in the present article provides managers with the means to evaluate the effect of biomanipulation on an ecosystem. This method enables researches to conduct a pre-action analysis of the planned measures and examine whether the goal can be achieved, saving money and time and preventing damage to the ecosystem.

A novel quantile method reveals spatiotemporal shifts in phytoplankton biomass descriptors between bloom and non-bloom conditions in a subtropical estuary	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Estuarine environments support dynamic phytoplankton blooms, especially in lowlatitude regions, where the effects of local drivers dominate. Identifying key bloom drivers from entangled ecological and anthropogenic influences is particularly challenging in stressed systems where several disturbances interact. Additionally, processes controlling bloom and non-bloom phytoplankton biomass dynamics can differ spatially, further confounding characterization of disturbance regimes that create bloom-favorable conditions. This study aims to explore the question of whether the shift from non-bloom to bloom conditions is matched by a shift in the relative importance of water quality drivers. Florida Bay (USA), a shallow subtropical inner shelf lagoon, was chosen as the study site due to its unique bloom dynamics and low-latitude location, as well as for the availability of long-term (16 yr) water quality data consisting of monthly measurements from 28 locations across the 2200 km(2) bay. At each of the locations, we applied a novel thresholdbased quantile regression analysis to chlorophyll a data to define bloom conditions, separate data from non-bloom conditions, and evaluate phytoplankton biomass dynamics of each of the 2 states. The final suite of explanatory covariates revealed spatial trends and differences in the relative importance of water quality descriptors of phytoplankton between the 2 conditions. The effects of turbidity and salinity on phytoplankton biomass became pronounced during blooms, whereas non-bloom conditions were primarily explained by autoregressive phytoplankton biomass trends and nutrient dynamics. The proposed analytical approach is not limited to any particular aquatic system type, and can be used to produce practical spatiotemporal information to guide management, restoration, and conservation efforts.

In this research, a simple but comprehensive process-based model was developed for simulating the water flow and nitrogen dynamics. Processes considered in this model included all the important processes involved in nitrogen transformations, as well as nitrogen transport. Nitrogen transformation processes comprised fertilizer dissolution, nitrification, denitrification, ammonium volatilization, mineralization and immobilization. The nitrogen transport processes included nitrogen uptake by the plant, soil adsorption, upward flux, surface runoff losses and drain losses in the fields with the drainage network. For model evaluation, the measured data obtained from Imam agro-industrial Company, in Khuzestan, Iran, were used. Computed RMSE of the simulated water table, the drainage discharge rate, nitrate and ammonium concentration in drainage water were determined to be 14.58 cm,1.82 mm/day,1.73 mg/L and 0.48 mg/L, respectively. The results indicated a good agreement between the observed and simulated data. This model could be, therefore, used for fertilizer management, thereby reducing the concentration of nitrate and ammonium in the drainage water and helping to prevent the environmental pollution.

J	Chimner, RA; Cooper, DJ; Wurster, FC; Rochefort, L				Chimner, Rodney A.; Cooper, David J.; Wurster, Frederic C.; Rochefort, Line			An overview of peatland restoration in North America: where are we after 25 years?	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Peatland restoration in North America (NA) was initiated approximately 25years ago on peat-extracted bogs. Recent advances in peatland restoration in NA have expanded the original concepts and methodology. Restoration efforts in NA now include restoring peatlands from many diverse types of disturbances (e.g. roads, agriculture, grazing, erosion, forestry, and petrol industry infrastructure impacts) and occur in a greater array of peatland types (e.g. fens and swamps). Because fens are groundwater and surface flow driven, techniques to restore the hydrology of fens are generally more complicated than bogs. Restoring a greater variety of peatland types on a large-scale basis (> 10ha) commands new techniques for reestablishing a broader array of plants other than Sphagnum spp., including non-Sphagnum mosses, sedges, nonericaceous shrubs, and trees. The rationale for restoring peatlands has expanded to include legal requirements, wetland mitigation and banking, climate mitigation, water quality, and as part of responsible ecosystem management for industry or society. In the past 25 years, peatland restoration in NA has evolved from (1) trial and error to a more empirically based scientific approach, (2) small site-specific experiments to landscape-scale restoration (e.g. hydrological connectivity, ecological fragmentation), and (3) individual stakeholder (academic) to multiple stakeholders across jurisdictional boundaries (private, local, and regional governmental agencies, NGOs, and so on). However, many research gaps still exist that must be addressed to enhance our ability to restore peatlands successfully.

Changes in runoff chemistry and soil fertility after multiple years of cattle winter bale feeding on annual cropland on the Canadian prairies	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Feeding cattle on cropland through the winter months using pre-placed fodder bales (bale grazing or infield bale feeding) has demonstrated economic benefits when compared to confined winter feeding, but very little research has been done to quantify the impacts of recurring cycles of in-field feeding on runoff water quality. In this study, two small watersheds (with and without winter bale grazing; WBG) located in the same annual cropped field in southern Manitoba, Canada were monitored from 2008 to 2016. Winter feeding in the WBG treatment occurred in the winters of 2008/09, 2010/11, 2012/13, and 2014/15. Export of N and P with the WBG treatment was also contrasted with the alternative practice of higher density confined feeding (CF). For WBG, soil fertility was improved, with higher soil test phosphorus (Olsen-P) and soil nitrate (NO3(-)-N) following WBG. Exports of N and P with surface runoff were also higher in snowmelt following WBG when compared to the control watershed, primarily due to higher concentrations of particulate N and P, NH4+-N, and dissolved organic N. Higher P loss from the WBG watershed than from the control watershed persisted in the non-grazing years following each bale grazing. In contrast, concentrations of all forms of nitrogen in runoff consistently returned to levels observed prior to bale grazing following a winter without treatment. Annual runoff export of N and P per animal unit day (AUD) following WBG was comparable to that for two CF sites. Higher annual volumes of runoff were observed from the larger area and lower density bale feeding treatment, but with lower concentrations of N and Pin comparison to feedlot sites. If WBG continues to be utilized to improve soil fertility and reduce manure transportation costs, the potential negative impacts on runoff water quality must be considered. Higher volumes of snowmelt runoff per AUD from WBG in comparison to CF sites will make runoff capture options more expensive to implement. WBG timing or siting changes that reduce runoff volume and make retention feasible or that decrease accumulation of P at the soil surface will reduce negative water quality impacts associated with WBG.

Richard; Jeong, Jaehak			Evaluating the ranch and watershed scale impacts of using traditional and adaptive multi-paddock grazing on runoff, sediment and nutrient losses in North Texas, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Grazing management practices have a significant influence on ecosystem services provided by rangelands. An assessment of hydrologic and water quality impacts of traditional and alternate grazing management practices facilitates adoption of best management practices for long-term sustainability of rangelands. A study was conducted to quantify the runoff, sediment and nutrient losses under traditional continuous and adaptive multi-paddock (MP) grazing management practices in the rangeland dominated (71% rangeland) Clear Creek Watershed (CCW) in north Texas in the United States using the Agricultural Policy/Environmental Extender (APEX) model. The model was calibrated and validated using observed herbaceous plant biomass and daily soil moisture data at four study ranches in the CCW [two under MP grazing and one each under light continuous (LC) and heavy continuous (HC) grazing practices], and using monthly streamflow, sediment, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) data measured at the watershed outlet. Both ranch- and watershed-scale results indicated a strong influence of the grazing practice on runoff and water quality. When the grazing management was changed from the baseline MP to HC at one of the study ranches, the simulated average (1980-2013) annual surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP losses increased by 148%, 142%, 144% and 158%, respectively. At the watershed-scale, changing grazing management from the baseline HC to adaptive MP reduced the average annual surface runoff, sediment, TN and TP loads at the watershed outlet by 39%, 34%, 33% and 31%, respectively. In addition, implementation of adaptive MP grazing reduced streamflow during the high flow conditions that have <10% exceedance probability, by about 20%, and hence reduced the chances of flooding downstream of the watershed. Adaptive MP grazing was therefore found to be an effective conservation practice on grazing lands for enhancing water conservation and protecting water quality. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Leslie, JE; Weersink, A; Yang, W; Fox, G				Leslie, Jennifer E.; Weersink, Alfons; Yang, Wanhong; Fox, Glenn			Actual versus environmentally recommended fertilizer application rates: Implications for water quality and policy	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Excessive application of crop nutrients has been identified as a threat to surface water quality in many jurisdictions. The Western Basin of Lake Erie Collaborative Agreement commits the governments of Michigan, Ohio and Ontario to reduce phosphorus entering the Lake Erie's western basin by 40% by 2025/2026 from 2008 levels by, among other things, reducing fertilizer use in agriculture. The International Joint Commission (2014) estimates that agriculture accounts for 44% of total phosphorus loadings to Lake Erie. Our study uses a unique micro level data set of 16 farms over 6 years that allows us to examine 397 individual nutrient application choices at the field and farm level. If efforts to reduce excessive application of nutrients are to be successful at aggregate level, they need to be informed by an understanding of how farmers make nutrient application decisions within existing production systems. The study aims to enhance our understanding by determining whether farmers applying nutrients to maximize yields, to maximize net returns or to meet environmental targets, and whether over application depends on factors such as farm size, crop type, manure use, and type of nutrient. We compare actual nutrient application rates with site specific rates intended to minimize excess nutrient application and we regress nutrient application levels against potential explanatory variables including farm size, crop rotation practices, and application of livestock. The data were collected from farmers in the Gully Creek watershed in Ontario. We found that excess nutrient applications, as a percentage of the total nutrient applications, are much higher for phosphorus than for nitrogen and higher for wheat than for corn. While most of the farmers in the study are not required to comply with provincial nutrient management regulations, many of them apply fertilizer at rates close to that recommended by those regulations and some at rates significantly less. While most farms are applying fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, at rates close to the minimum crop requirements, nevertheless, a few farms apply much more phosphorous than recommended. Policy and research efforts should be directed toward targeting these individuals that appear to be the primary contributor to the nutrient loading issue. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Forty-eight surfers enrolled in the study and completed an initial health background survey and weekly health surveys online using Survey Monkey. Descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation, a regression technique, were used to identify longitudinal and correlated results. The surfers were predominately Caucasian, male, and physically active. They surfed approximately 4 h a week. Their average age was 34 years. The data indicated that the surfers were generally "healthy,'' with a low prevalence of diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension. Their most common health problems were allergies and asthma. During the study, 10% of the surfers reported gastrointestinal symptoms and 29% reported upper respiratory symptoms. This study suggests surfers were significantly more likely to report upper respiratory symptoms when they had a history of allergies, housemates with upper respiratory symptoms, and/or a history of previous adverse health symptoms while surfing during a "red tide'' (an event often associated with the presence of phytoplankton toxins). Additionally, female surfers reported upper respiratory symptoms more than males.

A meta-analysis with implications for restoration and management	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in riparian zones. 2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead), fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified where and with which species current research is being undertaken and examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location, focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to changes in riparian zones. 3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific trout responses to eight key 'drivers' of change in riparian condition. 4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and +66.6% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation (-67.4 and -88.2% respectively). We found some evidence that positive riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e. individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on the 'production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial. 5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically, socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish species.

Understanding spatial and environmental drivers of undisturbed stream assemblages is important for separating natural and human-induced changes, but has rarely been attempted for an entire tropical bioregion. 2. We sampled riffle macroinvertebrate assemblages and measured associated biophysical variables in post-wet and dry seasons from 68 streams of orders 1-5 across the Australian Wet Tropics, a small bioregion (18 497 km 2) defined by its warm moist climate and closed-forest vegetation. 3. As climate and landscape were relatively uniform across the bioregion, we predicted that assemblages would be similar, with turnover (beta diversity) unrelated to distance, and with composition determined mainly by habitat. 4. We identified 93 higher taxa. Density and richness of macroinvertebrates were greatest in the dry season because of habitat contraction and minimal flow disturbance. Richness was greatest in higher order streams. 5. Relative abundance and richness of functional groups showed minor effects of catchment, lithology and stream order, and a positive relationship with altitude for richness of collectors, predators and shredders, and for abundance of shredders. 6. Distance-based linear modelling showed that among-assemblage differences were explained by landscape-scale variables (9.5% of the variation), stream size (13.0%), riparian characteristics (9.6%), water quality (4.6%), substratum (21.1%) and organic resources (22.4%); for models of individual taxa and functional groups, habitat and organic-resource variables also predominated. 7. Similarities among site assemblages differed little among catchments and there was no relationship between pairwise similarities of catchments and their geographical distances. Nestedness analysis confirmed that samples and catchment groupings were nested subsets of the total set of samples. 8. Across the Australian Wet Tropics, uniformity of assemblages (identified to family or above) conformed to the bioregional classification, probably as a result of the great age of the region. The habitat variables that most influenced macroinvertebrate assemblages support the idea that a suite of biophysical influences is common to stream macroinvertebrate assemblages globally.

Quantifying tillage dynamics from time ordered spatially aggregated data	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Understanding and documenting historical agricultural land use and farming practices is important for assessment of environmental benefits of no-till (NT). To address the need for quantitative estimates of time patterns of tillage practices, this study proposes modeling the time patterns using the Markov chains framework and estimating the probabilities of transition from one tillage-crop combination to another tillage-crop combination from time-ordered spatially aggregated data. We developed a first-order, four-state Markov chain model of tillage-crop dynamics in corn (Zea mays L.) soybean (Glycine max L.) production systems and estimated the transition probabilities for the state of Iowa using the 1992 to 1997 data collected by the Conservation Technology Information Center. The transition probabilities strongly suggest that the "majority of NT acreage is not in continuous but rather in rotational NT, i.e., NT crop production in rotation with conventional or other tillage systems. We find that the probability of two-year continuous NT is 8%, and that 70% of Iowa cropland has never used NT over two consecutive years. When three-year tillage history is considered on corn acreage, 3% is in continuous NT, 62% has never used NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. When three-year tillage history is considered on soybean acreage, 4% is in continuous NT, 56% has never used, NT, and the rest of the acreage is in rotational NT. The methodology presented is applicable to corn soybean,production systems in other regions and is generalizable to other cropping systems. Regional estimates of the use of rotational and continuous NT are likely to benefit simulation Modeling for the assessment of the environmental effects of alternative tillage practices.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAR-APR	2017	72	2					131	138		10.2489/jswc.72.2.131								WOS:000395957900009

Nutrient biofilters in the Virginia Coastal Plain: Nitrogen removal, cost, and potential adoption pathways	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Excess nonpoint source nutrient loss presents one of the most vexing water management challenges for water quality managers: Agriculture is the single largest contributor of nutrients to the Chesapeake Bay, and achieving nutrient reduction targets for agriculture will be costly. Biofilters offer new opportunities to reduce nutrient loads from artificially drained agricultural land. Nutrient biofilters consist of organic carbon (C) medium, typically wood chips, that when saturated with nitrogen (N)-enriched waters supports the activity of naturally occurring soil microorganisms that convert bioavailable N into N gases via denitrification.This study estimates the cost and N removal effectiveness for a biochar-amended woodchip biofilter draining a 10 ha (25 ac) field planted in a corn (Zea mays L.)-soy (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) rotation in eastern Virginia as well as for alternative design scenarios for biofilters ranging 25 to 150 m(3) (883 to 5,297 ft(3)) with either woodchips alone or biochar-amended woodchip C substrates. Nitrogen removal effectiveness is estimated using modeled site-specific influent loads and N removal effectiveness estimates derived from experimental trials in a pilot scale system on the Delmarva Peninsula. This analysis estimates N removal costs as a function of biofilter size, which directly relates to residence time, per unit of N removed. Modeled N removal estimates over a five-year period (2009 to 2013) for five bed volumes range from 88 to 391 kg (194 to 862 lb) for the woodchip biofilters (21% to 95% removal) and 132 to 412 kg (291 to 908 lb) for the biochar-amended woodchip biofilters (32% to 100% removal) of the 412 kg total N load exported to the biofilters during the five-year period.The N removal costs range from US$15 to US$48 kg' y-1 (US$6.82 to US$21.82 lb(-1)yr(-1)) for the woodchip biofilter and US$15 to US$33 kg(-1) y(-1) (US$6.82 to US$15 lb(-1) yr(-1)) for biochar-amended woodchip filters. While biofilters are determined to be cost-effective for N removal compared to conventional agricultural best management practices, agricultural producers may be reluctant to voluntarily adopt biofilters because of the relatively high initial installation costs and the lack of direct incentive payments for pollutant removal effectiveness. Nutrient trading programs offer some potential to enhance adoption, but not in the immediate future.

Riparian proper functioning condition assessment to improve watershed management for water quality	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Pollutants can be reduced, ameliorated or assimilated when riparian ecosystems have the vegetation, water, and soil/landform needed for riparian functions. Loss of physical form and ecological function unravels assimilation processes, increasing supply and transport of pollutants. Water quality and aquatic organisms are response measures of accumulated upstream discharges, and ultimately of changes in riparian functions. Thus, water quality monitoring often fails to identify or lags behind many causes of pollution or remediation from riparian degradation. This paper reviews the interagency riparian proper functioning condition (PFC) assessment for lotic (running water) riparian ecosystems and outlines connections between PFC and water quality attributes (sediment, nutrients, temperature, and dissolved oxygen [DO]). The PFC interaction of hydrology, vegetation, and soils/landforms influences water quality by dissipating energy associated with high waterflow, thereby reducing vertical instability and lateral erosion while developing floodplains with captured sediment and nutrients. Slowing flood water enables aquifer recharge, deposition, and plant nutrient uptake. Water-loving, densely rooted streambank stabilizing vegetation and/or wood helps integrate riparian functions to maintain channel pattern, profile, and dimension with characteristics for a diversity of habitats. A complex food web helps slow the nutrient spiral with uptake and storage. Temperature fluctuations are dampened by delayed discharges, narrower and deeper active channels, coarser substrates that enhance hyporheic interchange, and shade from riparian vegetation. After assessment and implementation, monitoring recovery of impaired riparian function attributes (e.g., streambank plant species) naturally focuses on persistent drivers of water quality and aquatic habitat. This provides timely environmental indicators of stream ecological health and water quality remediation projects or land management.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				MAR-APR	2017	72	2					168	182		10.2489/jSWC.72.2.168								WOS:000395957900013

Influence of the colonizing substrate on diatom assemblages and implications for bioassessment: a mesocosm experiment	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Although diatoms are important bioindicators of ecological quality, their ecological traits are still not well understood. A major issue is that of substrate preferences, which may result in differences in production, and assemblage structure and composition, and which should therefore be taken into account for ecological quality assessment studies. Thus, in this work, the periphyton grown on sand and ceramic tiles in indoor controlled channels were compared to understand whether substrate differences lead to differences in: periphyton production (chlorophyll-a), chlorophyll-b and c concentrations, diatom assemblages (diversity-Shannon-Wiener, cell density, taxonomic composition, trait proportions), and ecological quality assessments (IPS-'Indice de Polluosensibilit, Sp,cifique'). A combined inoculum of periphyton from four Portuguese streams was introduced to the running channels (six sand and six tile) and left to colonize for 35 days. Epilithic (tiles) and epipsammic (sand) assemblages were sampled at days 14 and 35. We verified that there were no differences in chlorophyll-a concentration over time and between substrates. On both sampling occasions, the epipsammic assemblages had higher concentration of chlorophyll-c and diatom density but without significant differences over time in each substrate. The taxonomic composition was different between substrates and over time. However, these differences were not reflected in ecological quality assessment. The diversity was also similar between substrates in both sampling occasions, but it was higher at day 14. Mobile and stalked species were more abundant over the entire study and differed significantly between substrates, with the epipsammic assemblages presenting higher abundances of both traits. We concluded that the colonizing substrate influences diatom assemblages but not the ecological quality assessment.

In this work, we used a 2-year survey data in 25 wetlands distributed throughout Morocco to model duck spatial distribution and to assess the relevance of a set of environmental and anthropogenic factors in predicting site occupancy, by means of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM). Mallards and Ferruginous ducks were the most commonly detected species, whereas White-Headed Ducks and Common Pochards were the least detected ones. An inter-annual variation in site occupancy was recorded for Ruddy Shelducks, Red-Crested Pochards and White-Headed Ducks. Geographical location (measured mainly as distance to the coastline and altitude) was the major predictor of the occurrence probability of Ruddy Shelducks, Marbled Teals and Red-Crested Pochards, while human presence and habitat features were the most relevant factors in shaping Mallard's distribution. However, none of the considered environmental and anthropogenic factors explained the distribution patterns of the Ferruginous Duck, Common Pochard and Gadwall. The results of this study clearly show that there are still gaps in our knowledge on factors driving wetland occupancy by breeding Anatidae in Morocco. The pursuit of the investigations, while considering other explanatory factors such as water quality (limnological data), diet, predation, and conservation status, is of great importance to more profoundly understand the dynamics of Moroccan duck populations.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				MAR	2017	32	2					259	269		10.1007/s11284-017-1436-5								WOS:000394982300017						
J	Ding, TD; Zhang, JY; Ni, WM; Li, JY				Ding, Tengda; Zhang, Jianying; Ni, Wanmin; Li, Juying			Combined toxicity of arsenite and dimethylarsenic acid on the freshwater diatom Nitzschia palea	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The toxicity and bioavailability of single arsenic species have been widely investigated, however, the biological effects of mixed arsenic species co-existing in natural waters still remain unknown. The objective of this work was to discern the adverse effects of combined arsenite (As(III)) and dimethylarsenic acid (DMA) on diatom Nitzschia palea. The combined ecotoxicity of As(III) and DMA on N. palea was observed to be time-dependent and showed dose-effect relation. The toxicity of DMA and As(III) mixture was higher than individual DMA or As(III) when the As(III) concentration was in the range of 0.085-0.316 mg L-1. As the As(III) concentration increased from 0.487 to 0.858 mg L-1, the antagonistic effect was found, which could be due to the higher thiols contents in the thiol-containing proteins (e.g., frustulins, silaffins and other glycoproteins). The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the treatment of mixed arsenic species was found to be at the same level compared to the As-free control after 72 h of exposure, indicating that the co-toxicity of As(III) and DMA on diatom frustules was not significant. Furthermore, the increase of frustule formation rate in the mixture of EC50 As(III)-EC10 DMA at 72 h exposure time indicated that the damaged diatom cell walls was likely repaired gradually. The results from this study suggested that the effects of co-existed arsenic species were concentration-specific and should be considered in the risk assessment of arsenic and development of water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic ecosystems.

Mining activities and the resulting high loads of heavy metals interact with intensive acid rain, and often have great consequences for biodiversity. However, considering the frequently episodic nature of these heavy acid rains, there is little detailed evidence of direct impacts. In 2011 we observed a massive mortality of noble crayfish and stone crayfish in PadrA<yen>sko Special Area of Conservation (SAC) in the Brdy Mountain region of the Czech Republic. Based on concentrations of metals (Al, Fe, As, Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn and Hg) in various tissues (gills, hepatopancreas, muscle) of both dead and live crayfish in this locality compared to reference populations, these crayfish had experienced long-term exposure to increased levels of these metals. Here we give detailed documentation of crayfish mortality associated with high metal concentrations in the gills and other tissues of these endangered invertebrates.

However, nutrient uptake by biofilms may be hampered by the occurrence of pollutants or other stressors. This study aimed: (i) to investigate the biofilm phosphorus (P) uptake capacity as a relevant process for the maintenance of fluvial water quality and (ii) to explore the sensitivity of this process to different chemical and environmental stressors. We conducted chamber experiments to test for the relevance of biofilm P uptake capacity (PUC) as a tool to detect effects of pollutants on river self-depuration. PUC was calculated by measuring P temporal decay after performing controlled P-spikes in chambers with biofilm-colonized tiles. Four different experiments were conducted to evaluate the response of PUC to: (a) several river waters from increasing polluted sites; (b) the effect of the bactericide triclosan (TCS); (c) the combined effect of TCS and grazers; and (d) the effect of TCS after a drought episode that affected the biofilms. These experiments showed that biofilms decreased their PUC along the pollution gradient. The biofilm PUC was significantly reduced after receiving high TCS concentrations, though lower TCS concentrations also affected the biofilm when this was submitted to grazing pressure. PUC decrease was induced by flow interruption which further enhanced the TCS negative effects. Overall, PUC was sensitive to the effects of pollutants like TCS as well as to the action of biological (grazing) and environmental (drought) factors. The study also showed that multiple stressors enhance the negative effects of pollutants on the PUC of biofilms. Our study values the use of biofilms' PUC as a sensitive ecological-based tool to assess the effects of chemicals on freshwater communities and their derived functioning in river ecosystems.

We evaluated PO43-, as soluble reactive P (SRP), and NH4+ uptake in 2 chronically enriched Pampean streams with different macrophytic abundance. We performed short-term nutrient additions to quantify SRP and NH4+ uptake metrics throughout the year, and we investigated which hydrological and biological factors influenced nutrient uptake. The results showed that SRP and NH4+ uptakes were high in relation to pristine and impaired streams elsewhere, and they did not saturate despite elevated background nutrient levels. NH4+ areal uptake rate fit in a 1st-order uptake model, but an exponential model described the relationship between SRP areal uptake rate and SRP concentration. Consistent with this finding, SRP uptake velocity tended to increase linearly, and SRP uptake length decreased linearly with SRP concentration. The analysis of factors influencing uptake metrics suggested that SRP uptake mainly depended on heterotrophic demand, whereas NH4+ uptake was enhanced under more autotrophic conditions. Our results showed that nutrient uptake metrics of enriched Pampean streams were similar to those observed in streams with low nutrient levels.

J	Mackintosh, TJ; Davis, JA; Thompson, RM				Mackintosh, Teresa J.; Davis, Jenny A.; Thompson, Ross M.			The effects of urbanization on trophic relationships in constructed wetlands	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Constructed stormwater wetlands are one strategy for mitigating the negative effects of urbanization on aquatic ecosystems. However, the biotic community in these wetlands generally is dominated by organisms able to tolerate poor water quality. Reduced macroinvertebrate diversity and abundance in comparison to natural wetlands, and prevalence of invasive species, such as Gambusia, can influence the flow of energy through food webs. We used stable -isotope analysis (813C and 8'5N) of food webs to assess whether the amount of catchment urbanization (total imperviousness [imperviousness] = % catchment covered in impervious surfaces) influenced basal resources and trophic relationships in constructed wetlands in Melbourne, Australia. As imperviousness increased, the abundance and diversity of macroinvertebrates decreased significantly and the values of 813C and 815N recorded for fishes and macroinvertebrates increased significantly. An increase in imperviousness was associated with a decrease in the mean trophic position of fishes and an increase in the mean trophic position of macroinvertebrates. Our results suggest that sources of C differed between sites of low and high imperviousness and that N sources increased with increasing imperviousness. Our study provides an understanding of the likely consequences of disturbance associated with urbanization on the foodweb structure of constructed wetlands.																	2161-9549	2161-9565				MAR	2017	36	1					138	150		10.1086/690674								WOS:000394633500012

FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Current freshwater biomonitoring with diatoms is based on microscopic examination of the morphology of their silica skeleton. This standardized approach is time consuming and requires a high degree of taxonomic expertise. Metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has great potential for next-generation biomonitoring applications but requires standardization. Molecular inventories are strongly influenced by the DNA extraction method used, but the effect of extraction protocols has not been tested to enable selection of the best DNA extraction method for HTS metabarcoding. We used 5 DNA extraction methods combining various types of cell lysis and DNA purification to extract DNA from 8 pure diatom cultures and 8 samples from streams and lakes with differing water quality. We compared the methods based on: 1) quality and purity of the extracted DNA, 2) community inventories obtained from HTS targeting the ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) barcode, and 3) similarity between molecular and microscopy-based inventories of community composition and the Specific Pollution sensitivity Index [SPI]. A method based on GenEluteTM-LPA had higher extraction efficiency than the 4 commercial kits but had the highest polymerase chain reaction inhibition level. All 5 methods were efficient for HTS, and method did not affect operational taxonomic unit richness. We observed variations in the relative abundance of some taxa within Nitzschia, Amphora, Encyonerna, Gomphonema, and Navicula between 2 of the 5 methods, but method did not affect global diatom community composition or SPI values. SPI values calculated from microscopy-based inventories and molecular inventories based on all 5 extraction methods were strongly correlated. For convenience purposes (high DNA quantity and low cost), we encourage standardization of FITS diatom biomonitoring based on the SA-Gen method.

J	Al-Isawi, R; Ray, S; Scholz, M				Al-Isawi, Rawaa; Ray, Sanak; Scholz, Miklis			Comparative study of domestic wastewater treatment by mature vertical-flow constructed wetlands and artificial ponds	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												This study compares the performance, design and operation variables of two wetland technologies treating domestic wastewater: an experimental artificial pond system and a mature experimental vertical-flow constructed wetland system. The wetland system planted with Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steud. (common reeds) was operated between June 2011 and October 2015, while the pond system was only operated between July 2015 and October 2015. Three different types of ponds were compared: ponds with wastewater; ponds with wastewater and reeds; and ponds with wastewater, reeds and aeration. Findings regarding the performances of mature wetlands showed that the wetland systems improved the water quality except for ortho-phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P), where the treatment performance reduced slightly over time. In general, the aerated pond systems showed better treatment performances in terms of ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N) and PO4-P. Both systems were linked with medium to high levels of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal. The highest COD and SS removals were observed for wetlands in comparison to ponds. Moreover, mature wetlands were better in removing NH4-N and PO4-P than ponds unless the ponds were aerated. The nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration increased in the aerated ponds reflecting the high oxygen availability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our goal is to make a forecast of this parameter in Central Europe's most important river with the use of other, easily measurable water quality parameters (pH, temperature, electrical conductivity and runoff) with the use of linear and nonlinear models. We adapt four models for forecasting dissolved oxygen concentration, namely a Multivariate Linear Regression model, a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network and a General Regression Neural Network model. Data is available for Hungarian sampling locations on River Danube (Mohacs, Fajsz and Gyorzamoly) for the period of 1998-2003. The analysis was performed with four alternative combinations, the models were formulated using data from the period 1998-2002 and a dissolved oxygen forecast was made for 2003. Evaluating model performance with various statistical measures (root mean square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination, and Willmott's index of agreement), we found that nonlinear models gave better results than linear models. In two cases the General Regression Neural Network provided the best performance, in two other cases the Radial Basis Function Neural Network gave the best results. A further goal was to conduct a sensitivity analysis in order to identify the parameter with the highest influence on the performance of the created models. Sensitivity analysis was performed for the combination of all three sampling locations (4th combination) and it was found that for all three neural network models sensitivity analyses showed that pH has the most important role in estimating dissolved oxygen content.

J	Richards, PJ; Williams, NSG; Fletcher, TD; Farrell, C				Richards, Paul J.; Williams, Nicholas S. G.; Fletcher, Tim D.; Farrell, Claire			Can raingardens produce food and retain stormwater? Effects of substrates and stormwater application method on plant water use, stormwater retention and yield	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Raingardens capture and filter urban stormwater using sandy soils and drought-tolerant plants. An emerging question is whether raingardens can also be used as vegetable gardens, potentially increasing their popularity and implementation. A successful vegetable raingarden Will need to both retain stormwater and produce vegetables, despite potential water deficits between rainfall events. To determine whether raingardens can provide this dual functionality, we undertook a greenhouse pot experiment using two different substrates (loamy sand raingarden substrate and potting mix typical of containerised vegetable growing) and two methods of stormwater application ('sub-surface' and 'surface' watering) with the water quantity at each application determined by average Melbourne summer rainfall. Overall, potting mix produced bigger plants (biomass and leaf area) and greater yield than did the loamy sand. Yield effects were variable: tomato yield was unaffected by treatment, bean yield was greatest in potting mix, beetroot yield was greatest with sub-surface watering and parsley yield was greatest with surface watering. Bigger plants also had greater transpiration, which meant that stormwater retention was greatest for parsley and tomato plants growing in potting mix with surface watering. Although, a raingarden with potting mix and surface application of stormwater was optimal for producing food and retaining stormwater under our rainfall regime, potting mix could be problematic due to higher nutrient leaching and breakdown over time. Therefore, we recommend using a mix of loamy sand and potting mix. However, the choice of substrate and watering treatment require trade-offs between yield, stormwater retention and potential implications for water quality and long-term stability of hydraulic properties.

The experiment was performed for 73 days and two treatments were evaluated: plants and control (without plants), with four replicates. Each experimental unit consisted of an 800 L tank, a 40 L conical bottom settling chamber, and a hydroponic bench with 0.4 m(2) of planting area and a capacity for 40 plants. The water from the shrimp tank was pumped continuously to the settling chamber and the overflow was distributed to the channels to irrigate the plants, then returned to the tank by gravity. Tanks were stocked with 250 shrimp m(-3) (1.4 +/- 0.0 g). Shrimp were fed a commercial diet containing 35% crude protein, four times per day. At the end of the experiment, total nitrogen was determined in the shrimp, the plants and the ration, as well as antioxidant activity and total phenolic compounds in Sarcocornia. The water quality remained within the acceptable limits for the culture of marine shrimp. No significant differences were observed in the performance of L. vannamei. The final biomass of shrimp was 2.1 +/- 0.1 kg m(-3), with a survival rate of 73.5 +/- 1.9%, a final average weight of 11.7 +/- 0.4 g, and a feed conversion ratio of 1.7 +/- 0.1. The production of plants was 8.2 +/- 0.3 kg m(-2). The antioxidant activity in S. ambigua was 38.3 +/- 1.3 mu mol TEAC 100 g(-1) FM, which characterizes this species as a functional food. The recovery of nitrogen supplied to the system through the ration was higher in the plants treatment (39.3%) than in the control (31.4%). In the proposed aquaponic system it was possible to produce 2 kg of plants for each kilogram of shrimp, integrating the production of L. vannamei and S. ambigua, and thus improve the use of nutrients in the culture.

J	Zhou, SB; He, YX; Yuan, XZ; Peng, SC; Yue, JS				Zhou, Shangbo; He, Yixin; Yuan, Xingzhong; Peng, Shuchan; Yue, Junsheng			Greenhouse gas emissions from different land-use areas in the Littoral Zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A series of ecological projects, including forest and dike-pond projects, were constructed in the littoral zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) to maintain the ecological safety of this area. Previous ecological designs mainly focused on the functions of ecological engineering for environmental purification, economic value and increased biodiversity. However, the variations in land-use may alter the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), which were ignored in our previous design. In this paper, the carbon sequestration benefits of ecological engineering were evaluated after dynamically monitoring the GHG emissions from different land-use sites during the growing (April-September) and submerged (October-March) seasons. The results showed that CH4 fluxes in the dike-ponds (3.76 CH4-mg m(-2) h(-1)) and rice paddies (6.09 +/- 1.60 mg-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) were significantly higher than those in the natural littoral zone (0.77 +/- 0.27 mg-CH4 m(-2) mg-CH(4)m(-2) h(-1)) and forest project (0.57 +/- 0.31 mg-CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) during the growing season. There were no significant differences in the CO2 fluxes from different land-use sites. The emission of N2O from different land-use sites was low and ranged from -0.02 to 0.07 mg-N2O m(-2) h(-1). The growing season contributed to more than 76% of the cumulative annual GHG emissions. Direct GHG emissions and the carbon sequestration ability of species determined the net carbon sinks in the littoral zone. Net carbon sinks in the forest projects with different understory plant communities showed a small variation, with a range of -2.58 to 3.40 t-CO2 ha(-1) year(-1), but the design of the dike-pond projects should favor species that are positive net carbon sinks, e.g., Sagittaria (19.76 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)) and Canna generalis (16.79 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)), rather than those that are negative net carbon sinks, e.g., Trapa natans (-11.79 t-CO2 ha(-1) y(-1)).

Opportunities for green infrastructure under Ecuador's new legal framework	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Ecuador's new constitution recognizes "rights of nature" and peoples' right to benefit from the environment and natural resources that enhance the Buen Vivir (Quality of Life). The national plan for Buen Vivir calls for spatial planning to guarantee territorial and global environmental sustainability, increase people's safety by minimizing the impact of natural hazards such as floods. Within this context, we analyzed opportunities for green infrastructure in Cuenca (Ecuador's third largest city). We mapped existing green areas and linkages, analyzed the roles of implementing institutions with structured input from 33 government, academic, and industry experts. We found that fragmented authorities and often-contradictory mandates of different agencies prevented optimal management of open-space areas within the city. Moreover, planning efforts within the city of Cuenca are completely disconnected from the rapidly urbanizing peri-urban areas outside the city limits, resulting in missed opportunities for connected green space for wildlife, human recreation, and water quality benefits.

J	Heliweger, FL				Heliweger, Ferdi L.			75 years since Monod: It is time to increase the complexity of our predictive ecosystem models (opinion)	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The complexity of our mechanistic ecosystem (biogeochemical, eutrophication, phytoplankton, water quality) models has not changed substantially since they were developed in the 1970s. Consequently, there is now a large disconnect with contemporary problems (e.g., toxin production), knowledge of biological and ecological processes (e.g., intracellular mechanisms, sediment bed overwintering) and environmental observational technologies (e.g., metatransciptomics). This limits the utility of models for making predictions and supporting management. There are several reasons against increasing complexity, including (a) number of required assumptions, (b) risk of overfitting, (c) higher uncertainty, (d) missing knowledge, (e) lack of observations for calibration and validation and (f) difficulty of developing, running, analyzing and communicating the model. Here I review those arguments and conclude that, for mechanistic, predictive ecosystem modeling, they either do not apply, are not a significant problem in practice or can readily be solved by providing more resources to modelers. Further, a review of these issues leads to the conclusion that more complexity generally increases the predictive skill of a model, because more information is used to constrain it. This can be formulated as a new rule: more in, more out (MIMO). MIMO suggests that more complex models make better predictions, but this should not be adopted as a universal modeling strategy, because in practice, the difficulty associated with developing, understanding and communicating complex models has to be considered. However, those are problems readily solved by more resources and I argue that more funding needs to be made available to develop complex ecosystem models.																	0304-3800	1872-7026				FEB 24	2017	346						77	87		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2016.12.001								WOS:000393248900008						
J	Elledge, A; Thornton, C				Elledge, Amanda; Thornton, Craig			Effect of changing land use from virgin brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland to a crop or pasture system on sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff over 25 years in subtropical Australia	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Native vegetation has been extensively cleared for agricultural systems worldwide, resulting in increased pollutant loads that often have adverse impacts downstream. This study uses 25 years of flow data and 10 years of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus (total and dissolved) event mean concentrations from paired catchments to quantify the effect of changing land use from virgin brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) woodland in a semi-arid subtropical region of Australia into an unfertilised crop or conservatively grazed pasture system. Both the cropped and grazed catchments exported higher loads of sediment and phosphorus than the virgin brigalow catchment; however, the grazed catchment exported less total, oxidised and dissolved nitrogen than the virgin brigalow catchment. The cropped catchment exported higher loads of all water quality parameters compared to the grazed catchment. The simple hydrology and water quality model presented was effective for measuring the effect of land use change on runoff water quality. Variations in water quality between the three catchments are likely due to the presence of native legumes, ground cover, tillage practices and pasture rundown.

Sequential fractionation was used to investigate accumulation and distribution of phosphorus in the soil profile to 100 cm (0-7.5, 7.5-15,1525, 25-50, 50-75, 75-100 cm) under fertilized and grazed pasture. The trial site had received annual superphosphate fertilizer inputs at different rates (0, 188 and 376 kg superphosphate ha(-1) year control, 188PA and 376PA, respectively) for 57 years. While there was significant accumulation of total phosphorus in the topsoil (0-7.5 cm), no corresponding differences were observed in organic or residual (non-extracted) phosphorus between treatments. However, fractionation data showed that inorganic forms of phosphorus were significantly higher in the 376PA treatment for all soil depths to 50 cm compared with the other treatments. Furthermore, the relative magnitude and significance of differences between the 376PA and other treatments in soil to 50 cm were greater for readily-soluble inorganic phosphorus (NaHCO3 and NaOH I extractable) compared with more recalcitrant inorganic phosphorus (HCl and NaOH II extractable). As such, phosphorus applied in excess of agronomic requirements and soil retention capacity was transferred below the topsoil and root zone by leacing, and most of the transfer of phosphorus was in readily-soluble inorganic forms. This presents an enhanced risk of elevated phosphorus transfer to groundwater with associated adverse impacts on water quality under fertilized and irrigated pastures. Our findings highlight the need to carefully assess and manage fertilizer phosphorus inputs in accordance with agronomic demand and soil retention capacity to minimize downward phosphorus movement and phosphorus transfer to water bodies.

Integrated assessment of agricultural nutrient pressures and legacies in karst landscapes	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Landscapes typically deemed at risk from leached losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are those with short subsurface hydrologic time lags. Due to the short time it takes nutrients to move from a source to an area of concern, such sites are deemed perfect to test the efficacy of programmes of measures as management changes. However, a small subset of these sites can retain nutrients in soil/subsoil layers, which in turn are leached and can be either attenuated (e.g. nitrate converted to gaseous forms or immobilised in soil and P can be mineralised) or mobilised over time. This biogeochemical time lag can have long lasting effects on water quality. In an intensive agricultural karst oxidised aquifer setting, the aim of this study was to improve understanding of P and N inputs, retention, attenuation and subsurface pathway distribution and to inform how similar sites can be managed in the future. This was undertaken for the present site by integrating existing secondary and new primary datasets for both N and P. Results showed that in the years pre-2000 slurry from an on-site integrated pig production unit had been applied at rates of 33 t ha(-1) annually, which supplied approximately 136 kg ha(-1) total N and approximately 26 kg ha(-1) total P annually. This practice contributed to large quantities of N (Total N and NH4-N) and elevated soil test P (Morgan extractable P), present to a depth of 1 m. This store was augmented by recent surpluses of 263 kg N ha(-1), with leached N to groundwater of 82.5 kg N ha(-1) with only 2.5 kg N ha(-1) denitrified in the aquifer thereafter. High resolution spring data showed greatest percentage loss in terms of N load from small (54-88%) and medium fissure pathways (7-21%) with longer hydrologic time lags, with smallest loads from either large fissure (1-13%) or conduit (1-10%) pathways with short hydrologic time lags (reaction time at the spring from onset of a rainfall event is within hours). Although soils were saturated in P and in mobile forms to 0.5 m, dissolved reactive P concentrations in groundwater remained low due to Ca and Mg limestone chemistry. Depletion of the legacy store with no further inputs (taking 25% of available mass of soil organic N as available in 1 m of soil/subsoil to be 75 kg N ha(-1)) would take approximately 50 years, with NO3-N concentrations in the source area dropping to levels that could sustain groundwater NO3-N concentrations below admissible levels within 9 years. Biogeochemical time lags (decades) are longer than hydrologic time lags on this site (months to years). Future management should target farm surpluses that maintain a legacy store at or below a soil organic N mass of 20 kg N ha(-1). Incorporation of biogeochemical and hydrologic time lag principles into future water quality regulations will provide regulators with realistic expectations when implementing policies.

J	Zhang, CF; Li, S; Jamieson, RC; Meng, FR				Zhang, Chengfu; Li, Sheng; Jamieson, Rob C.; Meng, Fan-Rui			Segment-based assessment of riparian buffers on stream water quality improvement by applying an integrated model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												As Best Management Practices, Riparian buffers are crucial to reduce pollutant loadings from upland area to streams. While fixed-width riparian buffer zones are relatively simple to be designed and implemented, variable-width buffer zones have the benefit to protect biogeochemical and ecological functions of riparian zones. With the variation of width, vegetation type, and topography, the filtering function of the riparian buffers could be varied from segment to segment along a stream. The developed REMM-SWAT interface could be used to assess riparian buffer zones at a segment level. This interface could obtain characteristics of each buffer segment and generate upland water and pollutants input, simulated with SWAT model, for each segment. From the modelling, the contribution of each segment in reducing sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus varied drastically from one to another. The maximum reduction of runoff, sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus for unit riparian buffer length was 3.83 mm m-1 yr-1, 202.4 kg m-1 yr-1, 1.01 kg m-1 yr-1, and 132.49g m-1 yr-1, respectively. The minimum reduction of these pollutants was zero as there was no buffer drainage area for some buffer segments. As riparian buffers have numerous functions, the design of the buffers should comprehensively consider each of its function. This developed software could be applied as an assistant tool with other riparian buffer tools for varied-species and width riparian buffer zones design. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	McLaughlin, DB; Reckhow, KH				McLaughlin, Douglas B.; Reckhow, Kenneth H.			A Bayesian network assessment of macroinvertebrate responses to nutrients and other factors in streams of the Eastern Corn Belt Plains, Ohio, USA	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Over the past several years, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has urged states to adopt numeric nutrient criteria to protect water quality. In a number of states, new numeric nutrient criteria have incorporated both a nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) criterion and a biological endpoint (e.g., chlorophyll a in lakes or benthic macroinvertebrates in streams). While the causal relationship between nutrient levels and chlorophyll in lakes is well-established, quantifying causal relationships between nutrients, chlorophyll a, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities in rivers and streams has been more elusive. This is especially true in highly agricultural ecoregions of the upper midwest United States where a number of confounding factors may be present. Predictive relationships derived from field collected data can provide important support for setting numeric criteria and identifying management alternatives that can achieve and sustain water quality goals. In this paper, we examine the empirical basis for a causal relationship between nutrients, chlorophyll, and benthic macroinvertebrates in the context of other potential macroinvertebrate stressors in a highly agricultural region. We developed a Bayesian network (BN) model for the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT) present in streams of the Eastern Corn Belt Plains Ecoregion of Ohio using Ohio Environmental Protection Agency data collected over roughly a decade (2005-2013). For the data evaluated in this study, useful relationships between nutrients, chlorophyll a, and EPT were not found. An alternative BN model including total Kjeldahl nitrogen with habitat quality and dissolved oxygen appeared to reflect stronger causal influences on this indicator of stream macroinvertebrate quality. However, the predictive power of the BN was relatively low, suggesting that other factors not accounted for in the model may contribute significantly to EPT taxa abundance in these streams.

To investigate the causes and to examine the underlying mechanisms, a two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model was developed. The model reflected the interactions between nutrients, phytoplankton and zooplankton. Moreover, it can be utilized to describe seasonal and regional water quality changes. The two-dimensional hydraulic model was set up using Navier-Stokes equations and was calculated by applying the finite volume method. The Bayesian method was employed to calibrate the model parameters and obtain the parameter posterior distribution. The two-dimensional hydraulic information and the parameter posterior distribution were utilized to calculate a two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication model, for which the 95% confidence interval (uncertainty bounds which can provide the trend and range for water quality changes) and mean value of every water quality index (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate, Chl. a and dissolved oxygen) were simulated. Comparisons between the model simulations and the field data indicated that the models were able to calculate the hydrodynamic information and the eutrophication dynamics with reasonable accuracy (all the relative errors lower than 11%). The simulated concentrations of water quality indexes (nitrate, ammonia, phosphate and Chl. a.) in the vicinity of the lake were higher than that in the middle of the lake during the simulation period, indicating that the nutrient load of the rainwater runoff had significant impacts on algal blooms and water quality. Therefore, the urban lake was vulnerable to the influence of rainwater runoff. To reduce the eutrophication risk, rainwater runoff needs to be controlled. Two-dimensional uncertainty eutrophication models, such as those used in this study, can provide a powerful management tool that will continue to improve prediction reliability.

J	Fanesi, A; Wagner, H; Wilhelm, C				Fanesi, Andrea; Wagner, Heiko; Wilhelm, Christian			Phytoplankton growth rate modelling: can spectroscopic cell chemotyping be superior to physiological predictors?	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Climate change has a strong impact on phytoplankton communities and water quality. However, the development of robust techniques to assess phytoplankton growth is still in progress. In this study, the growth rate of phytoplankton cells grown at different temperatures was modelled based on conventional physiological traits (e.g. chlorophyll, carbon and photosynthetic parameters) using the partial least square regression (PLSR) algorithm and compared with a new approach combining Fourier transform infrared-spectroscopy and PLSR. In this second model, it is assumed that the macromolecular composition of phytoplankton cells represents an intracellular marker for growth. The models have comparable high predictive power (R-2 > 0.8) and low error in predicting new observations. Interestingly, not all of the predictors present the same weight in the modelling of growth rate. A set of specific parameters, such as non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) and the quantum yield of carbon production in the first model, and lipid, protein and carbohydrate contents for the second one, strongly covary with cell growth rate regardless of the taxonomic position of the phytoplankton species investigated. This reflects a set of specific physiological adjustments covarying with growth rate, conserved among taxonomically distant algal species that might be used as guidelines for the improvement of modern primary production models. The high predictive power of both sets of cellular traits for growth rate is of great importance for applied phycological studies. Our approach may find application as a quality control tool for the monitoring of phytoplankton populations in natural communities or in photobioreactors.																	0962-8452	1471-2954				FEB 8	2017	284	1848							20161956	10.1098/rspb.2016.1956								WOS:000393750000003

These extreme events can alter typical biogeochemical patterns in coastal systems. The extreme Elbe River flood in June 2013 not only caused major damages in several European countries but also generated large-scale biogeochemical changes in the Elbe estuary and the adjacent German Bight. The high-frequency monitoring network within the Coastal Observing System for Northern and Arctic Seas (COSYNA) captured the flood influence on the German Bight. Data from a FerryBox station in the Elbe estuary (Cuxhaven) and from a FerryBox platform aboard the M/V Funny Girl ferry (traveling between Busum and Helgoland) documented the salinity changes in the German Bight, which persisted for about 2 months after the peak discharge. The Elbe flood generated a large influx of nutrients and dissolved and particulate organic carbon on the coast. These conditions subsequently led to the onset of a phytoplankton bloom, observed by dissolved oxygen supersaturation, and higher than usual pH in surface coastal waters. The prolonged stratification also led to widespread bottom water dissolved oxygen depletion, unusual for the southeastern German Bight in the summer.

Feeding competition between the native oyster Crassostrea virginica and the invasive mussel Mytella charruana	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The sub-tropical mussel Mytella charruana has been reported as invasive along the southeast coast of the USA since 1986. This mussel has been found to negatively impact the keystone species in its invaded range, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. To date, however, no mechanism for this negative impact has been determined. To elucidate the role of the invasive mussel on economically important oyster reefs, we compared the feeding of both species in a lagoon along the east coast of Florida (USA). Three different methodologies were used: (1) in situ filter-feeding experiments using the biodeposition method to estimate feeding behavior; (2) laboratory assays to estimate the depletion of bacterial particles using a flow cytometer; and (3) stable isotope analysis in conjunction with ellipse-based metrics to investigate the niche size and overlap of these 2 species. The in situ filter-feeding experiments revealed that, compared to C. virginica, M. charruana had significantly higher clearance, filtration, rejection, organic ingestion, and ab sorption rates, as well as higher rejection percentage and absorption efficiency, but rejected the same amount of inorganic particles. Flow cytometry data suggested that bacteria were a food source for both bivalve species. Stable isotope values confirmed that M. charruana and C. virginica filled similar functional niches in this ecosystem. These results suggest that M. charruana can out-compete native oysters; the findings also demonstrate that an invasion of M. charruana might significantly alter plankton abundance, potentially limiting food sources available to other less efficient native filter-feeders such as clams.																	0171-8630	1616-1599				FEB 3	2017	564						57	66		10.3354/meps11976								WOS:000400661400005

Effects of organic pollution on environmental conditions and the phytoplankton community in the central Lebanese coastal waters with special attention to toxic algae	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Organic pollution is a major global environmental issue for coastal ecosystems. In order to assess the effects of this pollution, environmental parameters and phytoplankton community were monitored during a two-year period (from April 2010 till March 2012) in the central coast of Lebanon in the Levantine Sub-basin. Data were collected for temperature, salinity, nutrients, chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton community. Temperature followed its normal seasonal and annual cycles, usually noted in the Lebanese coastal waters, whereas salinity varied spatially and temporally presenting sometimes low values due to continental inputs (19.07-39.6). Significant fluctuations of nutrients (N-NO2 = 0.004-4.28 mu M L-1; N-NO3 = 0.25-39.15 mu M L-1; P-PO4 = 0.014-5.77 mu M L-1), Chl-a concentrations (0.03-8.9 mg/m(3)) and density of total phytoplanktonic cells (40383-22.10(6) cells/L) were observed between the sites and through the years (P < 0.05). Environmental conditions were largely influenced by continental inputs. A perturbation of the natural phytoplanktonic succession and an occurrence of toxic or potentially harmful algae were noticed in the polluted sites, reflecting the influence of wastewater effluents on the coastal seawater equilibrium and thus on the Lebanese marine biodiversity. The overall study provides a good outline on the prevailing condition of few coastal areas which could facilitate the management of their pollution sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we examined three sandy disturbed beaches (including two artificial beaches) on three different sides of the island (artificial Ginowan Tropical Beach on the west coast, artificial Azama San-san Beach on the east coast, public Odo John Man Beach on the south coast) to investigate if differences exist in the environment and crustacean biota between paired disturbed and natural beaches. We conducted seasonal surveys (n = 4 surveys) by placing quadrats at three paired locations (artificial/disturbed and natural beaches at each location, to collect and record the diversity of infaunal crustacean (isopods and amphipods) taxa. Amphipods and isopods are basal parts of the food chain and therefore many marine creatures' diets contain them directly or indirectly, and they have been used in many studies as bioindicators. As well, environmental parameters including sand grain size, water temperature, and seawater quality (salinity, dissolved oxygen content, particulate organic matter, turbidity, conductivity, pH, phosphate, nitrite, nitrate, ammonium levels) were obtained from each site during each survey. The results showed that while water nutrients, sand composition, and water quality were very similar between paired disturbed and natural beaches, disturbed beaches had significantly less biodiversity. These results show that despite no obvious effects on water nutrients or quality, disturbed and artificial beaches influence the infaunal crustacean biodiversity/community in the classic manner of a disturbance. Furthermore, our results indicate that amphipods may be better indicators of disturbance compared to isopods, as the numbers of isopods were too low to be used in statistically robust analyses. With increasing tourism and corresponding development of artificial beaches in Okinawa Island, it is clear more research needs to be done on this subject. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The system consisted of a vertical subsurface flow (VSF) CW, a free water surface (FWS) CW, and a horizontal subsurface flow (HSF) CW in series. Results from six-year operation showed that the system resulted in average removal efficiencies of 70%, 70%, 34%, 52%, 45%, 74%, 21%, 43%, and 98% for COD, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, TP, TSS, F-, Ni, and E. coli, respectively. Especially, NH4-N was effectively removed by the VSF CW. With relatively high hydraulic loading rates (18.0-43.6 cm d(-1)) and short hydraulic retention times (1.04-2.51 d), the removal efficiencies of the system were quite stable for most of the water quality parameters, while the removal efficiency of TN increased from 49% to 60% during the six years. The removal efficiencies of the system were generally stable with the change of seasons. This study demonstrates that the VSF + FWS + HSF CW system can be a valuable approach for advanced wastewater treatment to meet the more stringent discharge requirement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abiotic habitat thresholds for salmonid over-summer survival in intermittent streams	ECOSPHERE												Intermittent streams lose surface flow during part of the year but can provide important habitat for imperiled fishes in residual pools. However, extended intermittency can drive high mortality as pool contraction decreases pool quality, and some pools dry completely. We evaluated the influence of a suite of abiotic habitat characteristics on the over-summer survival of two imperiled salmonid fishes (coho salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch; steelhead trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) at four study sites on two tributaries of Salmon Creek (Sonoma County, California, USA) from 2012 to 2014, during deepening drought conditions. Study sites spanned an intermittency gradient from continuous flow to near-dry conditions, and included alluvial and bedrock stream reaches. We estimated over-summer survival at the pool scale from fish presence-absence data based on paired early-late summer snorkel surveys. We measured pool dimensions and water quality parameters monthly (more frequently during summer dry down) and, in 2013 and 2014, recorded water quality with continuous loggers in selected pools. We performed: (1) logistic regression in a generalized linear modeling framework to identify factors limiting over-summer survival and (2) classification trees using the random forests ensemble learning method to identify abiotic thresholds for sustaining sal-monids. Results suggested that different factors governed mortality of the two species. Coho salmon, which tended to survive in large, deep pools, were limited by minimum dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In contrast, steelhead trout, which tended to survive in pools with large surface area, were sensitive to pool geometry and temperature. Both species persisted for weeks in large pools with low DO levels, including in pools where at least part of the water column reached sublethal or lethal levels. Our results suggest that shallow, lateral hyporheic flow may be important for maintaining DO and temperatures suitable for sustaining salmonids in isolated pools, whereas groundwater discharge originating from deeper flow paths may generate low-DO conditions that inhibit salmonid persistence. Geomorphically complex watersheds with a variety of pool geometries and high rates of lateral hyporheic exchange are those most likely to serve as "sanctuary reaches" for imperiled Pacific salmonid populations in semi-arid regions in the context of a changing climate.

This study assessed preferences for provisioning, regulating, and supporting ecosystem services, specifically, climate regulation (carbon sequestration), nutrient control (water quality), and agricultural and forest productivity, and the willingness to pay for protection of these ecosystem services by residents in the Suwannee River Basin of Florida, as assessed through a household mail survey and choice experiment. A conditional logit model was used to evaluate preferences and marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) under different scenarios. Survey respondents identified nutrient control (water quality) as the most important service, while agricultural and forestry production was somewhat important, and climate regulation/carbon sequestration was the least important. Respondents expressed the highest level of trust in local government agencies to implement ecosystem service protection programs, and welcomed the implementation of such programs anywhere in the basin, but not close to their home. The average MWTP was extremely low ( < $2/household/year) when compared to other studies, and suggests that respondents have many competing interests for their discretionary spending in relation to environmental amenities.																	2212-0416					FEB	2017	23						228	237		10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.12.015								WOS:000396986200022

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Denitrification within Depressional Wetlands of the Southeastern US Coastal Plain in an Agricultural Landscape	WETLANDS												Carolina Bays are depressional wetlands on the Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. These wetlands are often the recipient of nutrient runoff from adjacent agricultural lands and there is potential for production of greenhouse gases during nitrification and denitrification processes occurring in the wetland sediments. Because of their saturated conditions, Carolina Bays may improve regional water quality through denitrification of soil nitrate. Three small bays in South Carolina were selected for denitrification and greenhouse gas analysis. A transect of four points was sampled within each Carolina Bay in May, July, September, and November over a two year period. Gas emissions were measured in-situ using a photoacoustic gas analyzer and soil samples were brought back to the lab for denitrification enzyme activity and microbial analysis. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) averaged 1.8 mg m(-2) d(-1), with a median of 0.47 (with a range of below detectable limits to 9.414 mg m(-2) d(-1)). Many measurement events of N2O were below detection and did not vary within the bays. The carbon dioxide emissions from Carolina Bays averaged 15.8 g m(-2) d(-1) and were largely controlled by temperature. Denitrification enzyme activity had a larger response to nitrate additions further into the bays. Gram + bacteria were also greater deeper into the bays, while Gram- and fungal populations were greater at the field/wetland interface. Manure application had some minor effects on DEA within the bays, but did not appear to increase gas emissions over the period measured.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2017	37	1					33	43		10.1007/s13157-016-0837-5								WOS:000394134600003

Using Land-Use Change, Soil Characteristics, and a Semi-Automated On-Line GIS Database to Inventory Carolina Bays	WETLANDS												Carolina Bay wetlands are common in the southeastern US Coastal Plain and important to water quality, carbon sequestration, and habitat. Only South Carolina and Georgia have statewide inventories. We developed and evaluated a novel way to identify and delineate Bays using Bay-dense Bladen County, NC as a testbed. We posited that Bay land use had changed in the past 40 years and that Bays comprise a small subset of their surrounding soils. We classified decadal Landsat images as forest, agriculture, urban, and water. We used 812 previously delineated Bays to identify common Bay soils. From areas with common Bay soils and land-use change, we identified 548 new Bays and delineated them using a semi-automated on-line digitization tool. We saved new Bays to a Google Fusion Table for download and integration within a GIS. To gauge accuracy, Bays were scored on soils, land-use change, wetland delineation, and landscape position. Potential errors included omission of some small Bays (3.3-14.6 % of total Bay area) and commission of misclassified Bays (11 % of 1360 Bays), an estimated overall accuracy of 74 to 86 %. With 1360 delineated Bays, we estimated that as many as 478 have not yet been identified. These are most likely < 5.76 ha.																	0277-5212	1943-6246				FEB	2017	37	1					89	98		10.1007/s13157-016-0842-8								WOS:000394134600008

Abstraction can alter the hydrological regime of streams and rivers, reduce in-stream habitats, change water quality and affect fluvial communities. It can also impair ecosystem functioning, although this aspect has been seldom assessed. We experimentally tested the effect of water abstraction on stream functioning in a headwater mountain stream using a before and after control-impact (BACI) design. We quantified changes in water physicochemical properties, biofilm biomass and activity (exo-enzymes and metabolism), and ecosystem processes (nutrient cycling, organic matter retention and breakdown). Water abstraction did not affect water physicochemical properties, but reduced the biomass and the alkaline phosphatase activity of biofilm per surface unit, the areal uptake of nutrients, and the travel distance of organic matter. It did not affect the biofilm metabolism and breakdown of submerged leaf litter, but decreased the total breakdown. The impacts were larger when analysed per unit of channel length. All variables, except benthic chlorophyll-a, were significantly reduced by abstraction, due to the contraction of the wetted channel. The decrease in the biomass and activity of biofilm, as well as in nutrient uptake and total organic matter breakdown observed in this study could increase nutrient concentration in downstream reaches and reduce the energy transfer to higher trophic levels. Ecosystem services of permanent headwater streams are likely to be compromised with the reduction of wetted-channel width.

Pelagic phytoplankton community change-points across nutrient gradients and in response to invasive mussels	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Phytoplankton communities can experience nonlinear responses to changing nutrient concentrations, but the nature of species shifts within phytoplankton is not well understood and few studies have explored responses of pelagic assemblages in large lakes. Using pelagic phytoplankton data from the Great Lakes, we assessed phytoplankton assemblage change-point responses to nutrients and invasive Dreissena, characterising community responses in a multi-stressor environment and determine whether species responses to insitu nutrients can be approximated from nutrient loading. We demonstrate assemblage shifts in phytoplankton communities along major stressor gradients, particularly prominent in spring assemblages, providing insight into community thresholds at the lower end of the phosphorus gradient and species-stressor responses in a multi-stressor environment. We show that responses to water nutrient concentrations could not be estimated from large-scale nutrient loading data likely due to lake-specific retention time and long-term accumulation of nutrients. These findings highlight the potential for significant accumulation of nitrates in ultra-oligotrophic systems, nonlinear responses of phytoplankton at nutrient concentrations relevant to current water quality standards and system-specific (e.g. lake or ecozone) differences in phytoplankton responses likely due to differences in nutrient co-limitation and effects of dreissenids.

J	Henry, DAW; Cumming, GS				Henry, Dominic A. W.; Cumming, Graeme S.			Can waterbirds with different movement, dietary and foraging functional traits occupy similar ecological niches?	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Competitive interactions potentially play an important role in structuring bird communities. It is unclear how differences in functional traits influence the niche dimensions of highly mobile waterbird species, particularly when they co-exist in spatiotemporally heterogeneous communities. We investigated the inter-relationships between waterbird trait groupings (movement, dietary and foraging habitat) and environmental variable groupings (rainfall, land cover, vegetation structure and water quality). Specifically, we tested whether the scale of environmental variables filtered movement traits and whether these traits operated in conjunction with dietary and foraging habitat traits to form distinct ecological niches in waterbirds. We conducted waterbird and environmental variable surveys in 60 sites, sampled seven times each at bimonthly intervals, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Trait-environment relationships were tested using a combination of RLQ and fourth-corner analyses. Several significant trait-environment relationships emerged in bivariate correlations and multivariate ordination space. Movement traits correlated with the scale of environmental variables; migrant and nomadic species responded to broad scale environmental variables. Vegetation structure and land cover were particularly important in explaining the abundance of species foraging in emergent vegetation. Three groups emerged along a gradient in multivariate ordination space providing evidence for ecological niche separation of waterbirds with different movement traits. Our findings suggest that the scale of landscape resources can act as a filter of movement traits, and that in conjunction with dietary and foraging traits, waterbirds with different movement traits occupy distinct ecological niches.

J	Jones, TG; Willis, N; Gough, R; Freeman, C				Jones, Timothy G.; Willis, Naomi; Gough, Rachel; Freeman, Chris			An experimental use of floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) to reduce phytoplankton growth in freshwaters	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Eutrophication and the formation of phytoplankton blooms in freshwaters can be detrimental to water quality and biological health and produce organic matter that can be difficult to remove during water treatment processes. With the frequency of phytoplankton blooms increasing, remediation solutions are becoming increasingly popular. This study investigated the use of a peat-based floating treatment wetland (FTW) for reducing phytoplankton growth in eutrophic waters. Over a four-week period, the FTWs were able to reduce chlorophyll a concentrations by 80%, through sequestration of nitrate and phosphate and possibly due to the direct inhibitory properties of phenolic compounds. Although there are concerns about the leaching of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the FTWs, this may be more than offset by the beneficial suppression of phytoplankton growth and the resulting reduced input of `untreatable' low molecular weight DOC.

Ryan			Nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance, retention and uptake in six plant species grown in stormwater bioretention microcosms	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Stormwater runoff contains high levels of nutrients, and is regulated by the Federal National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) to protect surface water quality. Stormwater bioretention (BR) systems are increasingly used to address these regulations. Planted BR systems remove significantly more pollutants than unplanted systems, but most studies do not attempt to verify a pollutant mass balance and seldom evaluate differences in nutrient uptake among species. This greenhouse experiment proved that an overall 98% recovery of Total Phosphorus (TP) mass over the study period was feasible for six plant species, ensuring accuracy of measurements and analyses. Additionally, it was found that Phragmites australis, Carex praegracilis, and Carex microptera uptake significantly more TP and Total Nitrogen (TN) mass into harvestable tissue than Typha latifolia, Scirpus validus, and Scirpus acutus. These results confirm that species selection can optimize nutrient retention and recovery from stormwater and decrease pollutant discharge to surface waters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Plateau lake ecosystem in China is very vulnerable and especially sensitive to environmental change and human disturbance, due to its strong closeness, species simplification, oligotrophy and simple food chain. This research focuses on evaluating the quantitative and spatial relationships of land use pattern and water quality of rivers inflowing to Fuxian Lake, Chinas largest deep freshwater lake in plateau. To investigate the influence of spatial variation in land-use structures and topography on rivers water quality, the distributions of land-use types in the lakes drainage basin were obtained from satellite images, and the correlations between land-use types and inflow water quality indicators were examined by applying statistical analysis and spatial analytical function of Geographic Information System. Subarea-level analysis reveals that a land-use type could exert different effects on water quality in plains and mountains, and the effects had a connection with topographic and hydrologic factors, its mixture with other land-use types, weather conditions during field measurements, as well as its scale. In addition, a comparison of correlation coefficient data for buffer regions of different scales indicated that the effect of land-use type on inflow water quality peaked in buffer regions with a radius between 100 and 200 m. On the whole, the regions within 200 m of river banks were the key regions that affected river water quality, and thus the construction and preservation of a riparian buffer zone in these regions can provide considerable protection from the inputs of non-point source pollutants and nutrients, and important function such as water and soil conservation. Based on these, a pollution control zoning was constructed from two key pollution control zones in the north and south, a phosphate rock pollution control zone in the northeast, a water loss and soil erosion control zone in the east, and a tourism pollution control zone in the west. This research also offers valuable insights into how to carry out subarea-level prevention and control of water pollution and regional development, according to natural environment, land use pattern and characteristics of pollution sources in different pollution control zones.

From this perspective, the sustainability of a water system and its supply to end users may be classified according to the products, services, and energy necessary for its operation, which are incorporated from the corresponding socioeconomic system and form an important aspect of its evaluation. In the present study, the development of a geoinformatics tool with an emergy accounting approach and its corresponding methodology are described, focusing on a spatial-temporal analysis of water resources and their allocation to domestic, industrial, and agricultural uses. In addition, different water provision scenarios that involve several levels of infrastructure in the basin of the Upper Course of the Lerma River (UCLR) are evaluated, and existing water deficits are considered in order to assess their economic impact and offer a perspective on regional environmental sustainability. To achieve this, the water supply processes with the greatest relevance for the UCLR basin are evaluated, which include the extraction of groundwater and the treatment of surface and wastewater for subsequent use. The evaluation of the proposed scenarios indicates that the water supply system where treated water is recycled for agricultural, industrial, and urban uses (with restrictions) has the highest value according to the environmental sustainability index. Beyond this, it is possible to establish a series of strategies to transition from the current scenario where the water supply largely comes from an overexploited aquifer, to one where wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are capable of implementing additional units in their processes to achieve drinking water quality. Finally, the proposed methodology and the geoinformatics tool developed in this study showed their effectiveness as instruments for achieving an integrated management of water resources, which would facilitate a more objective decision making process based on current and projected scenarios.

Impacts of the long-term presence of buried crude oil on salt marsh soil denitrification in Barataria Bay, Louisiana	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Denitrification is typically the dominant process of nitrate removal in coastal wetlands, converting bioavailable N in surface waters into gases released to the atmosphere through microbial respiration. This critical function and valuable ecosystem service performed by soil microbes in coastal wetlands improves water quality and benefits the surrounding ecosystem. Five years after the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a layer of crude oil was found similar to 5 cm beneath the wetland soil surface in Bay Jimmy, LA. While previous research found potential denitrification in coastal wetland soils was significantly reduced immediately following oil exposure, this study sought to investigate the effects of the long-term presence of spilled crude oil on nitrate removal. Intact soil cores were collected from a salt marsh heavily oiled by the DWH spill, and a nearby, non-oiled site in Barataria Bay, LA. The presence of a layer of buried oil increased nitrate removal from the overlying water column, a proxy measure of denitrification, by 31.8% in intact cores compared to non-oiled cores. However, when the oil was thoroughly mixed through the surface soil intervals, there was an 1853% decrease in the rate of denitrification. This seemingly contradictory result demonstrates that oil buried 5 cm below the surface, and not in contact with the newly accreted soil, did not negatively affect areal denitrification rates. However, when oil was in direct contact and well mixed in the soil, denitrifiers in that part of the soil profile are still negatively affected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Condition factor, Length - Weight relationship, and the fishery of Barbus altianalis (Boulenger 1900) in Lakes Victoria and Edward basins of Uganda	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The condition, fishing effort and environmental parameters signify health of fish populations. This study characterized differences in water quality and fishing effort in the lacustrine and riverine systems of the River Nile, Lake Edward and Kazinga channel in Uganda. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences in mean relative condition among populations in the water bodies exposed to different levels of fishing effort and water quality conditions. There were significant differences in the mean relative condition (K-n) of Barbus altianalis between River Nile (mean dif 0.0880, P < 0.004) and Lake Edward and between River Nile and Kazinga channel (mean dif. 0.0796, P < 0.001). No significant difference in the mean relative condition between Kazinga channel and Lake Edward (mean diff. 0.0840, P < 0.95). Lake Edward had the highest condition (1.05), while Kazinga channel and River Nile had 1.04 and 0.96 respectively. The relationship between weight and length for each population, obtained by pooling individuals across systems was significant (P < 0.001), the length-weight allometry between the populations was also significantly different (F (2, 237) = 9.73, P < 0.001). River Nile had the highest number of fishers of 311 +/- 0.88 while the number of fishers in Lake Edward and Kazinga channel were 75 +/- 2.45 and 33 +/- 9.12, respectively. Catch rates varied between River Nile (1.92 +/- 0.59 Kg boat(-1) day(-1)) and the rest of the systems, 6.20 +/- 1.86 and 6.85 +/- 1.49 Kg boat(-1) day(-1) in Lake Edward and Kazinga channel respectively. Water quality varied greatly across all the water bodies. Dissolved oxygen was below the minimum of 5 mgl(-1) required for the physiology of freshwater fish. Conductivity was highest in Lake Edward (312 A mu S cm(-1)), followed by Kazinga channel and least in River Nile. The consistent variation in condition, fishing effort and water quality, indicates differential selective pressures faced by B. altianalis in the systems and therefore calls for concerted efforts for appropriate management measures.

A modeling approach to determining the relationship between vegetative filter strip design and sediment composition	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are areas of either planted or indigenous established vegetation designed to improve the quality of surface runoff. They can be incorporated into pastures, grassed waterways, terraces, or cropland to remove sediment, nitrogen, or phosphorus from runoff. However, their trapping efficiencies depend mainly on the sediment characteristics. The finer soil particles pass through the filter more easily and have more surface area, accounting for most of the transported sediment-bound pollutants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to use a modeling approach to develop a Sediment Composition Vegetative Filter Strip (SCVFS) model to predict the clay, silt and sand trapping efficiencies of VFS based on a wide range of soil loss data from Central Chile. The physically based Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was implemented using actual soil and climate data from Central Chile to generate a soil loss database for many VFS designs. More than 22,000 erosibn events were generated with data from 28 sites. Three nonlinear relationships were developed between clay, silt and sand delivery and VFS length. The clay and silt models provided accurate estimates compared to WEPP for the calibration (R-2 = 0.80-0.87) and validation (R-2 = 0.73-0.80) sites. However, the sand estimates were not correlated to WEPP (R-2 = 0.00-0.18), as the model computes sand using the difference between the total predicted sediments (R-2 = 0.77-0.89) and the clay and silt estimates. Nevertheless, because most of the sediment-bound pollutants move with the finer sediments, this is not a modeling limitation. Compared to other physically based VFS models, the SCVFS model is remarkably easy to use because it only requires the characteristics of the sediment delivery when there is no filter, the rainfall erosivity and the hillslope and filter lengths. Additionally, it can be easily combined with many existing erosion models that provide daily soil loss estimates, making it a flexible VFS design tool. This study provides the detailed methodology to construct this model and discusses its advantages and limitations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Meteorological drivers of hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Oxygen concentration is both an indicator and driver of water quality in lakes. Decreases in oxygen concentration leads to altered ecosystem function as well as harmful consequences for aquatic biota, such as fishes. The responses of oxygen dynamics in lakes to climate-related drivers, such as temperature and wind speed, are well documented for lake surface waters. However, much less is known about how the oxic environment of bottom waters, especially the timing and magnitude of anoxia in eutrophic lakes, responds to changes in climate drivers. Understanding how important ecosystem states, such as hypolimnetic anoxia, may respond to differing climate scenarios requires a model that couples physical-biological conditions and sufficiently captures the density stratification that leads to strong oxygen gradients. Here, we analyzed the effects of changes in three important meteorological drivers (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) on hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake using the anoxic factor as an index that captures both the temporal and spatial extent of anoxia. Air temperature and relative humidity were found to have a positive correlation with anoxic factor, while wind speed had a negative correlation. Air temperature was found to have the greatest potential impact of the three drivers on the anoxic factor, followed by wind speed and then relative humidity. Across the scenarios of climate variability, variation in the simulated anoxic factor was primarily due to changes in the timing of onset and decay of stratification. Given the potential for future changes in climate, especially increases in air temperature, this study provides important insight into how these changes will alter lake water quality.

Transport and transformation of nutrients and sediment in two agricultural watersheds in Northeast Arkansas	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Understanding pollutant transport at different spatial and temporal scales is crucial to agroecosystems management and planning. This study aimed to reduce the knowledge gap between edge-of-field and larger agricultural watersheds. Nutrients and sediment transport and transformation at two small agricultural watersheds, Little River Ditches Basin (LRDB) and Lower St. Francis Basin (LSFB), in Northeast Arkansas, were evaluated. Flow, nutrients, and sediment were measured at 3-5 instream locations in these two contrasting watersheds. These watersheds differed in primary crop, soil type, and size. Differences in sediment and nutrients loads were measured between the two watersheds primarily due to differences in cropping practices and soil type. LSFB was dominated by rice farms and had more pollutant load per unit area but lower concentrations for all measured parameters except nitrate, whereas LRDB was dominated by cotton farms and had less pollutant load per unit area but higher concentrations. Turbidity increased considerably at LSFB, but it did not increase or decrease at LRDB as water traveled downstream. The median nitrate-N concentration at LRDB increased from 1.64 to 2.34 mg L-1 as watershed size increased, in contrast to no increase at LSFB. Total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations remained constant, but ammonium-N decreased as the water traveled downstream in both watersheds. Nitrate-N were high in spring and late fall at both watersheds. The annual loss of nitrate-N was 9.6 and 8.6 kg ha(-1), sediment was 1604 and 1958 kg ha(-1), and SRP was 0.8 and 0.9 kg ha(-1), respectively from LRDB and LSFB. Source control in spring and late fall could be more effective in reducing agricultural pollution.

Agricultural land use and macroinvertebrate assemblages in lowland temporary streams of the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Streams that dry during part of the year are common throughout the world, yet studies of the macroinvertebrate assemblages in these types of streams are rare compared to those in permanent streams; and studies that assess the effects of agriculture on temporary stream invertebrates are even rarer. We studied macroinvertebrate assemblages in lowland temporary streams of a region with high agricultural land use, the southern Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. Overall assemblages were dominated by non-insects, and invertebrates tolerant of organic pollution. Nonetheless, these invertebrates displayed adaptations to life in temporary habitats, and as such they may be unique to temporary streams and seasonal wetlands, providing an important addition to regional biodiversity. Stream invertebrates are also important as a prey base for native fish and amphibians using these channels. Benthic invertebrate densities were higher at sites with slower water and more in-stream vegetation; to a lesser degree greater agricultural land use was associated with lower densities. Taxon richness was also negatively affected by agriculture, but this was most evident when least disturbed and highly agricultural sites were compared. Sites in watersheds with a lower proportion of their area under agriculture (mostly west of the Willamette River) had a variety of taxa in disturbance-sensitive insect orders Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT), plus flies in the family Simuliidae present. In addition, they had greater relative abundances of 2 types of flies in the family Chironomidae. In contrast, sites in watersheds with high agricultural land use (mainly east of the Willamette River) had greater relative abundances of non insects, including ostracods, nematodes, and oligochaete worms. In highly agricultural watersheds, when stream-bottom vegetation was abundant, it was associated with greater benthic invertebrate density, but not with higher taxon richness. Our results suggest that increasing stream-bottom vegetation could be useful when food is limiting for native vertebrates. On the other hand, reduced agricultural land use allows for the development of more diverse benthic invertebrate assemblages. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Time lag may therefore, impede the achievement of remediation deadlines such as those described in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Omitting time lag from catchment characterisation renders evaluation of management practices impossible. Time lag aside, regulators at national scale can only manage the expectations of policy makers at larger scales (e.g. European Union) by demonstrating positive nutrient trajectories in catchments failing to achieve at least 'good' status. Presently, a flexible tool for developing spatial and temporal estimates of trends in water quality/nutrient transport and time lags is not available. The objectives of the present study were first to develop such a flexible, parsimonious framework incorporating existing soil maps, meteorological data and a structured modelling approach, and to secondly, to demonstrate its use in a grassland and an arable catchment (similar to 10 km(2)) in Ireland, assuming full implementation of measures in 2012. Data pertaining to solute transport (meteorology, soil hydraulics, depth of profile and boundary conditions) were collected for both catchments. Low complexity textural data alone gave comparable estimates of nutrient trajectories and time lags but with no spatial or soil series information. Taking a high complexity approach, coupling high resolution soil mapping (1:10,000) with national scale (1:25,000) representative profile datasets to <5 m depth, indicated trends in nutrient transport of 10-12 months and 13-17 months throughout the grassland and arable catchments, respectively. For the same conditions, regulators relying on data from groundwater sampling to test the efficacy of the present measures would be delayed by 61-76 months and 46-79 months, respectively. Variation in meteorological datasets enabled temporal analysis of the trends in nutrient transport and time lag estimates. Such a tool could help catchment scientists to better characterise and manage catchments, determine locations for monitoring or mitigation, assess the efficacy of current measures, and ultimately, advise policy makers and regulators.

REMOVAL OF MICROCYSTIS AERUGINOSA BY CHITOSAN AND ILLITE	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												In recent years, massive water blooms of cyanobacteria occurred in many freshwater lakes and reservoirs, and cause severe water quality problems including scum formation, toxin production, taste and odors, and hypoxia generation. Therefore, a new environmental friendly method was proposed for cyanobacterial bloom mitigation using chitosan and illite. The effects of particle size of illite, addition of illite, addition of chitosan on Microcystis aeruginosa removal was examined through batch experiments. The results showed that the removal efficiency of cyanobacteria had a strong dependence on the changes of particle size of illite, addition of illite, addition of chitosan. The highest removal efficiency, 97.42 %, was obtained under the optimal conditions. This study demonstrated that there were technically viable methods using chitosan and illite to remove M. aeruginosa cells.																	0240-8759						2017	67	3-4					173	177										WOS:000430788900004

Ecosystem restoration: recent advances in theory and practice	RANGELAND JOURNAL					Conference on Restore, Regenerate, Revegetate - Restoring Ecological Processes, Ecosystems and Landscapes in a Changing World	FEB 05-09, 2017	Univ New England, Armidale, AUSTRALIA		Univ New England			Restoration of damaged ecosystems is receiving increasing attention worldwide as awareness increases that humanity must sustain ecosystem structure, functioning, and diversity for its own wellbeing. Restoration will become increasingly important because our planet will sustain an increasingly heavy human footprint as human populations continue to increase. Restoration efforts can improve desirable ecological functioning, even when restoration to a historic standard is not feasible with current practice. Debate as to whether restoration is feasible is coupled to long-standing disputes regarding the definition of restoration, whether more-damaged lands are worthy of restoration efforts given limited financial resources, and ongoing conflicts as to whether the novel ecosystem concept is a help or a hindrance to restoration efforts. A willingness to consider restoration options that have promise, yet would have previously been regarded as 'taboo' based on the precautionary principle, is increasing. Functional restoration is becoming more prominent in the scientific literature, as evidenced by an increased emphasis on functional traits, as opposed to a simple inventory of vascular plant species. Biodiversity continues to be important, but an increasingly expansive array of provenance options that are less stringent than the traditional 'local is best' is now being considered. Increased appreciation for soil health, plant-soil feedbacks, biological crusts, and water quality is evident. In the United States, restoration projects are becoming increasingly motivated by or tied to remediation of major environmental problems or recovery of fauna that are either charismatic, for example, the monarch butterfly, or deliver key ecosystem services, for example, hymenopteran pollinators.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2017	39	5-6			SI		417	430		10.1071/RJ17024								WOS:000423401600003

Riparian and landscape disturbance effects on stream fish community composition in an agriculturally-dominated drainage	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												We compared historical stream fish community sampling and remote sensing data from 1993-2011 in an agriculturally-dominated drainage basin to determine the effects of varying levels of riparian and landscape disturbances on fish communities. Stream fish guilds were analyzed with National Land Cover Database and aerial imagery products to quantify disturbance levels at a local and watershed scale. Insectivores and benthic insectivores were associated with intact riparian areas, whereas environmentally tolerant and omnivorous species were found in environments with degraded riparian areas. Riparian disturbances had the greatest effect near the stream (0-10 m), and the effects diminished with increasing distance from the stream. This spatial scale corresponds with those reported in the literature whereby allocthonous inputs and riparian filtering influenced stream fish communities and water quality. The landscape disturbance was not a strong predictor for any fish guild, indicating that local riparian conditions were more biologically meaningful. Considering the rapid rates of land conversion to production agriculture across the midwestern United States, ensuring adequate riparian buffering of streams may help protect specialist aquatic species and their habitat. Given the broad temporal and spatial nature of our data, these results suggest that targeted conservation of the 10-m scale of intact riparian vegetation directly adjacent to streams is a sound practice and should be considered the minimum conservation goal for watershed restoration in low-gradient landscapes historically dominated by agricultural land-use practices.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	4			SI		445	456		10.1080/14634988.2017.1368831								WOS:000423091000015

Measuring Physical Properties, Plant Development, and Runoff Water Quality	COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION												Six green roof substrate blends were created by using composts sourced from local suppliers and the Michigan State University Student Organic Farm. Bulk density, field capacity, total porosity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity were determined for each substrate and compared to an unamended expanded shale aggregate. Significant differences were detected in all measured physical properties. A plant growth study was conducted in a greenhouse. Ocimum basilicum (basil), Sedum floriforum (sedum), and Carex eburnea (bristleleaf sedge) were grown in a depth of 10 cm of all six substrates for 6 months. The greatest dry shoot masses in bristleleaf sedge and sedum were twice those of the smallest masses. The largest wet harvest of basil was four times greater than the smallest harvest. Runoff water was collected after simulated precipitation events on regular intervals during the plant growth study and analyzed for nitrate and phosphate concentrations. Ion concentrations were greatest on the first measurement date and decreased rapidly with time. Compost selection had a strong impact on initial nitrate and phosphate concentrations, but the influence of compost on concentrations diminished with time. Overall, compost selection was found to have measureable and meaningful impacts on green roof substrate performance.																	1065-657X	2326-2397					2017	25	4					231	241		10.1080/1065657X.2017.1295887								WOS:000423197100003

However, the level of impacts, especially on macroinvertebrates, are not well known, which is the goal of this study. Here, three biotic indices were used. The Saginaw River Basin, the largest watershed in Michigan was selected for this study. Since no know modeling package exists to evaluate the impacts of climate change on these biotic indices, a coupled modeling approach was proposed. First, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was setup to estimate streamflow and water quality for all stream segments. Next, the results from the SWAT model in combination with long-term biological monitoring data were used to develop biotic indices predictive models using a two-phase approach. An assemblage of 42 climate scenarios (2040-2060) were obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which are biased corrected and statistically downscaled. The dataset provides two extreme Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to account for best (RCP 4.5) and worst (RCP 8.5) case scenarios. The climate data were incorporated in SWAT and biotic indices predictive models to understand stream health conditions in the watershed. Results showed that the majority of streams have a probability of declining in values of biotic indices while streams that currently have excellent conditions are the most vulnerable streams to the climate change. This modeling approach provides a new mean to link more strongly biota indicators with flow regime indicators, which is of prime interest for the implementation of ecohydrology principles.

A comparative investigation on the inhibition kinetics of bioaccumulation of As(III) and As(V) ions using Bacillus arsenicus MTCC 4380	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												In the context of global environmental and social change, with increasing pollution and deterioration of biodiversity of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems having its deep roots in radical changes to hydrological mesocycles, there is an urgent requirement for a new approach for sustainability. The ecohydrology concept covers the entire hydrological cycle, including its atmospheric, terrestrial and aquatic phases, and the entire cycle of biological components of the environment playing a vital role as moderators of water quality and quantity. In the present study the simultaneous growth and bioaccumulation of As(III) and As(V) ions of living cells of Bacillus arsenicus MTCC 4380 was studied as a function of pH, inoculum size, concentrations of peptone and arsenic (As(III) or As(V)) ions. Although both As(III) and As(V) ions resulted in an inhibition effect on the growth of the bacteria, B. arsenicus MTCC 4380 was capable of removing. As(III) and As(V) with the maximum bioaccumulation % of 90.43 and 94.31 at 50 mg/L initial arsenic concentration, respectively at pH 7.0 and inoculum size 5% (v/v). As the maximum specific growth rate (mu(m))remained constant and the saturation constant (K '(s,app)) value increased in the presence of increasing concentrations of arsenic ions, the inhibition of As(III) or As(V) ions on the growth rate of B. arsenicus MTCC 4380 was found to be a competitive inhibition. The current investigation provides a new insight into the effect of As(III) and As(V) ions on B. arsenicus MTCC 4380, exclusively with regard to its toxicity, bioaccumulation and bioremediation potential.

In order to test water quality, fabricated reactors designed and the plants cultivated in the soil while their root were inside the wastewater. A long time study carried out from spring till end of autumn (9 months) in order to evaluate the difference in removal rate based on the seasonal changes. The highest removal rate was during summer which followed by spring and autumn. Thus, the effect of plants on the removal efficiency of organic matter (COD, BOD), TSS and nutrient (P and TN) appeared to be dependent on the seasonal growth.

IDENTIFYING THE SOURCE OF POLLUTANTS IN MALACCA RIVER USING GIS APPROACH	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The study was conducted to determine the dominant source of pollutants in Malacca River using the combined methods of water sampling and GIS approach. The study was conducted in 9 sampling stations based on Malacca River sub-basins. The result of WQI indicated that station 4 and 5 are polluted; station 8 and 9 are clean; and other stations are slightly polluted. PCA identified several pollutant sources, namely agricultural, residential, industrial, animal husbandry activities, as well as sewage treatment plants. Applied GIS technique detected several areas as hotspots pollutants sources, namely agricultural activities in station 5; residential activities in station 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7; industrial activities in station 3, 4, 5, and 7; animal husbandry in station 5 and some scatterings in station 1 to 4; as well as sewage treatment plant in moderate hotspot area between station 5 and 6, respectively. Besides the recommendation to reduce the river water pollution through the control of pollutants source, this study provides crucial information for the identification of problematic areas and spatial database of Malacca River for better understanding and management of river water quality in the future, as well as a reference for future land use and urban design development purposes.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					571	588		10.15666/aeer/1504_571588								WOS:000419994800039

APPLICATION OF CA-MARKOV MODEL AND LAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGES IN MALACCA RIVER WATERSHED, MALAYSIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Modeling the effects of past and current land use composition on surface water quality of the Malacca River watershed provides valuable information for environmental and land planning. The Land use land cover (LULC) spatio-temporal changes in watershed are classified as non-industrial area, industrial area, vegetation area, open space area, water bodies, as well as farming area. This is compared with the future spatial pattern simulated using CA-Markov model to evaluate qualitative and quantitative changes of LULC over time (between 2001, 2008, 2015, and 2029). This analysis consisted of the entire Malacca River watershed area. Changes may provide information on determinant of river water quality in future. Based on LULC monitoring and future simulation approach, the results may be used in an early warning system by demonstrating trend and consequences of changes in watershed. Continuous downward trends for vegetation area, open space area, and water bodies are due to expansion in non-industrial area, industrial area, and farming areas that increase contamination in the Malacca River. The findings demonstrate the need for more regulation in land use policy design, planning, and development for the protection of river water quality.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					605	622		10.15666/aeer/1504_605622								WOS:000419994800041

ISOTOPIC (delta C-13 AND delta N-15) VARIATIONS IN TROPICAL RIVER SEDIMENTS OF KELANTAN, MALAYSIA: A RECONNAISSANCE STUDY OF LAND USE IMPACT TO THE WATERSHED	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Intensification of sedimentation process has resulted in shallower river, thus increasing their vulnerability to natural hazards (i.e. climate change, floods). Considering the impact of soil erosion to the sedimentation, identification of the main source of erosion is critical to watershed management. Stable isotope of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) were carried out in Kelantan catchment. Results from delta C-13 showed that C-3 type plant represents as major plant (-29.10% to -23.60%) in the river. While for delta N-15, the isotopic variations demonstrate distinct pattern of dry (Southwest Monsoon, SWM) and wet (Northeast Monsoon, NEM) seasons, suggesting significant pollutants washout from terrestrial (due to agricultural activities) to the water bodies. In addition, the Kelantan river system is an autochthonous as determined by carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio. Essentially, this study will serve as a precursor of future study to understand the impact of anthropogenic activities on carbon and nitrogen cycles in tropical catchment.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					1101	1119		10.15666/aeer/1504_11011119								WOS:000419994800073

The area selected for the study is Mondaikadu of Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India, which is very near to the coast of the Indian Ocean. Groundwater samples were collected during summer, winter and pre-monsoon season and analyzed using analytical instruments. It was observed that the groundwater quality is significantly affected by coconut husk retting process. The pH level in the groundwater was found to be unacceptable because it was below the permissible limit of 6.5 to 9.2 as per the World Health Organization (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). All other parameters such as Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Electrical conductivity (EC), Hardness, Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Sodium (Na), Potassium (K), Ferrous (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Nitrate (NH3), Chloride (Cl), Fluoride (F), Sulphate (SO4) are within the limits. Low pH water was neutralized using addition of Sodium Hydroxide methods (NaoH), addition of soda ash and aeration process. Using correlation analysis, the dependent and independent variables were selected and regression analysis was conducted for these variables and the best fit regression model was created.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	4					1745	1756		10.15666/aeer/1504_17451756								WOS:000419994800111

Managers counteracted the detrimental effects of cultural acidification on aquatic ecosystems during the industrial era using liming to salvage biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, historical contingencies, i.e., whether lakes were naturally acidic or degraded because of acidification, were largely unknown and therefore not accounted for in management. It is uncertain whether liming outcomes had a potentially detrimental effect on naturally acidic lakes. Evidence from paleolimnological reconstructions allowed us to analyze community structure in limed acidified and naturally acidic lakes, and acidified and circumneutral references. We analyzed community structure of phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroinvertebrates (littoral, sublittoral, profundal), and fish between 2000 and 2004. Naturally acidic limed lakes formed communities that were not representative of the other lake types. The occurrence of fish species relevant for ecosystem service provisioning (fisheries potential) in naturally acidic limed lakes were confounded by biogeographical factors. In addition, sustained changes in water quality were conducive to harmful algal blooms. This highlights a pathological outcome of liming lakes when their naturally acidic conditions are not accounted for. Because liming is an important social-ecological system, sustained ecological change of lakes might incur undesired costs for societies in the long term.																	1708-3087						2017	22	4							44	10.5751/ES-09794-220444								WOS:000419351000039

Historically and culturally, cenotes are also important cultural and spiritual natural sites for the Maya, but they have been contaminated and degraded. We ask the following: What are the present-day meanings, understanding, and values of cenotes for the Maya? Is it possible to adopt a cultural approach for conservation of cenotes in Yucatan? Participant observation, interviews with stakeholders, and underwater exploration in cenotes were used to obtain data. Results indicate that cenotes often retain some spiritual meaning for people but not as important cultural, spiritual, or sacred sites. Little consensus was found regarding the significance of cenotes and how best to protect them. Informants noted changes in water quality, and identified the threats to cenotes including tourism, poor solid waste management, contamination, and deficiency of interest in preservation. Lack of accurate knowledge was a problem: informants did not seem to understand that cenotes are interconnected through the groundwater system. The Yucatan case illustrates how loss of cultural values can be linked to environmental quality and resource degradation. Conversely, it can be argued that cultural revitalization in indigenous communities has the potential to bring back community-based conservation.

Adoption of an ES approach requires agency personnel to have knowledge or experience in implementing an ES approach and metrics that link potential actions to impacts on ES. We characterize the degree to which ES considerations are taken into account in setting priorities for conservation acquisitions in the U.S. state of Minnesota. We assess two core dimensions of an ES approach: (1) multiobjective targeting and (2) measuring program benefits in terms of increases in human well-being. We assess the degree to which these two dimensions occur in statute and in conservation program decision making. We find that state statute provides clear support for an ES approach in conservation funding mechanisms. However, we find that many of the programs funded through those mechanisms have more traditional habitat-centric approaches. In contrast to statutory emphasis, water quality related metrics were not prominent. We recommend expanding current prioritization systems to include a broader suite of metrics that are linked to human well-being to further mainstream ES in Minnesota. These metrics can be generated from existing data and would allow program managers to better communicate the public benefits of conservation spending.																	1708-3087						2017	22	4							4	10.5751/ES-09581-220404								WOS:000419351000009

We linked terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem process models to simulate the spatial and temporal distribution of hydrological and water quality characteristics related to ecosystem services. The linked model integrates two existing models (a forest ecosystem model and a river network model) to establish consistent responses to changing drivers across climate, terrestrial, and aquatic domains. The linked model is spatially distributed, accounts for terrestrial-aquatic and upstreamdownstream linkages, and operates on a daily time-step, all characteristics needed to understand regional responses. The model was applied to the diverse landscapes of the Upper Merrimack River watershed, New Hampshire, USA. Potential changes in future environmental functions were evaluated using statistically downscaled global climate model simulations (both a high and low emission scenario) coupled with scenarios of changing land cover (centralized vs. dispersed land development) for the time period of 1980-2099. Projections of climate, land cover, and water quality were translated into a suite of environmental indicators that represent conditions relevant to important ecosystem services and were designed to be readily understood by the public. Model projections show that climate will have a greater influence on future aquatic ecosystem services (flooding, drinking water, fish habitat, and nitrogen export) than plausible changes in land cover. Minimal changes in aquatic environmental indicators are predicted through 2050, after which the high emissions scenarios show intensifying impacts. The spatially distributed modeling approach indicates that heavily populated portions of the watershed will show the strongest responses. Management of land cover could attenuate some of the changes associated with climate change and should be considered in future planning for the region.

Phytoplankton in two tropical mangroves of Sao Tome Island (Gulf of Guinea): A contribution towards sustainable management strategies	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Phytoplankton are important primary producers in tropical coastal lagoons, with a critical role in sustaining food webs. However, most studies conducted in tropical systems with high anthropogenic influence have focused only on biomass. Water samples were collected, for phytoplankton (pigments and microscopy) and other environmental parameters, from two mangrove lagoons in Sao Tome Island. The highest nutrient concentrations were observed in the mangrove of Praia das Conchas, indicating stronger nutrient inputs in this catchment area. Bottom oxygen deficiency was observed in the mangrove of Malanza, which is likely to be associated with the existence of a bridge that constrains the water exchange with the sea. Pigment analyses showed that overall chlorophyll a concentrations were low, indicating low phytoplankton biomass. The highest values were found at Praia das Conchas. It is suggested that chlorophyll a can be used as an indicator of anthropogenic pressure in this tropical system. Microscopy reveales the presence of Dinophysis sp. and Ostreopsis sp. cells, which can be harmful even at low densities. Water quality could be improved by enhancing oxygen condition in Malanza and by monitoring the occurrence of algal blooms, with potential benefits for public health and tourism.

J	Weber, MA; Caplan, S; Ringold, P; Blocksom, K				Weber, Matthew A.; Caplan, Shannon; Ringold, Paul; Blocksom, Karen			Rivers and streams in the media: a content analysis of ecosystem services	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												Although ecosystem services research has become common, few efforts are directed toward in-depth understanding of the specific ecological quantities people value. The theoretical framework of final ecosystem services focuses attention on such measurable attributes, as a common currency for social-ecological systems research. Environmental communications as well as ecological monitoring and analysis efforts could be enhanced through increased documentation of final ecosystem services. For example, small changes in the way ecosystems are described could strongly influence relevance to the public and improve the foundation for environmental decision making. Focusing on rivers and streams, we conducted a content analysis of existing publications to document the breadth and frequency with which various measurable attributes, such as flooding, water quality characteristics, and wildlife appeared in different news sources over a multiyear timeline. In addition to attributes, motivations for human interest in river-related resources were also coded, such as recreation or preservation for future generations. To allow testing of differences between materials written for different audiences, three sources were sampled: a blog hosted by National Geographic, New York Times articles, and Wall Street Journal articles. The coding approach was rigorously tested in a pilot phase, with measures developed to ensure high data quality, including use of two independent coders. Results show numerous similarities across sources with some notable differences in emphasis. Significant relationships between groups of attribute and motivation codes were also found, one outcome of which is further support for the importance of nonuse values for fish and wildlife.

The survey of the odonatofauna of three major Algerian wadis: Kebir-East, Seybouse, and Rhumel, led to the identification of 40 species. Our results revealed the presence of Calopteryx exul, a Maghrebian endemic, at Wadi Seybouse and seemed to confirm the extinction of the type population at Wadi Rhumel where the species was first recorded in the XIXth Century. The results also indicated the range expansion of several species: Coenagrion caerulescens, Orthetrum nitidinerve, Trithemis kirbyi and Urothemis edwardsii whose relict population is critically endangered. Additionally sampling of abiotic factors (altitude, water temperature, conductivity, etc.) was carried out and data analysed in view of exploring a possible co-structure between the faunistic and environmental data sets. Data analysis indicated that correlation between abiotic factors (hydroperiod, water conductivity and water temperature) and species richness differed between streams and thus Odonata may prove useful in evaluating the ecological integrity of Mediterranean lotic systems.																	0249-7395						2017	72	3					314	329										WOS:000413090300007

This research focuses on the land change associated with the development of shale oil and gas infrastructure in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in two geographically proximate and physically similar counties, Carroll County, OH, and Washington County, PA. Land-cover data used to measure feature-scale change were digitized from aerial photography and then used to update National Land Cover Dataset data used in the calculation of forest fragmentation for the entire study areas. The amount and pattern of land change was very similar between the two counties even though they are drawing oil and gas from different shale formations. Less than 1% of the total forest for each county was lost but the fragmentation impacts are amplified by the pattern of infrastructure on the landscape.																	1747-423X	1747-4248					2017	12	5					338	350		10.1080/1747423X.2017.1331274								WOS:000410841000002

Bare-root strawberry plugs were grown in 1-gallon plastic pots. The treatments consisted of two media: (1) a peat:perlite soil-less mix and (2) a fine sand soil. Each media was amended with three levels of dairy manure vermicompost: 0, 10, and 25% by weight, and a biweekly synthetic fertilizer treatment of 150mg N-P-K L-1 evaluated in a full factorial randomized block design. Drainage water from each plant was collected each week for 18weeks and analyzed for NO3- concentration. In the first 2weeks, high (1000-5000mg L-1) amounts of NO3- leaching occurred in all vermicompost-amended media relative to non vermicompost-amended media, but this leaching significantly (p < 0.01) decreased over time across all vermicompost treatments. Strawberry growth response to 10% vermicompost was similar to synthetic fertilizer only treatments. Plants grown with vermicompost at 25% with synthetic fertilizer had the highest above-ground vegetative biomass (15.3g) relative to plants with synthetic fertilizer only (5.3g). These data suggest vermicompost addition rates of 10 and 25% by weight promote high vegetative biomass in greenhouse strawberry but may facilitate high initial nitrate leaching, which can negatively affect water quality and environmental health.																	1065-657X	2326-2397					2017	25	3					194	205		10.1080/1065657X.2016.1277806								WOS:000410918800005

Phytoplankton ecology of a culturally eutrophic embayment: Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is a chronically eutrophic embayment located at the western end of Lake Ontario that has experienced many decades of agricultural, industrial, and urban contamination. It has been identified as an Area of Concern under the terms of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement between Canada and the United States. This study examines the ecology of the phytoplankton communities at one centrally located station during the ice-free period (May-October) of three non-consecutive years: 2002, 2004 and 2006. This was the first comprehensive study to be conducted since the 1970s. It was found that the phytoplankton communities are diverse and fluctuate throughout the year, along with changing nutrient, physical and environmental conditions. No consistent patterns of seasonal succession were observed throughout the study. Phytoflagellates including Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae had a tendency to outnumber and out-compete other phytoplankton since they are mobile and able to seek out optimal habitats within the water column. For a highly eutrophic water body, algal biomass (annual mean approximate to 2.0 g m(-3)) was lower than expected and more consistent with mesotrophic conditions-an observation first made by researchers in the 1970s and attributed to the highly variable physical environment. While our study supports these earlier results, we also conclude that zooplankton grazing likely has a significant role in limiting the size of the algal standing crop. Several algal bloom events were captured during our study. In addition to the somewhat predictable blooms of Diatomeae in the spring and Cyanophyta in the summer, we also observed blooms of Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae. In one case we observed a bloom with no dominant taxon-it contained a diverse mixture of Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyta and Dinophyceae-challenging the commonly held notion that algal blooms are essentially monocultures. Our results show that such a variable and stressed ecosystem requires frequent sampling to capture the rapid changes that occur.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		201	213		10.1080/14634988.2017.1307678								WOS:000410570900002

Elevated zooplankton production in a eutrophic Lake Ontario embayment: Hamilton Harbour 2002-2014	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Hamilton Harbour is an Area of Concern in western Lake Ontario, long stressed by cultural eutrophication, urbanization and invasive species. Despite high nutrient levels leading to hypolimnetic hypoxia and contaminated sediment, it is a highly productive environment. To better understand zooplankton dynamics in Hamilton Harbour, we conducted biweekly May to October sampling of zooplankton and rotifer composition at open water harbour sites from 2002-2014. May to October zooplankton density, dry biomass and total production averaged 265 +/- 16 animals l(-1), 306 +/- 19 mg m(-3) and 4131 +/- 359 mg m(-3), (+/- SE), respectively. These values are among the highest reported in the Great Lakes, with biomass two to seven times greater than in other eutrophic embayments. Zooplankton populations and taxonomic seasonality have remained relatively stable in Hamilton Harbour since 2002. Biomass is often dominated by smaller taxa such as Bosmina, Eubosmina and juvenile copepods, suggestive of high fish planktivory, but Daphnia retrocurva and D. galeata mendotae are also dominant during the summer, indicating improvements in the zooplankton community since the 1970s when Daphnia and cyclopoids were uncommon. Conversely, rotifers have declined over the last 40 years, though while still numerically dominant, now comprise <4% of total biomass and production compared to 40% in the 1970s. Both adult Dreissenid Mussels and their veliger larvae are less abundant in Hamilton Harbour compared to nearshore Lake Ontario. Zooplankton appear to be effectively utilizing high production rates of edible algae and microorganisms in the harbour. More work is needed to explore trophic interactions in this eutrophic ecosystem and the effects of hypolimnetic hypoxia on the zooplankton community.																	1463-4988	1539-4077					2017	20	3			SI		230	241		10.1080/14634988.2017.1294425								WOS:000410570900004

Perceived changes in environmental degradation and loss of ecosystem services, and their implications in human well-being	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND WORLD ECOLOGY												Rural communities worldwide face a decrease of critical ecosystem services caused by replacement of native forests by commercial plantations. Replacement of native forest by commercial plantations decreases water provisioning, with possible negative impacts over well-being. We tested this hypothesis in Central Chile. We assessed subjective well-being (SWB) and local perceptions of changes in forest cover and water provision among 78 rural families. We also assessed if the Shifting Baseline Syndrome (SBS) affects the perceptions of environmental changes and their implications in SWB. Individuals perceived less forest cover than 20years ago, and this is seen as a factor of decreased livelihood, availability of forest products, and water provisioning for households. People also reported less water available than 20years ago. The main drivers associated with decreased water provision were the establishment of pine plantations (44% of individuals) and drought (44%). A better-off SWB was associated with perception of lower rate of deforestation. The perceptions of forest degradation and its association to SWB are affected by SBS. Paradoxically, a better-off SWB was also associated with an improvement of water quality, although the quantity and quality of water have decreased according to biophysical data, which ought to decrease the SWB. Impacts of environmental degradation in SWB are masked by factors such as more infrastructure for drinking water, assisted by governments. This masking of environmental degradation reduces the opportunity to avoid negative impacts over well-being among rural communities that are dependent on assistance around the world.																	1350-4509	1745-2627					2017	24	6					561	574		10.1080/13504509.2016.1255674								WOS:000410913600010

The monitoring was performed during the minimum and maximum rainfall periods. The concentrations of As, Cr, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn in water exceeded the permissible limits set by the Interim National Water Quality Standards for Malaysia (INWQS). The risk index (RI) values determined for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb and Zn in sediment presented a low degree of ecological risk. The order of the top three heavy metals measured in fish muscle was Zn >F e> Al. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of As and Cr exceeded the allowable limits in both rainfall periods. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF) values of Zn in water hyacinth were 24.865 and 3.214, respectively. The concentrations of Cu and Zn in the plant tissue were significantly correlated (p < .05) with the concentrations of heavy metals in water. Overall, climbing perch and water hyacinth are excellent bioindicators of environmental impacts on water bodies.																	0275-7540	1029-0370					2017	33	7					637	651		10.1080/02757540.2017.1351553								WOS:000406482600004						
J	Kaine, G; Young, J; Lourey, R; Greenhalgh, S				Kaine, Geoff; Young, Justine; Lourey, Ruth; Greenhalgh, Suzie			Policy choice framework: guiding policy makers in changing farmer behavior	ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY												There is a substantial literature on the characteristics of policy instruments. Unfortunately, there is an unhelpful degree of overlap in the strengths and weaknesses of different instruments. As a consequence, rarely is it the case that one particular instrument is obviously superior to all others. Policy makers must then make choices about which instrument(s) to use. The economics discipline can provide some insights for instrument choice through its exploration of market failures related to natural resource management. Few attempts, however, have been made to encapsulate these economic concepts in way to that could aid policy makers in these choices and ensure that policy instrument choice aligns with the fundamental cause of the behavior to be changed. We describe and provide example applications of the policy choice framework (PCF). The PCF was developed to assist policy makers to deliberately and systematically choose policy instruments to influence the behavior of farmers. The PCF is unique among methods for choosing policy instruments because it links the microeconomic reasons underpinning the choice of a primary policy instrument (stage one) with predictions of the behavior of farmers (stage two) and predictions about the organizational needs of agencies responsible for implementing policy (stage three). We describe the PCF using two applications: wild dog management and the control of agricultural nitrogen discharges. Our purpose was to show how the PCF could be employed to assist in policy instrument selection. We then discuss the implications for policy design and instrument choice.																	1708-3087						2017	22	2							2	10.5751/ES-09135-220202								WOS:000404997600009

EVALUATION OF GRAPHICAL AND MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL METHODS FOR CLASSIFICATION AND EVALUATION OF GROUNDWATER IN ALATHUR BLOCK, PERAMBALUR DISTRICT, INDIA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This paper assesses the quality of water using different graphical and statistical methods like Durov, Schoeller, Piper - Tri linear diagram, Box and Whisker plot for three seasons in the study area Alathur block, Perambalur District. The graphical representation provides limitations compared with the multivariate method for large data sets. A total of 10 groundwater samples were collected from hand dug wells in this area and they were analyzed for various physical and chemical parameters. The sequence of the dominance of the major ions are in the following order Na+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ and Cl-> SO42-> HCO3- > NO3-. The dominating hydrochemicals of facies of groundwater are Ca-Cl and mixed Ca-Mg-Cl and alkaline earth metals (Ca2+, Mg2+) and strong acids (SO42-, Cl-) that dominate over alkalis (Na+, K+) and weak acids like HCO3-, CO3-. Based on the analytical result, groundwater in the study area is generally hard to very hard, slightly alkaline to brackish in nature. This indicates that leaching of salts, rock weathering and evaporation are among the most dominant processes in controlling water quality. For industrial purposes, the quality of water was assessed by using the Langeliner saturation index (LSI) and Ryznar saturation index (RSI). Seasonal variations in different parameters were also determined.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					105	116		10.15666/aeer/1503_105116								WOS:000403811200009

FORECASTING DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND BIOCHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND IN A RIVER WITH NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL BOD-DO MODEL	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												As a main measure of water quality, the concentration of DO always gets much attention. The chemical reactions in water bodies are mainly related to DO, so the concentration of DO has much relationship with the water quality. Biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen (BOD-DO) model is used to show the relationship of the concentration of BOD or DO with the physical characteristic of the river. For this model, it is difficult to determine the analytical solution, so numerical solution of the model is obtained with Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial. With this method, the model is rewritten with differential form, and then the four order differential of the oxygen deficit was expressed with the Chebyshev orthogonal polynomial, which had coefficients. Lastly, a simulation test was conducted to verify the rationality of the model. The actual BOD and oxygen deficit values are calculated using the original model. With the actual values and formulas, the coefficients could be solved and the predicted values calculated. The forecasting values of concentration of BOD and DO are compared with the actual values. Five statistical measures were used to evaluate the predicted results.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					323	333		10.15666/aeer/1503_323333								WOS:000403811200023

DYNAMICS OF LAND COVER CHANGES AND DELINEATION OF GROUNDWATER RECHARGE POTENTIAL SITES IN THE AGUANAVAL AQUIFER, ZACATECAS, MEXICO	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Currently, human activities in ecosystems have led to adverse effects in aquifers, with the main consequences being the loss of vegetation and water availability. This paper presents a multi-criteria qualitative matrix which is developed to assign different values which estimate the potential of a specific land cover to be a groundwater recharge site. The matrix was coupled with a quantitative analysis of land cover changes in the Aguanaval aquifer, within the central zone of Zacatecas State, Mexico. Land cover changes were determined using four satellite images from 1986, 1992, 2002 and 2016. The results indicate that from 1986 to 2016 croplands and pasture increased by approximately 33,483 ha, but the most important change for croplands and pasture occurred between 2002 and 2016 with an increase of 31,607 ha; mixed forest land class occupied 16.49% in 1986, but an increase in the period from 1986 to 1992 reached 18.69% and decreased to 13.30% and 11.76% for 2002 and 2016, respectively. For the mixed rangeland covering 61.26% of the aquifer area, the major land cover in 1986 decreased substantially in 2016 reaching only 17.09% of total area. It was identified that the sites with a high recharge potential are located in the east and central-southeast and the medium recharge potential sites are located in the central part while the low potential sites are distributed to the north and southwest side of the aquifer.

GIS BASED WATER SUITABILITY CLASSIFICATION FOR SHEEP - A CASE STUDY OF SAVADKOOH WATERSHED, MAZANDARAN, IRAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Water resources are of utmost importance for proper grazing management and optimal use of rangelands. In the present study, suitability of lands from the perspective of water resources is modeled regarding sheep as the grazing livestock. FAO (1991) method was used for the model. The study area is located at Savadkooh, Mazandaran province of Iran. The model comprised three submodels; water quality, water quantity and the distance of water resources to grazing area. According to the climatic conditions and number of permanent water resources, there was no shortage in water quantity. Results of water analysis also revealed no restricted elements for sheeps to drink the water. In the study area, in terms of water quality, the water resources were in S1 suitability class. However, steep slopes and stoniness were two barriers for water accessibility. As demonstrated by the model, 5552.32 ha (57.99%) of the study rangelands were in good class, 1523.85 ha (25.91%) in fair to moderate class while 5.76 ha (0.06%) were in poor suitability class. Non suitable rangelands were 2369.15 hectares which is equal to 20.4% of the surface area.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					1149	1156		10.15666/aeer/1503_11491156								WOS:000403811200083

SPATIO-TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN ZOOPLANKTON COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND WATER QUALITY IN A CHINESE EUTROPHIC RIVER	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												To collect information about the community structure of zooplankton and to study how zooplankton respond to environmental conditions, zooplankton samples were collected from seven stations in a heavily polluted river (the Nanfei River, China). Samples were collected in March (spring) and June (summer) 2014, September (autumn) and December (winter) 2013. A total of 275 species of zooplankton belonging to 79 genera were identified, the total zooplankton abundance was 193 040 ind./L. Protozoa and rotifer comprised a high proportion of species number and abundance of zooplankton. The upper reaches had higher greater species number and lower abundance than those in middle and lower reaches, and at the entrance of Chaohu Lake. The species number and abundance of zooplankton were the highest in autumn, and the lowest in winter. The habitats of Nanfei River had high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, revealed by unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustering analyses on environmental factors and detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) clustering analyses on zooplankton abundance. In addition, water quality of upper reaches was better than the middle and lower reaches, and the entrance; and better in autumn than in other three seasons in terms of species number, abundance, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index. Results of canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicate that the combination of water temperature, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, pH, chemical oxygen demanded, soluble phosphate, and conductance rate were responsible for the variations in zooplankton community structure. Results of the present study indicated that zooplankton communities of the Nanfei River had obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and the environmental factors played an important role in the changes in zooplankton community in Nanfei River.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					1417	1442		10.15666/aeer/1503_14171442								WOS:000403811200101

Macrophyte species composition and structure along littoral region in relation to limnological variables of a tropical wetland ecosystem	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												The composition and structure of macrophyte communities of the littoral region of Bhinda was wetland (India) was investigated. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) if limnological variables such as water chemistry and soil parameters are important determinants of species composition and abundance and (2) what is the variance in species richness and composition within the wetland. Twenty-eight macrophyte species belonging to 17 different families were identified with relatively low species diversity and richness (H' = 2.09; Margalef index = 1.12). Eichhornia crassipes, attained the highest relative frequency (22.69%), followed by Salvinia natans, Paspalum paspaloides, Phragmites karka, Cynodon dactylon and Cyperus alopecuroides. The first and second axis of CCA ordination explained 38.4% and 28.5% of the total variance of species-limnological variables relationship, respectively. Water-related variables (dissolved oxygen, pH and nitrate concentration) and soil nutrient factors (soil carbon and phosphorus levels) were significantly correlated to macrophyte distribution. Sampling sites formed two distinct groups based on cluster analysis, indicating varying ecological conditions. Generally, composition and abundance of macrophytes evince highly productive nature of the lake, while dominance of invasive species like E. crassipes and S. natans indicates high influence of increased nutrient levels and anthropogenic activities in the catchment on lake macrophyte composition.

Verification of a numerical growth model of Pistia stratiotes L. using field data from tropical and subtropical sites	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												The growth model of Pistia stratiotes L. (Pistia-model) was verified using two independent sets of published field data (07 degrees 26' N, 03 degrees 53' E Nigeria; 27 degrees 30' N, 80 degrees 30' W USA) to answer the following question: Is the Pistia-model, originally designed for P. stratiotes under natural conditions in Egypt, suitable to simulate the growth of P. stratiotes in tropical and subtropical regions? The Pistia-model simulates the growth dynamics and biomass production of well-established, monospecific stands of P. stratiotes based on fixed carbon gain and loss using first-order differential equations. General trends for shoots biomass, such as the slow initial growth rate followed by a high growth rate, the peak biomass, and the decline of biomass due to senescence, were successfully reproduced by the Pistia-model. Many characteristics typical for the roots biomass, such as the increase in the roots biomass during the early growing season because of the translocation of materials from shoots, and the reduction of roots biomass during the later period of the season, were also reproduced. The level of agreement between the simulated values and actual field data indicated that the Pistia-model can simulate the biomass of P. stratiotes over a wide range of latitudes.

J	Giblin, SM				Giblin, Shawn M.			Identifying and quantifying environmental thresholds for ecological shifts in a large semi-regulated river	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Ecological shifts, between a clear macrophyte-dominated state and a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton and high inorganic suspended solids, have been well described in shallow lake ecosystems. While few documented examples exist in rivers, models predict regime shifts, especially in regulated rivers with high water retention time. Here I quantified ecological shifts in a large, semi-regulated floodplain river during a transition from a turbid-to a clear-water state using water quality, aquatic vegetation and fisheries data from a rigorous, standardized long-term data set. My findings indicate that significant changes occurred in total suspended solids concentration, aquatic macrophyte abundance, native and non-native fish biomass, fish functional feeding guild patterns, fish habitat guild assemblages and fish spawning guild assemblage patterns over a nearly 20-year period in Navigation Pool 8 of the Upper Mississippi River. Transitions in physical and biological indicators were examined to identify mechanisms underlying the ecological shifts. Environmental variables driving fish assemblage changes were identified (total suspended solids and aquatic vegetation) and management-relevant thresholds are presented. Awareness of management thresholds is critical for resource managers to implement measures to prevent the river from moving to a degraded state characterized by high non-native fish abundance and low predatory fish species abundance.																	0270-5060	2156-6941					2017	32	1					433	453		10.1080/02705060.2017.1319431								WOS:000401719600004

Effectiveness of emergent and submergent aquatic plants in mitigating a nitrogen-permethrin mixture	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Hydraulically connected wetland microcosms (approximate to 50L) in series were used to test the effectiveness of varying combinations of two common aquatic vascular plants, parrot feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum) and cattail (Typha latifolia), for mitigating contamination from a mixture of nitrogen (ammonium nitrate) and permethrin. The upstream series included Myriophyllum only (M) and Typha only (T) while the combination upstream effluent into downstream series included Myriophyllum into Myriophyllum (M+M) and Typha into Myriophyllum (T+M). During flow, M into M+M more efficiently mitigated nitrogen than T into T+M. Post-flow, nitrogen removal efficiency was greater for T versus M and M+M versus T+M. Mean aqueous dissipation half-lives (t(1/2)) of NH4-N and NO3-N were more rapid in T than M treatments. Ammonium and nitrate t(1/2) was highly correlated with aquatic plant above-ground shoot biomass. Permethrin mitigation efficiencies and t(1/2) were not significantly affected by plant species either singly or in combination. Trans-permethrin t(1/2) was moderately correlated with plant biomass, but not cis-permethrin t(1/2). Results of this study indicate differences in aquatic plant species and flow path influence nitrogen removal but not permethrin. However, plant species appears less important than overall plant biomass in ascertaining aquatic plant effectiveness in mitigating a nitrogen-permethrin mixture.																	0275-7540	1029-0370					2017	33	5					420	433		10.1080/02757540.2017.1310849								WOS:000401448600004

Employing indicators for prioritization of fish assemblage with a view to manage freshwater fish diversity and ecosystem health in the tributaries of Ganges basin, India	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The major tributaries of the river Ganges basin are currently threatened by various anthropogenic activities which are hampering the ecosystem stability and fish biodiversity of the basin. Multiple indicators were used to prioritize the fish assemblages in the tributaries and to develop an index that is responsive to human-induced environmental changes. A high percentage of invasive species was described with the orgin index at the most disturbed sites of rivers Gomti and Betwa which also represented a substantial amount of biological disturbance. The Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index based on ecological integrity of different segments of the rivers was used to prioritize different sampling sites of the tributaries. Some of the sampling sites in Gomti and Betwa rivers are reflecting disturbed fish assemblages, a very low Fisheries Assessment Integrity Index score, few threatened species, and a high proportion of invasive species. Principal components analysis of the sampling sites, along with fish assemblage, reflected the influence of the habitat parameters on structuring the assemblage pattern. This study identified depth, flow, water quality and land uses in shaping fish assemblages. The combination of various indices in this study should provide more accurate measures in identifying sites of high conservation value.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		21	29		10.1080/14634988.2017.1270146								WOS:000400410800004

Studies on ecology, fish diversity and fisheries of Ken-Betwa rivers (India): Proposed for inter-linking	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Ken and Betwa rivers traversing through Central India are the major tributaries of the river Yamuna. Both rivers originate above 550m above sea level in the Vindhya region. An interlinking project proposed for the rivers envisages diversion of water from Ken basin to the Betwa. The river sediment is alkaline and dominated by sand (78-89%) in both rivers. Oxygen-rich alkaline water and moderate values of chemical parameters show the pollution free and productive nature of both the rivers. There was no statistically significant difference in water quality between the Ken and Betwa rivers, except for total alkalinity. The biotic parameters were observed in similar ranges and moderate condition. A total of 61 planktonic forms were recorded from the rivers out of which 55 were phytoplankton. For the first time, 89 fish species belonging to 10 orders, 26 families, and 62 genera have been recorded in the river Ken, while 81 species classified under 10 orders, 24 families, and 55 genera were found in the Betwa. Exotic fish species were also observed in the downstream stretches of both rivers. Out of the total fish species, 77 were common to both rivers, 12 were found only in the Ken River, and 4 species were restricted to the Betwa. Analysis of relative abundance showed dominance of Labeo boggut in the Ken and Osteobrama cotio in the Betwa River. On comparison of the Shannon-Wiener Diversity and Evenness Indices of fish diversity, these indicated slightly higher values in the Ken (3.76 and 0.842) than the Betwa (3.66 and 0.835). A total of nine near-threatened fish species was recorded in the rivers. Both rivers have already been obstructed by many developmental projects; the proposed interlinking would further negatively impact the ecology and fisheries.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		71	85		10.1080/14634988.2017.1261576								WOS:000400410800008

Fish habitat and fisheries of Brahmaputra River in Assam, India	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												River Brahmaputra is a trans-boundary major river flowing through the northeastern state of Assam, India and is the lifeline of its natural fisheries. In the present article, we discuss eco-hydrobiology (including sediment quality and energy flow) of River Brahmaputra and its important tributaries in the state of Assam, India based on extensive synoptic studies conducted from April 1996 to March 1998, duly collated with past and present studies. Salient aspects of fisheries of the river system in the state (ichthyofauna, biogeography, conservation status, migratory and exotic fish species, trends in fish yield and species composition, fishing crafts and gear) are discussed in light of past and present studies conducted by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Indian Fisheries Research Institute and others. Fisheries of floodplain wetlands (beels) located in the Brahmaputra valley in the state and their interaction with the river system are also discussed.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		102	115		10.1080/14634988.2017.1297171								WOS:000400410800010

AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers are the first and second largest running waters of Jharkhand, having variable river bed morphology with naturally hard substrates. The riverine biodiversity is outstanding, as it includes endemic taxa on species and subspecies levels. Aquatic habitats are mostly colonized by native species. Macrozoobenthic animals are important bioindicators of the habitat quality of the river and are used for rapid assessment of river quality globally. In order to have preliminary information on the biodiversity of macrobenthos, the first survey was undertaken to find the impact of domestic pollution, mining, and thermal power plants on the aquatic life of the Damodar in May 2004. On the basis of our observations and species records, systematic field sampling for macro-benthic invertebrates in the Damodar and Subarnarekha Rivers was conducted from 2007 to 2012 during different hydrological conditions to cover the seasonal variation. Synoptic sampling was done to allow comparison between the two rivers. Aquatic invertebrate fauna has been inventoried with 124 identified taxa. The highest proportion of functional feeding groups recorded were detritivores, followed by carnivores and herbivores, respectively. This present study demonstrates the seasonal disappearance of macrozoobenthic invertebrates caused by urban and industrial pollution and that the fauna of the two main rivers of Jharkhand are similar in species inventory. This reflects the ecological conditions of the shared ecoregion known as Chota Nagpur Dry Forests. The results of the present research provide an essential database to evaluate the future environmental impact of restoration and changes in water quality.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		116	129		10.1080/14634988.2017.1300041								WOS:000400410800011

Effect of river connectivity on hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity and biotic communities of wetlands	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Wetlands associated with floodplains of the Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems cover an estimated 0.2million ha and play a vital role in the fisheries, rural economy and environment. In recent years, most wetlands in the states of Bihar, Assam and West Bengal in India have lost connectivity with their parent rivers due to natural and anthropogenic changes. These changes are causing rapid shrinkage of valuable wetlands and threatening their biodiversity and ecological function. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of river connectivity on the hydrochemistry, sediment enzyme activity, and biotic communities of these wetlands. One wetland area having link channels (open) connecting the main river, and another without link channels (closed), were selected from each of the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins for the study. Comparative analysis of open and closed, ecologically distinct wetlands of the Ganges basin revealed greater seasonal reduction in water depth and higher water conductivity (p < 0.04), nutrients (Ca+2, Mg+2, SiO3-Si), sediment microbial activity (p < 0.004), phosphorous cycling enzymes (p < 0.001), carbon cycling enzymes (p < 0.01), organic matter, conductivity, and plankton and macrozoobenthos (p < 0.01) density in the closed wetland. However, the open wetland showed higher diversity of plankton and macrozoobenthos. A profound impact of connectivity on wetland fisheries was observed in the Brahmaputra basin in Assam, where a higher percentage of catch comprised of indigenous fish species with lower fish yield was noted in the open wetland.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		140	150		10.1080/14634988.2017.1301095								WOS:000400410800013

A case study of the Narmada River system in India with particular reference to the impact of dams on its ecology and fisheries	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Narmada, the oldest river system in India, originates from Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh, flows east-west, and joins with the Gulf of Cambay on the Arabian Sea. The river drains 45.64km(3) of annual run-off and a series of dams was proposed to hold some of its water resources for multipurpose use. Currently, three dams have been built in Madhya Pradesh and one is under construction in Gujarat. A comparison of pre- and post-impoundment eco-environment and fisheries revealed changes in water quality, productivity, and aquatic flora and fauna of the river system. Among the fish, species like Tor tor, Labeo fimbriatus and Labeo dyocheilus suffered most. The percentage contributions to total yield of Carp, Catfish, and miscellaneous groups have significantly changed, indicating falls of 17%, 36% and an increase of 410%, respectively. Percentage contributions to catches of Macrobrachium rosenbergii and Tenualosa ilisha have also declined by 46% and about 75% in the estuarine stretch of the river system. Suitable conservation measures for sustenance and development of fishery have been suggested.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		151	159		10.1080/14634988.2017.1288529								WOS:000400410800014

Status of the River Krishna: Water quality and riverine environment in relation to fisheries	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The River Krishna, the second largest peninsular river of India, was investigated during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons to improve the understanding of its ecology through analysis of physical and chemical parameters of water and sediment. Important tributaries of the river were also studied simultaneously to understand their influence on the main stream of the River Krishna. In addition to 25 sampling sites along the main stream of the River Krishna, sampling was also done in 13 important tributaries at sites upstream of the confluence point. Dams, barrages and anicuts have visible impacts on all of the observed physical and chemical properties of water and soil. Statistical analysis revealed that water parameters have a strong association with sediment parameters. However, the study was unable to find any relation between primary production and water quality parameters. Fish species distribution was strongly influenced by temperature and water depth, as well as specific conductivity, as observed through Canonical Correspondence Analysis.																	1463-4988	1539-4077				JAN-JUN	2017	20	1-2			SI		160	174		10.1080/14634988.2017.1296312								WOS:000400410800015

These difficulties are exacerbated by confounding the crafting of policy instruments to change resource use (a behavioral matter related to resource management) with the consequential issue of who bears the cost of changing resource use (an equity matter). The confounding of behavioral and equity issues is not surprising because equity is commonly suggested as a criterion in the literature on policy instrument choice, and inequity in access to resources may also be one of the initial drivers of policy intervention. Here, we restate the microeconomic analysis of "open access" resources and highlight the fundamental difference between efficiency (including allocative inefficiency) and equity that emerges from that analysis. We then discuss the implications of this difference for the choice of policy instruments to resolve problems in natural resource management, at least for instruments that entail changing the behavior of primary producers. This discussion is centered on three key decisions for formulating policy: (1) choosing the preferred portfolio of uses for a natural resource, (2) choosing a policy instrument to change that portfolio, and (3) choosing a mechanism to distribute the costs of change fairly. To illustrate how these decisions may play out in a real-world example, we apply the decisions to a freshwater policy process in New Zealand. By articulating the distinction, microeconomics draws distinctions between efficiency and equity as policy objectives. Linking that distinction with the Tinbergen's principle regarding the matching of instruments to objectives, we aim to reduce the conflation of the decision-making criteria employed in policy formulation decisions. In doing so, we hope to assist policy makers to avoid policy failure by reducing the potential for the influence of self-interested parties, or concern about their welfare, to introduce process failures into the policy formulation and decision-making stages of the policy cycle.																	1708-3087						2017	22	1							50	10.5751/ES-09133-220150								WOS:000399397700049

Larval Anuran Stable Isotope Signatures and Stoichiometry Across Multiple Geographically Isolated Wetlands in the Southeastern United States	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Animals live in complex environments that vary spatially and temporally. This heterogeneity strongly influences the availability and quality of food resources and has strong impacts on growth and survival of consumers. Geographically isolated wetlands provide an interesting system to study trophic relationships because they vary spatially and temporally in hydrology and vegetation. Larval anurans play an important role in these wetland systems because they are often the most abundant consumers. Yet, little is known about larval anuran diet. Here we assessed the diet of 3 larval anurans (Acris gryllus [Southern Cricket Frog], Hyla gratiosa [Barking Treefrog], and Lithobates sphenocephalus [Southern Leopard Frog]), across 2 isolated wetland types (marsh and cypress savanna) using a stable isotope mixing model, stable isotope analysis in R (SIAR). Furthermore, we assessed variation in basal resource and anuran tissue stoichiometry (C: N). Our analyses suggested that larvae of these 3 species primarily function as herbivores and detritivores. All fed on a mix of algal resources, detrital particulate organic matter, and litter originating from the wetland canopy. Barking Treefrog had a lower C: N than the other two species, suggesting their dietary N requirements may be greater. Understanding the trophic roles of these animals is essential in determining their ecological significance and contributes to a more complete view of isolated wetlands in the surrounding landscape.																	1528-7092	1938-5412					2017	16	1					87	104		10.1656/058.016.0107								WOS:000398177300008

A Survey of Freshwater Mussels (Unionidae) in Little River, Blount County, Tennessee	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Following the collection of a putative undescribed species in the genus Pleurobema in 2012, we surveyed the freshwater mussel fauna of Little River, Blount County, TN, to determine species diversity and relative abundances. At 18 main- stem sites, we sampled 3053 live specimens representing 12 mussel species and 1 fresh- dead individual representing another. An additional species represented by a relic shell was collected, bringing the total to 14 mussel species sampled during this survey. Villosa species comprised 77% of total live mussels sampled. Among the extant mussels were two federally endangered species: Fusconaia cuneolus ( Finerayed Pigtoe) was confirmed to persist in the river, while Pleuronaia dolabelloides (Slabside Pearlymussel) represents a new drainage record. Several other mussels collected are considered imperiled globally, including Alasmidonta viridis (Slippershell Mussel), Lampsilis ovata (Pocketbook), Medionidus conradicus (Cumberland Moccasinshell), Pleurobema oviforme (Tennessee Clubshell), Pleuronaia barnesiana (Tennessee Pigtoe), and Villosa vanuxemensis (Mountain Creekshell). A total of 319 individuals of the putative new species Pleurobema sp. cf. oviforme were sampled at 9 sites, 215 at 1 site. A total of 857 individuals of a putative undescribed species in the genus Villosa were sampled at 9 sites. These 2 putative species (Pleurobema sp. cf. oviforme and Villosa sp. cf. iris) are likely endemic to Little River, TN, and may be in need of state and federal protection. Mussel densities declined downstream from the mouth of Ellejoy Creek, indicating that water- quality issues may be occurring in this reach of the river.																	1528-7092	1938-5412					2017	16	1					105	116		10.1656/058.016.0108								WOS:000398177300009

Application of OEPA-Produced Biotic Indices and Physical Stream Measurements to Assess Freshwater Mussel (Unionidae) Habitat in the Upper Mahoning River, Ohio	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Freshwater mussels continue to experience declines in population numbers in response to changing environments. Identifying aspects of the environment associated with the presence and abundance of mussels in small streams is challenging where past records are minimal. Thus, we sought to produce models of habitat favoring mussel species richness and abundance in the upper Mahoning River using data collected in 2 ways: (1) surveying sites deemed as suitable habitat via observation and (2) surveying existing Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) sites used to evaluate water quality and aquatic life through biotic indices. Detailed physical measurements were added at each survey site. Surveys identified 963 freshwater mussels of 11 species. The more-forested Eagle Creek contained an abundant mussel assemblage compared to the rest of the Upper Mahoning River, yet this stream was still dominated by just 1 common species, Lampsilis siliquoidea (Fatmucket). Drainage area alone correlated with mussel richness and abundance, but a complex model of multiple characteristics provided equivalent predictive power to assess how variation in environmental components may enhance the likelihood of mussel presence. The OEPA composite qualitative habitat evaluation index, which encompasses substrate, instream cover, channel morphology, riparian zone, pool quality, and map gradient, also was indicative of greater mussel diversity.																	1092-6194	1938-5307					2017	24	1					1	14										WOS:000398171800003

This methodology creates a framework of integrating research of land use structure with modelling hydric potential by using runoff curve number into the assessment and subsequent optimization of hydric potential in a foothills region of the Biele Karpaty Mts. Analysis and hydric evaluation of the study area shows that foothills region has a relatively high hydric potential. The research question is: could landscape ecological optimization reduce runoff significantly and improve hydric regime in the landscape. The proposed measures are linked to existing land use structure, where they increase the quality of existing hydric elements. They have character of non-technical solutions with maximum exploitation of the potential of ecosystem services, therefore they are economically undemanding. On the basis of our results, the proposed changes in land use will lead to the capture of water in landscape and an overall better use of water in landscape.

DETERMINATION OF LEAD AND CADMIUM IN THE WATER OF THE DAMAVAND RIVER, IRAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Heavy metals contamination of surface waters has become an important issue in the last decades. The present study aimed to investigate the levels of lead and cadmium in the water of the Damavand River, Iran. Sampling was carried out in 10 stations during summer and autumn 2015. Metal analysis was performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Surface water at each sampling point was measured for selected physicochemical parameters with a multiparameter meter. Statistical analysis was carried out by SPSS and Excel software. The results showed that the mean concentrations (mg/L) of lead in the samples were higher than cadmium over the studied months. The highest levels of lead (2.13 +/- 0.80) and cadmium (1.03 +/- 0.50) were found in station 9 while the lowest levels of lead (0.09 +/- 0.00) and cadmium (0.03 +/- 0.00) were in station 1 (before entering the city of Damavand). Significant differences (P< 0.05) were observed between the stations, however, there were no significant variations between the levels of metals in the months. Significant differences were found between the levels of physicochemical parameters among different months at 95% confidence level. Present values revealed that the concentrations of metals in the stations were higher than the maximum permitted levels for drinking water set by different organizations.																	1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	1					439	444		10.15666/aeer/1501_439444								WOS:000397162200030

LOCAL AND SCIENTIFIC ECOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE POTENTIAL AS A SOURCE OF INFORMATION IN A PERIURBAN RIVER, MEXICO CITY, MEXICO	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Rivers in large cities face management problems that could be addressed through the integration of scientific and local ecological knowledge. The objective of this article is to emphasize the importance of different sources of knowledge in management alternatives for periurban watersheds. Specifically, this is done through (a) use of oral sources and archives to document the historic relationship between local residents and their natural resources, and (b) technical evaluation of the quantity and quality of water in the sub-basin through the time. We analyzed, through the 19 unstructured interviews, local residents' knowledge related to water quantity and quality. Additionally, we analyzed historical river flow data and water quality reports. The results show that the relationship between the local inhabitants and the river has been governed by public policies of both exploitation and conservation. For the last century, the river was used as the main source of electric power for local industry, the collapse of which, led to the decline of the importance of the river in the perception of the locals. Analysis of historical river flow data reveals a slight decrease in flow despite a trend of somewhat lower precipitation. This discrepancy may be due to hydraulic infrastructure construction and uncontrolled extraction. We conclude that the integration of two kinds of knowledge present a great opportunity to test a monitoring system that incorporates the environmental features that were more accurately described by the local residents: water quantity and forest land use.

Annual precipitation regulates spatial and temporal drivers of lake water clarity	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Understanding how and why lakes vary and respond to different drivers through time and space is needed to understand, predict, and manage freshwater quality in an era of rapidly changing land use and climate. Water clarity regulates many characteristics of aquatic ecosystems and is responsive to watershed features, making it a sentinel of environmental change. However, whether precipitation alters the relative importance of features that influence lake water clarity or the spatial scales at which they operate is unknown. We used a data set of thousands of northern temperate lakes and asked (1) How does water clarity differ between a very wet vs. dry year? (2) Does the relative importance of different watershed features, or the spatial extent at which they are measured, vary between wet and dry years? (3)What lake and watershed characteristics regulate long-term water clarity trends? Among lakes, water clarity was reduced and less variable in the wet year than in the dry year; furthermore, water clarity was reduced much more in high-clarity lakes during the wet year than in low-clarity lakes. Climate, land use/land cover, and lake morphometry explained most variance in clarity among lakes in both years, but the spatial scales at which some features were important differed between the dry and wet years. Watershed percent agriculture was most important in the dry year, whereas riparian zone percent agriculture (around each lake and upstream features) was most important in the wet year. Between 1991 and 2012, water clarity declined in 23% of lakes and increased in only 6% of lakes. Conductance influenced the direction of temporal trend (clarity declined in lakes with low conductance), whereas the proportion of watershed wetlands, catchment-to-lake-area ratio, and lake maximum depth interacted with antecedent precipitation. Many predictors of water clarity, such as lake depth and landscape position, are features that cannot be readily managed. Given trends of increasing precipitation, eliminating riparian zone agriculture or keeping it <10% of area may be an effective option to maintain or improve water clarity.

Agents of change and temporal nutrient dynamics in the Altamaha River Watershed	ECOSPHERE												Nutrient and carbon dynamics in river ecosystems are shifting, and climate change is likely a driving factor; however, some previous studies indicate anthropogenic modification of natural resources may supersede the effects of climate. To understand temporal changes in river ecosystems, consideration of how these agents act independently and collectively to affect watershed biogeochemistry is necessary. Through the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long-Term Ecological Research Project, we assessed nutrient (phosphorus, nitrogen, silicate) and carbon dynamics, with specific regard to import and export, in the Altamaha River Basin from 2000 to 2012. This is the first study in the region to document the biogeochemical patterns in the Altamaha's four main tributaries, the Little Ocmulgee, Ocmulgee, Oconee, and Ohoopee rivers, and the relationships between biogeochemistry and historical precipitation and discharge patterns as well as agricultural and population census data. As discharge patterns are a primary driver of nutrient loads, we determined that water use was a dominant factor in the shifting ecosystem dynamics. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen loads were primarily driven by population density and dissolved inorganic phosphorus loads were strongly influenced by livestock biomass. Taken together, we conclude that both the transportation and biogeochemical cycling of nutrients within the Altamaha River Watershed were highly impacted by anthropogenic influences, which were then further exacerbated by continued climate change. Furthermore, the N- and P-loads in the Altamaha River and tributaries were dominated by dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved organic phosphorus, emphasizing a need to further study the bioavailability of these species and the mechanisms driving their potential ecological impacts.																	2150-8925					JAN	2017	8	1							e01519	10.1002/ecs2.1519								WOS:000396526300013

H.; Yan, Xu-Feng			Eco-hydraulic evaluation of herbaceous ecosystems below headwater dams without a base flow: Observing below dam reaches as new stream sources	ECOHYDROLOGY												The roles of headwater streams are usually underestimated and inadequately managed compared with the larger downstream river systems. This two and half-year study covering several wet and dry seasons evaluated the impacts of small headwater dams without a base flow on downstream herbaceous dynamics. Results showed herb aerial cover and diversity below dams (new stream sources) are unique and different to original stream sources as well as to a comparable unregulated reach. The geomorphological habitats formed subsequent to damming did not show major influence on aerial cover of herbs; nevertheless, diversity showed a clear dependence. Downstream of dams were dominated by Acorus gramineus, which had >40% aerial cover, and this figure increased up to 60% within 2years (in between a major flood event). Simultaneously, downstream herb diversity decreased by 33%. However, diversity and aerial cover of the unregulated reach and original sources remained more or less the same. Herb pulling tests (simulating an uprooting mechanism during a flood) showed A.gramineus can withstand an eightfold higher force than the other herbs, especially in concrete surfaces and rock/sand pools. The estimated shear force on bed during the major flood was several folds less than the observed. This suggests downstream of dams behave opposite to the conventional understanding that large floods are considered as an agent of restoration.																	1936-0584	1936-0592				JAN	2017	10	1							e1774	10.1002/eco.1774								WOS:000393870100014

Macroinvertebrate responses to flow and stream temperature variability across regulated and non-regulated rivers	ECOHYDROLOGY												Flow regulation via impoundments threatens lotic ecosystems and the services they provide globally. Impoundments drastically alter flow and stream temperature variability within fluvial environments, but efforts to quantify ecohydrological and ecothermal responses to flow regulation in conjunction have been sparsely explored to date. This study examined macroinvertebrate community responses to antecedent flow (discharge) and stream temperature variability across paired regulated and non-regulated systems associated with three reservoirs located in adjacent catchments. Community abundances, functional traits, and biomonitoring indices were examined, and ecological differences between non-regulated and regulated sites were quantified, with the most sensitive faunal response being correlated against a suite of flow and thermal indices. Regulated sites exhibited reduced low-flow variability and rapid increases in discharge during peak flows that regularly exceeded those conveyed by non-regulated sites, while stream temperature variability was highly congruent between sites. Macroinvertebrate functional traits were particularly sensitive to flow regulation, and incorporating biomonitoring indices marginally improved the ecological discrimination between regulated and non-regulated sites. Unlike community abundances, functional traits did not vary spatially between catchments, highlighting that such information could guide the implementation of regional environmental flows. Macroinvertebrate communities responded significantly to various hydrological parameters, particularly those associated with the timing of extreme flows, but were less sensitive to thermal controls. Future research should explore ecological responses to antecedent hydrological and stream temperature variability associated with flow regulation to provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving biotic alterations, which could guide future environmental flow methodologies.

In this study, correlations between cyanobacterial blooms and hydro-meteorological factors, including water quality, temperature and precipitation were investigated. Results demonstrated that South Taihu Lake was heavily affected by cyanobacteria and the proliferation of cyanobacteria due to variations in hydro-meteorological factors and water quality conditions. Water quality parameters, including COD, NH3-N, TN and TP improved significantly since 2008 even at an elevated cyanobacterial bloom situation. Correlation analyses have shown that the development of cyanobacterial density and chlorophyll a concentration was sensitive to a wider temperature variation. The optimum temperature for cyanobacteria was 20 degrees C, while extremely low and high temperatures were found to suppress their growth. Moreover, unusual rainfall patterns were measured during the study period (2003-2009), which showed an adverse impact on cyanobacterial development. Findings from this study suggested that seasonal lake's water quality monitoring; suitable treatment of cyanobacterial blooms and strict policy implementation can solve the water quality issues in highly eutrophic lakes like Taihu.																	0275-7540	1029-0370				JAN	2017	33	1					76	87		10.1080/02757540.2016.1261122								WOS:000392971400006

Eight different treatments were tested varying the presence or absence of a toxicant (NaOCl) and two disturbances: the passing of a shadow (mimicking a predator) and entrapment of the fish. The concentration tested corresponded to a sublethal (1 % 24 h-LC50) and short term exposure (2 h). A total of 56 organisms were tested resulting in 112 diagnoses (before and after the contamination). A statistical model of diagnosis was developed using Self-organizing Map (SOM) and Correspondence Analysis (CA). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false positive and false negative values were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance. The disturbances did not negatively affect the capability of the model. In the presence of at least one of these variables, the diagnostic performance was similar or even superior to the baseline results without disturbances. Furthermore, the system produced a large number of correct diagnoses, at an ecologically relevant concentration of exposure, in a non-invasive way.

A test of trophic cascade theory: fish and benthic assemblages across a predator density gradient on coral reefs	OECOLOGIA												Removal of predators is often hypothesized to alter community structure through trophic cascades. However, despite recent advances in our understanding of trophic cascades, evidence is often circumstantial on coral reefs because fishing pressure frequently co-varies with other anthropogenic effects, such as fishing for herbivorous fishes and changes in water quality due to pollution. Australia's outer Great Barrier Reef (GBR) has experienced fishing-induced declines of apex predators and mesopredators, but pollution and targeting of herbivorous fishes are minimal. Here, we quantify fish and benthic assemblages across a fishing-induced predator density gradient on the outer GBR, including apex predators and mesopredators to herbivores and benthic assemblages, to test for evidence of trophic cascades and alternative hypotheses to trophic cascade theory. Using structural equation models, we found no cascading effects from apex predators to lower trophic levels: a loss of apex predators did not lead to higher levels of mesopredators, and this did not suppress mobile herbivores and drive algal proliferation. Likewise, we found no effects of mesopredators on lower trophic levels: a decline of mesopredators was not associated with higher abundances of algae-farming damselfishes and algae-dominated reefs. These findings indicate that top-down forces on coral reefs are weak, at least on the outer GBR. We conclude that predator-mediated trophic cascades are probably the exception rather than the rule in complex ecosystems such as the outer GBR.

Spatial fit between water quality policies and hydrologic ecosystem services in an urbanizing agricultural landscape	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Sustaining hydrologic ecosystem services is critical for human wellbeing but challenged by land use for agriculture and urban development. Water policy and management strive to safeguard hydrologic services, yet implementation is often fragmented. Understanding the spatial fit between water polices and hydrologic services is needed to assess the spatial targeting of policy portfolios at landscape scales. We investigated spatial fit between 30 different public water policies and four hydrologic services (surface and groundwater quality, freshwater supply, and flood regulation) in the Yahara Watershed (Wisconsin, USA)-a Midwestern landscape that typifies tensions between agriculture, urban development, and freshwater resources. Spatial extent of water policy implementation was mapped, and indicators of hydrologic services were quantified for subwatersheds using empirical estimates and validated spatial models. We found a spatial misfit between the overall spatial implementation of water policy and regions of water quality concern, indicating a need for better targeting. Water quality policies can also be leveraged to protect other hydrologic services such as freshwater supply and flood regulation. Individual policy application areas varied substantially in their spatial congruence with each hydrologic service, indicating that not all services are protected by a single policy and highlighting the need for a broad spectrum of policies to sustain hydrologic services in diverse landscapes. We also identified where future policies could be targeted for improving hydrologic services. Joint spatial analysis of policies and ecosystem services is effective for assessing spatial aspects of institutional fit, and provides a foundation for guiding future policy efforts.

We investigated monthly nutrient concentrations at 11 stations located in the Hii River, Japan. The nitrogen and oxygen stable isotope ratios in nitrate were applied to distinguish the origin of nitrogen, i.e., from fertilizers applied to paddy fields or from sewage. Although total nitrogen (TN), presumably from transboundary air pollution, was mainly loaded during the cooler season, nitrate originating from fertilizers applied to paddy fields became the main source of nitrogen in the river water during the warmer season. Phosphorus was mainly added in particulate form, and showed increased loading at the upstream stations in the warmer season, but not in the cooler season. Potassium and magnesium-components of fertilizers-showed an increasing trend in the downstream section of the paddy fields. Our results suggest that controlled application of fertilizers is necessary to decrease the nitrogen loads originating from farmlands, particularly from paddy fields. Since the nitrogen isotope of TN in fertilizer showed significantly lower values (mean value -4.6 aEuro degrees) than that in river water (mean value 1.8 aEuro degrees) or treated water (mean value 21.9 aEuro degrees), we could use these values to determine the contribution of TN from fertilizers to river water quality, and can use them to monitor fertilization levels in watersheds.																	1860-1871	1860-188X				JAN	2017	13	1					119	129		10.1007/s11355-016-0307-5								WOS:000391940700011

Upper Susquehanna watershed and New York State improvements in nitrogen and phosphorus mass balances of dairy farms	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW) are required to reduce nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads from agriculture to achieve water quality goals for 2025. Assessing nutrient mass balances (NMBs) on farms over multiple years allows for evaluation of trends in nutrient accumulation and potential losses in geographic regions. Between 2004 and 2013, 570 NMBs were conducted for 189 dairy farms in NewYork, including 91 farms (293(.) NMBs) in the Upper Susquehanna watershed (USW), headwaters of the CBW. The average NMBs per hectare and per megagram of milk were lower for farms in the USW than statewide. Data showed a decline in NMBs per hectare over 10 years that ranged from 29% to 42% (statewide) and from 29% to 51% (for the USW dairies), depending on the nutrient, while milk production remained constant in both regions. Reductions in NMBs resulted primarily from reductions in nutrient imports, particularly through feed management. These source reductions reflect increased efficiency of production and reduced risk of N and P loss to the CBW. Extrapolation of comparisons in NMBs between 2004 and 2013 suggest that dairies in the USW reduced total N and P imports by 30% and 20%, respectively, contributing to a 29% to 50% decrease in total N pool and 51% decrease in P pool. We conclude that USW dairy farms can deliver up to 49% of their 2013 N pool and up to 72% of their 2013 P pool at the edge of the farms (their NMB) and still meet the total maximum daily load (TMDL) for N and P set for 2025 for New York agriculture. This study illustrates that significant nutrient source reduction can be obtained by implementing nutrient conservation practices, such as precision feeding and fertilizer management, combined with annual assessment of whole farm balances. Such a reduction in nutrient imports onto farms results in a reduction of the pool of nutrients available for accumulation in the soil or direct loss to water bodies and the atmosphere.																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JAN-FEB	2017	72	1					1	11		10.2489/jswc.72.1.1								WOS:000391160500003

Relationship between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity at construction sites	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Stormwater runoff from construction sites can transport eroded sediment to nearby water bodies, degrading water quality and impairing biotic communities. Turbidity is a relatively easy characteristic to measure and can be used to estimate sediment loads from construction sites if reliable relationships between turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) are established. These relationships are investigated in this study for construction sites in Minnesota. Laboratory protocols have been developed herein for studying the factors that impact turbidity from construction site soils. Experimental procedures include the use of a rainfall simulator to generate runoff and turbidity values from soils carefully packed in appropriate test boxes. Turbidity characteristics of 14 different soils from construction sites were investigated using the laboratory protocols. Trends in turbidity with sediment concentrations were well represented by power functions. The exponent of these power functions was relatively constant between soils. The log-intercept, or scaling parameter, varied substantially among the different soils. Multiple soil properties were evaluated for each soil. An extensive regression analysis resulted in a model using percentage silt, interrill erodibility, and maximum abstraction that best represented the intercept term. A power value of 7/5 was chosen to represent all soils..																	0022-4561	1941-3300				JAN-FEB	2017	72	1					26	35		10.2489/jswc.72.1.26								WOS:000391160500005

Assessing the potential impacts of WWTP effluent reductions within the Reedy River watershed	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The Reedy River Basin originates along the northern fringe of the Greenville Metro Area and flows southward through downtown Greenville and continues for about 40 miles through increasingly rural lands until it empties into Lake Greenwood. This project evaluated the potential downstream impact to the Reedy River, Boyd Millpond, and Lake Greenwood from the removal of 100% of the effluent generated from various wastewater treatment plants along the river. Evaluation was performed using the Reedy River Model which is a combination of different programs including the EPA's Loading Simulation Program in C++ (LSPC) and the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP). Both water quality and quantity were analyzed as part of this study. The nitrogen and phosphorus species investigated in this study were total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Simulation runs were conducted for the Reedy River Model holding all original parameters constant to those used in the TMDL analysis. The second simulation consisted of eliminating wastewater treatment plants from the model to simulate 100% removal of their wastewater effluent. To reflect dry, wet, and average years of rainfall, seven years of actual weather data for Greenville County were used within these simulation runs. Flow was modeled from the headwaters to the Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. River sections analyzed included the river section immediately upstream and downstream of the wastewater treatment plant locations and Boyd Millpond and Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. Removal of effluent resulted in a reduced average flow at Boyd Millpond from 8.52 m(3)/s (301.23 cfs) to 7.34 m(3)/s (259.21 cfs), a reduction in flow of 14%; and reduced average flow at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood from 9.15 m3/s (323.13 cfs) to 7.97 m3/s (281.46 cfs), a reduction in flow of 12.9%. The removal of wastewater effluent had the greatest impact during periods of minimum flow when effluent makes up the largest percentage of total flow. During periods of drought, effluent removal resulted in a reduction in flow of almost 70% at the upper wastewater treatment plant, 66% at the lower wastewater treatment plant, 59% at Boyd Millpond, and 55% at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. Based on daily flow values averaged over seven years, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentration and mass loads at Boyd Millpond and Reedy Arm will both decrease by approximately 50% with the elimination of effluent. This report only considers the impacts of effluent removal to flow, total phosphorus and total nitrogen as modeled by LSPC and WASP. Other variables that may be influenced from effluent removal include, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, fecal matter, heavy metals, water temperature, habitat quality, species diversity, macroinvertabrates, recreational uses, and economic impacts but are not included in this study.

J	Cao, QQ; Wang, H; Chen, XC; Wang, RQ; Liu, J				Cao, Qingqing; Wang, Hui; Chen, Xiaocui; Wang, Renqing; Liu, Jian			Composition and distribution of microbial communities in natural river wetlands and corresponding constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Microbial community plays an important role in wetland ecosystem. To explore the composition and distribution of microbial communities in different wetland types, sediments from different sites of Xinxue River (XR) and Zhaoniu River (ZR), and the corresponding Xinxue River Constructed Wetland (XRCW) and Zhaoniu River Constructed Wetland (ZRCW) were sampled and analyzed using high throughput sequencing. The constructed wetlands were found to have more taxa of microbes in sediments than their corresponding river wetlands. The community richness index suggests that microbial richness in XR and XRCW is higher than that in ZR and ZRCW. High potential of sulfur cycle in XRCW is suggested by the superior distribution of Desulfobacterales, Syntrophobacterales orders, and Thiobacillus genus of Proteobacteria. Moreover, ZRCW has relatively lower nitrification ability than other three wetlands according to the distribution of Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Acidobacteria phyla. XR and XRCW show high potential of methanogenesis as the distribution of Methanomicrobia order in Archaea. ZRCW is suggested in a state that organic carbon mineralization exceeds aggregation, denitrification exceeds nitrification based on different distributions of the functional bacteria (such as Nitrospirae, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes). Furthermore, it indicates that ammonia removal process in ZRCW sediments is mostly limited to nitrification. This study demonstrated that wetland functions can be detected by the composition and distribution of microbial communities and influenced by the pollution status and surroundings probably. Our results are essential for understanding the interrelationship between microbial distribution and the pollution status of wetlands for the evaluation of constructed wetland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kimura, A; Baptista, MB; Scotti, MR				Kimura, Andrei; Baptista, Marcio B.; Scotti, Maria Rita			Soil humic acid and aggregation as restoration indicators of a seasonally flooded riparian forest under buffer zone system	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A degraded riparian forest that has lost vegetation and has suffered periodic flooding was rehabilitated using native species under buffer zone system which was stratified according to the distance from the river (Zones I, II, III). To restore the soil stabilisation and water flow we compared the soil aggregation, porosity and soil humic substances of the experimental site (ES) with those of a disturbed site (DS) and a preserved site (PS). Six years post-transplantation, soil aggregation and micro-porosity were improved in the ES relative to the DS, but only micro-porosity achieved a pattern similar to that of the PS in Zone III. Differences in soil aggregation between ES and PS were correlated with the negative effect promoted by a high aliphatic-humic acid composition in Zone I and by an undifferentiated distribution of fulvic acid among sites which were attributed to the flooding effect. Similarities among ES and PS were related to aromatic:vinylhumic acid ratio, allowing for the clustering of samples from Zones II and III of both the PS and the ES, via a principal component analysis. Samples from Zones I of ES and PS were separated driven by aliphatic and fulvic acid contributions, while all of the DS samples formed an isolated group under the influence of aliphatic species and macro-porosity. Based on these attributes, the ES is evolving towards the PS, and the rehabilitation process has attained an intermediate phase of restoration. The zones system adopted for riparian forest restoration allowed the use of soil humic substances, aggregates and micro-porosity as indicators of restoration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal variation in nutrient removal efficiency of a boreal wetland detected by high-frequency on-line monitoring	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	York, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc				Wetlands play an important role in reducing nutrient loads to receiving waters. The efficiency of a wetland in nutrient removal is commonly evaluated from discrete water samples taken at the inflow and at the outflow of the target wetland. In order to reveal variation in removal efficiency we carried out one year of high-frequency monitoring (HFM) of water quality and quantity at a wetland established at the mouth of an urban/agricultural watershed in boreal southern Finland. Data collected at the inflow and outflow of the 0,5 ha wetland was used to determine the range of total phosphorus (TP) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations. The incoming and outgoing TP and NO3-N loads were calculated and the relative and absolute reduction rates were determined. The wetland received 24 g P m(-2) year(-1) and 130 g NO3-N m(-2) year(-1) and it retained 3.1 g m(-2) year(-1) of P and 18 g m(-2) year(-1) of NO3-N. Annual TP reduction was 13% and NO3-N reduction 14%. The relative removal efficiency of TP was found to be dependent on retention time and NO3-N removal efficiency was dependent on temperature, oxygen concentration, NO3-N concentration and discharge.

Sedimentation and resuspension modelling in free water surface constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	York, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc				Eutrophication is a widespread problem that is being tackled from many perspectives and the recently applied technology of constructed wetlands is being used in the treatment of eutrophic water. However, process-based models to simulate their performance are scarce, so in this work a mechanistic model was developed to simulate the removal of total suspended solids, phytoplankton and total phosphorus in free water surface constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water. The model represents the influence of the main factors of the biotope and biota on these water quality variables, and particular attention is paid to resuspension produced by wind and by avifauna. Likewise, the effect of emergent vegetation cover in sedimentation, resuspension and phytoplankton growth is included. Phytoplankton is considered to store phosphorus internally in order to use it when growing, and the contribution of phytoplankton concentration to the suspended solids budget is included. The software AQUASIM was used to calibrate and validate the model in two full-scale constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water from Lake l'Albufera de Valencia (Spain) for three years. The simulated data and field measurements showed satisfactory adjustments for the three studied variables. The budgets obtained for each variable reveal that sedimentation and resuspension are the main processes in total suspended solids performance. Sedimentation of organic particulate phosphorus is the most important process in total phosphorus removal. The sum of the effect of resuspension by avifauna and by wind increases by more than 50% the quantity of solids that enters the water column. The model reveals that simulating the effects of the emergent vegetation cover and resuspension is crucial for representing the performance of the studied variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The adoption of an on-site treatment by Constructed Wetlands for the Combined Sewer Overflows is an example of decentralized approach for the optimization of the existing sewer networks and the needed reduction of their impacts on the water quality of the receiving water bodies. The CW system, that is treating the first flush of the overflows, is joined with an extended retention basin that is acting as a tertiary treatment for the CW effluents and is also storing and treating the whole second flush, slowing down by a throttle the discharge in the river and therefore playing a role in the flooding risk control. During the monitored time interval 69 events of overflow discharges have been observed and quantified; this quantification of the total volumes discharged by the specific CSO have been useful for evaluating the approach performances also in terms of mass loads in a single year, that is in the author's opinion a more conservative evaluation than comparing only the average concentrations removal rates. The obtained results have shown that on-site treatment for the first flush by CWs can obtain appropriate performances, as demonstrated by the about 87% and 93% of removal for COD and NH4+ respectively in terms of concentrations and the 68% and 94% in terms of mass loads in a year. A relevant analysis of the sampling program and the secondary services provided by this specific artificial ecosystems are discussed in the paper, together with a unique characterization of the role of the specific sources (washout, urban wastewater) to the loads that are reaching the on-site treatment unit.

Dry conditions disrupt terrestrial-aquatic linkages in northern catchments	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Aquatic ecosystems depend on terrestrial organic matter (tOM) to regulate many functions, such as food web production and water quality, but an increasing frequency and intensity of drought across northern ecosystems is threatening to disrupt this important connection. Dry conditions reduce tOM export and can also oxidize wetland soils and release stored contaminants into stream flow after rainfall. Here, we test whether these disruptions to terrestrial-aquatic linkages occur during mild summer drought and whether this affects biota across 43 littoral zone sites in 11 lakes. We use copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) as representative contaminants, and measure abundances of Hyalella azteca, a widespread indicator of ecosystem condition and food web production. We found that tOM concentrations were reduced but correlations with organic soils (wetlands and riparian forests) persisted during mild drought and were sufficient to suppress labile Cu concentrations. Wetlands, however, also became a source of labile Ni to littoral zones, which was linked to reduced abundances of the amphipod H. azteca, on average by up to 70 times across the range of observed Ni concentrations. This reveals a duality in the functional linkage of organic soils to aquatic ecosystems whereby they can help buffer the effects of hydrologic disconnection between catchments and lakes but at the cost of biogeochemical changes that release stored contaminants. As evidence of the toxicity of trace contaminant concentrations and their global dispersion grows, sustaining links among forests, organic soils and aquatic ecosystems in a changing climate will become increasingly important.

Environmental externalities of urban river pollution and restoration: A hedonic analysis in Guangzhou (China)	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												The degradation of urban river ecosystems presents a serious threat to sustainable urban development. Consequently, extensive efforts have been devoted to the ecological restoration of urban rivers worldwide. This study evaluates the environmental externalities associated with water pollution and river restoration in Guangzhou in southern China. A basic hedonic pricing model is applied to test hypotheses using a sample of 968 apartment transaction records during July-December 2013. Results show that river restoration could reverse negative externalities of polluted watercourses to positive externalities, especially for those apartments located on the 10th floor or lower. Water quality improvement from polluted non-recreational water (Grade V or worse) to non-body contact recreational water (Grade IV) could increase apartment values by 0.9%. River restoration (including river bank greening and water quality improvement) could increase property values by 4.61%, demonstrating a preference of Guangzhou residents for greening riverscapes. This study could hopefully provide a scientific basis for urban river governance for communities and decision-makers, and serve as a reference case to elucidate human preferences about river restoration in rapidly developing countries.

New Zealand is addressing this issue by regulating land-based nutrient losses, with debates over how to allocate limits across a heterogeneous landscape. We develop a spatially explicit economic land use model to investigate efficiency and equity issues from seven approaches to allocate nutrient discharges across two New Zealand watersheds. We find that the preferred allocation differs across land use, land characteristics, and regulation stringency; and that there is no universal 'best' allocation option. Therefore, decision-makers should focus on, at least, efficiency and equity, and on how to compensate those most affected. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
