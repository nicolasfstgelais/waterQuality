Performance of a Baffled Membrane Bioreactor (BMBR) Operated with Sponge Biomass Carriers: Substantial Reduction in Operational Energy	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			The authors have proposed a baffled membrane bioreactor (BMBR) that can eliminate the energy needed for the mixed liquor circulation. A combination of the BMBR concept and use of biomass carriers is promising, and a substantial reduction in energy consumption should be possible. In this study, a pilot-scale BMBR treating municipal wastewater was operated with sponge biomass carriers and its performance was investigated in terms of treated water quality and energy consumption (aeration intensity). Long-term operation of the BMBR revealed that aeration demand for the BMBR was substantially reduced with minimal membrane fouling and excellent nitrogen removal being achieved. The expected energy consumption (aeration intensity) in a full-scale BMBR operated with sponge carriers is very low, definitely lower than the values in "normal" MBRs. With the proposed modification of the MBR, processes using MBRs will no longer be considered to be energy-intensive processes.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						153	158		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_23								WOS:000430181700023

This promising process relying on a dense FO membrane and osmotic gradient demonstrated higher rejections of all contaminants and lower fouling propensity than for MBR. The concept that we developed aims at (partially) retrofit existing MBR into OMBR. In addition to the use of existing MBR installation, such process also allows for combined operation of MBR and OMBR to avoid salinity build-up and to be flexible/reversible in term of operation in MBR/OMBR modes to fit with (seasonal) water quality needs. The study presented aimed at validating the proof of concept of such retrofitting which includes also the development of OMBR/FO module with similar performance than MBR/UF ones. As such, OMBR plate were designed based on Kubota MF cartridge 203 design and using new generation of thin film composite FO membrane. Then, pilot tests were conducted using a 50L MBR/OMBR pilot for two months. Stable operation was obtained in terms of depuration efficiency and water flux. Salinity build up occurred in the reactor, but conductivity was maintained below 3 mS.cm(-1) thanks to the salt purge via the MBR permeate. Fouling was observed both for MBR and OMBR operation; however, for OMBR, osmotic backwash every 3 days allowed for complete removal of the fouling layer. Finally, 90% rejection of all pharmaceuticals compounds tested was observed in OMBR operation as a result of combined biological degradation and high rejection of FO membranes.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						188	192		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_29								WOS:000430181700029

Removal of Conventional Water Quality Parameters, Emerging Contaminants and Fluorescing Organic Matter in a Hybrid Constructed Wetland System	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			Constructed wetlands (CWs) are nature-based wastewater treatment systems, which are often implemented in decentralized areas and small communities. In recent decades, the CW technology has rapidly evolved through the use of various designs and operational modes or other intensifications so as to improve effluent water quality with respect to various pollutants from wastewater. In the present study, the removal of conventional water quality parameters, emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) and fluorescence signature was investigated in a hybrid constructed wetland system comprising different CW configurations: (i) unsaturated vertical subsurface flow (VF), (ii) partial saturated vertical subsurface flow (VF sat), (iii) saturated horizontal flow (HF) and (iv) free water surface (FWS) wetlands. The obtained results showed higher removal of BOD5, COD and fluorescing organic matter in the aerobic VF reactor, whereas the anoxic HF wetland was the most efficient unit for nitrogen removal. The partially saturated VF wetland showed a greater performance in the reduction of nitrogen and highly biodegradable EOCs than the unsaturated VF bed. Finally, linear regression analyses performed between removal of water quality parameters, EOCs and fluorescence measurements suggested the possibility to use fluorescence indexes as useful indicators of water treatment efficacy and/or surrogate parameters for EOCs monitoring.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						313	317		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_50								WOS:000430181700050

REWAQUA: An Advanced Technology for Water Purification in Sustainable Aquaculture Based on Photocatalytic Ozonation	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			The present study has been undertaken in order to test the real potential of photocatalytic ozonation in a bench-scale recirculating aquaculture system working on a 180 L reef coral aquarium. Notably, this choice may be considered representative. In fact, (i) the system is virtually closed so that fresh water turnover is practically negligible, (ii) the presence of living organisms is highly diversified (corals, fishes, molluscs, echinoderms and crustaceans) and some of them are particularly sensitive to water quality, (iii) high salinity strongly puts a strain on the purification system. The hereby presented purification method has been named REWAQUA, which stands for REcycling Water for AQUAculture and AQUAria. REWAQUA allows purification rates higher than the sum of the rates of the single technologies (photocatalysis and ozonation) operating in series. Furthermore the production of bromate ions, which are carcinogenic by-products of ozonation, is efficiently controlled. Two years observation of the reef coral aquarium reveals that photocatalytic ozonation is a good candidate for water purification in recirculating systems in view of a sustainable aquaculture.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						318	323		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_51								WOS:000430181700051

Applications of Mobile Carrier Biofilm Modelling for Wastewater Treatment Processes	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			One-dimensional (1-D) biofilm models have been demonstrated reliable for specific types of biofilm reactor design. Limitations using mechanistic biofilm models for engineering design do not rely on improved biofilm models, but rely on improved biofilm reactor models. This is important when considering that biofilm reactors containing submerged, free-moving biofilm carriers are the most widely applied biofilm system(s) for municipal wastewater treatment. This paper presents a new biofilm reactor model that considers the impact of submerged free-moving biofilm carrier (Xcarrier) movement on system performance. The model accounts for a hydrodynamic condition characterized as plug flow with back mixing (to model axial dispersion). The relevance of this new biofilm reactor model to engineering situations is evaluated by applying it to relevant scenarios and comparing model results.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						508	512		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_79								WOS:000430181700079

Reshaping the Activated Sludge Model ASM2d for Better Manageability and Higher Integration Potential	FRONTIERS IN WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND MODELLING, FICWTM 2017	Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering				Frontiers International Conference on Wastewater Treatment (FICWTM)	MAY 21-24, 2017	Univ Palermo, Palermo, ITALY	Int Water Assoc	Univ Palermo			The European Water Framework Directive has pointed out that the best model for water management is management by river basin. However, to obtain an overview of the water quality in a river basin system, one has to look at the individual components of the system such as the sewer network, the wastewater treatment plant and the receiving water bodies and the interaction between them. Within this study, we develop an adjusted model from the original state-of-the-art activated sludge ASM2d model with as main focus to maximize the compatibility with the sewage and river water quality models while still assuring a sufficient prediction capacity of the activated sludge system. To this end, and to avoid the commonly required fractionation into the classic activated sludge model state variables, the latter are directly derived from the outputs of the sewage model (e.g., BOD5, COD, TN or TP) for the adjusted model. Furthermore, the modified ASM2d model is made more realistic and can be more broadly applied due to the re-introduction of organic nitrogen and phosphorus component state variables. While developed on the basis of the data of a wastewater treatment plant in Belgium, the validation of the adjusted model on a data set of a wastewater treatment plant in Girona (Spain) is highly promising.																	2366-2557		978-3-319-58421-8; 978-3-319-58420-1				2017	4						583	587		10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_91								WOS:000430181700091

Nowadays, many hydropower systems confront with infiltration through dams or lateral dikes, followed by unexpected erosions. In order to maintain the hydropower system active, the water level is drastically reduced, sometimes even with 10 m. Consequently, it means less water for the human necessities (water supply, irrigation), but mainly few resources to produce electric energy. The research paper starts by presenting the actual dams situation, structured on hydrographic basins. For the case study two hydropower lakes from Arges-Vedea hydrographic area that confront seepage through embankments were selected. In that area there are more than 100 lakes which confront with different functioning problems. The local geomorphologic structure and the water quality create an image of local functioning conditions. Further, there are briefly presented the mathematical and numerical models, elaborated as to establish the infiltration risk zones. The numerical model is tested and calibrated based on local conditions, showing the zone with erosion and infiltration risks. Finally, some conclusions, possibilities to extend the numerical model, the acknowledgements, and references are presented.																							2017							77	84		10.21698/simi.2017.0010								WOS:000430609800010

It is known that the contamination was induced by the industrial activities carried out in the area, which is caused by sulfur dioxide air emissions and atmospheric particulate matters containing heavy metals, mainly cadmium, lead and zinc. The pollution of the city and the neighboring areas was mainly due to activities of two companies: SC Sometra SA (with a non-ferrous metallurgy profile, which before 1990 was considered the largest unit in the country) and SC Carbosin SA (with a chemical profile until its closing, in 1993). The assessment of the quality level of the environmental factors was carried out in 2016 through specific activities for soil and water quality investigation - sampling and physico-chemical analysis in R&D Institute for Industrial Ecology ECOIND laboratories, in order to highlight relevant elements of environmental quality of the above mentioned year, within a pre-established experimental field and targeting the limited area of the Copsa Mica city. As an important aspect, it is worth mentioning that the footprint of the pollution sources is still present in the area, even long after their activity has ceased. It is estimated that a soil and water monitoring could establish a dynamics of the quality parameters in the Copsa Mica area during the subsequent periods.																							2017							128	133		10.21698/simi.2017.0016								WOS:000430609800016

Poor water quality has adverse effects on human health and aquatic life. Hence, protecting the water resources from pollutants and the monitoring of water quality is important. In recent years, some kind of methods such as water quality index model, regression analysis, factor analysis, principal component analysis, cluster analysis, etc. has been developed for easy assessment and interpretation of large amount of water quality data. Among these methods, multivariate statistical analysis has an advantage of giving an idea about possible sources of pollution. In this study, the assessment of water quality of 10 different sampling station in Kirmir Basin which is one of the most significant drinking water resources of Ankara, the capital city of Turkey has been investigated by using multivariate statistical methods (principal component analysis-PCA and factor analysis-FA). 18 water quality parameters were analysed for each sampling station and used for the statistical analysis. The correlations between parameters and sampling stations were evaluated by using statistical techniques in terms of underlying factors. FA/PCA identified water quality parameters in five groups. The results revealed that Kirmir Basin was mainly affected from agricultural activities, urban land uses and livestock activities. The improving of the water quality in this region can be achieved by controlling these activities.																							2017							197	204		10.21698/simi.2017.0025								WOS:000430609800025

In many cases, the spills are not controlled and are not decontaminated properly or even at all. In the Jiu hydrographic basin, there are 225 localities with a population of more than 2,000 peoples. Only 32 of them are equipped with sewer systems and only 2 of them in accordance with Directive 91/271/EEC. As consequence of the pollution with organic and inorganic substances (nutrients) has appeared the eutrophication of the lakes. From the total 12-hydropower lakes with a surface over 50 ha, eight of them are clogged in the proportion of 60%, and 3 of them in a proportion of 80%. In the first part of the paper are analyzed the main punctual and diffuse sources of organic and inorganic pollution, with a decisive factor in the development of the aquatic vegetation. During 2010-2016, a systematic campaign of measurements was done. They were determined the protection zones that need to be tracked, the catchments zone for the human consumption, the zones for protected fish or of those species economically important, the natural protected areas, and the zones vulnerable to nitrate and nitrites. The obtained results are presented for the most affected hydropower lakes from the selected area. Finally, are mentioned some possibilities and measures necessary to be followed as to reduce the inorganic and organic pollution, some conclusions, acknowledgement and references.																							2017							221	228		10.21698/simi.2017.0028								WOS:000430609800028

In a community, the state of the environment is influenced by both the quality and the quantity of water resources. The state of the environment is also given by measures to protect water resources in other areas such as energy, transport, agriculture, fisheries and tourism. The supply of drinking water is influenced by water quality. A prudent and rational use of natural resources, including water resources, can help preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment. Water management and use of water resources are very important. The importance is the multiple use of water. This may lead to deterioration in the qualitative parameters of water resources. This raises the issue of implementing rehabilitation and development measures for wastewater management systems. The application of modern and non-polluting technologies can lead to pollution prevention. In many areas, it is used in addition to surface water and groundwater. From this point of view, the article presents an analysis of the quality of surface waters and groundwater. Globalization has favoured technological transfer from developed countries to developing countries. Given the economic development of a country, globalization has made the role of human capital grow. It also had an effect on competitiveness. The article presents the evolution of the population served by the public water supply system, respectively the quantity of drinking water distributed to the consumers. In a globalized economy, increasing competitiveness is based on knowledge.																							2017							330	337		10.21698/simi.2017.0043								WOS:000430609800043

Founded in the early 1930's it is now home of more than 160000 inhabitants, and it is characterized by low water quality, poor housing, lack of drainage and sanitation systems, and of green and public spaces. This paper presents the preliminary results of a joint research project between the Politecnico di Milano and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) for the improvement of the urban quality, health, livability and inclusiveness of Rocinha, that moves from an upgrading process of the environmental performance of the existing built environment. The project, in the frame the social responsibility program of Politecnico di Milano (Polisocial), is based on a multidisciplinary and integrated design methodology named IMM (Integrated Modification Methodology). The research aims to demonstrate that in a planet where the informal settlements are exponentially growing, strategies to improve the quality of life of their inhabitants are possible, and preliminary results, mostly achieved in the diagnostic phase of the process, are presented. Rocinha is seen as a complex system that has been investigated in its own morphological structure and the related environmental performance, focusing on: climate and energy, ecosystem services, waste management and their relation with urban morphology. This phase opens up to the next phases, specifically the intervention and retrofitting, that intend to select intervention areas and priorities and then to objectively size the implementation in Rocinha.

State monitoring system of quality of water was discussed and critically reviewed. Mobile measurements technique to collect vast number of measuring points across the large water body during one day cruise to make maps of pollutants distributions was described. Maps of water quality parameters show dynamic changes of spatial distributions of pollutants both in time and along the length of the lake which proves that one point measurements cannot be representative for the large water body. Critical evaluation of calibration principles and accuracy of the most frequently used water quality models, WASP and GEMSS are presented. On the basis of CFD calculations, close correlation between water quality and hydrodynamics in large water bodies regarding the physicochemical aspects and biological production was proved. Neglecting the effect of hydrodynamic on eutrophication process introduce large element of uncertainty in determination of nutrients flow in the large water bodies.

Automated Aquaculture System that Regulates Ph, Temperature and Ammonia	2017 IEEE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMANOID, NANOTECHNOLOGY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION AND CONTROL, ENVIRONMENT AND MANAGEMENT (IEEE HNICEM)	IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Nanotechnology Information Technology Communication and Control Environment and Management				9th IEEE International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management (IEEE HNICEM)	NOV 29-DEC 03, 2017	Pasay, PHILIPPINES	IEEE, IEEE Philippines				The current method of raising tilapia in the Philippines is through fish ponds exposed to the weather. Methods for measuring pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia are limited to manually using a chemical test kit. The current system relies on manually regulating the water quality so the fish are at risk of harmful situations resulting from unsafe levels of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, or ammonia. This study aims to solve that problem by creating a system that automatically measures and regulates the pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia. This study takes advantage of electronic sensors for pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen, while computing the ammonia factor, to allow the user to measure the levels of the said parameters at any given time, process, send the data to a LabVIEW database, and use the data to automatically take corrective action against harmful levels of pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ammonia while notifying the user through SMS. The proponents of this study built the prototype and tested it on two different trials of 50 fingerlings each in a 1 cubic-meter glass aquarium.																	2475-7152		978-1-5386-0912-5				2017																		WOS:000426116300075

Development and Implementation of Low Cost Salinity and Temperature Monitoring System for Mangrove Forest	2017 IEEE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMANOID, NANOTECHNOLOGY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION AND CONTROL, ENVIRONMENT AND MANAGEMENT (IEEE HNICEM)	IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Nanotechnology Information Technology Communication and Control Environment and Management				9th IEEE International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management (IEEE HNICEM)	NOV 29-DEC 03, 2017	Pasay, PHILIPPINES	IEEE, IEEE Philippines				Mangrove population has greatly reduced in several countries such as Philippines due to different factors such as clearing, overharvesting and water quality changes. The third factor includes the high level of salinity which is a great threat for the mangroves. With that, the researcher of this study came up with a low cost salinity monitoring system with temperature sensors. The said sensor node determines whether the salinity of the water exceeds the acceptable level (10,000 ppm) and upon encountered, the floodgates represented by the water pump will be controlled to open for the freshwater to flow from reservoirs. The flow of freshwater will stop by closing the floodgates as the sensor nodes determine that salinity level is now reduced to the acceptable ppm range. The low cost salinity sensor is based on the magnetic induction concept of the two sets of coils which are in toroidal and solenoid in forms. Zigbee will be the communications network of the sensors, the Arduino microcontroller and the water pump control system. System was deployed in two areas: the mangrove forest and non-mangrove located in Barangay Calibuyo, Tanza, Cavite. With the results, it's proven that the created salinity sensor has correlated results with the commercial one. Also, temperature has inverse relationship with the water salinity. Lastly, the control of the motor based on the threshold has proven 100% working as checked with different water samples.																	2475-7152		978-1-5386-0912-5				2017																		WOS:000426116300018

Water Quality Parameter Correlation in a Controlled Aquaculture Environment	2017 IEEE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMANOID, NANOTECHNOLOGY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION AND CONTROL, ENVIRONMENT AND MANAGEMENT (IEEE HNICEM)	IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Nanotechnology Information Technology Communication and Control Environment and Management				9th IEEE International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management (IEEE HNICEM)	NOV 29-DEC 03, 2017	Pasay, PHILIPPINES	IEEE, IEEE Philippines				Measurement accuracy is important in any field of study. This work presents the effect of water quality parameters with each other in a controlled aquaculture environment, which can be used to ensure data reliability. The water quality parameters that are considered are temperature, pH and flow rate. Experimentations were done using tap water to correlate the effect of change in temperature with pH, and the effect of varying flow rate with pH and temperature. The parameter correlation was computed using linear regression. Raspberry Pi was used as the system microcomputer that integrates all the parameters being investigated. Throughout the study, water level was maintained in a desired level, and was ensured by integrating a water level sensor into the system. The alternative hypothesis stated that pH and temperature have strong negative relationship with each other. Experiment results shown that pH has inversely proportional relationship with temperature. The null hypothesis stated that flow rate has no effect on water pH and temperature. External factors like water source also has an effect on parameter values changes.																	2475-7152		978-1-5386-0912-5				2017																		WOS:000426116300010

BIODIVERSITY SUSTAINABILITY USING TELEMETRY FOR THE REMOTE TRANSMISSION OF DATA FROM LAKE BUHI, CAMARINES SUR	2017 IEEE 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMANOID, NANOTECHNOLOGY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATION AND CONTROL, ENVIRONMENT AND MANAGEMENT (IEEE HNICEM)	IEEE International Conference on Humanoid Nanotechnology Information Technology Communication and Control Environment and Management				9th IEEE International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment and Management (IEEE HNICEM)	NOV 29-DEC 03, 2017	Pasay, PHILIPPINES	IEEE, IEEE Philippines				The biodiversity remediation strategies currently used at Lake Buhi, Camarines Sur shows that new techniques are required to solve the problems of decreasing level of dissolved oxygen, increasing carbon dioxide and varying pH values. One such technique that could be used involved the use of telemetry for the remote transmission of data. This method used reactive media, particularly the sensors, to evaluate contaminated lake water. The aims of this study were to develop a telemetric device for real time monitoring and identification of water quality problems; develop a complementary program using Visual Basic and microchip that could remotely monitor water quality through the use of a GSM module; and perform comparative evaluation of the results derived from the device with the results produced by the conventional methods. The comparative evaluations of the results derived from the device were in congruence with the existing method. Its lower variance proved the greater precision of the proposed device. Hence, the telemetry device could be considered as an alternative to the existing device and can be adopted for use by the different LGUs in the province for a more efficient monitoring of water quality in the province.																	2475-7152		978-1-5386-0912-5				2017																		WOS:000426116300099

It explores the preferences of residents in the Eurometropole de Strasbourg (France), with the aim of redefining priorities for sewer network asset management. Valuation is performed using the contingent ranking method and results are compared to a recoded choice experiment. Comparison of results from both methods reveals that price influences the ranking of the different alternatives given to the respondents, but does not influence respondents' preferred alternative. In other words, the price of the alternatives is only considered by respondents later in the decision process. For residents, the trade-offs between the potential disruption caused by a network malfunction favour the reduction of the risk of flooding (either in terms of their frequency or attained water levels). These findings highlight the challenges of asset management.																	1466-2132	1741-511X					2017	20	3-4					163	182		10.1504/IJETM.2017.10010689								WOS:000424335700003

Also, the migration of CO2 through heterogeneous subsurface is very difficult to predict because small differences in material properties may result in vastly different migration patterns. Therefore, like other environmental contaminants, it is necessary to design optimized groundwater monitoring network to effectively characterize the migration of the CO2. Main objectives of this study is to construct optimized groundwater monitoring network considering hydrogeological characteristics in field-scale transport of CO2 originated from artificially-injected CO2 at the environmental impact monitoring test site in Eumseong, Korea (K-COSEM). 24 monitoring wells were installed at the site aligned with the regional groundwater flow direction. Various hydraulic tests were performed to estimate the hydraulic characteristics such as hydraulic conductivity, effective porosity, and groundwater velocity. Groundwater monitoring network for CO2 injection and leak test constructed with regard of the heterogeneity understood through the various field tests. Three multidepth monitoring well nests each of them was composed of four monitoring well units drilled with different depths (each 18, 22, 26, 30 m deep) have been installed along the groundwater flow direction and dedicated to depth-discrete water quality monitoring in saturated zone. Additional, four multi-depth monitoring well nests each of them was composed of four unsaturated-zone monitoring well units drilled with different depths (each 5, 8, 11, 14 m deep) were also installed with a distance of 1.25 m away between saturated zone monitoring wells and were dedicated to depth-discrete gas monitoring in unsaturated zone. By these efforts, effective groundwater monitoring network for temporal and spatial CO2 leakage detection and groundwater safety management have been designed and constructed at the test site.

Detection and understanding of natural CO2 releases in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GREENHOUSE GAS CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES, GHGT-13	Energy Procedia				13th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies (GHGT)	NOV 14-18, 2016	Lausanne, SWITZERLAND					Natural carbon dioxide (CO2) emanates from a number of sites along a N-S trend that coincides with a mapped fault near the village of Bongwana in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. In addition to the natural CO2 seeps a groundwater well drilled on a farm in Bongwana encountered CO2 and now leaks. Thus the Bongwana sites provide excellent analogues for failed CO2 storage under the two primary leakage scenarios; 1) abrupt leakage through injection well failure or leakage up an abandoned well, and 2) gradual leakage, through undetected faults, fractures or wells.

The study of many sources of relief can allow the characterization of important water reserves. The hydrogeological study on the relationship and operation of five sources (Ain Troubia, El Megalib, Gaagaa, Youkous and Ain Sarie) located in different altitudes and spaced fairly large distances. The flow variation is a function of time and the precipitation shows a resemblance characterized by curves generally affected by certain peaks. The followed hydrochemical of the five source showed the same chemical facies which is calcic to magnesian bicarbonated with predominance of the first facies; except the source of Ain Sari is composed of calcic chlorinated. The evolution of the contents of the chemical elements is due to the increase in the flow of the sources after the period of flood which demonstrates the effect of the behavior of the karst area.

This last represents a real source of environmental pollution. This study aims to identify this pollution and its risks. Therefore, physico-chemical analyses were performed on leachates and water of the plain, which is located in the downstream of the landfill representing a direct relation with a highly sensitive ecosystem of the Fetzara Lake. A sampling campaign and analysis (pH, Eh, T, EC, major ions, heavy metals) were performed on all points (wells, boreholes and leachates). The mapping of hydrochemical elements allows the understanding of the pollution mechanisms and their origins. The use of LWPI as a tool for identifying hazards show that the leachate have a significant impact on water quality of the study area. A diagnosis of risks on public health has been achieved using the RI as hazard index. Results indicates few scenarios of water uses and show the significant influence of the old landfill site on the quality of water and the degradation of people's lives. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The solar still is one such method that has received notable revived attention recently. Research primarily focused on enhancing the productivity of the still with a very limited number of studies addressing the water quality issue of the distillate produced by the still, as it is often assumed that this distillate is safe to consume without proper analysis. In addition a very limited number of studies have examined the ability of the still to remove conventional and emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals. The objective of this paper is to address the bacteriological and chemical aspects of the distillate produced from a number of different water sources using several experimental setups. Results show that moderate temperature alone is not sufficient to kill bacteria hence the importance of ultra-violet light from solar radiation. It is also important that all parts of the still be accessible to sunlight to avoid bacterial breeding at shaded sections. Chemical quality parameters were found to be within the limits recommended by WHO standards for potable water. As for the pharmaceuticals considered, all three compounds that were spiked into the feed water were completely absent from the distillate, however, degradation products were found in the brine. The level of pharmaceutical degradation was influenced by the solar still configuration. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This is to protect the receivers which typically are rivers, streams, lakes. Examination of the quality of treated wastewater allows for quick elimination of possible negative effects, and the study of water receiver prevents from excessive contamination. The paper presents the results of selected physical and chemical parameters of treated wastewater from the largest on the region in north-eastern Poland city of Bialystok municipal wastewater treatment and Biala River, the receiver. The samples for research were taken 3-4 a month in 2015 from two points: before and after discharge. The impact of the wastewater treatment plant on the quality of the receiver waters was studied by using non-parametric Wilcoxon test. This test determined whether the analyzed indicators varied significantly depending on different sampling points of the river, above and below place of discharge of treated wastewater. These results prove that the treated wastewater does not affect the water quality in the Biala River.																	2267-1242						2017	22								UNSP 00127	10.1051/e3sconf/20172200127								WOS:000417352100127

An evaluation of the interrelationships within this approach deems necessary. This work identified and tested these relationships to improve the method for water quality assessment. Data from over 4,500 km(2) watershed were used as a representative example for the Saigon River and its tributaries. The data covered the period March and September, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2015. To implement this evaluation, the analyses were based on accepted the methodology of Mekong River Commission and the studies of scientific group for the biological status assessment. For correlation analyses, the selected environmental variables were compared with the ecological indices, based on benthic macroinvertebrates. The results showed that the metrics of Species Richness, H', and 1-DS had significant and strong relationships with the water quality variables of DO, BOD5, T_ N, and T_ P (R-2 = 0.3751 -0.8866; P << 0.05). While the metrics of Abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates did not have a statistically significant relationship with any water quality variables (R-2 = 0.0000 -0.0744; P > 0.05). Additionally, the metrics of Species Richness, H', and 1-DS had negatively correlated with the pH and TSS. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the ecological quality of the Saigon River and its tributaries using benthic macroinvertebrates seems to be the most sensitive indicator to correlate with physicochemical variables. This demonstrated that it could be applied to describe the water quality in the Saigon River and its tributaries.																	1755-1307						2017	92								UNSP 012053	10.1088/1755-1315/92/1/012053								WOS:000417457600053

This paper analyses the current status in numerical modelling of pollution dispersion in streams and use of some modelling approaches for the inverse task. Inverse task means a modelling technique, which is focused on the localisation of unknown pollution source (typical common models or equations are rather focused on the pollution spreading simulation, whereas the pollution source location is known). Paper offers an idea of such inverse task solution. It is based on the known pollution concentration time courses or it can be based on the results of the on-line monitoring of the specific water quality parameters as well. For the application of inverse tasks in conditions of real streams and rivers a large number of various requirements and conditions in specific river should be considered, i.a. the non-prismatic river bed, occurrence of dead zones, dispersion rate etc. Paper also describes the first version of the software for solving inverse tasks and preliminary experiences of using this software.																	1755-1307						2017	92								UNSP 012056	10.1088/1755-1315/92/1/012056								WOS:000417457600056

High concentrations of ammonia nitrogen that were detected during the whole period are the result of the discharge of all wastewater from the village of Dolni Cermna to flow Cermna. Although the results showed a positive effect pond Cermensky, during the growing season the concentration of ammonia nitrogen at SP No. 2 placed under the pond increased mainly due to fertilizing pond by manure to increase nutrients for the fish population in the pond.

Accurate measurements of these air pollutants and greenhouse gases are needed to support management and regulatory decisions. A mobile platform was developed to measure air emissions from tailings pond in the oil sands region of Alberta. The mobile platform was tested in 2015 in a municipal wastewater treatment lagoon. With a flux chamber and a CO2/CH4 sensor on board, the mobile platform was able to measure CO2 and CH4 emissions over two days at two different locations in the pond. Flux emission rates of CO2 and CH4 that were measured over the study period suggest the presence of aerobic and anaerobic zones in the wastewater treatment lagoon. The study demonstrated the capabilities of the mobile platform in measuring fugitive air emissions and identified the potential for the applications in air and water quality monitoring programs. Implications: The Mobile Platform demonstrated in this study has the ability to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fugitive sources such as municipal wastewater lagoons. This technology can be used to measure emission fluxes from tailings ponds with better detection of spatial and temporal variations of fugitive emissions. Additional air and water sampling equipment could be added to the mobile platform for a broad range of air and water quality studies in the oil sands region of Alberta.																	1096-2247	2162-2906					2017	67	11			SI		1205	1212		10.1080/10962247.2017.1285832								WOS:000416544400006	28152339					
J	Huang, P; Zhang, DD; Bai, S; Qin, SY				Huang, Peng; Zhang, Dandan; Bai, Shuang; Qin, Songyan			Application of combined emergent plants in floating bed for phytoremediation of landscape pond in South China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Plants support fauna richness and can be aesthetically pleasing. They also play an invaluable role in the assimilation and removal of nutrients. Canna indica L, Iris tectorums, Lythrum salicaria L., Cyperus alternifolius were found to be highly effective in remediating high nutrient levels in an aquatic environment. In this paper, the four plants were planted in floating beds in a park pond-Fuzhuang, Hefei city. The nearby pond-Lianfang as control was unplanted. The results suggested that combination of four species emergent plants performed well in nutrients removal; the removal efficiencies for suspended solids (SS), turbidity, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) were 82.5%, 87.5%, 75%, 82.9% respectively, compared with the control. At the end of the test, it successfully transformed from V grade water-body to III grade water-body. Different periods of flowering could maintain longer landscape effect. This paper demonstrated that combination of emergent plants could form pleasant scenery as well as restore eutrophic landscape pond.																	1466-2132	1741-511X					2017	20	1-2					22	36										WOS:000416508600003

A CASE STUDY FROM THE MESOPOTAMIAN MARSHES, IRAQ	ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION ENGINEERING												Water quality status of marshes within Mesopotamia has been investigated, and temporal and spatial changes determined by examining causes and effects. Data gathered from pre-desiccation and after re-flooding periods were subjected to index and statistical analysis. The quality of waters in the region was assigned to polluted class, regarding specific salinity related parameters. Total dissolved solids, chloride and sulfate were main variables negatively impacting the water quality. The main quality parameters creating spatial differences between the selected marshes were electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids. Temporal differences in dissolved oxygen, salinity, nitrate and phosphate concentrations between the 1980's and 2000's reflected the impact of desiccation and water shortage on the marshes. Salinity and nutrient concentrations generally increased after desiccation compared to their historical levels. These findings indicated that the Mesopotamian marshes had poor water quality due to increase in the concentration of salinity. The study revealed that the index and statistical methods are useful tools identifying water quality and fingerprinting pollution. This will help decision makers to establish strategic and comprehensive water management plans.																	0324-8828						2017	43	3					21	37		10.5277/epe170302								WOS:000416201200002

(common duckweed or lesser duckweed) for textile azo dye removal. The objectives are to assess the influence of L. minor on water quality parameters, compare the dye and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal of four dyes (Acid Blue 113, Reactive Blue 198, Direct Orange 46 and Basic Red 46) with each other, and monitor the effect of dye accumulation as a function of the relative growth rate (RGR) of L. minor. Findings indicate that the simulated shallow pond systems remove BR46 (low concentration) significantly (p < 0.05) higher than other dyes, and the ponds containing L. minor outperformed control ponds by around 51% in mean removal efficiency with a potential of L. minor for phytoremediation of approximately 13% efficiency.																	0324-8828						2017	43	3					39	60		10.5277/epe170303								WOS:000416201200003

The authors examined separate river stretches representing maximum changes in the hydraulic gradient and investigated the dependence of variations in the concentrations of biogenic nutrients on river flow velocity, i.e., turbulence, defining it by the Reynolds criterion. The calculation of the coefficient of self-purification provides that the river flowing downstream is 100% self-purified and removes all nitrates and 61% of phosphates. The content of dissolved oxygen at the confluence of the river in spring was by 5.5% larger than that at the headwaters, whereas in the summer season, the difference in the content of dissolved oxygen in river water between the headwaters and confluence increased and made 25%. The conducted research has disclosed that the dynamics of river flow affects water quality, and therefore, for selecting monitoring places, land use structure or economic entities situated around the sampling point as well as the nature of the river flow itself must be considered.																	0324-8828						2017	43	3					81	91		10.5277/epe170305								WOS:000416201200005

For this purpose, ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membranes were used in a cross-flow laboratory equipment. The permeate fluxes at the steady state were determined, and the resistances to the permeate flux were established. It was found that the inherent resistance of the clean membranes provided a much larger resistance than the fouling resistance. The retention coefficients for each individual contaminant were evaluated, as well as the retention coefficients referred to three water quality parameters: absorbance at 254 nm, COD and TOC. These parameters provide the effectiveness of the filtration processes for the elimination of the organic matter present in the selected water matrices.

Nevertheless, the high cost of microalgae cultivation hinders its development economically, so inexpensive cultural mediums are supposed to be found for the large-scale application of microalgae. Wastewater contains large amount of organic and inorganic compounds, which provides nutrition for the cell growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae. Here we will review the systems of microalgae cultivation and utilize wastewater as a feedstock for biodiesel production.

Water quantity and hydrochemical quality monitoring of Laspias River, North Greece	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The water quantity and quality of Laspias River, located in Xanthi Prefecture, Thrace, North Greece, are studied. A data collection program was designed at five stations along the main river course and its main tributary. Sampling frequency was about once every 10days. Temperature (T), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ simultaneously with discharge measurements. Moreover, water samples were collected and analyzed for the determination of nitrites, nitrates, ammonium, total phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids and alkalinity, according to standard methods. Anions (i.e., SO4-2 and Cl-) and cations (i.e., Li+, Na+, Mg+2, and Ca+2) were determined using ion chromatography (Dionex ICS-3000 ion chromatograph). The results showed that there is an impact of point (e.g., wastewater treatment plant effluent and farms) and non-point (e.g., agricultural activities) sources of pollution on the EC values, and chloride, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the river water. The trophic state of Laspias River, based on nutrient concentrations, was found eutrophic. Based on the Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment Water Quality Index, the river water quality ranged from poor to marginal category, indicating the need for management measures in order to improve it.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	14					1312	1321		10.1080/10934529.2017.1357408								WOS:000415634300005	28956687

However, the membrane breakage found in the membrane modules in many water treatment plants resulted in an increase in turbidity and bacterial amount in the membrane permeate. In this study, a membrane module running for 3years in a full-scale application was examined in terms of the breaking positions and the numbers of the broken fibers. It was found that most of the breaking positions were mainly on the outlet side of the module and that the distance from these points to the outlet was about 1/10-2/10 length of the membrane module. The lab-scale tests showed that the increase of the numbers of the breaking fibers in the membrane module (the breaking fibers were from 1 to 4 of 75 fibers) resulted in the increase in turbidity, particle count and the amount of total bacteria and coliform bacteria. Meanwhile, the water quality after the filtration with broken membrane fibers was similar to the quality of the raw water, which indicated that once the membrane fiber breakage occurred in the membrane module, the quality of drinking water after membrane filtration was significantly affected. Furthermore, the breaking position closer to the outlet side of the membrane module exposed much higher microbiological risk than those in the middle or near the bottom side. A pilot scale test was conducted by using a membrane module with 6600 fibers, and the effect of the membrane breakage (1-4 broken fibers) on water quality was also investigated. The results indicated that periodical backwashing caused drastic fluctuation of turbidity, particle count and the bacterial amount in the permeate water, which might be due to the washing force and self-blocking action inside the hollow fibers. Moreover, there is a good quantitative relationship (R-2 = 0.945) between particle count and the bacterial amount, which indicated that an online detection of particle count can be used to evaluate the bacterial risk. It was also suggested that the online detection of particle count after backwashing within 100s would be a quick and precise method to identify any fiber breakage in time. These results are very important for the safety issue in the application of polymeric membrane to water treatment plants.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	12					1126	1132		10.1080/10934529.2017.1342496								WOS:000414129100002	28738172					
J	Dembowska, EA				Dembowska, Ewa Anna			Evaluation of Ecological Potential of the Lower Vistula River Based on Multi-Year Research on Phytoplankton	OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												Changes in ecological status of the lower Vistula River over the past two decades were evaluated. The.1990s saw dynamic changes in the Polish economy and increasing environmental awareness, accompanied by introduction of modem, effective treatment methods of wastewater discharges into rivers. Yet, extensive research on modern evaluation of aquatic ecosystems was only conducted in the first decade of the 21st century. Planktonic diatoms (mainly of the Centricae subclass) followed by coccal chlorophyta were the main groups determined to form the phytoplankton biomass in the Vistula River in Torun. A more significant contribution of other algal groups (including cyanobacteria) is only occasional. Application of phytoplankton multimetric index (IFPL) for rivers allowed assessment of water quality variations in the Vistula River. Phytoplankton of the Vistula River determined in the '90s was compared with that of the period of 2007-2015. The trophic index (TI) measured in the 90's indicated poor ecological status of the river. Its value for both years of research (1994 and 1998) was 0.35. Over the subsequent twenty years the water quality significantly improved. Today, the TI value is 0.66, while the average phytoplankton multimetric index is 0.75, indicating good ecological potential of the Vistula River in Torun.																	1230-6169						2017	39	3					19	24										WOS:000412619400003

An innovative hybrid process based on biofiltration, ozonation and short SAT (sSAT, with similar to 22 days retention time) was demonstrated in a 6 m(3)/hr pilot system to remove emerging trace organic compounds (TrOCs), organic matter and control Mn2+ dissolution in reclaimed water. The biofiltration stage was proposed for nitrification of ammonia as well as removal of dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM), to enable efficient ozonation of secondary effluents. The pilot system was operated in two modes, where samples were periodically taken from all pilot stages to observe changes in product water quality. At first (Mode 1), biofiltered effluents were infiltrated through sSAT (i.e., no ozonation prior infiltration). During this operation, ammonia, nitrite and phosphate were completely removed, and pathogens were highly reduced. In addition, all measured TrOCs were effectively removed after sSAT, besides the persistent TrOCs Carbamazepine (CBZ) and Iodine-organic contrast media Iopamidol (IPDL). In Mode 2, biofiltered and ozonated (1.0-1.2 mg ozone/mg DOC) effluents were infiltrated through sSAT. In the final reclaimed product, values of DOC, UVA and Mn2+ were reduced to 0.8 mg/L, 2.2 L/m, and 29-35 mu g/L, respectively. Furthermore, ammonia and nitritewere not detected in the product, and good bacterial quality was obtained. Following 56-75 days of operation at Mode 2, all TrOCs were reduced down to <100 ng/L. The delay in the effect of the pretreatment stages on TrOCs removal by sSAT (>56 days instead of similar to 22 days) could be explained by their displacement retardation in the upper soil layers of the pilot SAT (0-25 cm). In-depth sampling inbservation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water. the observation well after 111 days atMode 2 showed homogeneity along the overall perforated section of the well (from -14 to -26 m) with 0.7-0.9 mg/L DOC, 2.1-2.2 1/m UVA and <10 ng/L CBZ. This result proved that the ozonated water completely covered the area around the observation well and positively affected the quality of the reclaimed water.																	0191-9512	1547-6545					2017	39	5					385	394		10.1080/01919512.2017.1346465								WOS:000413092900010

Concurrent basic water quality parameters and seven nutrients were measured in the water column. Sediment measurements from depositional areas were conducted for bifenthrin, Total Organic Carbon, grain size, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and eight metals. All parameters were measured at 12 sites annually during the late summer for a 3-year period (2014, 2015 and 2016). Univariate regressions, stepwise multiple regressions and canonical correlation statistical analyses were used to determine the relationship between various benthic metrics (i.e., taxa richness and abundance) and all the measured parameters for the 3-year database. Benthic communities comprising 108-110 taxa were collected annually, and were generally dominated by sensitive caddisflies and mayflies. These communities were rated as good to exceptional using the Ohio Invertebrate Community Index. Physical habitat for the various sites was rated as good using the Ohio Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index, thus suggesting that habitat is not a significant stressor that would likely impact resident benthic communities. Based on a comparison of measured in-stream total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations and criterion value exceedances, it appears that the in-stream nutrient concentrations could be potentially stressful to resident benthic biota. Metal concentrations were below established NOAA Threshold Effects Levels at all sites. Measured PCB concentrations were below levels of detection at all sites. Toxic units' (TUs) calculations based on using sensitive laboratory strains of Hyalella were less than 0.1 for bifenthrin, thus suggesting that bifenthrin sediment toxicity was unlikely. Thirty significant relationships reported between benthic metrics and the various environmental variables based on the 3-year database were as follows: 12 relationships with habitat metrics, 8 relationships with metals, 7 relationships with nutrients, 2 relationships with bifenthrin and 1 relationship with sediment characteristics. Relative habitat quality, habitat preferences, and ecological competition appear to be factors that shape the characteristics of the benthic communities of Big Bureau Creek, rather than stress imposed by toxicants (bifenthrin and metals), nutrients, or sediment characteristics. Complex relationships between benthic metrics and environmental variables are discussed.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	10					1008	1021		10.1080/10934529.2017.1328947								WOS:000409999100008	28609223

And the results showed that, through the quality of influent water was fluctuant, the quality of final effluent water was quite stable and met the discharge limits. Specifically, the concentration of oil in effluent was 3.6 mg/L and met its discharge standard; COD concentration was 83.3 mg/L, much lower than the design standard (350 mg/L); as for NH3-N, the effluent concentration was 9.3 mg/L, and its design standard of effluent concentration was 17-30 mg/L, and the sulfide concentration in effluent was only 0.037 mg/L, also lower than the design standard. The total removal efficiency of oil, COD, NH3-N and sulfide were 97.9%, 83.9%, 81.4% and 88.88%, respectively. So all actual results met the required demands, and the ultimate removal rates were also relatively high.																			978-1-315-37510-6; 978-1-138-02964-4				2017							299	302										WOS:000408464800063

The Index of Trophic State (ITS) was used to assess trophic state of both reservoirs as well as to determine dynamics of its changes for the analyzed period. Since the main function of both reservoirs is drinking water storage for the Silesian agglomeration with about 3.5 min population, special attention was paid to the physico-chemical indices describing the utility function of water and reflecting impact of eutrophication on water quality. Despite similar functions, the two reservoirs differ fundamentally in terms of their morphometric parameters, level of impact of the catchment area and potential vulnerability to degradation. The land utilization structure for both reservoir catchments varies too. Water quality was determined on the basis of temperature, electrical conductivity, BOD5, and the amount of total suspended solids, nitrates and phosphates. For both dam reservoirs, indicators values remained within the levels of very good water quality that corresponded to the A1 category of water utility for a public water supply. Only a few BOD5 measurement results for water from Goczalkowice dam reservoir corresponded to the A2 water category. According to the trophic state assessment, the Goczalkowice dam reservoir was classified as a mesoeutrophic while Czaniec dam reservoir - as a mesotrophic water body. In the examined 5-year period, the dynamics of trophic state changes in both dam reservoirs was comparable, and their ecological status was characterized as stable. This ensures good quality of water near the discussed intakes, despite the relatively high trophic status of the reservoirs.																	1230-6169						2017	39	2					11	16										WOS:000404834800002						
J	Olsinska, U				Olsinska, Urszula			Characteristics of bromate formation prevention methods in water intended for human consumption	OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												Bromate content following ozonation of bromide-containing water may range from 0.4 to 60 mgBrO(3)(-)/m(3). Based on toxicological studies, bromates are classified as potential human carcinogens and are subject to legal regulations in many countries. In Europe, since the 25th of December 2008 their maximum permissible content in water intended for human consumption must not exceed 10 mgBrO(3)(-)/m(3). As bromates are stable compounds, difficult to remove using conventional water treatment technologies, novel techniques to control their formation in water need to be developed. Technologies meant to control the bromate content in water can be divided into two groups: (1) methods allowing limitation of bromate formation and (2) methods for bromate removal. Methods that may be applied to control the bromate formation in water intended for human consumption are briefly reviewed herein. Evaluation of progress in their development was performed as well as feasibility of their application in water treatment systems was assessed. The review outlines both the well-known methods (e.g. lowering of pH, water ammonification, bromide removal in conventional water treatment processes, operational parameter optimization, multi-stage ozonation, addition of (OH)-O-center dot radical scavengers, hydrogen peroxide dosing) and the novel ones (e.g. membrane processes for bromide removal, catalytic ozonation, strong oxidant dosing). Selection of an appropriate solution to the problem of increased bromate presence in water should always be preceded by pilot studies. The main reasons include a complex mechanism of bromate formation and simultaneous effect of various water quality indicators on the effectiveness of different bromate formation prevention methods.																	1230-6169						2017	39	2					17	26										WOS:000404834800003						
J	Sakson, G; Brzezinska, A; Zawilski, M				Sakson, Grazyna; Brzezinska, Agnieszka; Zawilski, Marek			Prospects for reduction of the impact of wastewater discharge from urban areas on surface water quality in view of legal regulations	OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												Despite full adoption of EU requirements into current legal regulations in Poland, surface waters as sewage receivers in urban areas still cannot be considered fully protected, especially against contamination from sewer overflows and storm water systems. The examples discussed demonstrate that urban wastewater discharged from sewer overflows and storm water systems during rainfalls has a clearly dominant share in the load of pollutants emitted to the receiver. It is therefore important to develop efficient tools of water protection against these contaminants. Uniform but rather limited provisions applicable throughout the country do not take account of specific local conditions, especially size of wastewater receivers and size and characteristics of the catchment area, preventing therefore effective and economically viable water protection. The results of this research, carried out in Lodz, examining pollution loads discharged from the urban catchment area, illustrate that current approach to surface water protection issues requires a revision. Feasibility of regulatory changes in the area of setting requirements for effective receiver protection against pollutants discharged from urban areas was presented, considering the impact of untreated wastewater on the receiving water. It is also necessary to take comprehensive measures both in terms of research on pollutant emissions and their impact on the receiver and the method to utilize the results of such studies. This would enable more widespread use of urban wastewater discharge system modeling, which in turn would enable a reliable assessment of their impact on the receiver and taking appropriate modernization decisions. All of these activities are preconditions for sustainable rainwater management in urban areas.																	1230-6169						2017	39	2					27	38										WOS:000404834800004

The aim of this research was to evaluate suitability of Unio tumidus bivalve mollusks as bioindicators of water quality in a surveillance system. The experiment involved a 72-hour observation of the mollusks behavior in tap water containing about 0.04 mgFe/dm(3) (almost no iron ions), 0.2 mgFe/dm(3) (limit value for drinking water) and 1.7 mgFe/dm(3) (average iron ion content for the deep sea). Three behavioral variables considered were: time of activity (time period of water filtering activity), average shell opening degree and its frequency. It was determined that presence of iron ions exceeding the threshold value reduced daily activity time by 5 hours, while the shell opening degree - by over 20%. Variations in frequency of the shell movements were not observed, which might indicate no iron ion impact on the nervous system of the individuals tested. Similarly, lethal states were not demonstrated, even at the relatively high iron concentrations in water. Results of the research conducted demonstrate that the bivalves Unio tumidus may be employed in tap water surveillance system for detection of water contamination with iron compounds.

The aim of these studies was to evaluate potential to discharge the backwash water from rapid filter beds to a river or to drain them into the ground. Based on the physico-chemical and microbiological analysis of backwash water samples, degree of their contamination was determined with regard to the current quality requirements for wastewater discharged into surface water or soil as well as the requirements under the Water Law Act that defined water quality to be discharged from the analyzed pool. It was demonstrated that direct routing of the eluate from backwashing into the river or soil was impossible due to a high amount of total suspended solids and chlorine content. The concurrent efficacy testing of sedimentation and alum coagulation of backwash water performed under laboratory conditions demonstrated that the obtained supernatant water complied with the requirements and might be discharged into the river or drained into the ground.																	1230-6169						2017	39	2					45	50										WOS:000404834800006

When dissolved in ultrapure water, adsorption of the ECs followed the trend of AH > MS > PE, with a positive effect of the adsorbent dose. According to the analysis of the adsorption isotherms and adsorption kinetics, PAC showed strongly higher adsorption efficiency in both capacity and velocity of the adsorption, in agreement with its higher mesoporosity. Equilibrium isotherm data were fitted by Langmuir and Freundlich models. Pseudo-second order kinetics modeled very successfully the adsorption process. Finally, the effect of the presence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the water matrices (ultrapure water, surface water and two effluents from wastewater treatment plants) on the adsorption of the selected ECs onto PAC was established, as well as its performance on the removal of water quality parameters. Results show a negative effect of the DOM content on the adsorption efficiency. Over 50% of organic matter was removed with high PAC doses, revealing that adsorption onto PAC is an effective technology to remove both micro-pollutants and DOM from water matrices.																	1093-4529	1532-4117					2017	52	8					727	734		10.1080/10934529.2017.1301751								WOS:000404661400004	28358290

Removal of Suspended Solids in Anaerobically Digested Slurries of Livestock and Poultry Manure by Coagulation Using Different Dosages of Polyaluminum Chloride	2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (CEESD 2016)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				International Conference on Environmental Engineering and Sustainable Development (CEESD)	DEC 09-11, 2016	Sanya, PEOPLES R CHINA					In this study, anaerobically digested slurries of livestock and poultry manure were pretreated by coagulation-sedimentation using an inorganic polymer coagulant, polyaluminum chloride (PAC). The effect of different PAC dosages on suspended solids (SS) removal and pH in the biogas slurries was assessed to provide reference values for reducing the organic load of biogas slurry in the coagulation-sedimentation process and explore the feasibility of reducing the difficulty in subsequent utilization or processing of biogas slurry. The results showed that for the pig slurry containing approximately 5000 mg/L SS, the removal rate of SS reached up to 81.6% with the coagulant dosage of 0.28 g/L PAC. For the chicken slurry containing approximately 2600 mg/L SS, the removal rate of SS was 30.2% with the coagulant dosage of 0.33 g/L PAC. The removal rate of SS in both slurries of livestock and poultry manure exhibited a downward trend with high PAC dosage. Therefore, there is a need to control the PAC dosage in practical use. The pH changed little in the two types of biogas slurries after treatment with different PAC dosages and both were in line with the standard values specified in the "Standards for Irrigation Water Quality".																	1755-1307						2017	51								UNSP 012008	10.1088/1755-1315/51/1/012008								WOS:000399175800008

In order to solve the problem of water resources restricted by varieties of factors, this paper establishes a water resources evaluation index model (WREI), which adopts the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) algorithm. After considering influencing factors of water resources, we ignore secondary factors and then hierarchical approach the main factors according to the class, set up a three-layer structure. The top floor is for WREI. Using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to determine weight first, and then use fuzzy judgment to judge target, so the comprehensive use of the two algorithms reduce the subjective influence of AHP and overcome the disadvantages of multi-level evaluation. To prove the model, we choose India as a target region. On the basis of water resources evaluation index model, we use Matlab and combine grey prediction with linear prediction to discuss the ability to provide clean water in India and the trend of India's water resources changing in the next 15 years. The model with theoretical support and practical significance will be of great help to provide reliable data support and reference for us to get plans to improve water quality.																	1755-1307						2017	51								UNSP 012017	10.1088/1755-1315/51/1/012017								WOS:000399175800017

The water area in cites decreased sharply, and some rivers were cut off because of estate development, which brings the problems of urban flooding, flow stagnation and water deterioration. The approach aims to enhance flood control capability and improve the urban river water quality by planning gate-pump stations surrounding the cities and optimizing the locations and functions of the pumps, sluice gates, weirs in the urban river network. These gate-pump stations together with the sluice gates and weirs guarantee the ability to control the water level in the rivers and creating hydraulic gradient artificially according to mathematical model. Therefore the flow velocity increases, which increases the rate of water exchange, the DO concentration and water body self-purification ability. By site survey and prototype measurement, the river problems are evaluated and basic data are collected. The hydrodynamic model of the river network is established and calibrated to simulate the scenarios. The schemes of water quality improvement, including optimizing layout of the water distribution projects, improvement of the flow discharge in the river network and planning the drainage capacity are decided by comprehensive Analysis. Finally the paper introduces the case study of the approach in Changshu City, where the approach is successfully implemented.																	1755-1307						2017	51								UNSP 012029	10.1088/1755-1315/51/1/012029								WOS:000399175800029

Our objective was to investigate the relationships between the measures of benthic macroinvertebrate communities and nutrient concentrations to assess water quality. The rivers' benthic macroinvertebrates were collected during different seasons in 2012. The biological and chemical parameters used in the current study identified them as quick indicators of water quality assessment. The total number of macroinvertebrate individuals (n = 15,006) (Osumi river: n = 5,546 organisms; Devolli river: n = 3,469 organisms; and Shkumbini river: n = 5,991 organisms), together with the EPT group (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera), showed that the water quality at the river stations during the above-mentioned period belonged to Classes II and III (fair water quality and good water quality, respectively). The classification of the water quality was also based on the nitrogen and total phosphorus contents. The pollution tolerance levels of macroinvertebrate taxa varied from the non-tolerating forms encountered in environments with low pollution levels to the tolerating forms that are typical of environments with considerable pollution levels.

Additionally, influence of the selected environmental characteristics on functioning of these insignificant water ecosystems was evaluated. Ten ponds varying in terms of catchment usage structure, hydrologic type and size of surface area were selected for the studies. Impact of the catchment management on water quality was evaluated. In addition, it was verified if periodic changes in the reservoir hydrological function (incorporation into the surface runoff system) significantly affected the water quality. The results confirmed that the usage structure of small reservoir catchment had a decisive influence on the quality of the water. The principal cause of the increasing concentrations of the analyzed ions (Li+, Na+, NH4+, Mg-2(+), K+, Ca-2(+), F-, Cl-, NO2-, Br-, NO3, PO43-, SO42-) was the neighborhood of farms. Seasonal changes in the nutrient (total nitrogen, total phosphorus) water concentrations were not observed. Significant changes in water quality by intermittently forming hydrographic network that interconnected the individual depressions were reported for total nitrogen only. Interestingly, the landlocked ponds, in theory continuously accumulating contaminants from the catchment area, were characterized by good hydro-chemical conditions.																	1230-6169						2017	39	1					11	22										WOS:000398763600002

In addition, an analysis of operating costs of such system was conducted. The study was based on a real facility, i.e. the swimming pool of AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. In the facility, water disinfection with calcium hypo chlorite was carried out, assisted by UV irradiation. Switching the UV lamps temporarily off allowed for comparative studies on the quality of pool water disinfected by pure chlorination and by the UV and chlorination sequence. For these two variants of the swimming pool water disinfection several physico-chemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed, including the disinfection by-products. Cost analysis included the consumption of chemical agents and the UV lamp operation. It was established that the UV technology did not contribute to the expected improvement in the pool water quality in terms of the combined chlorine removal, however it did cause an increase in the concentration of selected organic chlorination by-products. Moreover, application of the UV lamp to the pool water treatment system increased the chlorine demand and, consequently, the consumption of calcium hypochlorite. Combined with the need to exchange lamp filaments, it raised the operating costs of the pool water treatment technology.

The research results were used to develop the models predicting the concentration of five groups of chlorination by-products (trihalomethanes, haloacetonitriles, haloketones, chloral hydrate and chloropicrin), on the basis of several parameters of water quality, chlorination and distribution (organic carbon and nitrogen, bromide ions, UV254, temperature, pH, retention time). The multiple linear regression analysis was used to develop the base models, in which all analyzed parameters were included. The backward stepwise regression method was used to optimize these models. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the ability of the models to predict the by-products concentration in the analyzed water distribution systems. The sensitivity analysis was also performed to identify the influence of individual parameters on the formation of each by-products group.

Such reservoirs, by providing additional benefits, e.g., for sport and recreation, become an increasingly frequent element of city and suburban landscape. However, by practice, while the impact on flood reduction is considered at the design stage of such reservoirs, the aspect of water quality improvement is often undervalued. In this paper results of fields and analytical investigations on the impact of Wyscigi Pond (a detention pond located in the catchment of Sluzew Creek in Warsaw) on flood flows and on the suspended sediment load reduction are presented. Our investigation shows that Wyscigi Pond impacts flood reduction only to a limited degree, but has a meaningful influence on the sediment load reduction.

However, WTPs face numerous potential obstacles, including changes in source water quality and quantity, financial burdens related to operations and upgrades, and stringent water quality regulations. Moreover, these challenges may be exacerbated by climate change in the form of long-term climatic perturbations and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. To help WTPs overcome these issues, decision support systems (DSSs), which are used to aid and enhance the quality and consistency of decision-making, have been developed. This paper reviews the scientific literature on the development and application of DSSs for water treatment, including physically-based models, statistical models, and artificial intelligence techniques, and suggests future directions in the field. We first set the context of how water quality is impacted by climate change and extreme weather events. We then provide a comprehensive review of DSSs and conclude by offering a series of recommendations for future DSS efforts for WTPs, suggesting that these tools should (1) more accurately reflect the practical needs of WTPs, (2) represent the tradeoffs between the multiple competing objectives inherent to water treatment, (3) explicitly handle uncertainty to better inform decision makers, (4) incorporate nonstationarity, especially with regard to extreme weather events and climate change for long-term planning, and (5) use standardized terminology to accelerate the dissemination of knowledge in the field.

Unlike static infrastructure, which cannot adapt its operation to individual storms or changing land uses, "smart" stormwater systems will use system-level coordination to maximize watershed pollutant removal and treatment. We illustrate that this vision is not limited by technology, which has matured to the point at which it can be ubiquitously deployed. Rather, the challenge is much more fundamental and rooted in a system-level understanding of environmental science. Once distributed stormwater systems become highly instrumented and controlled, how should they be operated to achieve desired watershed outcomes? The answer to this question demands the development of a theoretical framework for smart stormwater systems. In this paper, we lay out the requirements for such a theory. Acknowledging that the adoption of these systems may still be years away, we also present a modeling framework to allow for the simulation of controlled stormwater systems before they become commonplace. We apply this control framework to two simulated case studies in which stormwater sites are controlled to reduce nitrate loads to downstream water bodies.

J	Wang, J; Chua, LHC; Shanahan, P				Wang, Jia; Chua, Lloyd H. C.; Shanahan, Peter			Evaluation of pollutant removal efficiency of a bioretention basin and implications for stormwater management in tropical cities	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												Non-point source pollution is a prevalent problem throughout the world. Bioretention basins have been deployed worldwide to treat stormwater runoff and alleviate eutrophication in downstream water resources. However, basin performance in the tropics is poorly understood. Given the distinctly different rainfall-runoff characteristics of tropical climates, whether basins that are built according to temperate design guidelines are effective is questionable. There have been no field studies based on continuous, high-resolution, long-term monitoring in the tropics. In this study, 96 storms were monitored in the first bio-retention basin in Singapore. Of these, flow measurements were made during 80 events and samples were collected and analyzed for 15 water quality parameters (including nitrogen and phosphorus species, total suspended solids, and chemical oxygen demand) during six events. The mean removal rates were 25%, 46%, and 53% for total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total suspended solids respectively. Results show that a lack of storage capacity and resulting high overflow reduce pollutant removal efficiency for high-rainfall-depth events. The transition from efficient to non-efficient removal occurs at a rainfall depth between 10 and 30 mm. Low EMC (event mean concentration) and weak first flush as a result of frequent and intense rainfall in the tropics also contribute to low removal rate. The results suggest a need to revise bioretention basin design guidelines for the tropics to be based on WQV or WQD (water quality volume or depth) instead of ARI (average recurrence interval). A larger basin volume (WQD between 10 to 30 mm) is recommended.					/0000-0001-8667-8186												2053-1400	2053-1419				JAN 1	2017	3	1					78	91		10.1039/c6ew00285d								WOS:000394270400006

Membrane fouling profiles were quantified by water flux decline and permeate conductivity. Mechanisms of the synergistic effect of combined fouling were revealed by light scattering measurements and infrared spectra of foulant-foulant interaction and foulant- membrane interaction. Membrane fouling morphology and element mapping provided further details of transport of colloidal silica particles and elucidated the mechanisms for silica-induced pore wetting. Specially, gelation of alginate formed an alginate layer on membrane surface and prevented penetration of silica particles into the membrane matrix, which was confirmed by silicon element mapping as well as infrared spectra. Adsorption of BSA protein by colloidal silica aggregates led to a sharp water flux decline and a partial pore wetting. Humic acid, forming a coil structure in high salinity, exhibited limited interaction with colloidal silica that penetrated into the membrane matrix and wetted membrane pores, thereby compromising the product water quality. Results showed that the combined organic fouling with colloidal silica particle not only deteriorated water production, but also compromised product quality by partial membrane wetting.

Review on river bank filtration as an in situ water treatment process	CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY												Surface and ground water are valuable sources for drinking water. Certain industrial, mining, and agricultural practices pollute these critical resources. Riverbank filtration (RBF) is a cost-effective in situ water treatment process, which removes suspended solids and organic and inorganic pollutants. The RBF process is defined as a natural filter of soils and aquifer sediments at the river site. In RBF, river water moves through the pores of the natural soils of the riverbed and riverbank. RBF improves several physical, chemical, and biological properties of the river water. Several treatment actions including, filtration, sorption, and biological degradation occur during this process. Under specific conditions, RBF could be used as a treatment or pretreatment process to remove or decrease pollutants in surface water. In this paper, the effectiveness of RBF in improving the river water quality is presented. RBF as a cost-effective water treatment process is also discussed. Furthermore, factors that affect the performance of the RBF process and its overall effectiveness for developing countries are also discussed.																	1618-954X	1618-9558					2017	19	2					349	359		10.1007/s10098-016-1266-0								WOS:000394319300006

Multiobjective Design of Water-Quality Monitoring Networks in River-Reservoir Systems	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												This study develops and tests a method for multiobjective optimization of water-quality monitoring networks in river-reservoir systems. The optimization method identifies optimal sampling locations to detect the sudden release of contaminants to a reservoir, and meets two objectives: (1) minimizing the prediction error of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) at the reservoir's outlet valve; and (2) minimizing the average time during which MTBE is detected at sampling locations. The optimization method considers 36 contaminant scenarios, corresponding to three volumes of contaminant release, three release locations, and four different seasonal release times. The MTBE pollutant chemograph was simulated at the outlet valve of the reservoir and at 16 possible sampling locations with the CE-QUAL-W2 model for each of the 36 scenarios of contaminant release. A support vector regression (SVR) tool is coupled to the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII) to optimize the water-quality sampling locations. Implementation of the NSGAII-SVR method demonstrates its capacity to design water-quality monitoring networks that meet multiple objectives in a river-reservoir system.

For such purposes, the models to be used in water quality simulators must describe chlorine decay in the systems as accurately as possible, requiring a minimum number of parameters and still be sufficiently robust to predict chlorine residuals under changing operational conditions. In this paper, two second-order decay models (single reactant and two reactants) were examined for their ability to predict chlorine residuals in surface raw and treated waters at a range of initial chlorine and natural organic matter concentrations. The two reactants model is necessary for chlorine residuals prediction in raw waters. However, for treated waters it only performed marginally better than the simpler single reactant model, with half the number of parameters that needed to be estimated. In addition, correlations were observed between both models parameters for reactive natural organic matter (NOM) concentration and measured fluorescence and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopic data associated with humic-like compounds. Such findings are likely to open the door for a more exact determination of the models' parameters and, thus, for improving the chlorine decay models' adequacy and accuracy.

Characterizing Runoff from Roads: Particle Size Distributions, Nutrients, and Gross Solids	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Particulate matter, nutrients, and gross solids from roads contribute nonpoint-source pollution to waterways. To inform road runoff management, a field monitoring study was undertaken at eight road sites across North Carolina. Particle size distributions (PSD) of edge-of-pavement runoff samples were analyzed to understand the granulometry of the particulate matter. Knowledge of PSDs is critical when attempting to understand sediment fate and transport through stormwater control measures (SCMs), especially when the primary removal mechanism is particle settling. For 43 road runoff events, median particle size varied from 31 to 144 mu m. The median PSD from hot mix asphalt (HMA) was 2.6% clay, 44.8% silt, and 52.6% sand. PSD was not correlated to roadway classification or ecoregion; however, PSD was significantly correlated to the presence of a permeable friction course (PFC) overlay, which is a layer of porous asphalt placed over traditional HMA. The median d(90) for PFC (131 mu m) was significantly smaller than for HMA (428 mu m), with 11.5% less sand fraction present in the PFC runoff. Smaller particles emitted from PSD will diminish performance for downslope highway SCMs, including swales and filter strips. PFC also emitted lower median effluent total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations (9 mg/ L) than HMA (23 mg/L). Gross solids may represent a substantial portion of the total nutrient load from roads, but they are often entirely overlooked. Dry mass of leaf litter from roads in North Carolina was correlated to rainfall depth and peak rainfall intensity. Total nitrogen (TN) loads from gross solids varied from 0.2 to 0.9 kg/ ha/year, while total phosphorus (TP) loads ranged between 0.03 and 0.12 kg/ha/year, approximately one order of magnitude less than reported TN and TP nutrient loads in stormwater runoff. Given the typical fraction of TN and TP leaching into stormwater as leaves and organic matter break down, gross solids represented about 0.6% of TN and 3.6% of TP yearly nutrient loading for the evaluated highway sites, suggesting gross solids were a relatively inconsequential portion of the total nutrient load from roads.

Modeling Sediment Reduction in Grass Swales and Vegetated Filter Strips Using Particle Settling Theory	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												Two of the most common and simple stormwater control measures are swales and filter strips. However, an overly simplistic one-size-fits-all design approach typically is used for these practices. To provide more flexibility in design, a coupled hydraulics and particle-settling model was created to predict swale and filter strip total suspended solids (TSS) reduction as a function of catchment area, longitudinal slope, side slope, cross section type (triangular swale, trapezoidal swale, or filter strip), and length. The hydraulics and hydrology models were based on Manning's equation and the rational method, respectively, with the underlying requirement that the water quality design storm does not exceed the height of the grass. The particle-settling model was underpinned by the Aberdeen equation. The model predicts that triangular swales produce the least and filter strips the most TSS removal because of increased hydraulic retention time; trapezoidal swales had on average 10% greater TSS removal than triangular swales with similar design characteristics. Grass filter stormwater controls performed better with decreasing slope, increasing length, smaller catchment area, and shallower side slopes. Filter strips registered the majority of their TSS reduction within the first meter of their width and were insensitive to increases in longitudinal slope. This water quality design storm-abating modeling approach could be coupled with modeling for infrequent-return-interval storms to obtain dual benefits of sediment reduction and conveyance. This water quality model may provide regulatory agencies a tool to provide variable TSS credit to swales and filter strips as a function of design.

The EFT process with an ORP control was able to improve the current efficiency from 16.9% to 73.6-81.9%. A superior performance for both the current efficiency and the treated water quality was recorded by the EFT process with an ORP control of 1000 mV. This superior result was ascribed to the approach preventing an excessive accumulation of hypochlorous acid. Two combined processes, namely, an activated sludge process followed by the EFT process with an ORP control (AS-EFT process) and the EFT process with an ORP control followed by an activated sludge process (EFT-AS process), were examined by using 1,4-dioxane contaminated municipal wastewater. As a result, the AS-EFT process was superior to the EFT-AS process in respects of both energy consumption and the performance of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, as well as the removal of 1,4-dioxane, due to the smaller COD loading onto the EFT reactor in the AS-EFT process.

J	Wang, SW; Li, ZW; Yu, QL				Wang, Shunwu; Li, Ziwang; Yu, Qinglong			Kinetic degradation of guar gum in oilfield wastewater by photo-Fenton process	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Guar gum is considered as a main component of oilfield wastewater. This work is intended to optimize the experimental conditions (H2O2 dosage, Fe2+ dosage, initial concentration of organics, initial pH and temperature) for the maximum oxidative degradation of guar gum by Fenton's reagent. The kinetics of guar gum removal were evaluated by means of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the absorbance measurements. The batch experiment results showed that the optimum conditions were: H2O2 dosage, 10,000 mg/L; Fe2+ dosage, 2,000 mg/L; initial concentration of organics, 413 mg/L; pH, 3 and temperature, 35 degrees C, under which the COD removal could reach 61.07% and fairly good stability could be obtained. Under the optimum experimental conditions, using UV irradiation to treat the wastewater, the photo-Fenton systems can successfully eliminate COD from guar gum solution. The COD removal always obeyed a pseudo-first-order kinetics and the degradation rate (k(app)) was increased by 25.7% in the photo-Fenton process compared to the Fenton process. The photo-Fenton system needed less time and consequently less quantity of H2O2 to obtain the same results as the Fenton process. The photo-Fenton process needs a dose of H2O2 20.46% lower than that used in the Fenton process to remove 79.54% of COD. The cost of the photo/ Fenton process amounted to RMB9.43/m(3), which was lower than that of the classic Fenton process alone (RMB10.58/m(3)) and the overall water quality of the final effluent could meet the class. national wastewater discharge standard for the petrochemical industry of China.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JAN	2017	75	1					11	19		10.2166/wst.2016.470								WOS:000392391100002	28067641

The response of phytoplankton and microlayer-adapted bacteria to monolayer application in a humic, eutrophic irrigation dam	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Repeat applications of artificial monolayers to farm irrigation dams to reduce evaporative loss may adversely affect water quality by enhancing populations of microlayer-adapted bacteria and blue-green algae. The microlayer, subsurface and water column of a 16 ha dam were monitored every two weeks for 18 months, to benchmark the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton and microlayer-adapted bacteria prior to monolayer application. Results for Secchi depth, total P, total N, chlorophyll a, phytobiovolume and UV254 absorbance, characterise Logan's Dam as humic and hypereutrophic. Seasonal peaks in the cyanobacterial species Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaena sp. associated with regular thermal stratification periods over summer, exceeded the Queensland algal bloom alert level. Dissolved organic matter derived from aromatic char in the black soil used to construct the dam was the main substrate for microlayer-adapted bacteria. Intermittent monolayer application over seven weeks in late summer temporarily increased surface pressure, indicating a condensed monolayer had formed, with no increase in chemical oxygen demand or in populations of cyanobacteria or microlayer-adapted bacteria. The increase in dissolved organic carbon was well below the concentration recorded after a pump ingress event in late spring. In this humic hypereutrophic irrigation dam, repeat applications of the experimental monolayer formulation did not adversely affect water quality.																	0273-1223	1996-9732				JAN	2017	75	2					322	327		10.2166/wst.2016.515								WOS:000392395800009	28112659

Since it is not possible to analyze every single substance, a prioritization methodology is needed for the selection of those to be monitored. Existing well-developed models require significant amount of data for reliable outcomes. This paper presents a methodology to prioritize the dangerous substances having adverse effects on freshwaters in Turkey, where data are scarce. Such a methodology will also serve as a solid model for other countries with limited background data. The adopted methodology enabled the elimination of chemicals to generate a candidate list composed of 608 substances among more than 5000 substances. Further screening and prioritization were conducted using different assessment methods (i.e., Total Hazard Value, Total Impact Value, Combined Monitoring-based, and Modelling-based Priority Setting) to obtain a proposed Final Candidate Specific Pollutants List of 150 dangerous substances. The proposed Candidate National Pollutant List of Turkey was established by combining 45 priority pollutants of the European Union with a list of candidate specific pollutants. According to the outcomes of this study, monitoring and controlling of 195 dangerous substances in freshwaters are recommended. Further detailed studies should be conducted in order to observe the actual levels of these dangerous substances in freshwaters followed by a review of the monitoring list accordingly. Moreover, further revisions might be required in the proposed list due to some possible versatile conditions in terms of sampling points (i.e., change in the location of industries).

Oceans in Peril: Grand Challenges in Applied Water Quality Research for the 21st Century	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE												Oceans cover most of the planet and 60% of the world's population lives near the coast. Anthropogenic activities along coastlines and in the open ocean have placed the oceans in peril. According to a Pew Oceans Commission Report, among the greatest threats to the ocean are land-based runoff from coastal development, nutrient pollution, overfishing, and invasive species. Here, we describe threats due to microbial, nutrient, chemical, and plastic pollution in addition to declining biodiversity and describe fundamental and applied research needed to mitigate the threats. While the research needs are diverse, we identify several research foci that transcend individual threats: monitoring, fate and transport studies, modeling, innovative natural and engineered treatment systems, and toxicity and health studies. Research within the environmental engineering and science community that addresses these needs will contribute to improving ocean health.																	1092-8758	1557-9018				JAN	2017	34	1			SI		3	15		10.1089/ees.2015.0252								WOS:000391851300002

Assessing the potential impacts of WWTP effluent reductions within the Reedy River watershed	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												The Reedy River Basin originates along the northern fringe of the Greenville Metro Area and flows southward through downtown Greenville and continues for about 40 miles through increasingly rural lands until it empties into Lake Greenwood. This project evaluated the potential downstream impact to the Reedy River, Boyd Millpond, and Lake Greenwood from the removal of 100% of the effluent generated from various wastewater treatment plants along the river. Evaluation was performed using the Reedy River Model which is a combination of different programs including the EPA's Loading Simulation Program in C++ (LSPC) and the Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP). Both water quality and quantity were analyzed as part of this study. The nitrogen and phosphorus species investigated in this study were total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Simulation runs were conducted for the Reedy River Model holding all original parameters constant to those used in the TMDL analysis. The second simulation consisted of eliminating wastewater treatment plants from the model to simulate 100% removal of their wastewater effluent. To reflect dry, wet, and average years of rainfall, seven years of actual weather data for Greenville County were used within these simulation runs. Flow was modeled from the headwaters to the Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. River sections analyzed included the river section immediately upstream and downstream of the wastewater treatment plant locations and Boyd Millpond and Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. Removal of effluent resulted in a reduced average flow at Boyd Millpond from 8.52 m(3)/s (301.23 cfs) to 7.34 m(3)/s (259.21 cfs), a reduction in flow of 14%; and reduced average flow at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood from 9.15 m3/s (323.13 cfs) to 7.97 m3/s (281.46 cfs), a reduction in flow of 12.9%. The removal of wastewater effluent had the greatest impact during periods of minimum flow when effluent makes up the largest percentage of total flow. During periods of drought, effluent removal resulted in a reduction in flow of almost 70% at the upper wastewater treatment plant, 66% at the lower wastewater treatment plant, 59% at Boyd Millpond, and 55% at Reedy River Arm of Lake Greenwood. Based on daily flow values averaged over seven years, total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentration and mass loads at Boyd Millpond and Reedy Arm will both decrease by approximately 50% with the elimination of effluent. This report only considers the impacts of effluent removal to flow, total phosphorus and total nitrogen as modeled by LSPC and WASP. Other variables that may be influenced from effluent removal include, pH, Dissolved Oxygen, fecal matter, heavy metals, water temperature, habitat quality, species diversity, macroinvertabrates, recreational uses, and economic impacts but are not included in this study.

J	Cao, QQ; Wang, H; Chen, XC; Wang, RQ; Liu, J				Cao, Qingqing; Wang, Hui; Chen, Xiaocui; Wang, Renqing; Liu, Jian			Composition and distribution of microbial communities in natural river wetlands and corresponding constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Microbial community plays an important role in wetland ecosystem. To explore the composition and distribution of microbial communities in different wetland types, sediments from different sites of Xinxue River (XR) and Zhaoniu River (ZR), and the corresponding Xinxue River Constructed Wetland (XRCW) and Zhaoniu River Constructed Wetland (ZRCW) were sampled and analyzed using high throughput sequencing. The constructed wetlands were found to have more taxa of microbes in sediments than their corresponding river wetlands. The community richness index suggests that microbial richness in XR and XRCW is higher than that in ZR and ZRCW. High potential of sulfur cycle in XRCW is suggested by the superior distribution of Desulfobacterales, Syntrophobacterales orders, and Thiobacillus genus of Proteobacteria. Moreover, ZRCW has relatively lower nitrification ability than other three wetlands according to the distribution of Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Acidobacteria phyla. XR and XRCW show high potential of methanogenesis as the distribution of Methanomicrobia order in Archaea. ZRCW is suggested in a state that organic carbon mineralization exceeds aggregation, denitrification exceeds nitrification based on different distributions of the functional bacteria (such as Nitrospirae, Acidobacteria, and Planctomycetes). Furthermore, it indicates that ammonia removal process in ZRCW sediments is mostly limited to nitrification. This study demonstrated that wetland functions can be detected by the composition and distribution of microbial communities and influenced by the pollution status and surroundings probably. Our results are essential for understanding the interrelationship between microbial distribution and the pollution status of wetlands for the evaluation of constructed wetland. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kimura, A; Baptista, MB; Scotti, MR				Kimura, Andrei; Baptista, Marcio B.; Scotti, Maria Rita			Soil humic acid and aggregation as restoration indicators of a seasonally flooded riparian forest under buffer zone system	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A degraded riparian forest that has lost vegetation and has suffered periodic flooding was rehabilitated using native species under buffer zone system which was stratified according to the distance from the river (Zones I, II, III). To restore the soil stabilisation and water flow we compared the soil aggregation, porosity and soil humic substances of the experimental site (ES) with those of a disturbed site (DS) and a preserved site (PS). Six years post-transplantation, soil aggregation and micro-porosity were improved in the ES relative to the DS, but only micro-porosity achieved a pattern similar to that of the PS in Zone III. Differences in soil aggregation between ES and PS were correlated with the negative effect promoted by a high aliphatic-humic acid composition in Zone I and by an undifferentiated distribution of fulvic acid among sites which were attributed to the flooding effect. Similarities among ES and PS were related to aromatic:vinylhumic acid ratio, allowing for the clustering of samples from Zones II and III of both the PS and the ES, via a principal component analysis. Samples from Zones I of ES and PS were separated driven by aliphatic and fulvic acid contributions, while all of the DS samples formed an isolated group under the influence of aliphatic species and macro-porosity. Based on these attributes, the ES is evolving towards the PS, and the rehabilitation process has attained an intermediate phase of restoration. The zones system adopted for riparian forest restoration allowed the use of soil humic substances, aggregates and micro-porosity as indicators of restoration. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal variation in nutrient removal efficiency of a boreal wetland detected by high-frequency on-line monitoring	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	York, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc				Wetlands play an important role in reducing nutrient loads to receiving waters. The efficiency of a wetland in nutrient removal is commonly evaluated from discrete water samples taken at the inflow and at the outflow of the target wetland. In order to reveal variation in removal efficiency we carried out one year of high-frequency monitoring (HFM) of water quality and quantity at a wetland established at the mouth of an urban/agricultural watershed in boreal southern Finland. Data collected at the inflow and outflow of the 0,5 ha wetland was used to determine the range of total phosphorus (TP) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations. The incoming and outgoing TP and NO3-N loads were calculated and the relative and absolute reduction rates were determined. The wetland received 24 g P m(-2) year(-1) and 130 g NO3-N m(-2) year(-1) and it retained 3.1 g m(-2) year(-1) of P and 18 g m(-2) year(-1) of NO3-N. Annual TP reduction was 13% and NO3-N reduction 14%. The relative removal efficiency of TP was found to be dependent on retention time and NO3-N removal efficiency was dependent on temperature, oxygen concentration, NO3-N concentration and discharge.

Sedimentation and resuspension modelling in free water surface constructed wetlands	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING					6th International Symposium on Wetland Pollutant Dynamics and Control (WETPOL) / Annual Conference of the Constructed-Wetlands-Association (CWA)	SEP 13-18, 2015	York, ENGLAND	Cranfield Univ, Constructed Wetlands Assoc				Eutrophication is a widespread problem that is being tackled from many perspectives and the recently applied technology of constructed wetlands is being used in the treatment of eutrophic water. However, process-based models to simulate their performance are scarce, so in this work a mechanistic model was developed to simulate the removal of total suspended solids, phytoplankton and total phosphorus in free water surface constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water. The model represents the influence of the main factors of the biotope and biota on these water quality variables, and particular attention is paid to resuspension produced by wind and by avifauna. Likewise, the effect of emergent vegetation cover in sedimentation, resuspension and phytoplankton growth is included. Phytoplankton is considered to store phosphorus internally in order to use it when growing, and the contribution of phytoplankton concentration to the suspended solids budget is included. The software AQUASIM was used to calibrate and validate the model in two full-scale constructed wetlands treating eutrophic water from Lake l'Albufera de Valencia (Spain) for three years. The simulated data and field measurements showed satisfactory adjustments for the three studied variables. The budgets obtained for each variable reveal that sedimentation and resuspension are the main processes in total suspended solids performance. Sedimentation of organic particulate phosphorus is the most important process in total phosphorus removal. The sum of the effect of resuspension by avifauna and by wind increases by more than 50% the quantity of solids that enters the water column. The model reveals that simulating the effects of the emergent vegetation cover and resuspension is crucial for representing the performance of the studied variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The adoption of an on-site treatment by Constructed Wetlands for the Combined Sewer Overflows is an example of decentralized approach for the optimization of the existing sewer networks and the needed reduction of their impacts on the water quality of the receiving water bodies. The CW system, that is treating the first flush of the overflows, is joined with an extended retention basin that is acting as a tertiary treatment for the CW effluents and is also storing and treating the whole second flush, slowing down by a throttle the discharge in the river and therefore playing a role in the flooding risk control. During the monitored time interval 69 events of overflow discharges have been observed and quantified; this quantification of the total volumes discharged by the specific CSO have been useful for evaluating the approach performances also in terms of mass loads in a single year, that is in the author's opinion a more conservative evaluation than comparing only the average concentrations removal rates. The obtained results have shown that on-site treatment for the first flush by CWs can obtain appropriate performances, as demonstrated by the about 87% and 93% of removal for COD and NH4+ respectively in terms of concentrations and the 68% and 94% in terms of mass loads in a year. A relevant analysis of the sampling program and the secondary services provided by this specific artificial ecosystems are discussed in the paper, together with a unique characterization of the role of the specific sources (washout, urban wastewater) to the loads that are reaching the on-site treatment unit.

J	Coats, ER; Brinkman, CK; Lee, S				Coats, Erik R.; Brinkman, Cynthia K.; Lee, Stephen			Characterizing and contrasting the microbial ecology of laboratory and full-scale EBPR systems cultured on synthetic and real wastewaters	WATER RESEARCH												The anthropogenic discharge of phosphorus (P) into surface waters can induce the proliferation of cyanobacteria and algae, which can negatively impact water quality. Enhanced biological P removal (EBPR) is an engineered process that can be employed to efficiently remove significant quantities of P from wastewater. Within this engineered system, the mixed microbial consortium (MMC) becomes enriched with polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs). To date much knowledge has been developed on PAOs, and the EBPR process is generally well understood; nonetheless, the engineered process remains underutilized. In this study, investigations were conducted using qPCR and Illumina MiSeq to assess the impacts of wastewater (synthetic vs. real) on EBPR microbial ecology. While a strong relationship was demonstrated between EBPR metrics (P:C; influent VFA:P) and excellent P removal across diverse EBPR systems and MMCs, no such correlations existed with the specific MMCs. Moreover, MMCs exhibited distinct clusters based on substrate, and qPCR results based on the putative PAO Accumulibacter did not correlate with BLASTN eubacterial results for either Accumulibacter or Rhodocyclaceae. More critically, PAO-based sequences aligned poorly with Accumulibacter for both eubacterial and PAO primer sets, which strongly suggests that the conventional PAO primers applied in FISH and qPCR analysis do not sufficiently target the putative PAO Accumulibacter. In particular, negligible alignment was observed for PAO amplicons obtained from a MMC performing excellent EBPR on crude glycerol (an atypical substrate). A synthetic wastewater-based MMC exhibited the best observed BLASTN match of the PAO amplicons, raising concerns about the potential relevance in using synthetic substrates in the study of EBPR.

J	Chaudhary, A; Hantush, MM				Chaudhary, Abhishek; Hantush, Mohamed M.			Bayesian Monte Carlo and maximum likelihood approach for uncertainty estimation and risk management: Application to lake oxygen recovery model	WATER RESEARCH												Model uncertainty estimation and risk assessment is essential to environmental management and informed decision making on pollution mitigation strategies. In this study, we apply a probabilistic methodology, which combines Bayesian Monte Carlo simulation and Maximum Likelihood estimation (BMCML) to calibrate a lake oxygen recovery model. We first derive an analytical solution of the differential equation governing lake-averaged oxygen dynamics as a function of time-variable wind speed. Statistical inferences on model parameters and predictive uncertainty are then drawn by Bayesian conditioning of the analytical solution on observed daily wind speed and oxygen concentration data obtained from an earlier study during two recovery periods on a eutrophic lake in upper state New York. The model is calibrated using oxygen recovery data for one year and statistical inferences were validated using recovery data for another year. Compared with essentially two-step, regression and optimization approach, the BMCML results are more comprehensive and performed relatively better in predicting the observed temporal dissolved oxygen levels (DO) in the lake. BMCML also produced comparable calibration and validation results with those obtained using popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique (MCMC) and is computationally simpler and easier to implement than the MCMC. Next, using the calibrated model, we derive an optimal relationship between liquid film-transfer coefficient for oxygen and wind speed and associated 95% confidence band, which are shown to be consistent with reported measured values at five different lakes. Finally, we illustrate the robustness of the BMCML to solve risk-based water quality management problems, showing that neglecting cross-correlations between parameters could lead to improper required BOD load reduction to achieve the compliance criteria of 5 mg/L.

In this study multiple approaches including targeted sampling and monitoring of host-specific Bacteroidales markers were used to identify the impact of septic systems on microbial water quality. Twenty four watersheds with septic density ranging from 8 to 373 septic units/km(2) were monitored for water quality under baseflow conditions over a 3-year period. The levels of the human-associated HF183 marker, as well as total and ruminant Bacteroidales, were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Human-associated Bacteroidales yield was significantly higher in high density watersheds compared to low density areas and was negatively correlated (r = -0.64) with the average distance of septic systems to streams in the spring season. The human marker was also positively correlated with the total Bacteroidales marker, suggesting that the human source input was a significant contributor to total fecal pollution in the study area. Multivariable regression analysis indicates that septic systems, along with forest cover, impervious area and specific conductance could explain up to 74% of the variation in human fecal pollution in the spring season. The results suggest septic system impact through contributions to groundwater recharge during baseflow or failing septic system input, especially in areas with >87 septic units/km(2). This study supports the use of microbial source tracking approaches along with traditional fecal indicator bacteria monitoring and land use characterization in a tiered approach to isolate the influence of septic systems on water quality in mixed-use watersheds.

J	Reichwaldt, ES; Ho, WY; Zhou, WX; Ghadouani, A				Reichwaldt, Elke S.; Ho, Wei Y.; Zhou, Wenxu; Ghadouani, Anas			Sterols indicate water quality and wastewater treatment efficiency	WATER RESEARCH												As the world's population continues to grow, water pollution is presenting one of the biggest challenges worldwide. More wastewater is being generated and the demand for clean water is increasing. To ensure the safety and health of humans and the environment, highly efficient wastewater treatment systems, and a reliable assessment of water quality and pollutants are required. The advance of holistic approaches to water quality management and the increasing use of ecological water treatment technologies, such as constructed wetlands and waste stabilisation ponds (WSPs), challenge the appropriateness of commonly used water quality indicators. Instead, additional indicators, which are direct measures of the processes involved in the stabilisation of human waste, have to be established to provide an in-depth understanding of system performance. In this study we identified the sterol composition of wastewater treated in WSPs and assessed the suitability of human sterol levels as a bioindicator of treatment efficiency of wastewater in WSPs. As treatment progressed in WSPs, the relative abundance of human faecal sterols, such as coprostanol, epicoprostanol, 24-ethylcoprostanol, and sitostanol decreased significantly and the sterol composition in wastewater changed significantly. Furthermore, sterol levels were found to be correlated with commonly used wastewater quality indicators, such as BOD, TSS and E. coli. Three of the seven sterol ratios that have previously been used to track sewage pollution in the environment, detected a faecal signal in the effluent of WSPs, however, the others were influenced by high prevalence of sterols originating from algal and fungal activities. This finding poses a concern for environmental assessment studies, because environmental pollution from waste stabilisation ponds can go unnoticed. In conclusion, faecal sterols and their ratios can be used as reliable indicators of treatment efficiency and water quality during wastewater treatment in WSPs. They can complement the use of commonly used indicators of water quality, to provide essential information on the overall performance of ponds and whether a pond is underperforming in terms of stabilising human waste. Such a holistic understanding is essential when the aim is to improve the performance of a treatment plant, build new plants or expand existing infrastructure. Future work should aim at further establishing the use of sterols as reliable water quality indicators on a broader scale across natural and engineered systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Bonhomme, C; Petrucci, G				Bonhomme, Celine; Petrucci, Guido			Should we trust build-up/wash-off water quality models at the scale of urban catchments?	WATER RESEARCH												Models of runoff water quality at the scale of an urban catchment usually rely on build-up/wash-off formulations obtained through small-scale experiments. Often, the physical interpretation of the model parameters, valid at the small-scale, is transposed to large-scale applications. Testing different levels of spatial variability, the, parameter distributions of a water quality model are obtained in this paper through a Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm and analyzed. The simulated variable is the total suspended solid concentration at the outlet of a periurban catchment in the Paris region (2.3 km(2)), for which high-frequency turbidity measurements are available. This application suggests that build-up/wash-off models applied at the catchment-scale do not maintain their physical meaning, but should be considered as "black-box" models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a versatile material to remove the organic pollutants from water. However, such materials capable of both efficiently separating insoluble oil and organic solvent from water and photodegrading soluble organic pollutions are rare on the market. Here, we report a facile method to fabricate a dual-layer copper mesh (DCM) by overlaying a graphene oxide (GO)/AgBr-coated mesh onto an Ag-coated mesh. The key point in this study is to integrate the superhydrophobic Agcoated mesh and photocatalytic GO/AgBr-coated mesh, resulting in the bifunctional DCM with both excellent oil/water separation performance and efficient photodegradation of soluble organic pollutants under visible light illumination. Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the fabrication process is simple and cost-effective without using any sophisticated equipment, which permits a scale-up of DCM for water purification. Hence, the bifunctional and easily prepared properties make it an ideal candidate for encouraging application in oil/water separation and water pollutants photodegradation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
